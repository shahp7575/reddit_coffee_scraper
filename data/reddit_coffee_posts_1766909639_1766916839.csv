I moved down here from Scotland a couple of years ago and am keen to make some friends. My interests are mainly connected with keeping fit: boxing training, lifting weights, walking and jogging. I have a close circle of friends in Scotland but so far down here I mainly have acquaintances. It would be good to have people to meet up with for a coffee or a chat etc. I recently gave up alcohol so it can be tricky as a lot of socialising revolves around that but I'm comfortable spending time in pubs just having a zero percent.

Kieran doesn’t discriminate when it comes to the things he people, small talk, kombucha—he despises them all equally.  
  
And then there is Ash freaking Cleaver. Cocky, shameless, and on a mission to get under Kieran’s skin—and into his pants. The fact that Kieran doesn’t bat for his team doesn’t seem to bother him. Nothing seems to bother him, including Kieran’s unconcealed hatred for the guy. Actually, Kieran swears the pervert *enjoys* the open displays of hostility.  
  
Yeah, he definitely hates Ash the most.  
  
So when Kieran wakes up two years in the future—next to the very man he despises, in the bed they share, in the life they’ve apparently built together—no one can blame him if he loses it a little (a lot).  
  
Trapped in a timeline he doesn’t understand, with the man he can’t stand, Kieran desperately searches for a way out.  
  
And he better find it quick.  
  
Because the more time he spends with this version of Ash, the one who kisses his forehead and knows how he takes his coffee, the one who makes him feel safe even in the middle of a storm, the harder it is to pretend he still hates him. Even harder to admit that, maybe, he never really did.

She of course disagreed and said there was too much space being taken up by things like the rice cooker or Vitamix. I said the place they were at, under some other cabinets to the right of the sink, wasn't used for cooking/food prep and was effectively storage already. 

We compromised and reorganized another cabinet to make space for a few things so some are put away.

# FAQ

### Why are all these little things different from Trench Crusade

Because of the terms of their license agreement, baby! You can't make and distribute stuff unofficially on your own with the Trench Crusade name attached.

### Yeah but why are some of the mechanics a little bit different it's throwing me off

Guess you better read the whole rules then!

### Did you really make this in three days what the hell is wrong with you don't you have a job

Yes, I don't know, and I'm on vacation, respectively!

### Why would anyone not take Devotion to Each Other it increases your entire health pool by like 50% and meanwhile devotion to God gives you like +1D to hit scary monsters and resist an effect once a chapter maybe it's totally unbalanced

Sure is!

### Why can't Knights become STRONG and take HEAVY weapons like greatswords like the class fantasy suggests, seems like a huge oversight

Looks like you forgot to check the generic traits available to all players!

### Don't I recognise this campaign

Yep, the sample adventure is adapted from a homebrew Trench Crusade campaign I wrote earlier this year, though it's much simplified and streamlined! I also need to go back and update that campaign to fit the full release rules, so the TTRPG version here is the closest you get!

### I don't understand how the structure of the campaign is supposed to work

1. Scenario 1
2. Roll for camp/random encounter. If you roll a 6, or after 3 camps/random encounters, move on to Scenario 2
3. Repeat

### What happens if someone dies do you create a new character from 1st level or do you create a new character the same level as everyone else or are you like completely eliminated from the game

Up to you! Well not that last one obviously. I'd lean towards being nice rather than being mean as a general guideline. I'll probably have a few variant rules for how to handle character death eventually.

### How did you playtest this

Little models on my coffee table, little boxes as terrain

### How did you get it to look like the Trench Crusade documents

I downloaded a template someone made on this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrenchCrusade/comments/1pjzbbo/homebrew_template_in_the_style_of_the_10_rules/

### This is so cool please marry me

1) Hand grinders are good but a good electric grinder like ode gen 2 or timemore 078 are just better and more forgiving.

  
2) Filter paper matters more then ever making cafec t90 filters best value for money but hario meteor are king of flavour if looking for best experience but are way to expensive.

  
3) Having multiple drippers is ok because sometimes a certain dripper just doesn't fit your taste.

  
4) Make your own recipe and just experiment as most recipes online are made with different water recipes , grinders, beans etc.... and they do have a large impact on the final cup.

  
5) Most local water is bad so get good bottled water like spa or volvic. If you really wanna go next lvl make your own water with minerals as the difference is night and day.

  
6) Buy good beans. This one as tricky as a lot of roasters are selling mediocre coffee for expensive prices. Once you find a good roaster like still coffee roaster and dak you can safely order and don't waste your money.

  
7) Blind shaking and slow feeding makes your coffee better and everyone should do this.

  
8) Don't buy geisha just because someone says it. Your flavour is different. Most cheaper geisha's are not good. Their better types of beans for way lower prices.



9) Taking a pour over class to get better is a good way to start if you know nothing but on youtube their masterclasses for free for example Lance henderick. If you have a one on one class with a experienced ""barista"" without breaking the bank then i would suggest this but mostly its really expensive.

  
10) Practice practice practice day in and day out. You gonna make bad cups but thats ok. You learn more from a bad cup then from a good cup. ",2,1766916500.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Do any of you have decent childed friends?

I mean people who can initiate and hold conversations according to social standards or even based on common ground and interest in each other, like friends do?

Who don't talk down to you or bring topics back to their kids?

Maybe even mentioning the children only shortly when asked how everyone is and only elaborating when asked about the kids specifically?


If so, why is that? what's your culture, where are you in the world, what are your friendships like? how come your friends are capable of normal socializing while it seems to get lost/discarded by others?




Personally, I seem to have kinda gotten a jackpot of cfdom by having supportive parents and family members and decent parent friends. None of my friendships ever took a nosedive because of kids. Of course, friends with young kids are busier than before, so meeting up happens less and changes for a few years. But they all actively reach out, invite, initiate or simply hit us up to see if we're free for a coffee or a walk or so.
Basically, they still like the activities and people in their lives they had before the kids. Of course, some of that changes too, not everything stays the same. That being said though, both the ones who are not happy as parents and those who are, always try to make any meet ups as pleasant as possible for the people invited/the friends/the group who comes together for a purpose etc.


It's not paradise, it doesn't change that I don't like kids except from afar and if they're being cute and relaxed. But it's very valuable still. I think it might come down to a culture which is not child friendly or centered at all. I also wander if it might be because in my subset if culture questions about w having kids or hogging conversation with personal topics is frowned upon? Like, if the topic is gardening it usually goes one of two ways: someone can relate and you might talk about gardening or nobody can relate and then it's just a short update on what you're up to and that's cool too and then you move on to whatever. If you mention kids, only parents or other people with kids actively in their lives can relate, but even then each parents' kids are very personal and nobody can relate to them specifically so why would *they* be a topic? Nobody does that, it's rude.

    I just received my De’Longhi Eletta Explore and I'm having a problem with my coffee. With my Orubia Novissima, in Espresso mode, intensity 5, medium quantity, the coffee flows very quickly: only 9-12 seconds for 33 ml, whereas the ideal time should be 25-30 seconds.
    
    The result: bitter coffee, weak or almost non-existent crema, and a flow rate that's too fast despite the grind setting being 3/10 (quite fine). I've already rinsed the machine several times, checked the bean hopper and the internal circuitry, but the problem persists.
    
    For comparison, a test in Coffee mode (Lungo, intensity 4, medium quantity) produced a consistent flow rate of 52 seconds, which seems normal.
    
    The problem therefore seems specific to espresso, and I'd like to know if it can be resolved by adjusting the settings or if it's a hardware defect requiring repair. Has anyone else encountered this problem with this machine or have any tips for getting a decent espresso with this coffee?

1pxnnqz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxnnqz,"Kala Jadu in a Bottle? | PDM Layton Exclusif: The Dark, Beast Mode King.","If the original Layton is the Chocolate Boy of the fragrance world, Layton Exclusif is the Alpha Older Brother who has seen things. 🚬 It takes that famous DNA and wraps it in a layer of mystery and darkness that is honestly addictive.

The Scent Journey: A Three Act Play

This isn't a linear scent, it evolves beautifully on the skin:

\* The Opening (Fresh & Woody): It starts with a sharp burst of Bergamot and Almond. It feels like walking into a high end boutique in a cold, luxury mall fresh, crisp, and expensive.

\* The Mid (Oudy & Earthy): As the citrus fades, the Guaiac Wood and Laotian Oud start creeping in. The  playful vibe vanishes. The woodiness is  dank in the best way possible, think of a mahogany library or a heritage luxury hotel.

\* The Dry Down (Sweet Dark Vanilla): This is the soul of the fragrance. The Vanilla emerges, but it’s not a cupcake scent. It’s a dark, smoky vanilla with Oud and Coffee lingering in the background. It stays masculine and royal until the very end.

Performance: Is it really Beast Mode?

In our Indian climate, performance is everything, and this doesn't disappoint.

\* Longevity: On skin, it’s an easy 10-12 hour performer. On clothes? You’ll still smell it on your blazer even after it comes back from the dry cleaners.

\* Projection: It creates a massive scent bubble for the first 3-4 hours. You don't need to over-spray; 3-4 sprays are more than enough to let everyone know the Boss has entered the room.

Seasons & Occasions: The Desi Context

\* Seasons: This is a Winter/Autumn powerhouse. It shines in the North Indian chill or the ""mild winters"" of the South.

\* The Summer Hack: Can you wear this in 40°C? Strictly NO for outdoors. However, if you are living the AC to AC life (office -> car -> indoor event), you can pull it off. Just go light on the trigger (2 sprays max) and keep it for night-time events.

\* Occasions: This is your Shaadi Season King. It’s perfect for Receptions, Walimas, or high stakes Date Nights where you want to leave an unforgettable impression.

The Verdict: Who is this for?

This is for the man who is tired of freshie blue scents and wants to stand out in a crowd of Dior Sauvage and Aventusclones. It smells like Old Money mixed with the Bad Boy energy.

Layton (OG) vs. Exclusif: The Quick Rundown

\* Vibe: OG is  Sweet Apple Pie | Exclusif is Dark Forest & Oud.

\* Complexity: OG is a 7/10 | Exclusif is a solid 10/10

\* Beast Status: OG is Strong | Exclusif is Legendary

Final Word: If you want to smell like Royal Darkness, go for it. But bhai, don't blind buy this. Get a 5ml decant or a sample first because that civet/oud note can be tricky for some noses!

after watching the fnaf 2 movie last night me and my brother were talking about how interesting fnaf 4 would be if it were adapted into a movie, and i decided that for fun i'd make a movie script. this is unfinished so far but i want to post it to get some feedback on what y'all think and if there's some changes i should make so far. i have never written a movie script before in my life, so the format will probably be wrong (and dialogue may be dry) but i tried my best. please give me any constructive criticism and tips you may have!!

Some notes:

i refer to the crying child as Evan in this because that's just the name i prefer for him. The FNAF bullies and Mrs. Emily's names were also just made up.

I also went with the theory that Michael was the one we play as in the game, mainly because i thought i'd be interesting narratively.

This is only 5 short scenes from it, and if i decide to fully complete it i do have an idea for a full movie script. The scenes are short and to the point for now.

I didn't give Mrs. Afton a name, mainly because there is no reason to yet, but she might get one later on. If y'all have any good names for her i'd love to hear them.

This is set in a different timeline that the FNAF movies, mainly because this is a more canon adhering script, though it is still a bit different.

  
Just to be clear i am NOT saying the fnaf movies are bad or that i can do it better, this was entirely just for fun and is a passion project. (though if scott wants to reach out...? just kidding ofc)",1,1766914865.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

For the machine, I decided to go for a flair 58 plus 2 because I knew that I was going to want to pull light roast espresso and I wanted the control that lever machines offer to do that task well. I also don’t really need a steam wand as I don’t really like hot milk drinks. 

Its near lack of regular maintenance, repairability, and light weight were also deciding factors in my decision. Getting the flair also allowed me to free up money in my allotted budget to spend on a grinder.

For the grinder, I was initially planning on getting a P64 but the P80 dropped a month before I was planning to buy the P64. 

I’m so far really pleased with the P80. It makes great espresso with a good balance of sweetness, acidity, clarity and body. I don’t really have anything negative to say about the grinder other than the unit, in auto-mode, will occasionally (two or three times so far in one month of ownership with \~100 cups) not do the high rpm purge at the end. 

Apart from that, it works flawlessly. 

Anyways, I hope this post will be helpful for people designing a setup with a similar philosophy/price point.

When Susan was hired we could already see through a few lies, she said she was fully bar and coffee trained but has turned out to refuse to do coffees and when a check came through for a gin she had to ask which kind, which sounds normal when training or your new but if you have worked in a bar you would know which kind. 

Now as much as that annoys me I don’t mind helping her and training her that’s not my problem, but she does keep on trying to change the way we do things ( and we do them very well for a little pub in the middle of nowhere ) and make them her way… I’ll try to train her and tell her how to do something if I see her struggling or correct her as is my job to do so if I see her doing anything wrong and she just shrugs me off and continues making our lives a little bit more miserable.

Oh she also stood and bit and perched a kiss on my arm as I was pouring 2 pints as the same time and as I was walking around to speak to someone who was signing out she slapped my bum.

I am a man.  A good man. If given the chance I would never let you down.  I have some faults that I have owned and am not ashamed of.

    My last relationship was well over five years ago.  It ended with me leaving after failing miserably at helping her realize her lifelong dream.. I just wasn't prepared properly for the tasks asked of me.. we began way too late in life and after all our careful planning.  It just failed because we had underestimated the difficulty level of it and we ended up losing everything in the attempt up to and including our lives.. mine in particular.. it was to be an off grid farm built in the wilderness.  We arrived too underfunded to do it properly and were unprepared for the harsh reality of it. Until things began to happen I could not control.  While attempting to build our dream house on top of a mountain in Oklahoma.  It was back breaking labor and required knowledge that I just didn't have to complete.  But powered through regardless of the difficulty level.  Improvising and devising learning as I went..we BEgan construction on our home.. at first it went well then one day our power source exploded and left all the power tools I had been using worthless.. so I changed to ancient methods of building using hand tools.  Cutting and shaping logs to drag to the home site and shaped them by hand and muscleing them into place using pure determination and desire to survive as my motivator.. when it became apparent that I had to abandon the entire house and concentrate instead on the coming winter. I built one room in the middle of the home site and had just completed it when the first snow fell.  Covering everything in a blanket of deep snow.. we moved into it and stored all the important things inside. But we were safe and dry.  Warm enough and had plenty of food stored for us to wait out the long cold winter.. our livestock began to disappear killed by local predators. I fought them to salvage what could be saved. And smoked the meat and stored it.  A vast amount of foodstuffs and firewood to last thru to spring. Killing local game And smoking that meat too .  We stayed inside during the worst of the storms.. huddled together amidst our stuff and listened to the wind howl outside.. it was a bad winter.. ice storms followed by flash floods ruined a lot of our stuff at one time or another.. it was at this time in the wilderness my life partner had had all the bad luck she could stand and returned to California.  To return in the spring and begin anew on the home.. leaving me in the woods.  During her absences things took another turn for the worse and she was forced to stop sending me money to survive on. Gas got scarce. Food followed. Then water stores were exhausted.  I began running trap lines and hunting for game far and wide.  To just kill enough to survive.. often to no avail.. at one point I began to starve on the mountain despite my efforts to survive to spring and her return.  I lost all the weight I had gained almost starving to death several times.  But made it through. Somehow.  At one point I became ill and was transported to the hospital fourty miles away with double pneumonia and exposure. Frost bite on several of my toes. As my boots were not designed to keep me warm enough.  I could feel the strength draining from my body.. I called for help and was put into the hospital for nine days.  During that time we were robbed by locals and what they did not steal from us was burned to the ground.. I returned to find a burned out shell of our cabin and all our belongings missing. It was. A devastating blow.  I went to our closest neighbor's house and found them sorting through some of my stuff. Tools and utensils spread all over the ground on one of my tarps.  They had been the closest things I had there to actual friends but here they were with large quantities of our belongings. There was much more taken than that.. by other hillbillies In The area. I just downed my head and drove back to my land and cried for a few hours..by that time my body had wasted to the smallest I had ever been .  I had dropped from two sixty two pounds to just about 165 pounds.  True starvation can do that to you very quickly.I had waited too long to seek help and was not only sick with pneumonia but with classic malnutrition and starvation. All the muscle I had gained from all the hard work was all but gone.. I knew I was going to die up there . I asked for help and one of my friends wrote me and said. He'd be there in the morning to get me out of there.. and true to his word he showed up.. I loaded my pickup onto his trailer and he took me to his house which was just over a hundred miles away.. where he took me back to the doctor and nursed me back to health.  Thank the Lord for this old friend seeing my post and allowing me to recuperate at his place. He saved my life and I knew it.  I returned to the mountain one more time and to my astonishment my partner drove in with her new car and it was there that she said she was going to stay and try again. And that since I had allowed such a dismal failure to happen she was finished with me and wanted to separate.. for good.. I signed the property over to her.  Gave her the remaInder of my tools and money to help her get started by herself to rebuild if she could.. And left that place for good.  I haven't heard one word from her in years.. I have no idea if she is still there or has given up.. I have no way of finding out.  At this point what is the point of ever trying again to inquire.  Her family here will not take my calls nor will she.  I can only wish her the best.. I am sorry it failed so miserably and perhaps it would not had things been different.  We were dismally unprepared for the harsh reality of life in such a place..But I know that I tried with all I had.  And was unable to complete the thing as I had wanted.. almost gave my life to make her dream come to fruition.. I failed.  That is the story of that chapter.  
   I determined to return to California and start again here but my phone rang and my daughter asked if I could come help her for awhile out in Ohio.  So I made a u turn and headed back east..to find her very ill. I stayed and helped her through recovery from gastric bypass surgery And the healing process after such an invasive surgery was astonishingly hard..she had just been divorced and was living alone in big beautiful home in Ohio I moved into the mother-in-law suite inside her garage.  Separate room and facilities separate from her home.  It was my first time spending a great deal of time with her. She having been raised by her mother and I had her every other weekend until I took a long haul trucker job.  So I wasnt around a lot. When she was younger.  I relished the idea of helping her and getting to really know her well.  It was a great time in my life. I was so proud of her I spent those next few years with my chest stuck out in pure pride at the beautiful soul she had grown to be.  She had been a marine corps logistics officer in the military and was deployed to Iraq where she had been shot down and had barely survived..she was on 100% service connected disability. Combined with ssid and other benefits she was very well off..and had purchased this beautiful home after her divorce...every since her Iraq war she suffered from mental illness aS well as physical limitations.    Bouhhts of deep depression and manic spells were commonplace.  I watched as her doctors tried medication after medication to control her mental issues. Wounded warriors helped some.  But it was very hard.  After almost two years of steady improvement she suddenly and without warning committed suicide.  Which destroyed me for a great deal of time. Afterwards..  I stayed at her big home for another year alone surrounded by her belongings and seeing her hand in every decoration of the place..alone and very depressed myself...seeing a doctor for it who prescribed powerful drugs to help me cope with the loss of my little girl..I wAs trapped there with no where to go . I fell into a stupor that lasted over a year.  The powerful medications keeping me in a state of dreamlike existence unable and or unwilling to do much.ekse but sit and watch hours upon hours of mindless television. Eat sleep repeat until a very long time had passed without having really given it much thought.  I escaped from the place after long deliberation and planning I just packed my things and left again headed for California.  Where I arrived at a true friend's house and he had an extra bedroom I rent from him and live a quiet contemplative existence.  Amidst his home.. unfortunately my friend is a hoarder and has stuff all over the yard and house .every horizontal surface is covered in stuff .  I could never bring a date here to this place And not have her take one look at this place and run screaming for the hills.  
    But again I am lonely and miss having someone to share life with.  It is time to seriously begin looking for a life partner or a mate.. wife or a long term girlfriend.  I have never in my life spent this much time alone.. without having a woman in my life.. someone to share this life with would be great . But never having been in the dating aren before.  I have very little idea where to even begin.. I need help to find someone.  I would appreciate any input as to what my next move should be to achieve this goal.. I have returned to Bakersfield to find most of my friends have either moved away or died while I was gone.  I know few people here.  All the old places I used to go to meet eligible women are closed down. Chrystal Palace is closed. Trouts in oil sale is gone. Vinny's bar in South union is gone.  I have no clue where to go to even meet nice ladies. In this town and as I said before the dating sites I've tried have little to offer except an endless supply of fake profiles and a. I. Driven profiles. Costing hundreds of dollars to keep coins filled up enough to try and hold a conversation with a lady.. or in many cases a computer saying all the right things. Until it becomes apparent that I'm chatting with a computer designed for the purpose.. 
   Help me y'all what does a man of my age group do to find the right type of women in this town?  Im uninterested in one night stands and bar hookups.  There are few women at those places and frankly don't fit any of my criteria.  The chances now days of finding a nice lady at my age or a tad younger is finite.  I just honestly have no idea what or where to go.. church socials and such used to be a good source but I have found none. No announcements if singles mixers or even old standby places like bookstores and coffee shops haven't produced many opportunities..  clueless in Bakersfield.. ",1,1766914001.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

As global inflation keeps restaurant tabs high, a new generation of travelers is using a digital ""cheat code"" to feast for pennies: Too Good To Go.By 2026, this surplus food app has expanded into nearly every major city across 20 countries, from the US and Canada to most of Europe and Australia. For the price of a coffee—usually between $4 and $6—you can snag a ""Surprise Bag"" worth three times that amount. Here is how to turn food waste into your travel budget's best friend.1. The ""Hotel Buffet"" JackpotThe ultimate 2026 travel hack isn't found in a cafe; it’s in the lobby of major hotel chains like Hilton, Accor, and Ibis.The Strategy: High-end hotels are required by safety standards to clear their breakfast buffets at a strict time (usually 10:30 AM). In 2026, over 100 Hilton properties alone in Europe now list their surplus as ""Surprise Bags.""The Reward: For about $6, travelers often receive a massive haul of premium pastries, fresh fruit, high-quality cold cuts, and artisan cheeses.The Pro Move: Use these breakfast bags to ""build your own lunch."" One hotel bag can easily provide enough bread, meat, and fruit for two people to have a gourmet picnic later in the afternoon.2. High-End Bakeries: The ""Evening Carb"" RitualBy 2026, artisan bakeries—from Eataly in the US to independent boulangeries in Paris—have automated their surplus listings.The Window: Most bakery pickups happen in the final 30 minutes before closing.The Arbitrage: A $35 bag of sourdough loaves, almond croissants, and savory focaccia can be yours for $5.Travel Tip: Since bakery goods keep well, this is the perfect way to stock up on snacks for a long train ride or a ""Gateway Hop"" flight the next day.3. The 2026 Traveler’s ""Surprise Bag"" StrategyStepActionWhy it works in 20261. Set Your PinMove your app location to your destination 24 hours before you arrive.You can see which local spots ""sell out"" instantly and plan your route.2. Target the 4.5+Only book bags with a rating of 4.5 stars or higher.2026 users are vocal; low ratings usually mean the ""value"" isn't actually 3x.3. Pack a ContainerBring a lightweight, collapsible silicone bowl in your ""Personal Item.""Many 2026 vendors prefer you use your own container to maximize the ""Zero Waste"" mission.4. Time the DropCheck the app at 15 minutes past the hour.This is often when the AI ""releases"" new inventory for the following day.4. Top 2026 ""Value Cities"" for TGTGWhile the app is everywhere, these cities have the most aggressive partner networks in 2026:London & Paris: The birthplace of the movement; you can find a bag on almost every block.New York City: Every city with over one million residents in the US is now active, but NYC’s high-end grocery partners (like Whole Foods) offer the best ""Grocery Bags"" for Airbnb stays.1Lisbon: As a major ""Glowmad"" hub, Lisbon has some of the highest densities of healthy, plant-based surplus bags.5. The ""Anti-Soggy"" RuleA common 2026 traveler complaint is receiving ""mushy"" pre-made meals. To avoid this, focus on categories rather than specific restaurants:Focus on: Bakeries, Grocery Stores, and Hotel Buffets (ingredients are usually separate).Avoid: Pizza shops or ""hot food"" containers unless you have a way to reheat them in your accommodation.The 2026 Mindset: Using Too Good To Go isn't just about being ""broke""; it’s about environmental arbitrage. You are paying the planet back by ensuring premium food doesn't hit a landfill, and the $40 you save on dinner is $40 you can spend on a museum entrance or a local experience.",0,1766913873.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,0.5,False

In a world of ""one-tap"" apple-pay and $18 craft cocktails, the ""No-Spend Weekend"" has become more than a frugal hack—it’s a social movement. By 2026, the Financial Fast has gone mainstream, with thousands of people using the 48 hours between Friday night and Monday morning to reset their dopamine levels, reconnect with their communities, and keep an average of $200–$400 in their pockets.

Why the ""Financial Fast"" Works

Research in 2026 shows that constant spending creates a ""shopping high"" followed by a crash. By removing the option to buy, you force your brain to find dopamine in connection, creativity, and nature. > Pro-Tip: Start your No-Spend Weekend by ""hiding"" your credit cards on Friday night.

1pxn4oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiddenTrueCrimeChat/comments/1pxn4oy/follow_the_npi/,Follow the NPI ....,"# What is an NPI?

An NPI is a unique 10-digit identification number used in standard health care transactions. Every healthcare provider or organization is required to register with the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; this includes health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who transmit any health information in electronic form. (All providers basically.)

March 2007 - July 2007  
Dr. John Matthias applied for an NPI code, 1366560633, March 2007. He last updated his record in July 2007. John used a taxonomy code of 103T00000X, Psychologist (General). He did NOT use the taxonomy code 103TC0700X for Clinical Psychologist or 103TF0200X for Forensic Psychologist.  This means he has never registered with the federal government as a Clinical or Forensic provider. 

January 2007-August 2020 Using the same address as the practice of Dr. John Matthias, I found the NPI code, 1245384908, under the name FAMILY AND CHILD TREATMENT OF SOUTHERN NEVADA (**FACT).** Taxonomy code of 251S00000X - Community/Behavioral Health. They applied in Jan 2007 and updated in August 2020.  They will need to update again if they have a change in directors, address, etc.

SO Dr John's NPI code was registered when he was licensed in Nevada for general psychologist, was not updated when he was licensed in Utah, and has not been transferred to any other practice since he was working for FACT in July 2007.  So for 18 years, his NPI has not been updated.  Which means, no billing insurance from any practice since he was employed at FACT. No charting. No signing med records. EVERY ELECTRONIC REPORT needs an NPI number for the provider. 

IF HE HAD DONE ANY WORK at a state mental facility, that facility would have needed his NPI to bill any sort of Medicare, Medicaid, or state health plan. The facility would have required his NPI as part of the hiring process called ""credentialing."" You cannot work at a facility without an NPI.



Just for shits and giggles, I pulled another NPI code. Starting on the date of original  licensing, it has every practice, every state and every taxonomy ever covered. MULTIPLES. These are all managed in-house by credentialing. IN THE REAL WORLD,  employers keep up with the NPI shit because that is how they bill insurance. So when you go to the hospital and see DR STATEMENT on the bill, DR STATEMENT put in the orders and has NO CLUE how to bill anything. The magical chipmunks pull the charts and bill insurance using the DR's NPI number. Then the clinical group meets once a month and says oh look, DR STATEMENT makes x dollars and DR COFFEE POT makes x dollars FOR THE HOSPITAL. Have a donut.



TLDR: You haven't updated your NPI since 2007, so there is a very good chance that you (DR BABE) haven't billed any insurance, signed any clinical records or PRACTICED IN A MEDICAL OFFICE since you left the job where you were working in 2007. NOT EVEN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. You also don't have your UTAH license on your NPI. And you have never listed Forensic OR Clinical taxonomies on your NPI ... so you have NEVER billed insurance as a Forensic or Clinical Psychologist??



Hmmpf. You are a volunteer psych??? How does that work??? You cannot even sign a CHART without an NPI.  How do you use med records without a provider number???? How are you HIPAA COMPLIANT without an NPI?

But the plain manila envelope squared dead center on Detective Voss's desk did not belong. No name. No postmark.

She slid into her chair, glanced around. No one watching. She opened it.

A small, unmarked USB drive dropped into her palm. She plugged the drive into her laptop.

One file. Timestamp: one year prior.

The video opened on a windshield view: wet blacktop, headlights cutting through dark, wipers thumping a steady rhythm. Speed readout in the corner: forty. Climbing.

Two men in an SUV. Their voices cutting through the dim interior.

“Man, this weather sucks,” the passenger said. “You sure you're good to drive?”

The driver didn’t answer right away.

“I'm good,” he said finally. Flat, calm. “We’re almost there.”

“Yeah, yeah.” Fabric rustled; something clinked in a cup holder. “You’re awfully chipper for a graveyard run.”

“Just focused.”

The speed crept up. Forty. Forty-five.

A minute of windshield and rain. No music. No other cars.

“Are you sure you're good? You’ve been a little weird since we left,” the passenger tried again.

“We have something to do,” the driver said. “Then it’s over.”

The road dipped, then rose.

Emma appeared dead center in the lane, soaked through, one arm lifted like she was trying to wave them down. Her face flashed white in the headlights—eyes wide, mouth open.

“Whoa—whoa, whoa,” the passenger said, sitting up fast. “Kid! There’s a kid! Hey, you see her?”

“I see her,” the driver said.

The speed ticked up. Fifty. Fifty-five.

“Dude, slow down!” Panic cracked the passenger’s voice. “Hit the brakes!”

The dashcam jolted hard; the girl blurred under the hood and vanished.

For a few seconds, only engine howl and wipers.

“What did you do,” the passenger choked out. “Oh, God—what did you do? We hit her. We hit her. We hit a kid—”

“Stay calm,” the driver said. His voice hadn’t changed. “It’s done.”

“Done?” The passenger almost laughed, high and shaky. “We just killed a little girl! We have to stop, we have to go back, call someone—”

“We keep going,” the driver said. “We finish the drive.”

“No. No, fuck that. Pull over. I’m calling it in.”

The SUV lurched.

The dashcam swung wildly as the vehicle jerked off-line, tires hissing on wet shoulder. Violent jolt, then smashed light and black as the front end plowed into something solid.

Metal screamed. Glass exploded. The picture spun and settled crooked.

Shattered light pole leaned into frame. Rain streaked the lens. Off-screen, wet rasping—someone trying to breathe through broken ribs.

The driver moved through the edge of the shot, leaning over the console. Boots hit pavement. He stepped around the front of the SUV.

Cracked windshield caught his reflection: early forties, close-cropped hair, hard features. One side swelling from impact.

He walked out of frame toward the ditch. Rasping cut off with a sick crunch.

Voss's throat tightened.

Driver came back into view, head turning, checking the scene. Gaze shifted up, found the dashcam.

He stepped closer until his face filled the frame. Expression almost blank.

Hand reached up. Picture jolted as he ripped the mount.

Feed went black.

Voss sat back, heart hammering, the man's face burned into her mind. She printed the best still—distorted but unmistakable—grabbed the USB, and headed for Dumolt's desk.

“Got a minute?”

He took one look at her and hung up mid-sentence. “Conference room. Now.”

They locked the door. Voss slotted the USB into the room terminal, ran the clip.

Dumolt watched stone-faced until the impact. Then:

“Jesus Christ.”

He was silent for a moment after the clip ended, then his eyes tracked to the printout beside Voss on the table. “You recognize him?”

“No. But I want to show the Harts. See if they do.”

Dumolt set the remote down carefully. “Unfortunately the husband's not gonna recognize anybody. Put a gun in his mouth a few weeks ago.”

Voss blinked. “Nobody told me.”

“I got told in passing—think you were at that thing with the chief. Wife found him after a couple days of not responding to her calls. Apparently he packed himself up on his little girl's birthday.”

“Then we go to the wife,” Voss said.

Maggie Hart's apartment smelled of cigarettes and unwashed dishes. One bedroom, boxes half-unpacked in the hall, a single stuffed bear on a shelf too high for a child. Maggie looked smaller than Voss remembered—hollow cheeks, sunken eyes that didn't quite focus.

They sat at a folding table. Voss and Dumolt expressed condolences first: the year she'd had, Ben's loss, their gratitude for her time.

“Maggie, I'm going to get right to the point,” Voss said finally. “There's been a development in Emma's case.”

Maggie frowned, setting her coffee mug down with a soft clink. “What do you mean development? The man who hit her died. What new development could there possibly be?”

Voss slid the print across the table. “This came to my desk today. Dashcam footage from that SUV. We thought it was corrupted, but it's not. Shows the driver. Not the man we ID'd in the ditch a year ago.”

Maggie took the photo with steady hands. Brought it to the light over the sink.

Her chest sank.

“Do you know him?” Voss asked.

Maggie's jaw clenched. She swallowed, eyes flicking from the distorted face to Voss, then back. “That's... no. It can't be. That's Richard Korrigan. We've worked together on occasion but he was transferred... Oh my god, about a year ago.”

She trailed off, staring at the photo like it might change if she looked away. “Why now? After a year? If Korrigan was driving, where's he been? And who sent you this?”

“We don't know,” Dumolt said quietly.

Maggie shook her head, a sharp, disbelieving jerk. “This doesn't make sense.” She pressed a hand to her mouth, eyes still locked on Korrigan's swollen face in the grainy still.

Voss and Dumolt rode back to the precinct in heavy silence. When they pushed through the bullpen doors, the air felt thicker—patrol officers glancing their way, whispers cutting off. Two men in dark suits waited by Voss's desk: late thirties, clean-shaven, high-and-tight haircuts that screamed federal.

“Detective Voss? Dumolt?” The taller one stepped forward, badge flipped open too fast to read. “Special Agent Harlan Reed, FBI Joint Task Force. We need to talk.”

Dumolt bristled. “About what?”

“The Hart file,” Reed's partner—a shorter guy—replied. “In private.”

They followed the agents into the conference room. Door shut. Reed laid a folder on the table, gold eagle stamped across it.

“Case is federal jurisdiction as of 0900,” Reed said flatly. “Hart incident ties to a classified transport op. We need your digital prints, laptop—complete evidence transfer.”

Voss's pulse spiked. “You were waiting for us.”

Reed met her eyes, almost sympathetic. “We move fast on these. OpSec is extremely important to national security. I'm sure you can understand that. We appreciate your work on the case thus far.”

Dumolt slammed a hand on the table. “Bullshit. We just got a break—a mother ID'd the driver who killed her kid. You don't think that's odd that you guys are just now taking an interest?”

“Your chief's been briefed,” Reed's partner said. “Any grievances will need to be formally written and passed up the chain of command. We pulled you in here as a courtesy. We don't owe you any more explanation.”

The shorter agent walked over to the door and opened it, gesturing for the detectives to leave.

They left without another word, suits already boxing Voss's desk.

Voss and Dumolt stormed straight to the chief's office. He looked up from his phone, face sunken, already knowing.

“Don't even start,” he said, waving them in. “I called their field office. Tried pulling strings. Nothing. My connections wouldn't budge on this one.”

Dumolt exploded. “Chief, they just yanked everything! We sat with Maggie Hart twenty minutes ago—watched her crumble naming that bastard.”

The chief rubbed his temples, voice cracking with genuine regret. “Not that I need to tell you this but your guy is probably connected up top. They say if we push, it's felony charges for all of us. Life sentences. My hands are tied.”

Voss gripped the doorframe. “A little girl was killed, Chief.”

“I know.” He met her eyes, pained. “I've got daughters too, and I don't want them growing up without their dad. Go home, detectives.”

Dumolt swore, kicking the wall on the way out. “Fucking spooks.""

They made their way down the hall a ways 

""What now?” Dumolt asked.

Voss palmed the USB still in her jacket pocket. She'd 'forgotten' it was there. She looked around to make sure they weren't in earshot of anyone. “Now we find Korrigan.”",1,1766913123.0,shortstory,0,0.99,False

Here's my review:

First the good - the staff were great.  The public spaces were clean and well maintained.  The room was clean and main bed was comfortable.  Our 7yo daughter loved the kids program, and the staff there were very good.

The rest was, well; enough that I would be hard pressed to try any other NCL offerings.

First off, we did a balcony room with the beverage package, wifi, and 3 specialty dinners.  The room was smaller than Princess balcony rooms; but the real issue was the fold out couch-bed was so hard even my 7yo couldn't sleep on it comfortably!

The whole perception once you get on board is a nickel & dime approach to everything.  We had the beverage package; but the only coffee option readily available was Starbucks and NOT INCLUDED!  That's another upcharge per person per day.

The base wifi is MEASURED IN MINUTES???  WTF is it 1998?  Upgrading to ""the fastest internet at sea"" or the streaming video package was a joke.  I've been on a larger, fuller Princess ship and streamed shows to my devices without issue.  Their internet (also provided by Starlink) struggled the entire time.  Hard to watch anything, hard to get things to download to watch later.

Water - access to water bottle filling stations COST EXTRA.  It was included in our beverage plan, but it's an upcharge if you didn't get the plan.  Especially notable to me was the fitness room had a single water fountain with placards not to fill water bottles.

Food - the food was TERRIBLE.  I was missing my Crown Grill steaks!  Our first specialty dinner was Brazilian style churrassco.  The beef was grey and ""sludgy"" and terribly seasoned.  It was served either under or over cooked - but regardless of cooking temp it was disgusting.  We did a Teppenyaki (Hibachi style) Japanese dinner - I watched them bring out the beef that looked the same and ordered seafood instead.  I eat Hibachi style at home in the South USA on a regular basis.  I've never had fresh cooked fried rice that was inedible.  I was picking around my plate to find something to eat.  Our last specialty meal was ""East meets west"" - Asian fusion.  The appetizers were actually decent, but the main courses again were terrible.  On Princess ships we usually enjoy the buffet at breakfast and lunch.  The buffet here was firstly off tiny for the number of passengers on board; but more importantly the food quality was just terrible.  Breakfast had good bacon and the omelette stations were nice, but a lot of the other food was low grade cafeteria food.  Same for the other meals.  Proteins were consistently disgusting.  They might have one station with a fresh pig/turkey/lamb etc that was decent but then most of the other food was terrible.  I'm also used to Princess having a really nice selection of desserts and pastries.  The dessert table at the buffet was filled with picture perfect desserts that tasted like cardboard.  We tried the pool side grill and ""Cadillac diner"" as well and the burgers and dogs were the cheapest, grossest style I've seen served in a while.

Excursions felt to us pretty steep compared to Princess in Alaska and the Caribbean.  It seemed most options were over $200pp; even for a simple snorkel excursion.  We rented a car with Turo at each port and did our own thing.",6,1766913051.0,PrincessCruises,0,0.88,False

I (f56) met my birth father last year for the first time after years of searching for him. I couldn't have been happier, but its all going downhill for me and I want to cut contact. 

First when we met we were obviously all on good behaviour with each other and everything was wonderful and exciting. We started meeting once a week for a coffee. It progressed to meeting each other's families. He has other adult children both in their 50s also. All was good, and I know I was happy. 

However, as I get to know him more, I realise I don't actually like him or the way he speaks to me at times. He always has a negative comment about everything I do or touch. It can range from silly things, like the flowers I buy, the car I drive, diy I've completed, my vacation choices.. everything I do he ALWAYS has a negative comment. His jabs are not always direct, but I still hear them.

2 really stick in my head. It was his birthday a few months ago and I was invited to his birthday meal. I gave him what I thought was appropriate gift. It wasn't extremely expensive, but it was thoughtful and suited my limited budget.

A week later he called me. We spoke about the lovely day we had. I asked if he opened his gift. His reply, 'you wouldn't give a child that little'. I was shocked and didn't answer. With my family and friends, it's not about the gift or cost, it's the appreciation that someone took time out of their busy lives to think of me. I do regret not saying something, but I was honestly gobdmacked.

About 2 months later we arranged he would come to my house for lunch. My son traveled 1.5 hrs just to see him, and my daughter rearranged her schedule to be there. He didn't arrive so I rang him to see if he was ok. He didn't answer for a day and I was worried. I left a voice mail and later sent a message. When he called back, I asked if he was ok. His reply, 'ya, I woke up in a pissed off mood and couldn't be bothered'. Again I was speechless. 

These comments have stuck in my head and hurt me a lot. I've not had the best male role models in my life. I was SA by my adopted brother as a child, when I told my parents at 18yrs they brushed it under the carpet, and that was that, it wasn't mentioned again. I reported it too the police a few years later. He plead guilty, was charged and sentenced. Then my dad and the wider family cut me off. 

But I've made a good life for myself. I put myself through university, I have two amazing adult children, a great group of friends and a really good relationship with my ex husband (both kids dad). I'm happy in my life and happy in myself.

But before I make the hugh decision to cut him off I need some outside opinions please, as my concern is that I am actually projecting the negative feelings I have for my adopted father onto my birth father. Oh my head is a little mess right now. 

Thank you all in advance for reading/reacting to this post ❤️

Last Pick: **O 3.5 TO(s)❌(7-3 Last 10 POTDs)-1U**

Today's Pick: **Joe Burrow 3+ Passing TDs**

**Score Bet**: **+140**

Wager Amount: 1.U to WIN 1.4U

League: Arizona Cardinals vs Cincinnati Bengals (12PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: WHAT A FUCKIN' BAD BEAT! Excuse my language, but that deserves a WTF moment. **3 FUCKIN' TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST HALF AND ZERO TURNOVERS IN THE 2ND HALF?! WTF!!! And there were 3 combined FUMBLES IN THIS GAME AND ALL THEM WERE NOT RECOVERED BY THE DEFENSE!**! Not one of those! We just needed 1 MORE TURNOVER and we did not get there! One of the WORST BAD BEATS EVER for me! Hopefully you guys took my best bet/intial POTD which was **U 39.5**✅(Also wagered **U 40.5**✅on game day when the line moved) in the Texans/Chargers game. I don't regret taking that as my POTD because I have decided that I am strictly doing value or deep value wagers from here on out. Why not go out wit a BANG!?

**Matchup:** I'm not going to stop taking value wagers and I like a lot of points in this game between the Bengals and Cardinals. I was tryna find a special tab where I can get a combined Passing TDs between the two, but did not find this sort of wager in any special market, so I will just take single wagers on both QBs. 3+ Passing TDs for both Joe Burrow and Jacoby Brissett. I found both odds at a really nice plus money odds on Score Bet, so I placed both of them thru there. You can pick and choose which one you want, but today's selected POTD is Joe Burrow 3+ Passing TDs and I will go over his numbers and go over Cardinals defense stats.

Let's start out wit the Cards defense. They're not good. Matter in fact they are horrible. Jacoby Brissett and the offense is the not issue, it's the defense. The offense puts up points, but their defense give up more points than the offense and usually when that happens you lose the game. Cards are currently on a 7-game losing skid and Bengals should come out and handle them. I expect Burrow to roll this Cards secondary. I think everyone eats in this game, even the Cardinals offense. I  think Burrow throws a passing TD to everyone! Tee Higgins, Mike Gesicki, Ja'Marr Chase, Chase Brown, Samaje Perine, Iosivas, even the backup TE Tanner Hudson. We just need 3 of those, Idc who or how many TDs they catch, it can all be Ja'Marr Chase to get 3 TDs all I care, just need 3 TDs receptions from Burrow! Anyway before I get carried away let's stay on track wit the bad Cards defense. **This defense ranks 9th worst for allowing passing TDs and** **they have allowed 3+ Passing TDs to CJ Stroud, Brock Purdy, Trevor Lawrence and Matthew Stafford in their last 6 games (most recently allowed 3 Passing TDs from Texans on Week 15)! Burrow should feast against this secondary.**

Joe also had a 4 Passing TDs game last week against the Fins (Also recently threw 4 Passing TDs against a tougher defense in the Bills couple weeks ago). Lastly he's thrown 3 Passing TDs last time he faced this Cardinals team (10/8/23)

https://preview.redd.it/36tm1h1osw9g1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=2072192f74d6e76ac67432cd6a19b3506d1cb8f7

Don't overthink it. Joe Burrow should cook and feed his teammates late X-Mas presents.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Joe Burrow 3+ Passing TDs on Score Bet. Joe throws 2 Passing TDs in the 1st half and matches his passing TDs in the 2nd half.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

He broke up with his ex who he works with about 8 months ago, always talks about her and how she was emotionally abusive, he felt trapped & he has lots of new wounds from her, even to the point of getting upset to me & saying he has chills when he sees her car and that she’s followed him before.

At first this situation was fun and care-free, as time went on, I feel like the lines emotionally became blurred. He would make comments about me feeling in love with him, he’d tell me about other girls and say he didn’t want to not tell me and ruin what we have. He told me he downloaded hinge and went on a few dates but didn’t want me to see him on there and not tell me but then said he read ‘high value men don’t have hinge’ so deleted it. I told him I felt confused and wanted it to stop. I also have been going through a lot this year emotionally in my personal life and work & slowly the situation has been chipping away at me.

Even when it stops, we’d chat & he’d flirt. The last time it happened we ended up sleeping together again and afterwards he even said ‘I really caved in and do you regret this now?’ a lot of really insensitive things from my pov. When we met for a coffee, he openly said he was confused why I’m open to other people if I want him so badly & that he knows how he feels about baked beans, doesn’t like them in that way but is unsure if he could come round to the idea of them? In the moment, I wasn’t registering what he had just said. I’m baked beans for reference.

When I confronted him, he said he has a bad way with words. I feel like each time I explain how I feel, he either says I project just like his ex does, says it’s all my ego or has some sort of anwser which then makes me doubt myself?",4,1766912608.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False

Overall, wonderful time with a country with amazingly friendly people. Just one word of caution: BEWARE OF CHA-CHA

**Tbilisi:** Spent 4 nights in Tbilisi at an Airbnb close to Fabrika complex. Neighborhood was very chill, not too much foot traffic especially in winter / during Catholic Christmas week. Has an alternative, industrial, artsy feel. Notable spots less than 10 minutes walk - **Brewio** for craft coffee brews, **Wine Merchants** for a relaxed wine bar with good selection & **Kiev** **Sulfur Baths** for a traditional and very affordable sulfur bath, sauna & cold bucket experience.

First day, we did the Tbilisi free walking tour which starts daily at 12pm from Liberty Square & lasts about 3 hours. Was a nice way to orient yourself to the city after arriving and get interesting tidbits on the culture & history of the post-Soviet city.

In terms of Georgian food, I had previously had Khachapuri but only the Adjarian variety (the one that looks like a boat with an egg on top). The big surprise for me was the imerati version of Khachapuri which was simply delicious at every place visited. Admittedly & exposing myself to great shame, I never came to love Khinkali & remain partial to Asian dumplings.

**Best Meal:**  **Craft Wine Restaurant** \- elegant interior and great spot for a elevated meal. The food here has all the Georgian classics but with a modern, refined touch. The sulguni cheese salad with adjika was a standout along with the lavash bread and bean hummus.

**Best Wine**: **Wasserstrasse** \- don't be fooled by the name, this is not a German spot. It is a traditional Georgian restaurant with an impeccable wine list. And the food is not too shabby either. Best wines of the trip were had here including a deep dark amber & saperavi red.

**Best Cocktail Bar:** **House of Juniper** \- has Japanese style cocktail vibes. Very friendly staff and a great night cap experience for conversation.

**BEWARE:** As mentioned, the local hooch - CHA-CHA - can be dangerous. Drink it, enjoy it but remember that house-made versions served in bars can contain 60-70+% alcohol. Also, use Bolt app when traveling locally & do not take a taxi at the Tbisili airport (can be a scam - the taxis there quoted a price 5x Bolt).

**Kazbegi:** Spent 1 night in Kazbegi in a cute cottage. Left Tbilisi in the afternoon using GoTrip & the ride took roughly 3-4 hours. Go-Trip is super convenient and our experience booking drivers was seamless. You also have options on the type of vehicle - in December, booking a driver with a 4x4 is recommended as the roads can be icy especially in the Kazbegi area.

In winter, Kazbegi is pretty dead. It is very cold and not a period of the year with lots of tourists. We took a taxi up to Gergeti Trinity Church (50 Gel both ways) but due to the weather conditions, the spectacular views for which it is known were unfortunately not visible. Would visit again in Spring / Summer for hikes / better views.

**Telavi:** Spent 2 nights in Telavi - a town in the Kakheti wine region - before flying back from Tbilisi airport. Spent one full day during a tour through wineries in the area, which was organized by our accommodation (Neli & Zaal guesthouse).

**Wine Tour:** We had a taxi organized by the guesthouse which took us to Khareba winery, Shaloshvilli Cellar, Shumi Winery & Tsinandali Estate. We were also supposed to visit Nekresi - however, due to weather conditions, the road was inaccessible. Khareba winery was probably the most interesting tour - is it huge underground tunnel wine cellar that was created during Soviet times. In terms of the wine, all the wineries were quite commercial - while a good first taste of the region, would go back to Kakheti to explore less conventional / more family run wine cellars.

The standout winery was actually located in the town of Telavi itself - **Art Winery SamKhari**. The owner is an artist & designs all the bottle labels himself (each one is unique & different). Admittedly, I did not expect the wines to be that good from a relatively new establishment - but they were terrific! The family was very friendly and the 88 year old father - who took a nap randomly while we tasted wine - arose from his slumber to play several beautiful piano arrangements. Apparently, he is a renowned musician in Telavi. Come for the wine, stay for the music!

**Best Drinking Spots in Telavi:** Two spots located on the same street - **Musaifi wine bar** & **Suphevs**. Musaifi wine bar just opened by a super passionate Sommelier a few months ago & has some great wines. Suphevs is a just great time with a small neighborhood bar atmosphere. The homemade cha-cha here is called Bomba - and at 65% alcohol, I can attest that the name fits!",1,1766912307.0,travel,1,1.0,False

Two weeks ago, I dropped a PDF guide about LinkedIn growth hacks.

The hook? ""Drop 'guide' below and I'll send it over.""

Classic engagement bait. Works every time.

Except this time it worked *too* well.

I checked my phone during a coffee break.

214 comments.

Most of them just said ""guide.""

Some said ""Guide please!"" Others went with ""GUIDE 🔥"" or ""guide guide guide.""

Didn't matter. They all wanted the same thing.

And I'd promised to deliver.

What followed was the most mind-numbing 4 hours of my life:

Open comment → Visit profile → Check connection status → Open chat → Write something semi-personal → Drop the link → Hit send → Pray I didn't already message them → Move to the next one.

Around person #60, my messages became robotic. ""Here's your guide. Cheers.""

By #150, I stopped checking if we were even connected. Half my messages probably bounced.

By #214, I swore off lead magnets forever.

Then I remembered I literally run an automation company.

So I spent a weekend building this:

**Smart filtering** — Only messages people who typed your keyword. No accidental spam to people saying ""great post!""

**Connection check** — LinkedIn won't let you DM strangers. The workflow knows this and skips them automatically.

**Human-like pacing** — Random delays between 15-30 minutes. Looks organic. Keeps your account healthy.

**Personalization** — Uses their first name. Small touch, big difference.

**Here's what you need:**

1. N8N (cloud or self-hosted)
2. [ConnectSafely.ai](http://ConnectSafely.ai) account + API key
3. Your LinkedIn connected to the platform
4. A post with hungry commenters

**The message template I use:**

    Hey {{firstName}}!
    
    You asked, I'm delivering 🙌
    
    Here's the guide: {{yourLink}}
    
    Let me know if you have questions!
    
    — {{yourName}}

Nothing fancy. Just keeping the promise.

**Real talk on limits:**

Don't go crazy. Stick to 30-50 DMs daily on free accounts. Premium can push 70-80. Sales Navigator maybe 100.

The delays feel slow. That's the point. LinkedIn's watching. Patience beats punishment.

**Where I'm taking this next:**

* Logging every send to a spreadsheet (no double-messaging)
* Auto-connecting with non-connections first, then circling back
* Different templates for different keywords
* Pushing contacts straight into my CRM

**The bottom line:**

The ""comment for X"" strategy prints engagement. But if you can't fulfill at scale, you're just building a backlog of disappointed people.

This workflow handles delivery so you can focus on creating stuff worth commenting for.

But over time, I have grown accustom to the taste, consistency, and convenience.

I am a long-time customer and drinker of Starbucks black coffee. Started drinking it when I was in my late teens. I'm now in my early 30s. I get my coffee every day. Sometimes 2-3 cups. Cup = 1 tall, black, coffee. Blonde roast. Nothing in it. Never get any other type of drink. This routine is part of the budget. Waking up every day, no matter the weather, walk and go my coffee. Every day, each week, of every month. Doing this is \~$160/month, on average. A damn utility bill.

I also live near a La Colombe. And while I like their coffee, too. This post is framed more-so about commercially brewed coffee in general, and how that is a monthly expense.

In the past, to try and overcome this dependency of commercially brewed coffee vs. making it at home, I purchased a Bodum french press, tried my regular Starbucks blonde roast brew and the results never quite A.) taste the same and B.) do not carry the same ""kick"" from the caffeine I am used to. Multiple times experimenting with brewing techniques yielded poor results.

I've also had a pour-over. Same thing. And a Keurig machine, too. With K-cup Starbucks pods. Gross. And forget about ""Mr. Coffee"" drip-style machines. They suck. And I wonder how clean the internals of those machines really are over time.

I have not been able to achieve at-home coffee that comes close to a commercially brewed cup of coffee, where the taste and most importantly, kick from the caffeine, are the same.

I'm revisiting the idea again since it is a real luxury to get coffee out every single day. Any suggestions? What about investing in a high-end espresso machine and going that route?

I met my ex mid June this year, 2 weeks before I was due to move overseas for 3 years. We agreed to just let ourselves go and enjoy our fleeting time together. But we fell in love, hard! Was the kind of love you see in movies. When I left I thought it was over, but we both agreed to carry it on as we were obsessed with each other, despite the 8 hour time difference.

This is where it all starts to go wrong. A couple of weeks later she tells me she is pregnant, and as we both agreed before hand if this were to happen we would have to get an abortion (we used protection btw). To cut a long story short, we had planned for her to come see me for 2 weeks in Oct, but by early September she had dumped me via text. She explained that she didn't feel I was there for her during the abortion, but I felt I was. I know it must have been awful for her, but I thought being strong for us both was the right thing to do. I didn't take the break up well, we went no contact for around 2 weeks, then I got emotional one night and sent her a few long messages, all ended in tears and she said she wouldn't be messaging me anymore, blocked on everything.

It just really hurt how we could be so close, calling twice a day and always messaging, to her not even caring about me at all. She was the more forward one of us both at the start. I know we didn't know each other long but I really thought it was something special, despite the long distance. Cut forward to Christmas, (now back in the same city)I left a really nice letter on her car (not begging, not pleading, just gratitude for what we had and wishing her the best). 4 days later she unblocked me and sent me a message saying thank you for the letter it was very nice. And explained it was a very traumatic time and she felt she got nothing from me. And if the timing was different things maybe would of ended differently. I felt I was there for her, but I was also setting up a new life in America at the time and things were really stressful for me too. I replied saying thank you for clearing the air and that the timing was definitely wrong, and wished her a happy Christmas.

Didn't hear anything, until last night I messaged her while having a drink in a bar we used to go in, saying ""just sat in the worlds smallest booth again 😂 reminded me of you x"". She replied ""Awww was it nice?"" And ""I mean a lot of things around here must remind you of me"". I replied ""yeah it's evitable around here isn't it lol"" and she said ""that's true 💔 xx"" and I replied with a broken heart emoji. I am only in the same city as her for another 5 days before I go back abroad and I really don't want to make things worse, but I really want her back. Does anyone think we have a chance? And would asking to see her for a coffee or something before I left be okay to ask?

I'm still trying to get back on my feet so moving out is not an option at the time.

Yesterday she tied up the full garbage bag and simply left it in the hallway. Neither she, nor my stepdad felt the need to take the trash outside. A few minutes ago I went downstairs to get my second cup of coffee and another cigarette. Mom just got up too and the trash bag is still in the hallway. She asked me if I'm going outside and if I could take the trash with me. But I told her, that the trashcans are nowhere near the spot where I smoke so it's not like I walk past them anyway. She got mad that I won't do it. I tried to reason with her that it would have been a completely different situation if I were on my way to my car, which is closer to the trashcans, but she just got pissed off. 

Her outsourcing task to me is nothing new in this household. In the winter she wants to have a fire in the fireplace to keep the house warm but somehow *I* am responsible for keeping the fire going and making sure that there's fire wood inside the house. A couple of months ago I even told her, ""mom, I have no problem with keeping an eye on the fireplace while you two are going out for some alone time. But I don't like it if I go downstairs to check on the fire and have to find out there's no fire wood left. At least be so kind and tell me that we need to fetch a new basket of wood first. Especially when he is ready to go and still waiting for you to get ready it wouldn't hurt either of you to go outside with me so we can carry the heavy basket together. Because, honestly, I feel like you're taking advantage of me and I will not tolerate being treated like that."" In that moment she was like, ""yeah, okay"" but nothing changed.

I wrote a post about how the Lions switched to an Air Coryell  Offensive scheme in 2025 with Johnny Mo.



[It kinda blew up to my surprise... ](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/1pw4ss1/lions_changed_schemes_the_data_shows_what_happened/) Thank you everyone!



I shared how the Air Coryell scheme Is designed to attack a defense through stretching deep, and wide, using wide sets that run deep, with single back formations.  It sets teams up for explosives, by exploiting space through geometry.  


Which is exactly what happened.  The lions became the #1 team with 40y+ explosive throwing plays.  
  
The problem was it ended up putting a young, injured offensive line under strain because Goff had to wait longer for routes to develop.

Our 3rd down Yards Per attempt went from...

**7.6 in 2024**

**To 9.6 in 2025**

And many asked, 

>***""Didn't the increase happen because our run game was getting stopped and putting us in a place where we had to make up for it.""***



I intend to answer that, but there's more to the full picture.



The questions I'd like to answer are as follows;

* How did our offensive line end up losing 2 pro-bowlers from the previous season?
* How did the scheme affect our young line, and our run game?
* And why did our offense really start to sputter mid season around game 10?

  
So I guess kick back... grab a coffee because I'm going to go deep with this one.

***\*\*Sips coffee\*\****

  
**Rewind back to January 2025.**

>Brad Holmes in an interview said,   
  
*""I don't care how good we ever get on the offensive line, that one right there is too important for not only our team, our quarterback, everything, it's our identity, man. So, I think just that alone is just—it's always going to be at the forefront.""*

I just want to point out, **Brad knows offensive line is important.**

Following an exit interview with Zeitler, Brad was quoted as saying, 

>*""We had conversations on exit day and then we'll just continue to have dialogue and just kind of see where it goes.""*

I say this to show, I think Brad was counting on Ragnow coming back (He has 2 years left on his contract, and he's a guy who deals with pain, so high percentage of return was there), and was actively talking to Zeitler, confident he'd want to return to chase a ring.  

As we know Zeitler ended up signing with the Titans, and the priority became Frank, and the youth.  The line would have looked decent with Frank, not perfect but solid.  
  
We know the story - Frank announces retirement.  I'm going to go out on a lim and say this caught Brad off guard.  He hadn't pursued more offensive line help.  Colon was desperation.  

The reason this important is because by the time this happened, we had already changed schemes, and started installs.  It was too late to switch.

As we entered the season the famous quote, ""We're good."" From DC was *for* the **team.** aka We believe in the guys we got.

Up for argument, but In my opinion, a lot better than saying.  *We have young guys that just aren't ready.*

# The Schematic Shift Away From Erhardt-Perkins (EP) To Air Coryell (AC)

As I stated in the previous post, Morton wanted to ""hunt more explosives"".  

DC said about Jamo; 

>*""The sky’s the limit for him... We expect him to have a huge season. We really do, man. He’s going to be one of these guys that we’re going to lean on this year and is really going to be big for us.""*



They wanted to utilise Jaymo, and the best use of a high speed deep threat is Air Coryell. 



Jaymo will stretch the defense with his speed, Amon will exploit the gap between the line backers and safeties, LaPorta will be there to pull Linebacker down, and Jahmyr is an extra safety valve to prevent teams from stacking the box.

  
  
LaPorta is known as the Joker and is very important(this last point is important).

  
  
So on paper with our personal, the AC will be devastating to defenses.  The lions will ***out skill*** the competition, because it forces a defense to choose.  Either commit and get beat deep, or cover deep and get opened up in the middle.  

  
  
EP on the other hand is a concept style offense - it can take many formations but a basic understanding is it's built around 6 - 8 yard consistent plays.  The death by 1000 cuts.  It's not about splash, it's about establishing rhythm, and playing a high percentage style.



EP is around math, and law of averages.  Mathematically you will win based on clock control, possession, and creating an extra man advantage.  And that's what happened with close games last year.  On average we'd win without relying on big plays.  Games came down to the wire, and the Lions had the ball at the end.  



Or we just couldn't be stopped because we were exploiting the opponents with Penei running across the back of the line to create a man disadvantage for the defense by adding another player.



So how do you know we switched? *Let's look at the stats.*



||2024|2025 Early Johnny Mo|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Pre-snap motion|66%|23.3%|
|During-snap motion|35.2%|14%|
|Pre-snap shifts|2.4%|0%|



# EP Pre-snap Motion

**Pre-snap motion** is when a player like gibbs moves from one side of the formation to the other before the snap.



It's diagnosis, and It forces a defense to reveal whether the linebackers shift in a 'shell' which means they're in zone defense, or a linebacker follows Gibbs meaning they're in man coverage.



The system relies on offensive players to identify coverage (You need high IQ players for this), Goff then calls **Kill-Kill, Can-Can, Alert...** 



These commands instruct the team as to run play A, B, or have a player run a hot route for pressure release, from a blitz.  (There's more to it, but these are the basics)  


An EP system is reactive to what the defense shows.  


AC You don't rely on pre-snap motion.



The diagnostic is based on post-snap safety rotation.



In doing so you are always looking for a deep threat, this forces defenses to make choices, cover jaymo stretching the field high this allows under cut gashing plays because they're forced to respect Jaymo's speed, or play aggressive and allow deep balls.  


You'd see people complaining they're not throwing to Jaymo, but that's the system, his deep threat opens a defense vertically underneath. 

  
  
In my opinion this is what Dan likes, he wanted to put his foot on the opposing teams throat and force them to make a choice where either choice resulted in Lions racking up yards and points.   (This is the system used by the greatest show on turf the St Louis Rams)



# The Offensive Line In An EP vs AC Scheme



The choice to go AC scheme was largely because of the ""hunting explosives"", it's Johny Mo's specialty, we lost BJ so... who was going to make the play calls for an EP system?

I believe the lions looked at their personal and wanted to use Jaymo more in his natural skillset, where he could influence the game more with deep routes.

Also having an under skilled, rookie heavy offensive line, AC is a better choice because there are more zone blocking schemes, and they don't rely on complex timing of O line push/pull, or mid count adjustments.   


The o-line is getting the play in the huddle and running it, this helps the rookie play faster and as we know playing fast early on is hard for rookies.  So lets remove the mental load of an EP scheme.

  
Here's a table of some stats between 24 and 25.



||2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|IOL Pull Rate|18%|8.8%|
|Gap Scheme Runs|54%|31%|
|Zone Scheme Runs|46%|69%|



Push & Pull rate of the offensive line took a nosedive this year.  
  
Push pull is a core of the EP scheme.  Where push/pull (meaning the o-line players run across the back of the line to re-enforce the other side of the line post snap or up the middle to create a numbers mismatch.)



You need smart linemen (High IQ) and Agility, there is a lot of pre-snap processing and  this isn't easy for rookies.  The entire team is thinking like a qb to some extent.

  
You can see that the EP works to create better odds.  If you run Penei from one side to the line to the other side you counter the defense with a play going from 2v2 to a 3v2.  


(If you really want to understand football, this is a core understanding.  You split the field in two from where the ball is, and you create odd man advantages on either side of the split)  
  
EP is dynamic, but again you need high IQ and if the timing isn't right, plays are blown up.  


The EP with both Jahmyr and Monty on the field this creates stress for the defense.  It's also why Monty had more yards last year vs this year since there are more calls with both rb on the field.



# The AC O-Line Problem

  
The problem with the o-line in an AC scheme is that on throwing plays you need to wait for the routes to develop.  The issue was you were putting rookies, inexperience on an island forcing them into a system where they had to hold on longer than the EP system.



||2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Release Time|2.56s|2.78s|
|Pressure Arrival|2.64s|2.47s|
|Pocket Integrity|\+0.08s|\-0.31s|

  
We know what happened, the o-line couldn't sustain.

From a numbers perspective the young o-line was asked to hold longer before Goff released it because he had to wait for route development.  The major problem is the young guys couldn't hold the protection for that long and the line broke down.



# LaPorta's Injury Was The Most Crucial Injury



In and AC style scheme the TE or LaPorta in our case is the most important player.

  
The tight end in this scheme is known as the Joker.  



He's the only route runner that is consistently running 8-10 yard routes.  **He's the pressure release.**  When a blitz comes, when coverage breaks down, LaPorta is there to exploit the defense, and it worked when he was healthy.

  


||Weeks 1-9 (With Laporta)|Weeks 10-16 (Without LaPorta)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Points Per Game|**33.2**|21.4|
|3rd Down Conversion %|**48.2%**|31.5%|
|Goff Passer Rating Middle|**108.4**|76.2|
|Sacks Allowed Per Game|**2.1**|3.8|
|Amon Ra Success Rate|**61%**|44%|

  
As you can see without LaPorta to bridge the gap between a power run or air pass, we were dead in the water and predictable.



Losing him in my opinion **was the single most crucial piece that gave us an out**, when a defense blitzed or didn't respect the middle of the field.  It forces you to be honest or you'd pay for it.

  
***Losing LaPorta was a domino that mathematically broke the AC system.***

  
After LaPorta went down, defenses played '2-high shell' meaning two high safeties to contain the deep threat.



No LaPorta meant the Linebackers weren't pulled away allowing Amon to exploit the gap in the middle of the field.



No LaPorta meant they lost their best move blocker in the 'zone-stretch' run blocking, there was no blocker to seal the edge on lateral runs by Gibbs.



The Lions went from being a team that owned the middle, to a team that abandoned the middle of the field.



And when the lions put in a backup TE, **teams knew that they were running.**

  
Here's a stat that shows what defenses thought, with LaPorta because he's a dynamic player and you didn't know if he was a run blocking or receiving.

  


||With LaPorta|Without LaPorta|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Run Success Rate|**48.2%**|36.5%|
|Yards Per Carry|**5.1**|4.2|
|Stacked Box %|**18%**|34%|

  
The most damning is stacked box.  Without LaPorta the disrespect was there.



# Route Tree Concept Of AC Doesn't Fit Amon Ra



Now I say this looking back.  There was no way to know this before the season.

  
Amon Ra has an incredibly high football IQ.  He is also small.  This makes him perfect for EP.



The major difference for WR in AC scheme is Amon Ra is told to run a route tree.  It's puts a receiver in a geometric box.  He's told to run a ""6"" (a 12-to-15 yard curl).  He *must* reach that depth regardless of what the defenders are doing.



In the EP system Amon Ra had more freedom to 'sit' and find soft pockets of coverage, because of his football IQ.



If a linebacker drifted too far left, Amon-Ra would stop his route at 6 yards; if the linebacker stayed home, he’d push to 8.  (It essentially makes every route an option)



By putting Amon Ra into a box, it forced him to be more static.  



He's one of the best at sniffing out soft coverage and the system took that away from him.



||2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Drop Rate|2.8%|6.3%|



The combination of Goff being forced to wait for routes to develop, and Amon needing to run to specific points regardless of coverage, meant the drops were tight window drops.

  
Hitting his hips, not completely missing, Goff under pressure and Amon needing to hit specific points left everyone under pressure to perform.



In the EP scheme this is where Amon and Goff have the most chemistry.  Everyone talks about it, since Goff sees the coverage and knows where Amon is going and they make plays happen. 



This only happens with high IQ players, alternatively interceptions happen if players aren't on the same page.



# TLDR;

  
The offensive line was inexperienced, injured and not as talented, **we know this**.  But there is so much more to this game.



Forcing young players to hold on longer in and anchor  because we needed to wait for routes to develop made it hard on our young, and inexperienced interior offensive line.



*Could the EP scheme have avoided this, by getting the ball out quicker?*  I don't know.  Maybe, but the pre snap processing might have been too much, and the line could have been exposed because of this.



I believe Brad as caught off guard with Zeitler and Ragnow.  



Ragnow wanting to 'Unretire' seems like he felt bad (this is pure speculation on my part).



Either way it wasn't planned for.



The AC system was a way to get Jaymo involved, and it did work for the most part.  Lions could rack up points.  



But it left us out of a rhythm,  and rhythm as I watched games seems to be very important.

  


The LaPorta Injury was possibly the most crucial offensive injury, it exposed everything as the Joker role is a core piece of the AC scheme.



It made us predictable, static, and defenses knew what we were doing, and things fell apart after week 10.  The Vikings are so deceptive, it showed without LaPorta we really couldn't do anything.

  
AC isn't the best system for Amon Ra, or Penei.  I didn't go into depth, but Penei is one of the most athletic and best push/pull OT's in the league, he'll be better utilized in an EP or hybrid scheme.

If fans like this this, then I'll have to do a defensive breakdown (because realistically this what collapsed our season, as always backed by data).

The hinge cracked, the keyboard had three dead keys, and the battery lasted about 45 minutes. I was done wasting money on laptops that promised durability but fell apart within 2-3 years.

I spent weeks researching, talking to IT professionals, and reading through hundreds of reviews. Now I'm 18 months into owning a laptop that still feels brand new, and I wanted to share everything I learned because I see this question constantly.

# Define What ""Durable"" Actually Means for Your Work

This was my first mistake - I thought durable just meant ""won't break."" But durability means different things depending on how you use your laptop.

**If you're a desktop replacement user** (laptop stays on your desk 90% of the time): You need solid build quality and excellent cooling systems. Overheating is the silent killer of laptops. You want something with good ventilation, quality fans, and components that won't thermal throttle.

**If you travel constantly**: You need physical durability - reinforced hinges, shock-resistant chassis, spill-resistant keyboards. Look for MIL-STD-810G or 810H certification. These are military-grade durability standards that test for drops, vibration, temperature extremes, and more.

**If you run heavy software** (video editing, 3D rendering, development environments): Thermal management becomes critical. Poor cooling doesn't just slow your laptop down - it literally shortens its lifespan. Every component degrades faster when running hot.

# Build Quality Indicators You Can Actually Check

After my research, here's what separates laptops that last from those that don't:

**Chassis Material**: Metal bodies (aluminum or magnesium alloy) are significantly more durable than plastic. They dissipate heat better, resist flexing, and protect internal components. Pick up the laptop - does it feel solid or does the keyboard deck flex when you press on it?

**Hinge Design**: I cannot stress this enough - check hinge reviews specifically. This is where most laptops fail. Look for metal hinges, dual-hinge designs, and reinforced mounting points. Read through Amazon reviews and search for ""hinge"" specifically.

**Keyboard Quality**: If you type 6-8 hours daily, keyboard durability matters enormously. Business-class laptops often have spill-resistant keyboards rated for millions of keystrokes. ThinkPads, for instance, have drainage channels that redirect liquid away from components.

**Thermal Design**: Look at reviews that mention fan noise and heat. Check if the laptop has heat pipes, vapor chambers, or adequate ventilation. Avoid anything described as ""runs hot"" unless you're okay replacing it in 2-3 years.

**Port Durability**: USB ports that wiggle, charging ports that become loose - these are common failure points. Metal-reinforced ports last much longer than plastic.

# Business Class vs Consumer Grade

This was the game-changer for me. Business-class laptops are built completely differently than consumer models, even from the same manufacturer.

**Business lines that last**:

* Lenovo ThinkPad (T, P, X, and L series)
* Dell Latitude and Precision
* HP EliteBook and ZBook
* Fujitsu Lifebook (underrated in North America)
* Panasonic Toughbook (if you need extreme durability)

These models prioritize longevity over aesthetics. They have longer warranty options, better customer support, and are actually designed to last 5-7 years instead of 2-3.

**Why they're different**: Standardized parts, extensive testing, better quality control, and actual repair manuals available. Many have modular components you can upgrade or replace.

# Repairability Matters More Than You Think

My old laptops were basically disposable. Battery dies? Whole laptop is trash. Screen breaks? Costs more to repair than replace.

Check [iFixit.com](http://iFixit.com) for repairability scores. A laptop that scores 7+ means you can actually fix things yourself. Framework laptops are the gold standard here - literally designed to be repaired and upgraded.

Some Dell Latitude and ThinkPad models still have official service manuals with step-by-step instructions. This means when something breaks (and eventually, something will), you're not forced to buy new.

# Don't Ignore These Details

**Battery**: Bigger capacity (measured in Wh, not just hours) degrades slower. A 95Wh battery will still be usable at 80% capacity in 3 years. A 45Wh battery becomes frustrating much faster.

**RAM and Storage**: Get more than you need now. 16GB instead of 8GB. 512GB instead of 256GB. This extends how long the laptop stays useful.

**Warranty**: Business laptops often have 3-year warranties standard, with options for on-site service. Consumer laptops typically have 1 year. This tells you what the manufacturer expects.

# What I Actually Bought

I ended up with a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 3 (AMD version). Not sexy, not thin, not the lightest. But:

* All-metal chassis that feels indestructible
* Keyboard is phenomenal and spill-resistant
* Runs cool even under heavy load
* Dropped it once, spilled coffee on it - still perfect
* Battery still lasts a full workday after 18 months
* Cost $1100 (sales), which is less than I spent on my previous three laptops combined

Durable laptops cost more upfront but save money long-term. My $400 laptops lasted 18-24 months each. My $1100 ThinkPad is going strong at 18 months and feels like it'll easily hit 5+ years.

Don't cheap out on something you use 8 hours a day. Buy once, cry once, then enjoy years of reliability.

1pxmh42,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1pxmh42/passed_at_100/,Passed at 100,"I passed the CISSP exam yesterday at 100 questions. Sharing my preparation strategy and exam-day experience in case it helps others on their journey.

👨‍💼 My Background

I have 10+ years of experience in IT, spanning
Software Development & Infrastructure Management with last 2 years in GRC.

📚 Study Resources (In Order)

Destination CISSP (Book): My primary resource. One thorough read-through built my foundation and helped me understand the syllabus. I liked the simple language and colorful presentation.

Pete Zerger – CISSP Last Mile and Youtube CISSP Videos : Completed this after Destination CISSP. Excellent for reinforcing concepts and covers few areas in syllabus, where DestCert does not go in depth.

Final Day Revision: Prabh Nair’s ""Coffee Shots"" and Pete Zerger’s PPTs (Links available in YouTube video descriptions)


🧪 Practice Questions

LearnZapp (1 month subscription): Attempted ~1,000 questions. Best for identifying knowledge gaps and domain-specific weaknesses.

Quantum Exams (Non-CAT): Took 6 tests, scoring 50–60%. Don’t let low scores scare you. These were the most useful for learning how to identify keywords and eliminate options logically. This was the closest to the real exam.

Destination Cert App: Good initially, but I found the options became predictable over time and app was also a bit slower.

📝 Exam Day Experience & Break Strategy

Preparation: Since I had an afternoon slot, I had dark chocolate before the exam and during the break to stay sharp and avoid the mid-day ""slump.""

Timing & Breaks: Attended 75 questions in about 90 minutes. After a short break, I attended the final 25 questions in another 40 minutes.

The Confidence Level: About 30 questions felt ""certain."" For the rest, I could usually narrow it down to two choices, but picking the ""best"" one was tough and in most cases, I could only guess.

💡 Final Advice & Key Takeaways

Hydration & Energy: Ensure you keep yourself hydrated and energized during the exam. Plan your snack and break strategy in advance.

The ""Shock"": Since I already passed CCSP and also prepared with Quantum Exams, I was ready for the ""exam-day shock"" of ISC2 where questions look nothing like practice banks. So, expect the unexpected. Do practice the art of elimination.",4,1766910899.0,cissp,1,1.0,False

Winter does this thing                                             where time slows down just enough                           for people to notice each other again.

Winter does this thing to people.                          Coffee tastes more deliberate.                                Hands stay in pockets longer,                                      not because of the cold,                                              but because suddenly touch feels                              like it should mean something.

Scarves become excuses.                                     Silence becomes comfortable.                                  Even the city lowers its voice,                                        as if it knows something tender                                      is trying to happen.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

1pxmgqz,https://i.redd.it/8qt6qpf4pw9g1.jpeg,Switched from Oxelo Town 7 XL to Oxelo C900 - AMA,"The Oxelo Town 7 XL is a great scooter. The ride is very comfortable due to the dual suspension (though this has its downsides), and it is not as heavy as the C900. When I was first looking to buy a scooter, I debated between the C900 and the T7XL. I ultimately settled on the T7XL because of its lighter weight, knowing I would be carrying it up and down stairs at train stations and bus stops.

However, once I started using the T7XL for my daily multimodal commute, I found myself frequently wishing I could fold and unfold it without bending down, especially when rushing to catch a bus or train. I also often wished I could roll the scooter around in ""trolley mode"" rather than carrying it, as there is no reason to carry the weight when on a flat surface.

Unfortunately, the T7XL lacks a handlebar lock and a curved front, making it difficult to stroll around in trolley mode. I have to position the scooter completely upright so the front deck doesn't hit the ground, which puts significant strain on my wrist.

Fast forward after 1.5 months,
My cousin saw me use it and he became interested in buying a scooter, so I sold the T7XL to him for half the price and bought the C900.
The riding experience is different. Here is what I can tell you:

Pros
- It's more stable. The scooter feels far more stable due to the wider handlebar. This is 100% noticeable even at moderate speeds. The stiffer suspension (and lack of rear suspension) gives me the confidence to increase speed and perform maneuvers.

- Better rolling efficiency. The lack of suspension means the scooter rolls better with less rolling resistance, especially on flat, smooth surfaces. I can easily hit 18km/h any day. On the T7XL, I could only manage 16km/h because some of the kicking energy was absorbed vertically by the suspension

- The folding mechanism is so well-engineered that I can unfold it and start riding in less than 2 seconds. The handlebar doesn't need to be ""plugged"" in; you just unfold and go. This is incredibly practical for public transport.

- The rear fender flexes less. This means the VIOOCLIP lights that Decathlon sells are more stable and less likely to fall off (I lost my light twice on the T7XL).

Cons
- Noise and Vibration. The lack of rear suspension means the scooter is very noisy on rough asphalt, and you can feel the vibration. The noise bothers me the most, but I try to ignore it; it is still not as loud as a motorcycle engine.
- It is a bit bulky. Unlike the T7XL, you can't really park the scooter upright because of the curve (you can see how low it goes in the photo). This wastes more horizontal space, which is noticeable when bringing it inside a coffee shop or restaurant.
- Weirdly enough, the brake feels weaker than on the T7XL. I think this is to reduce wear on the rear wheel. But it still gets the job done and is less likely to make me skid or go over the front handlebar.

Verdict on Ride Quality
I am actually getting used to the lack of rear suspension. Even though it feels stiff, the ride is very tactile, giving a clear feel for the ground. This increases my confidence in building up speed. The wider handlebar also significantly improves stability.

I believe Decathlon has positioned their scooters correctly:
 - The T7XL is designed for leisure riding where you don't need to frequently fold and unfold. It handles distances over 2km, but requires more effort than the C900 due to the softer dual suspension converting some kicking energy into vertical motion.

- The C900 is designed for the actual commute, just as its name suggests. It offers superior riding stability (despite the stiffness). The Easyfold system is truly unique and innovative; while it adds weight, this is mitigated by the ability to easily roll it in trolley mode.

I just completed a 5.6km commute entirely on my C900 (I previously attempted this route with the T7XL, but it was wet and I didn't scoot continuously). I still prefer the C900 due to the stability and tactility.

The answer won't surprise you. . . It's the same as it's always been. . . independence. Self-determination. And freedom.

**Why is independence so important?**

Jeff Bezos is on record saying he wants his employees to wake up, every morning, terrified. Elon Musk has claimed that remote work isn't really work.

---

In 1986, Russian Psychology student Dmitry Davidoff invented a classroom game, called Mafia, to show the advantages an informed minority could have over an uninformed majority.

The game is simple:

3 mafia bosses over 15 citizens. The game alternates between day and night. During the night, the bosses have the option to kill citizens. During the day, the citizens have the option to capture the bosses.

The game has a 50% win ratio for the mafia bosses. 3 people [in the know] can take on 15 [out of the loop] people and beat them all 50% of the time.

**How much data does big tech have on you?** I just went through my Google account logs (they make this publicly available to anyone), and there's a timestamped record of every website I've ever visited, video I've ever watched, search term I've every entered, or app I've ever opened on my phone.

At the price of losing all the nifty features afforded by them, this forced me to de-Google my phone. All of these companies are ""in the know"" about me.

Rich people have already stated they wanted to rule the poor, in several places (TED, for example, https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming). Plutocracies are governments ruled by the rich. Elon and Bezos.

I think most people, nowadays, are living their lives under the assumption that they've won the genetic lottery. They aren't bothered, because they're somehow superior to those who are harassed. That isn't the case. Science has long disproved the notion of any genetic superiority. No data supports the concept, because for there to be a superior, there must be an inferior. And, you can't prove a negative. Every assertive has its own strength. Making every human cosmologically equal.

What allows rich people to assume the position of ruler? It isn't that their smarter than you. Or, more cunning. It isn't their education. It isn't their upbringing. It's simply that, they're in the know about your life. If you were in the know about theirs, you could rule them. But politicians have special protections from having data collected on them, to prevent them from being manipulated (ruled). And rich people have the money to avoid it.

**Why is freedom so important?**

Because it frees us from depending on plutocrats. And that's what every investor in cryptocurrencies truly wants. A system where their every purchase isn't tracked. Where every penny spent isn't telling someone something about them.

---

The United States just stopped minting pennies. A lot of US businesses have stopped taking cash or money orders. My rent is paid online. My cellphone bill. My bus tickets are on my phone. My job sends digital numerical data to my account every 2 weeks. And my credit card company/bank sells data on every purchase I make to third-parties. Every piece of data, another little bit of power for the plutocrats to use.

**The flaw in the system** is that crypto was never meant to be treated like an investment opportunity. All along, the developers and concept innovators behind crypto have constantly stated that crytocurrencies should be treated as cash.

You don't go to the bank and withdraw large sums of cash. Why? Because if you lose it, your bank isn't going to reimburse you. You don't take out large sums of crypto. If you lose it, you're not getting it back. Taking out large sums of crypto is akin to storing cash in coffee tins, buried in your garage (the money rots overtime and you're left with nothing).

**How to fix the system**

We really need an anonymous government-backed open source digital currency. With a simple standard that even mom and pop can implement in their businesses.

An anonymous chain, where purchases can't be tracked, like Monero. Where transactions can be rescinded by a third-party moderator, like modern Bitcoin.

Where mom and pop can easily setup an open source blockchain server, that processes their store payments, so they aren't dependent upon third-party data collection groups.

Where that server can send a digital ""check"" via BlueTooth to offline digital wallets (like this, https://lilygo.cc/en-us/products/t-deck-pro), and the end user can sign said check then forward it back to said server for insertion into the chain. Where keys can be backed up onto multiple wallets, in case one of them fails. And users can see their current balance on those wallets (getting it from the BlueTooth servers of the stores they interact with). There needs to be a warning to wallets with large sums of digital ""cash"" to make sure they have a backup wallet, and that digital cash isn't meant to be a long-term savings solution. And, most importantly, about 1% of it would expire annually. This would allow for a controlled circulation throughout the economy and blockchain pruning.

Cash transfers could be facilitated through transaction IDs. You type in a 6 character code for the local area transaction you're sending cash to. The device finds that transaction code through the BlueTooth network, and its value pops up on your screen. You then decide to sign the transaction, and forward it back to the chain.

You could withdraw bank account funds in the same manner (this is cash). Your device creates a BlueTooth check and issues a 6 character code. You type the code into the ATM, the ATM finds the transaction, signs the check, and puts the transaction into the network.

Make online payments. webSerial lets you connect to BlueTooth devices.

This all needs to be funded by the government, and developed by independent university backed computer science majors, who have a vision of simplicity over recursion. University driven would mean it didn't have hidden government intentions.

This would drop the price of printing money overnight for the government, while also giving people the freedom to make payments out of the hands of the system.

I know this wasn't written very well. Some 12-year-old will probably try and take a giant shit all over it. That's fine, because the points are still solid. Because, if rich people were really that much smarter than you, they wouldn't need to tilt the system in their favor for it to work for them. They wouldn't have to track everything around you. They'd just know your habits, out of intuitive experience. But, they don't. They aren't playing a fair game. We should level the table.",1,1766910835.0,Rants,0,0.67,False

Well..she snuck an open container in his truck, then proceeded to ask him if she could set her drink IN HIS FRONT FUCKING console.. something like ""can you hold this for a min it's just a little drink"" completely oblivious like it was no big deal and minimizing. I firmly but calmy told her you need to get your drink out of his console he is a truck driver and that could be detrimental to his job and we both told her you need to pour it out..And she KNOWS he's a truck driver.It's the PRINCIPLE too!

Within half a second she got in a defensive hissy fit saying it's no big deal and she has a little drink in her car all the time (she use to always have wine in her coffee cup and drive drunk with me and my brother in the car)

She also said well fine then I'll just put it back in my backpack! Like how dare us right? That we don't want to hold her open container🙄

She continued to gaslight us and victimize herself saying I'm leaving and I don't deserve this. If y'all only knew what I'm going through! (It's always a sob story) Bahaha! How selfish can you get right? My husband said later he was just in shock by her behavior and speechless.

Needless to say it was a dinner from hell because of her selfish ways.

Back to putting up strong boundaries with her and no more picking her up! It's crazy to see your parents for who they really are.. A lot of the time the feel entitled because they are you parent, but they are just like any other selfish person.

Any advice would help too! Thank you so much 🙏 Having a selfish parent is so hard.",6,1766910441.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

I want to die for a lot of reasons, because i feel perpetually unable to make meaningful relationships. I’ve been in college for 3 years and every relationship here has ebbed and flowed, until i’ve found myself with a lot of people to hang out with—but nobody to talk to. I talk to my oldest childhood friends sometimes about how isolated i feel, but even that packs me with a feeling of hopelessness, as i’ve been telling my best friends i’m suicidal since i was 11.

I guess i don’t ever explain well enough why, it’s the world, and my life, and the circumstances i don’t wish to see. It’s the urge i’ve resisted since i was a small child to be feminine. I’ve successfully come out to my small-town-kentucky family as a gay guy, but what’s felt right to me has never been the masculine. I was sexually assaulted by my brother one time when i was probably ten. I relive the memory every single day. often it impedes my every strain of thought. It planted a seed so young in me to want to be taken advantage of sexually. I did a lot of things too young, and made a few mistakes i still sleep with. i have never told any member of my family what happened, and my brother has never spoken to me about it since.

I spend my days waking up and sexting men on grindr and sniffies between 8-9 am, while also watching youtube shorts. My algorithms are decorated by fnaf and drag queens and the ever flowing vat of bad news erupting from our world. I am simultaneously terrified, and laughing, and horny, and intrigued, but not happy. On weekdays i go to class and do homework struggling to mantain attention with any one task throughout the day. I’ve been stoned since 2024. I have a 3.95 honors college gpa. i study painting, photo/video, writing, philosophy, art history, and sociology. I deejay, and I work at a coffee shop. I try so hard in all of my endeavors. I want to be an artist i am an artist but i want to be a great one. I don’t think there’s anything else i feel any sense of purpose in doing. Making art has been the only way for me to express my silent psychology for a long time. Long before anyone knew my, art was queer and served complete escapism.

The reason I still want to die: I don’t think i will ever be able to successfully navigate a career out of my art. I tell relatives over thanksgiving i’d like to be a professor but to be perfectly honest the art professors i’ve met don’t live a lifestyle i’m necessarily envious of. Can’t escape bureaucracy i guess, that’s what makes so much so awful. I make art envisioning a future literally hundreds of thousands of years after the fall of humanity when earth can once again flourish now harnessing the power of the technology we left behind. That’s where my brain can find peace, because as long as i can access information i find new reasons to be angry at the social order which is violently crushing so many of the innocent people of earth. I see imperial violence and revenge porn and ai gooning accounts and i think of my permanent doom to wanting to be a girl but being terrified of that. It all swarms around my mind constantly, the future, the past, infused with constant class schedule stress, job stress. It’s to the point where i think im only really having 1 1/2 meals a day out of a lack of energy to purchase or prepare that meal. I’d rather just rot. I’m 6 ft and I’ve been 150 lbs give or take 5 since the 8th grade, i don’t know if i’m supposed to be this skinny or if im starving and thats why im so fucked up. But i binge when the snacks are around.

I’m saying a lot, i guess it has been somewhat helpful. But tonight, when i was sitting alone in the bar i just deejayed in, and watching as all of these people i’ve spoken to and gotten to know in my city through the music scene enjoyed themselves i became hollow. this same thing has played out at many shows where i just feel like people run out of reasons to talk to me at all. My grandma is on 2 ssris and a beta blocker, so maybe i should think about meds, but all the mental healthcare i’ve received in my life has felt…subpar? That seems rude but i have legitimate concerns for the recent therapist i had. It’s made me not want to try again. I also have so many cavities that alone makes me want to die.

I also think i might have broken up with someone i really love because all of this suicidal anxiety was multiplied by the idea of picturing a future with someone.",1,1766910106.0,depression,0,1.0,False

My autistic side just unmasked as I treat my ADHD. I realized I had become very logical and started to tell myself that I am literally in a religion that discriminates against gay people and trans people. Also, nothing is more misogynistic than this religion, where we have prophets marry 57 wives, and women are subservient to men. As an autistic person, I am very literal and empathetic. I also love humans regardless of their differences. I realized that this church has a way of telling you they love you, but they will never accept you for being gay. They are sly and believe in obeying blindly. I started to see the church for what it truly is. Control. Yes, they make you feel like you have free will. No one teaches about free will more than the Mormons, but still they have the most ridiculous amount of rules. Please don't blame me for just realizing I joined the church at 18. It was during a time when I was most vulnerable and depressed. I joined it. All I have to do is be more autistic to see the truth. Oh, and I just watched the temple ritual video and jumped at the “death oath” chant and gesture. The “death oath” chant and gesture are so cultish, yikes, yikes, yikes yikes I have never used the F word before but FUCK the Mormon church unmasking my austism actually saved me i have watched the Same “death oath” leaked video and saw it as hmm it is just symbolism but now my brain is like fuck what that actual fuck that in the Mormon fuck the I just watch i get my self into. Glad i not going to be getting taxed 55% of my income   With 10% going to the most successful multibillionaire cult in the ward my austism makes me cringe everytime i think I actually joined a FUCKING Mormon FUCKING cult cannot imagine how damaging will be to commit to this bull shot and have some old fucking men from Utah dictate what i can't or i can not do yikes nah i have fucking Grandpa at home that i can listen to oh sorry he is actually dead. What should my being my deepest shade of red flag is those awkwardly cute Utah teenage missionaries who tell you this book have changed that life and It iS tHE BoOk tHat wiLl ChaNgE My LiFe Cuz iT ChaNge theirs should have been my first cue to run those missionaries are very robotic and socially awkward that even as an active member i vowed never to go to Utah cuz i feel like everyone one the Utah people i have met here in Canada are very awkward and ask the most embarrassing questions i notice other Americans as not as socially awkward as them but just dismissed it.  Fuck those
Fucking awkwardness should have been my first cue to run. Yikes I can fucking imagine living in Utah it does feel like a real place yikes. 

I probably will fucking have a coffee tomorrow morning then start planning on how to leave cuz i have a sense it will be Fucking hard to leave the cult than it
It was easy to fucking join. I apologize for using the fucking “fuck” words excessively it is my first time ever using it and i am having way too much fun with their shit word. 

What i have learnt from this cult is the only religion worth following is nothing just treat humans with decency anything that does not serve human or gay people does not worth your time. Glad i got out of the fucking cult. I am done with every fucking   Religion.  Fuck religion and cheers to be a normal human who values humans over some highly controlling religion.

1pxm93e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pxm93e/a_girl_and_i_recieved_anonymous_emails_signing/,"A girl and I recieved ""anonymous"" emails signing off as the other; it's messing with my head.","**Background:** I asked out a girl (""S"") from college. Over the span of a month, we went out for coffee, to brunch, and to lunch. Each outing extended several hours past what we planned (coffee → dinner, brunch → a 3+ hour stroll, etc.) She even invited me to her birthday dinner, which was a relatively small/intimate event. 

Shortly into winter break, I recieve a phone call from a mutual (""M""), who informed me that ""S"" confided in him that she didn't like me, that I made her uncomfortable, and that she wished I would stop asking her out.

That evening, I called ""S"" directly. She denied what ""M"" said. She did, however, confess that she wasn't ready for a romantic relationship (at the moment) due to personal reasons, but that she'd love to remain friends, and would initiate herself if/when she was ready.

I took her at her word, and we even had a \~2 hour call the next night. 

**The Troubles:** A few days later, I got an email from a strange (@gmail.com) account, claiming to be ""S"". The gist of the message was that she wasn't interested or comfortable around me, and that she would 1. like space, and 2. prefer no-contact. 

This really, really distressed me. I sent her a text asking if she did indeed send that email. She denied it. After I forwarded her the mail, she said that she recieved a near-identical one claiming to be *me* (she forwarded the mail to me, so I know it exists). ""My"" mail said that I wasn't interested in her romantically, and that I also wanted her to leave me alone.

I called her that night to confer, and sort of laughed it off. I assumed it might be ""M,"" or one of ""S'"" friends playing a prank, but was unable to shake my fear that it was ""S"" herself.

Earlier this week, she added me and ""M"" to a groupchat, and said that she was escalating this situation to the college deans since she was impersonated via mail. I spoke to her later that same day, and she confessed that (due to overthinking habits because of mental health), she was unable to shake suspicion off of either ""M"" or I.

She had a call with ""M"" the next day (who has since blocked me, since I spoke to ""S"" about our \[confidential?\] call), and ""S"" has been dodging my request for a call to clear things up since. 

I don't know if it was her, ""M,"" or someone else who sent those emails, but nothing makes sense. This has crossed the line from amusing to bizarre/creepy.   
  
**How I feel**: I'm happy to cooperate with any investigtion/escalation, but I feel so anxious being ""out of the loop,"" especially now that the deans are getting involved. 

I feel like everyone (""S"" and ""M"") has more information than me. What's messing with my mind is the uncertainty of how she truly feels, if she's actually willing to remain friends, and if she genuinely believes I sent those emails.
