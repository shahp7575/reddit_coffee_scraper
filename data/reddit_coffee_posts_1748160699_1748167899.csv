1kuz554,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mid_Century/comments/1kuz554/fun_story_about_finding_some_mid_century_furniture/,Fun story about finding some mid Century furniture.,"I'm a picker and go to 5-8 2nd hand stores daily. I like metals- worked in a machine shop and as a jeweler. One day, years ago, I went into a small shop in Boston. There was a pile of furniture in the far corner. Literally, all piled on top of each other. Multiple metal tables, chairs, outdoor and indoor furniture. There were three different sets. I went up to the greenish furniture with my loupe and looked closely at a scratch in the metal. The scratch revealed the bronze metal. The other pieces were obviously aluminum.

I asked the manager 'How much?' He said a grand. $1000 US. Sure, I'll take it. I figured I could scrap it and get my money back if I screwed up. I paid and could only manage to get 2 chairs in my vehicle. I told him I'd rent a van and be back for the rest tomorrow. I took the chairs home and sent some photos to a friend who knows this era. He immediately wrote back that I'd found the cream of the crop. A set of Dan Johnson Gazelle in Bronze (5' table, 4 chairs), a pair of bronze gargoyle tables and an Italian outdoor set from the same era in heavy, cast aluminum. Everything was in as-found shape. The cane seats were trashed, no cushions on the aluminum set. Rough. I found out that there were 8 five-foot tables known and here I had the 9th jamming up my front room in my house (my wife was not too happy!). The glass was in great shape and was about an inch thick. Same thick glass for the two round tables. I found out later that the shop sold the coffee table from the set separately. I missed it by a day or two. 

From Boston, I called Richard Wright in Chicago, and he sent a truck. The pieces did well. It was during the crash of 2008 but they still did close to $40,000. Wright did a terrific job of replacing the cane seats and making the sets look great. 

I've had other great hits, but none compared to this!

1kuz4yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1kuz4yo/finally_stopped_failing_at_habits_after_12_years/,Finally Stopped Failing at Habits After 12 Years of BS Advice. Here's What Actually Works.,"**I've wasted more money on habit apps than some people spend on rent.**

Notion templates, fancy journals, morning routine courses, productivity masterclasses. I've tried systems with color coding that would make a kindergarten teacher jealous.

All of it failed. Every single approach.

Then I accidentally discovered why.

Most habit advice treats you like a robot that just needs better programming. Download this app, follow this 47 step morning routine, track 15 different metrics.

**Complete garbage.**

Your brain doesn't work like a computer. It works like a lazy employee who will find any excuse to avoid work.

After 12 years of failure and probably $3,000 in apps and courses, here's what actually changed my life.

**The 48 Hour Reset Rule:** Never let two full days pass without doing your habit. I don't care if you do it perfectly. I don't care if you do it for 30 seconds. Just don't let 48 hours go by.

This single rule saved more habits than every tracking app combined.

**Decision Fatigue is Your Enemy:** I prepare tomorrow tonight. Workout clothes laid out. Lunch prepped. Book opened to the right page. Coffee machine ready to go.

Small decisions drain your willpower faster than big ones. Eliminate them ruthlessly.

**The Momentum Hack:** Start with exactly 2 minutes of any hard task. Not 5 minutes. Not 10 minutes. Two minutes.

Your brain can't build resistance to 2 minutes. Once you start, momentum usually carries you forward. But you're only committed to 120 seconds.

**Habit Anchoring:** Attach new habits to things you already do automatically. I stretch while my coffee brews. I review my goals while brushing teeth. I read while eating lunch.

Don't create new time slots. Hijack existing ones.

**Sunday Reset Protocol:** Every Sunday evening, I spend 15 minutes asking two questions. What worked this week? What didn't?

Then I adjust exactly one thing for the next week. Not five things. One thing.

# Why This Works When Everything Else Doesn't

**It's designed for humans, not productivity robots.**

You will have bad days. You will feel unmotivated. You will want to quit. This system expects that and works around it instead of pretending you'll be perfect.

**It focuses on systems, not outcomes.**

I don't track how many pages I read. I track whether I picked up the book. I don't measure workout intensity. I measure whether I put on gym clothes.

Systems you can control. Outcomes you can't.

# My Results After 8 Months.

**Before** I couldn't  even maintain any habit for more than 2 weeks **After** 6 solid habits running automatically without willpower

I now exercise 6x per week, read daily, meal prep on Sundays, journal every morning, learn Spanish 10 minutes daily, clean as I go throughout the day.

I stopped trying to be disciplined and started trying to be consistent.

**Motivation is not the problem. Systems are the problem.**

You have enough motivation. You don't have systems that work when motivation disappears.

**Perfection is the enemy of progress.**

A mediocre habit you do consistently beats a perfect habit you do sporadically.

**Environment beats willpower every time.**

Change your environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder.

1kuz3jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kuz3jb/aio_for_wanting_my_feelings_to_be_heard/,AIO for wanting my feelings to be heard,"So I have a friend, we are one on one friends meaning we don't really have any mutual friends. My best friend used to be friends with them but they grew apart with distance. They lived in the same city, and when they were friends (a couple years ago) would hang out a lot but only he would initiate hangouts. I care about him a lot and I enjoy spending time with him, and he has voiced the same to me, but we have had our misunderstandings in the past. I moved cities a few years ago but try to visit monthly even though I live far. Some essential context is that he and I first met online through social media, so I hadn't known him when I still lived in that city. He asked me to grab a coffee sometime when I was around and so I did and it was fun. We hung out every month after that for about 5 months but every other time it was only me asking and he would either say he was busy or just be really difficult to make plans with because he would be so wishy washy. The last time we hung out, I jokingly said that it was difficult to make plans with him because he wouldn't ever give me a specific time or anything and he said ""it's just lunch, you know, it's not like you came to visit this city for me, you came to go to a concert."" It was true that I had gone to the city for a concert, however, I had wanted to spend time with him, I have a lot of other people I could've asked to hang out with but I wanted to see him, you know??And like I am traveling a really long distance, it doesn't matter if there was a concert because I've come to the city just to spend time with people before and he has behaved the same, there's never been a priority in why I am coming and all my other friends have always been at least trying to make time for me. It's been three months since we last hung out but we still text jokes back and forth almost everyday and I have been asking to hang out over those last three months, to which he says yeah, I'll let you know. And then he proceeds to never let me know. I ask him when his exams are over so we can hang out then and he tells me end of this month and so I wait until the end of the month and ask him again and he says that after his exams, he's going back home so he can't. This upset me a bit but I know he has exams and he's probably exhausted and I don't think he's lying with anything he is saying but he keeps on saying later and then never following through, so I sent him a message saying that that is fine but it's really hard to make plans with him, and that I get he has been having a heavy workload but it just feels sucky sometimes. He responded to this saying he wishes his sucky exams were over. And I felt like he had just completely dismissed how I was feeling and avoided even broaching the subject. I sent him a message telling him that it made me feel sucky and detailed how I prefer hanging out over just texting and how it feels embarrassing how many times I ask to hang out only to be left hanging with a vague answer or an I'm busy because it is only ever me asking, and that I do understand that he is really busy but it just makes me feel awful sometimes. I really don't know if how I behaved was an overreaction because he does have exams right now but him completely ignoring me trying to just slightly explain how it makes me feel just made me so upset. I feel like the dynamics I have with him versus my friend who he used to be friends with, are different - for example, he spent a lot of time with them in person but rarely texted. Whereas we text, semi often but I wouldn't say very often, and we live far apart, but if he had wanted to hang out with me, I would've tried to make time and it just doesn't feel like he would do the same for me and the friendship feels so one sided but I can't tell if that's just my own insecurities or the actuality of the situation. 

In conclusion, I'm just really unsure if how I approached the situation after was an overreaction or not given the circumstances. I'm also going through exam season but I just felt like it had reached a point where I had to voice it clearly but now it is stressing me out.",1,1748167662.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

The first - Corsearch is the mother, and the other two are peripheral companies. It is the oldest and has been known as a trademark company for decades. In recent years, it has offered a number of AI-based tools that are definitely beneficial to their clients. But these tools are not only accessible to ""brand owners"", but also to those who pretend to be such, without being checked whether they have the rights in question. Corsearch knows very well that this is not very legal, and that is why they use the other two companies to remove content from various online platforms. This is not only about commercial platforms, but also about posts on social media. You can relatively easily use their tools and remove content on a competitor's commercial platform. Or content from a person you don't like on a social media platform.

Online platforms have clear rules related to ""brand ownership"". No matter whether they are commercial or social, no matter whether they are American, European or Chinese, they accept as pure truth the actions of companies or ordinary people who claim to be the owners of a given brand, or its representatives. The platforms themselves do not verify the veracity of the claims of the companies and people in question that they are the owners or representatives of a given brand. And they prefer to remove the content without much question. This is contrary to all the rules of free trade in the US or the EU. For example. Or it violates the freedom of speech, which is the foundation of the existence of the US or the EU. Content related to ""brand ownership"" is not restored in any commercial or social media. You are never given the right to defend yourself if you are attacked by a company or person claiming to own a brand.

A year or two ago, Tesla filed lawsuits against hundreds of accessory sellers because their products were damaging the brand's image. A huge amount of truthful jargon was invented to get ordinary people into the courtroom. And to be sentenced to mind-boggling financial sums. I was amazed by this move by the Tesla owners. A technology giant, an innovator in technology, stared at a coffee cup with the Tesla logo. I couldn't realize how far corporate thinking could go. I couldn't realize how these people didn't see the free advertising they were getting while someone was sipping coffee from a cup with the Tesla logo. And I think about Tesla cars, the technologies in them, the innovations in them, the idea of ​​change. Change captivated the world in 2012 - 2014. And the pandemic and destructive behavior of consumers in 2025. How many steps does it take in 10 years to fall from the top to the bottom of general consumer thinking. People started making cars in 2012 with the idea of ​​offering a unique product to the market, could they have imagined that in just 10 years, corporate thinking, the hysterical desire for every cent of profit, would lead to the absurdity of paying super expensive lawyers to physically remove free advertising materials of the Tesla product and technology. The market and consumers will determine the future of the Tesla case right now. But Tesla owners will have to pay a lot of money to change the public or personal opinion of someone who could drink coffee every day from a cup with the Tesla logo.

Over the past 10 years, many manufacturers have begun to devote enormous intellectual and financial resources to preserving the name and ownership of their brand. Corporate thinking, the desire for maximum profits, has become entrenched in all the boards of directors of all large companies around the world. No one looks into the more distant future of a given company. This fact is skillfully used by various law firms and they easily impose the opinion that a brand protection policy must be implemented at all costs. And many companies have forgotten what they produce, what their history is and what their future is becoming. In China, they produced copies of famous brands. Some time ago. But that time is over. China produces competitive cars, power tools, technology, shoes, clothes and what not. They focused on the product, not the brand. And the market appreciates it. In Temu, there are significantly better quality clothes, at significantly cheaper prices than many famous brands of clothing manufacturers. Chinese cars are sprouting like mushrooms after rain in the forest. And some of them are better than the famous and traditional car brands. But in Chinese goods, there is no focus on brand image, there is a focus on the product. And this changes the market.

The Chinese are dominant in the market. And they have been at the beginning of their dominance for a very long time. Because for them it doesn't matter what the product is called. It doesn't matter what the name is. It is important for them to offer the market the best price-quality ratio of a given product. No matter if it is a car, a phone, a garment, a shoe or technology.

President Trump and some other politicians around the world have some very pure and beautiful ambitions for a restart of production. I am fascinated by their sincerity. But are the manufacturers, the owners of the companies and brands ready for this restart? Do they deserve it? Will the market accept this restart? I don't think so. The market has changed, but the consumers have not changed in it. Consumers have had the same consumer mindset for centuries. The consumer first looks at the product and then the brand name. The consumer always determines whether he will buy Adidas, Nike, Puma sneakers, not the brand name, but because of the quality or the vision. And when the consumer does not find what he is looking for, he will look at other products. That is why new players appear on the market, new brands, new visions and technologies. Which takes and will take away the market share of the old players on the market. The brands PUMA, Adidas, Nike will not retain the market share of the manufacturers. Because brands like Under Armour or Joma (and many other similar new brands) are accumulating fans, an image and a history that is already equal to the three brands listed. What do the three brands in question do? They guard their territory, they guard against replicas of their logo that would ruin their reputation. And they tolerate any kind of free advertising that is not a copy of the products they produce.

In the USA, Europe and all countries around the world there are institutions that take care of consumers and markets. Even the clumsy European commissions, even the clumsy European Commission for Consumer Protection, are effective enough, like the various state and federal analogous structures in the USA. If they are properly informed about the problems that have arisen.

They must be informed constantly and about everything.

Because we are not just users on a social platform or a trader in the online space. We are one with the manufacturers of various goods and the owners of various different brands. We work in their factories, we sell their goods, we use their goods. And to maintain these positions, we ourselves must change the thinking of the owners of various brands. Let's remind them that they produce goods, and are not just owners of a name. Which they must protect at all costs and from all kinds of things.

Personal opinion:

There is a need for law firms that must protect products from counterfeiting. No matter whether it is a garment, bag, shoe, technology, phone, car or spare part for a car. For our good and for our safety. All social and commercial platforms have the right to remove any type of content. For our good and for our safety.

But there must be control over who and why is presenting themselves as the owner or representative of a particular brand. Because the lack of this control has led to complete anarchy in the online space. Cleaning up personal accounts on social networks, eliminating competitors in online commerce, has become a very easy action that remains unpunished.

The market will punish manufacturers who forgot what they produce and focused on the brand name and its use. Free advertising of the product does not exist, there is brand protection at any cost. The owners of shares of the companies in question will lose a little, but they will move their invested money to other companies. The directors of the companies in question will take their salaries, they will be fired after a while, they will find another job. Law firms will take money for brand protection services performed, they will stop working for a given company, they will find another carp.

The loss will be for the workers, the traders and everyone connected in the chain from the machine in the factory to the shelf in the store or a commercial advertisement on the Internet. We will lose jobs, commercial dividends or consumer experience because we have remained indifferent, today to some irregularities on the Internet ... today .... to a murderous desire to use the brand name, at the expense of the product itself. From people who hysterically want every single cent in the world.

I allow everyone to quote me, to use what I have written, to rewrite it according to their own thinking ..... even if they can and manage to get dividends from what I have written or parts of it. Freedom of speech, freedom of thought, the freedom to choose what to eat, wear, use in everyday life.... makes us ""PEOPLE"".",1,1748167572.0,u_One-Confection-1379,0,1.0,False

New Orleans on Edge as Locals Demand: 'Where is it now?',"https://preview.redd.it/9x8heg4mjw2f1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=f893c230798d43f9850a5793bac90c63158f1f46

Alright, let’s talk about something that’s been sending shivers down spines and lighting up social media feeds, especially here in New Orleans. You know the one, right? The Annabelle doll. The very name is enough to make a lot of people feel a little uneasy, and with good reason, if you believe the stories. But recently, a new wave of panic has swept through the air, thicker than the summer humidity: *is Annabelle missing?*

It all started with whispers, then those whispers turned into shouts across the internet, particularly from folks in Louisiana. The chatter grew louder when news broke about a fire at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana. No injuries, thankfully, but the timing? Well, that’s where things got *really* interesting, and for many, downright terrifying.

# The New Orleans Connection: A City of Shadows and Speculation

New Orleans, as we all know, is a city steeped in history, mystery, and a healthy dose of the supernatural. Ghosts, voodoo, restless spirits — it’s all part of the fabric here. So, when rumors about the Annabelle doll’s alleged disappearance began to circulate, coupled with the Nottoway fire, it hit us a little differently. We’re used to eerie tales, but this felt… *too real* for some.

The Annabelle doll, for those who might not know, is supposedly a Raggedy Ann doll that was deemed “possessed” by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren back in the 1970s. She’s been housed in a special glass case at their Occult Museum in Connecticut ever since, with strict warnings about never moving her. The movies, of course, have only amplified her terrifying reputation, making her a household name in horror circles.

So, when word got out that Annabelle was on a “paranormal tour” — the “Devils on the Run Tour,” no less — and had made a recent stop in our very own New Orleans, people were already on high alert. The idea of this notorious doll, linked to demonic activity, being on the loose in a city already brimming with supernatural energy? It was a recipe for widespread unease.

# The Fire and the Frenzy: Coincidence or Something More?

The fire at Nottoway Plantation was a significant event, a tragic loss of a historical landmark. While officials quickly stated that faulty wiring was the likely cause and dismissed any supernatural connection, the internet, as it often does, had other ideas. “Annabelle was just in Louisiana!” became the rallying cry. “She caused the fire!” people speculated, with a mixture of fear and morbid fascination.

Social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok, exploded with frantic posts. “What do you mean, Annabelle, the doll has gone missing??? WHO THE F\*\*\* LOST HER????” one person tweeted, a sentiment echoed by countless others. Another exclaimed, “THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL?? LIKE?? THE HAUNTED ANNABELLE DOLL?? They take her on a tour around America AND THEN THEY LOOSE HER? BRAH?” The panic was palpable, a digital scream of collective dread.

It felt like a horror movie playing out in real-time. Was the doll truly missing? Had the evil spirit associated with it been unleashed upon the world, starting with a historic fire in Louisiana, and potentially heading our way? The questions hung heavy in the air, fueling a flurry of conspiracy theories. Some even linked it to a prison break in New Orleans around the same time, as if Annabelle was orchestrating a grand scheme of chaos.

# Where is it Now? The Truth, or a Temporary Reprieve?

The fear was real, believe me. I heard folks talking about it on the street, in coffee shops, even in the grocery store. There’s a certain respect for the unknown here, a healthy caution born from centuries of stories. And the idea of Annabelle roaming free? Well, let’s just say it wasn’t a comforting thought.

Thankfully, the frenzy was eventually put to rest, at least for now. Dan Rivera from the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), who is associated with the Warrens’ Occult Museum, stepped forward to address the rumors. He posted a video from *inside* the museum, showing the Annabelle doll safely secured in her glass case. “She/it is NOT lost,” the caption read, a collective sigh of relief audible across the internet. “Annabelle is back home inside the museum in Connecticut… for now.”

So, for those of us in New Orleans and beyond who were starting to feel a chill despite the heat, it seems Annabelle is right where she’s supposed to be. The fires and other incidents? Pure coincidence, according to the authorities. The doll wasn’t responsible, and she certainly wasn’t wandering the streets of our city.

# The Enduring Power of a Haunted Legend

But here’s the thing about a good legend, especially one with a dash of the supernatural: it never truly dies. Even with the debunking, a seed of doubt remains. Why did the rumors spread so fast? Why did so many people instantly believe the worst? Perhaps it’s because deep down, a part of us wants to believe in something beyond the mundane, even if that something is terrifying.

The Annabelle doll, whether you believe in her haunting powers or not, has become a powerful symbol. She represents the unknown, the dark corners of the world that we sometimes glimpse, and the fear of what lurks there. The recent panic in New Orleans, despite its brief nature, showed just how deeply these stories can resonate, especially in a place where the veil between worlds feels a little thinner.

And while Annabelle may be back in her glass case in Connecticut, the question “Where is it now?” will undoubtedly surface again the next time something unexplained happens, especially if she ever goes on tour again. Because when it comes to haunted dolls and ancient cities, some fears are simply too ingrained to ever truly vanish. And maybe, just maybe, that’s part of the enduring allure of it all.",1,1748167563.0,u_ImpossibleFreedom503,0,1.0,False

I've read about this thing called 'bystander apathy,' and it's really interesting. It's like the more people around, the less likely anyone is to step in and help. Maybe it's because we all assume someone else will do it, or we're just not sure if help is welcome? It's a bit strange tho, especially when it seems so minor, like just picking up some papers. 

Makes me think about how we function in groups, and how our individual instincts kinda get overridden by this group mentality.

One day I was watching a funny movie

Man, I tell you it was absurd as hell

It was filled with such a dark comedy

But now it's showing up on my TV



\[Verse 2\]

You see, it's not the movie I fear,

Especially since I'm paying attention,

You can't trust all the news that you hear,

These days you need to be a seer.



\[Chorus 1\]

I tell you, I loved Idiocracy,

As funny a movie I'd ever enjoyed

Then something terrifying came to me

It wasn't meant to be a documentary



\[Chorus 2\]

We're living in an idiocracy!

That much I understand.

But it's plain for those with eyes to see,

We're trapped inside this absurd comedy.



\[Verse 3\]

If you wonder what the future will bring,

Then you need to watch this movie,

How can you stand the winter's cold,

When all your Carl's Jr. stock's been sold?



\[Verse 4\]

Soon, we'll give plants Brawndo — it’s what they’re craving,

And going to Starbuck, spending 50 bucks, but not on coffee,

And watching Ouch! My Balls! while 'batin',

You understand what I'm sayin'?



\[Bridge\]

It's scary how close we're getting

To the world in that setting

Soon enough we're going to be seeing

The opening of Costco University



\[Chorus 1 — Repeated\]

I tell you, I loved Idiocracy,

As funny a movie I'd ever enjoyed

Then something terrifying came to me

The glass door to the tower swings open automatically for me. The doorman greets me and gives me a slight smile—I think I caught a faint wink. I'm wearing a dark suit. He wears a security uniform. A tall blonde with her hair tightly pulled into a bun, wearing a business suit, looks at me with a mix of fascination and disgust. Disgust wins out. I briefly hold my ID to the reader and the glass barrier parts with a confirming beep. The elevator awaits me. Two colleagues are already leaning against the side walls. Even though they look prematurely aged, there’s something boyish and soft, unmanly about them. I catch the usual garbage of small talk and corporate chatter.

I despise people like you. You've removed yourselves from God and nature. The way of corporate living has made them age early, but it hasn’t matured them. Their wrinkled baby faces disgust me.

When they see me, they shut their mouths and just stare. In the mirror, I see a not-so-bad-looking guy. The dark suit matches almost perfectly with the blue shiner circling his left eye. He’s grinning, revealing a gap in his front teeth. The suit fits perfectly. I keep grinning and run my tongue through the unfamiliar gap, which still tastes faintly of blood.

I’m called into the boss’s office. Someone told that bastard what I look like. What are you sons of bitches going to do? Fire me? I walk the hallways. To my left and right, wage slaves sit in their cubicles. I can feel their eyes on me. The gods look down upon me and they love me.

There is nothing more dehumanizing than the modern workplace. The modern workplace is torture. You are held like a slave in a cubicle under artificial light, in front of a screen projecting artificial light onto your pale face. The walls are plastic, the desk is plastic. The noise of printers and phones is constant. This cacophony is a form of anti-music, meant to eat away at more of your soul. You drown it out with more noise from your headphones while writing meaningless texts. You hear words and write other words—all words lose meaning. You are as far from nature as no living creature should ever be.

You make PowerPoint presentations or work on Excel sheets. Whatever you’re working on—it’s meaningless. Listen to me, Anon. You do meaningless work. Nothing you do has the slightest impact on anything.

I once read somewhere—I think it was Solzhenitsyn, though maybe I’m remembering it wrong, but fuck it, because it’s true, and if I made it up, then I’m better than Solzhenitsyn. I read that in the Gulag, prisoners had to build a railroad. Of course, they were poorly fed and pushed to their limits. But he writes that the worst thing that could happen to them was when the leadership decided the track wasn’t needed. They were made to build the railway during the day, only to tear it down at night. Nothing, he writes, crushed him more. Humans can endure extreme physical hardship if they believe they’re suffering for a purpose. The greatest punishment is robbing a person of their sense of meaning.

Sabine from Finance wants you to tweak the colors on the PowerPoint to make it pop more. The content isn’t that important. The railway just got torn down again. Sabine probably hasn’t been fucked in five years—you should probably take care of that with the printed and rolled-up PowerPoint deck. Everything you do will never matter to anyone with actual decision-making power. And should it ever reach someone who does, they won’t give a fuck about what Sabine has to say. I bet you, Anon—if you did nothing all day, the world would be no different. Worse—if you had done the *opposite*of what you did, the world would be no different.

Your work is part of a cult. The cult demands that you give yourself up. That you sell your soul and time to it. That you go through its empty rituals ten waking hours a day, six days a week. Another eight hours a week are lost just commuting to your place of humiliation. All so you can collapse into bed at night. Weekends are too short to recover. So you might as well spend them drinking or partying.

You may wear the ceremonial robe. You may enjoy the perks of the clerics—five-star hotels, business class, maybe even the occasional escort and coke. The gods are no longer watching over me. They’ve abandoned me. They hate me—or worse—they’ve forgotten me.

I step into the boss’s office. Without saying a word, I leap onto the desk and slide across its polished mahogany surface on my knees. I see myself in slow motion gliding toward him. I grab his tie, yank it, and punch him in the face. I get the feeling my boss will show up to work tomorrow regardless. Entering the large entrance hall with a smile on his face. The gods are looking down at me. They love me.



**This is my warning to you, Anon. Under no circumstances should you do any of the following—or even think about them. All of them would drastically reduce your employer's productivity. Most of them don’t even require much effort.**

1. Absolutely do *not* become a servant to two masters. Whenever one boss asks why you couldn’t do something, tell him you had to do something for the other boss. Always stay as vague as possible, so he can’t estimate your actual workload. Ideally, you serve more than two masters, though there’s probably a break-even point. This setup must definitely be avoided.
2. Under no circumstances should you commit time theft. Time theft is the worst thing you can do to your company. It’s not just that you don’t work—you get paid *not* to work. But remember, Anon, if your work is meaningless, then you can’t actually steal time. So here’s what you should *never* do: When you get to work in the morning, immediately head to the bathroom. No—of course not right away. First, go to the coffee machine. If your company has a conference area, head there. Grab the good coffee reserved for guests—it’s often way better than the stuff they give employees. While you're at it, snag a few bottles of drinks. I mean, *don’t* do that. Then definitely *don’t* go to the bathroom and spend the first two hours of your day there. If you get bored, absolutely *don’t* jerk off there.
3. Find hidden corners and unused cabinets. Definitely don’t hide eggs in those places.
4. It might happen that companies need to shut down due to outbreaks of diarrhea. Under no circumstances should you put laxatives in food or coffee. A business might have to close for days or even weeks because of that.
5. Travel expenses. Travel expenses are extremely vulnerable to fraud. Especially in large corporations, controls are often lax. That’s why you must be absolutely diligent with all receipts. If you ever lose one, know, Anon, that you are entitled to write your own replacement receipts.
6. Call meetings. For every little thing. There’s nothing narcissists love more than being asked their opinion on stuff that doesn’t concern them—and believe me, there are more than enough of those in your company. Insist that Sabine be invited so she can comment on the colors of the PowerPoint graphs. For every bullet point in your presentation, there’s an expert in your company. Tell your boss you still need to check with this or that expert from the meeting. That makes you seem super thorough and delegates much of your work to people who like to speak in meetings but don’t actually want to do the work. The whole project drags out, and none of it is your fault.

1kuyykx,https://www.reddit.com/r/costochondritis/comments/1kuyykx/progressivesuccess_story/,Progressive/Success Story,"Hi everyone, I’m sharing my story hoping that it may help others. This condition sucks and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

MY STORY: 
I’ve been going through Tietze Syndrone (rare costo) for about 5 months. Had my first flare up December 2024. The standard anxiety, heart palpitations, can take a deep breath. Went to the ER and got the same treatment as you and racked up thousands🤑. After research, I realized my symptoms aligned with Costochrondritis, but particularly Tietze Syndrone. My frozen rib joint is in my left lower back below my shoulder blade. With Tietze, you have multiple ribs impacted, not just one rib. I started poking around (literally poking) and found where my ribs hurt. 1.) Upper left rib under my chest (T8 & T7) 2.) Lower left rib 3.) Upper right rib I also get some pain on my lower left side. I have swelling there from inflammation right under my left chest and a swollen knot on my upper left chest corner near my underpit (this is how I knew it was costo). My fiancé was also going through the same thing, but she has regular Costo located on the right side.

WHAT I DID TO FIX MY SITUATION: 
We started going to a Chiropractor in February twice a week. After a month, we went down to once a week. I purchased the backpod on Amazon. I changed my diet and reduced my sodium intake to less than 2,000 mg a day. I drink decaf coffee now because caffeine triggers the heart palpitations. I drank more water and ate more fruit and vegetables. I got on the treadmill and started walking a mile a day (2-speed pace walk). I do yoga stretches after the walk and stretch out that swelling in my upper left chest by utilizing the door frame stretch (very important). You have to make sure you are stretching every moment you get time. And use the backpod 1-2 mins a time, 3 times a day. Your back joint is like a rusty hinge on a door. Using the backpod is like adding oil, but stretching it back and forward is what fixes the door hinge. Be mindful of your workout. Don’t push yourself too hard because your muscles can contract and cause strain on the costo area.

CONCLUSION: 
My chiropractor journey has been up and down. I’ve had flare ups when it rained to hard, I was sweeping to hard, grabbing, or pulling things to heavy. But I haven’t given up, and my progress has gotten to where I’m at least 90% normal.

After 5 months I finally told my chiropractor I don’t need to come once a week. I am now going twice a month. I can actually lift weights again, but I know my body is healing. So it best not to go too hard. Breathing is normal. Can’t take a super deep breath yet, but I’ve made a lot of progress from where I started. 
You have to feel your body and understand it’s trying to heal, but your injury is internal. IT TAKES TIME. If you want to conquer this issue, you have to get serious like I did and make a drastic change. Otherwise you’ll be miserable forever. I’m not a gym bro, I am highly introverted. If I can do this, I know anyone can!",1,1748167134.0,costochondritis,0,1.0,False

Now feeling lost,"Bit of a ramble here, but I figured this might be the place. I’m 50, retired just over a year ago after spending most of my adult life in investment banking. It was the usual grind -  long hours, constant pressure, always chasing the next deal. I told myself I’d feel free once I stepped away. And for a little while, I did.

But lately… I don’t know. The novelty of sleeping in wore off. My friends are either still working crazy hours or scattered across the world. My kids are grown and busy with their own lives. My wife’s still working full-time - she enjoys what she does and she’s younger than me, so that makes sense - but it does mean I spend a lot of time alone.

Most days I’m just drifting between coffee shops, reading articles I’ll forget by dinner, and going on long solo walks while everyone else is at work.

I’m not trying to complain - I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways - but I didn’t expect to feel so... adrift. There’s this weird quietness that’s settled in. I stepped off a moving train and everything’s still, but not in a peaceful way.

So I guess I’m just wondering - are there any communities out there for folks like me? Retired a bit early, figuring out what this next chapter is meant to be, and looking to find some sense of purpose or connection again. Doesn’t have to be anything deep - just somewhere to talk, maybe laugh, maybe get involved with something that actually matters.

Would really appreciate any ideas.

1kuyxy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDPH/comments/1kuyxy5/how_to_get_diagnosed_for_adhd/,How to get diagnosed for ADHD,"Hi! As the title says, I'm wondering what the process is like to get diagnosed for ADHD? And where (within Metro Manila)? If online, how does that work? How much will it cost? How many sessions will it take? I don't know a single thing about how to get evaluated for this so any info would help! 

Some background info: I'm currently 25yo and a freelancer. I don't earn much so I'm hoping it won't cost masyado huhu. I have a strong hunch that I have ADHD due to my everyday experience with executive dysfunction. It's mostly manageable naman, but there are certain points where I become heavily frustrated with myself to the point of even breaking down, especially during my college years. I've also become very irresponsible/impulsive with my spending (I have these weird quirks that I have to drink a certain type of coffee to get focused, or I have to get new equipment to get motivated to do something, or just for that quick serotonin/dopamine boost). There are many days I would just lie in bed and do nothing and beat myself up for not being able to be productive. It's really affecting my everyday life.  
  
I passed school with good grades, so my family didn't fully believe I might have it until I finally broke down during college. I've done a lot of research and I seem to check out all the boxes for the inattentive type, but I still have this fear of what if I'm just lazy and dumb? I want to get it over with and get properly evaluated. And kung may medication that I can get, even better! But I doubt I could afford it, so I'm moreso hoping to get diagnosed lang. 

Another thing to note is that I have heavy social anxiety, so I'm actually still hesitant to even get diagnosed because it requires *talking* to someone 😅I'm mostly afraid of possibly being dismissed or invalidated. Would love to hear other people's experiences and tips just so I can get the courage to go through with it!

1kuyw4r,https://i.redd.it/a1i8qqd2gw2f1.jpeg,Pentaton is the audio player for digital purists,"Hey everyone, we’ve been hard at working developing our audio player focusing on rendering quality, speed and playback experience. 

# Audio Quality

We’re big Hifi nerds and have been collecting music for three decades in many different formats. We wanted an app that could play them all. Pentaton supports virtually all formats and codecs, including FLAC, WavPack and DSD (over PCM). You can connect an external DAC if you prefer high-resolution audio or stream via AirPlay 1/2 and still get lossless quality. We are also deliberate about what we don’t support: Pentaton has no crossfade, equalizer or automatic leveling as we’re committed to delivering unaltered, bit-perfect audio.

# Speed

Pentaton utilizes hardware to the maximum. Browsing your library is blazing fast (just a couple of milliseconds), and even scanning thousands of tracks takes just a second or two. Audio decoding and playback uses less than a single percent of processing power for most formats, and our animations are implemented using iOS’s lowest-level APIs so they are are virtually undetectable. This allows for the longest possible playback time when on the go.

# Playback Experience

Many players lock you in using a proprietary database to manage your music library. Not Pentaton though! We rely only on files and folders allowing you to organize everything just the way you want. Pentaton’s interface on iPhones and iPads is tailored for navigating your library smoothly, no matter how deep it is.

We’re offering a 30 day trial to check [Pentaton](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pentaton-for-digital-purists/id6711346182) out. Any feedback would be very much appreciated!",0,1748166836.0,iosapps,1,0.5,False

I never thought I'd still be working the graveyard shift at Buc-ee's on Highway 35, thirty miles south of Austin. My name's Marcus, and I've been manning this particular outpost for three years now. The massive travel center sits like a neon beacon in the darkness, drawing every kind of traveler you can imagine across the Texas landscape.

During daylight hours, families pile out of minivans loaded with coolers and kids, grabbing the famous brisket sandwiches and those overpriced beaver nuggets. But nights? That's when you meet the real Texas. Long-haul truckers pulling double trailers filled with everything from cattle to computer parts. Ranch hands driving dusty F-250s with livestock trailers, heading to auction in San Antonio. Weekend warriors in lifted Chevy Silverados, their beds stuffed with camping gear and beer coolers.

There's old Miguel, who stops every Tuesday around 2 AM in his weathered Ford pickup, buying the same exact items: two energy drinks, a bag of beef jerky, and a pack of Marlboro Reds. He tips his hat but never speaks, just nods and disappears back onto the highway. Then there's Sarah, a trucker from Minnesota who hauls frozen foods down to Mexico. She's got a mouth like a sailor and tells the best road stories I've ever heard while she waits for her logbook hours to reset.

The strangest regular is probably Tommy Chen, who drives an immaculate 1979 Peterbilt with hand-painted flames down the sides. He claims he's been driving these highways since before I was born, which would make him impossibly old based on how young he looks. Tommy only stops during the deepest part of night, always buys exactly thirteen items, and pays in cash that looks like it's fresh from the mint.

But last Thursday, something different rolled into our lot. I was restocking the coffee station around 3:30 AM when headlights swept across the windows in an odd pattern – not the usual steady approach of a truck or car. This vehicle seemed to pause, then advance, pause again, like it was.. considering.

A massive black pickup truck finally parked under the far edge of our lighting. Not black like most trucks you see on the road, but black like the space between stars. The kind of black that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. No license plate visible from where I stood. No mud, no road dust, no scratches – unusual for any vehicle that's spent time on Texas highways.

The driver sat motionless for nearly ten minutes. Through the tinted windshield, I could make out only the outline of someone wearing what looked like a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. No movement, no engine noise after parking. Just stillness.

Finally, the door opened with a soft click that somehow carried all the way to the store. The driver emerged slowly, wearing a long coat despite the October heat. What caught my attention wasn't the coat or the hat, though. It was the mask.

A simple white medical mask, the kind everyone wore during covid, but something about it felt wrong. Maybe it was how perfectly clean it looked, or how it seemed to catch the fluorescent light in a way that made it almost glow. The driver – I couldn't tell if it was a man or woman – walked with measured steps toward the entrance, never looking left or right, never acknowledging the security cameras.

I pretended to be busy with inventory as they entered. The automatic doors chimed their usual welcome, but the sound felt flat, muffled somehow. The person moved through the aisles without making any noise – no footsteps on the polished floor, no rustle of clothing. They selected items methodically: a bottle of water, a package of crackers, and a single banana. Nothing else.

At the counter, they placed exact change on the surface without speaking. As I rang up the items, I tried to make eye contact, but the mask and hat cast shadows that seemed deeper than they should.

""Have a good night,"" I said, handing over the receipt.

They tilted their head slightly, like an animal listening to a distant sound, then walked out the same deliberate way they'd entered. The truck started without any engine noise I could hear and pulled away, taillights disappearing into the darkness of Highway 35.

That was five days ago. Since then, my manager Dale handed me a folded piece of paper during shift change. ""Follow these exactly,"" he said, his usual joking demeanor completely absent. ""Some rules for night shift. Don't ask questions.""

I unfolded the paper in the break room. Seven simple rules written in block letters. Rules I'd never heard of despite working here for three years.

Tonight's my first shift following them. It's 11 PM now, and the black truck just pulled into the lot again.

I pulled the folded paper from my pocket, hands trembling slightly. The rules were written in bold, black ink:

RULE 1: Never serve the customer in the white mask after 3:33 AM. RULE 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price. RULE 3: The coffee machine in aisle 3 may drip red liquid between 2-4 AM. Clean immediately. RULE 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors. RULE 5: If you hear whistling from the truck lot, stay inside until it stops. RULE 6: Lock the cooler doors at exactly midnight. Do not open them until 6 AM. RULE 7: If the same customer enters more than once in a single shift, only serve them the first time.

The black truck sat motionless under the flickering security light. Through the window, I could see the driver hadn't moved. Same white mask, same wide-brimmed hat. It was 11:47 PM according to the register clock.

I stuffed the rules back into my pocket and tried to focus on normal tasks. The store felt different tonight – sounds seemed muffled, like someone had wrapped the building in cotton. Even the usual highway traffic noise faded to a distant whisper.

At exactly midnight, I remembered Rule 6. I walked to the cooler section and turned each lock mechanism. The metallic clicks echoed louder than they should have. As I locked the beer cooler, something rattled inside. Something that definitely wasn't bottles.

Back at the counter, I noticed the security monitors. Twelve screens showing different angles of the store and parking lot. Most displayed normally – the bright interior, the scattered cars outside. But Monitor 7, which showed the main entrance, flickered every few seconds. During these flickers, the entrance area appeared different somehow. Older. The floor looked like aged concrete instead of polished tile.

A customer entered at 12:23 AM. Betty Rodriguez, a nurse from the VA hospital in San Antonio. She worked double shifts and always bought the same thing – a large coffee and two energy bars. Normal as could be.

""Hey Marcus,"" she said, yawning. ""Quiet night?""

""Pretty much."" I rang up her items. ""Drive safe out there.""

She headed for the door, then paused. ""That truck out there.. is that guy okay? He's been sitting there for like an hour.""

I glanced at the monitors. The black truck remained in the same position. ""Yeah, he's.. taking a break.""

Betty shrugged and left. Through the window, I watched her walk to her Honda Pilot, right past the black truck. She didn't even glance at it, like it wasn't there.

At 1:15 AM, Tommy Chen pulled up in his flame-painted Peterbilt. But when he walked in, something felt off. He moved to the snack aisle and began selecting items: peanuts, a candy bar, chips, crackers, gum, a drink, another drink, cookies, jerky, mints, breath spray, energy bar, and finally a pack of gum – thirteen items exactly.

My stomach dropped. Rule 2: If someone orders exactly 13 items, charge them half price.

""How's the road tonight, Tommy?"" I asked, scanning his items.

""Roads are different after midnight,"" he said, watching me closely. ""You learning that now?""

The total came to $37.84. I entered a 50% discount, bringing it to $18.92. Tommy nodded approvingly and paid in those strangely crisp bills.

""Good boy,"" he whispered, then left without another word.

The next hour passed uneventfully until I noticed something dripping in aisle 3. The coffee machine – the old one they kept running for nostalgic customers – was leaking. But the liquid wasn't brown.

It was dark red.

Rule 3 flashed through my mind. I grabbed cleaning supplies and hurried over. The substance looked like coffee but smelled metallic, like pennies mixed with burnt rubber. As I wiped it up, more droplets fell, each landing with a soft plop that echoed strangely.

The cleaning rag soaked up the liquid, turning burgundy. I used three rags before the dripping stopped. Instead of throwing them away, something made me put them in a plastic bag and hide them under the counter. I don't know why.

At 2:17 AM, the automatic doors chimed, and a man in a business suit walked in. Expensive clothes, perfectly groomed, but something nagged at me. I glanced at the security monitors.

Monitor 4 showed him clearly browsing the magazines. Monitor 7 showed the same aisle.

Empty.

No reflection of the man in Monitor 7. Just the magazine rack and empty floor.

Rule 4: Do not acknowledge customers who cast no reflection in the security monitors.

The man approached my counter with a newspaper and a pack of gum. He stood there, waiting. I stared at my hands, focusing on reorganizing the receipt tape, anything to avoid eye contact.

""Excuse me,"" he said. His voice sounded exactly like my father's.

I kept sorting receipts.

""Son, I'd like to buy these items.""

Still Dad's voice. Perfectly reproduced. I gripped the counter edge, knuckles white.

The man waited for two full minutes, then set the items down and walked out. When I looked up, he was gone. The monitors showed him disappearing through the doors, but Monitor 7 had never shown him at all.

3:28 AM. Five minutes before the rule about the masked customer would matter. The black truck hadn't moved. Its driver remained motionless behind the wheel.

I checked the time obsessively. 3:30. 3:31. 3:32.

At exactly 3:33 AM, the truck door opened.

The driver stepped out, straightened their coat, and walked toward the store. Each step seemed perfectly timed, landing on an invisible beat. The automatic doors opened, letting in a rush of cold air that shouldn't exist in October Texas heat.

The figure approached my counter. Up close, the mask looked even stranger – too smooth, too white, too perfectly fitted. No breath stirred the material.

They placed three items on the counter: water, crackers, and a banana. Same as before.

According to Rule 1, I couldn't serve them. But they stood there, waiting, while that white mask seemed to bore into my soul.

Time stretched. Seconds felt like minutes. The store's fluorescent lights hummed different tunes, creating harmonies I'd never noticed.

Finally, I spoke: ""I.. I can't help you right now.""

The figure tilted their head, like they'd expected this response. They left the items on the counter and walked away, each step as measured as before.

Through the window, I watched them return to the truck. But instead of driving away, they placed something on my windshield – a folded paper tucked under my wiper blade.

The truck then pulled away, disappearing into the Texas night.

At 4 AM, I went outside to retrieve the paper. It was another list of rules, written in the same block letters. But these rules were different.

And they had my name on them.

I unfolded the paper with shaking hands. The handwriting was different this time – not block letters, but flowing cursive that looked oddly familiar.

Marcus, You've done well following the first rules. Now come the real ones. These apply only to you. PERSONAL RULE 1: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer. PERSONAL RULE 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately. PERSONAL RULE 3: Your shift ends at 6 AM. Do not leave before then, no matter what happens. PERSONAL RULE 4: The phone behind the counter will ring three times between 4-5 AM. Answer on the fourth ring. PERSONAL RULE 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

I stared at the paper until the words blurred. How did this person know my mother's voice? How did they know these specific details about my life?

Back inside, I tucked the new rules into my wallet. The store felt heavier now, like the air had thickened into syrup. Every shadow seemed deeper, every reflection distorted.

At 4:07 AM, Miguel arrived in his Ford pickup. But something was wrong. Instead of his usual two energy drinks, jerky, and cigarettes, he bought a single lottery ticket. He paid with a twenty-dollar bill that smelled like flowers.

""You should go home,"" he said quietly, avoiding eye contact. ""This isn't your fight.""

Before I could respond, he walked out, leaving his change on the counter. Through the window, I watched him drive away faster than his truck should have been capable of.

4:23 AM. The phone rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

I reached for it but stopped. Personal Rule 4: Answer on the fourth ring.

Fourth ring. I picked up.

Static filled the line, punctuated by what sounded like breathing. Then a woman's voice, crackling through interference: ""Baby? Marcus, baby, is that you?""

My mother. Exactly like she sounded before the cancer took her voice. Before the chemotherapy made her whisper. Before she died two years ago.

""I'm so cold, Marcus. I'm trapped in here. Please let me out.""

Personal Rule 1 blazed in my mind: When you hear your mother's voice calling from the walk-in freezer, do not answer.

""I know you can hear me,"" the voice continued. ""Remember when you were seven, and you got lost at Zilker Park? I found you by the playground. I promised I'd always find you.""

The voice was perfect. Every inflection, every pause where she'd catch her breath. I started walking toward the back of the store before catching myself.

""Marcus? Please. I'm so cold. Just open the door.""

I hung up.

The silence afterwards felt like judgment. Had I just abandoned my mother's ghost? Or avoided something wearing her voice like a cheap costume?

At 4:45 AM, I noticed something on Monitor 3. A figure walking through the store. Male, average height, wearing the same Buc-ee's uniform I had on.

Me.

I watched myself on the screen, moving through aisles I wasn't in, stocking shelves I hadn't touched. The monitor-me looked tired, older somehow. He moved systematically, efficiently, like someone who'd worked here much longer than three years.

Personal Rule 2: If you see yourself on the security monitors, look away immediately.

I forced my gaze to the counter, but peripheral vision caught the monitor-me stopping at the camera, looking directly at it. Direct at me. The face was mine but wrong – too pale, eyes too wide, mouth turned down in permanent disappointment.

I kept my head down for ten minutes, reorganizing everything within reach. When I finally glanced back, the monitor showed only empty aisles.

5:15 AM brought Sarah, the trucker from Minnesota. But she looked different. Her usually bright demeanor was gone, replaced by something hollow.

""Marcus, honey,"" she said, her voice strangely formal. ""I've been talking with management. They want me to cover the rest of your shift. You can go home.""

Personal Rule 5: Someone will offer to take your shift early. Refuse them.

""Thanks, but I'm good. Just an hour left.""

Sarah's smile twitched. ""Come on, you look exhausted. I'll handle everything. Clock out now.""

""Really, I appreciate it, but I need to finish my shift.""

Her expression darkened. ""Marcus, this isn't a request. Management wants you gone. Now.""

""Call Dale if you want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""I'm staying until six.""

Something flickered across Sarah's face – anger, frustration, then resignation. ""Fine,"" she said. ""But don't say I didn't warn you.""

She left without buying anything, which had never happened before. Through the window, I watched her truck pull away, but the license plates were different. Instead of Minnesota plates, they were blank white rectangles.

5:30 AM. Thirty minutes left.

The store began to change. Subtle at first – products on shelves rearranging themselves when I wasn't looking. The Buc-ee's merchandise display shifted from t-shirts to items I didn't recognize: snow globes containing miniature gas stations, keychains shaped like tiny white masks, coffee mugs with my face printed on them.

The security monitors showed increasingly wrong images. Monitor 5 displayed the store from an angle that shouldn't exist, looking down from the ceiling. Monitor 8 showed the parking lot but with different cars – vehicles that looked decades old, rusted, some with their doors hanging open.

5:45 AM. I found myself humming a song I'd never heard before, something with seven distinct notes that repeated endlessly. When I realized what I was doing, I bit my tongue hard enough to taste copper.

The automatic doors chimed, and a woman entered. She moved with precise steps, her high heels clicking against the tile in a rhythm that matched my humming. As she approached, I saw her face.

My mother. But not as I remembered her. This version was younger, maybe thirty years old, wearing a white dress that seemed to move independently of any breeze. Her hair was perfect, her skin unmarked by illness.

""Marcus,"" she said, and her voice was exactly as I'd heard on the phone. ""Let's go home together.""

She extended her hand. Her fingernails were painted white, and her wedding ring caught the fluorescent light like a tiny star.

""I'm not ready,"" I whispered.

""You don't have to be. Just take my hand.""

I wanted to. God, I wanted to. The pain of losing her had never faded, just learned to hide better. Here she was, whole and healthy, offering to take away three years of grief.

But something about her eyes was wrong. They held too much knowledge, too much sadness for someone her apparent age. And when she blinked, darkness lingered beneath her eyelids longer than it should.

""I can't,"" I said.

Her expression didn't change, but disappointment radiated from her like heat from asphalt. ""I understand,"" she said softly. ""But I had to try.""

She turned and walked away, her heels echoing with each step. At the door, she looked back.

""I'm proud of you, baby. You're stronger than I was.""

The doors closed behind her. I checked the monitors – they showed no trace of her having been here at all.

5:58 AM. Two minutes left.

The store returned to normal with jarring suddenness. Products snapped back to their proper places. Security monitors showed standard views. The oppressive atmosphere lifted like fog burning off in morning sun.

6:00 AM exactly.

Dale walked through the doors in his standard manager uniform, coffee in hand, looking utterly ordinary.

""Morning, Marcus. Quiet night?""

I stared at him, still processing everything that had happened. ""Relatively.""

""Good, good. Go ahead and clock out. Jenny's here for the morning shift.""

I gathered my things slowly, checking the monitors one last time. Everything normal. No sign of the strangeness from the past seven hours.

As I walked to my car, I noticed something on my windshield. Not a note this time, but a single black feather held in place by my wiper blade.

I drove home in silence, but couldn't shake the feeling that tonight had been a test.

And somehow, I'd passed.

I barely slept that day. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the security monitor version of myself staring back, or heard my mother's voice pleading from somewhere cold and dark. By 10 PM, I was back at the store, keys jingling in my shaking hands.

Dale was still there, finishing paperwork. He looked up when I entered, and something passed over his face – relief, maybe, or resignation.

""Marcus. Good, you came back.""

""Did you think I wouldn't?""

""After the first night with the rules, some people don't. They find other jobs, leave town, pretend none of it happened."" He stood, gathering his things. ""You did well yesterday. Following them exactly.""

""Where do the rules come from?""

Dale paused at the door. ""That's not for me to say. But I will tell you this – everyone who's worked nights here eventually gets their own set. Some people fight them. Those people.."" He shook his head. ""Just follow the rules, Marcus. They're not meant to hurt you.""

He left me alone with questions multiplying like bacteria.

The first few hours passed quietly. Normal customers, normal transactions. Old Miguel came by as always, buying his usual items, but this time he looked me directly in the eye.

""You're still here,"" he said.

""Where else would I be?""

""Some places are doors,"" he said cryptically. ""You chose not to walk through. That means something.""

At 1:30 AM, Tommy Chen arrived, but his truck looked different. The flame paint job was faded, like it had aged decades overnight. He bought exactly thirteen items again, but these were completely different from his usual selections: birthday candles, matches, a bottle of red wine, children's birthday cake mix, vanilla extract, food coloring, plastic forks, paper plates, napkins, a disposable camera, balloons, ribbon, and a congratulations card.

""Whose birthday?"" I asked, applying the half-price discount.

""Mine,"" he said. ""Every night is my birthday now.""

He paid with those crisp bills, but this time I noticed the dates. They were all from 1979. Perfect condition, like they'd been printed yesterday.

""How long have you been doing this run, Tommy?""

He smiled, and I saw his teeth were wrong – too white, too uniform, like dentures made for someone else's mouth. ""Since my truck was new. Since this stretch of highway opened. Since they built this store."" He gathered his bags. ""Some of us chose to stay in the loop. Others get chosen for it.""

After he left, I found myself checking the local traffic reports on the computer. Highway 35 through this section had been completed in 1967. Buc-ee's had opened this location in 1982. Tommy's truck was a 1979 model.

The math didn't work.

2:47 AM brought an unusual customer – a woman in her sixties wearing a Lubbock High School class ring and carrying a purse that looked like it belonged in a museum. She moved slowly, methodically, selecting items with the kind of precision that suggested ritual.

She bought seven items: a bottle of water, a bag of peanuts, a candy bar, a local newspaper, a pen, an envelope, and stamps. At the counter, she opened the newspaper, read something that made her frown, then wrote a short letter. She sealed it in the envelope, addressed it in careful cursive, and applied a stamp.

""Could you mail this for me, honey?"" she asked, handing me the letter.

The address read: Marcus Chen, Buc-ee's Travel Plaza, Highway 35, Austin, Texas

My address. My name. But the last name was wrong.

""Ma'am, I think there's been a mistake. This has my first name, but—""

""No mistake,"" she said firmly. ""You'll understand when you need to.""

She left cash on the counter and walked out. Through the window, I watched her get into a car that looked like it was from the 1950s, mint condition but somehow dusty. The license plate read ""MEMORY.""

I held the letter up to the light. Inside, I could make out handwriting, but couldn't read the words. Something told me not to open it yet.

At 3:15 AM, the coffee machine in aisle 3 started dripping again. Red liquid, same as before. But this time, I noticed something else. The droplets weren't random – they were forming a pattern on the floor. Letters.

MARCUS

I cleaned it quickly, but the letters reappeared immediately. Different this time.

YOUR TURN

I cleaned again. The droplets stopped, but a new message had formed:

C H O O S E

The automatic doors chimed. I looked up to see someone in a Buc-ee's uniform walking in. Male, my height, my build. As he got closer, I realized with growing horror that it was me. Exactly me, down to the small scar on my left hand from a childhood accident.

But this version looked tired in a way that went beyond losing sleep. His eyes held a weariness that seemed to span years. He moved like someone who'd been walking the same path for far too long.

""Finally,"" he said, his voice exactly mine but somehow older. ""I was wondering when you'd show up.""

The security monitors didn't show him at all.

""Personal Rule 2,"" I whispered. ""Don't look at myself in the monitors.""

""Smart,"" the other me said. ""But this isn't a monitor, is it? This is face to face.""

""What do you want?""

""To go home. To sleep. To stop walking this loop."" He gestured around the store. ""Do you know how long I've been here? How many nights I've served the same customers, followed the same rules, pretended everything was normal?""

""I don't understand.""

""You will. See, here's the thing about loops, Marcus. Someone has to walk them. Someone has to keep the store running, serve the customers who aren't quite customers, follow rules that aren't quite rules."" He smiled, and it was my smile but wrong. ""I've done my time. Now it's your turn.""

""That's not how it works.""

""Isn't it? Look at Tommy Chen. Look at Miguel. Look at everyone who comes here regularly. We're all in loops, Marcus. The question is whether you choose yours willingly or get trapped in it accidentally.""

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. My keys, but these were tarnished, worn smooth by endless use.

""Take them. Take my place. I'll walk out that door, and you'll never see me again. You'll work the night shift forever, but you'll be part of something bigger. Something that keeps the balance.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Then we'll keep running into each other. Night after night. Until one of us breaks or until you finally understand that this is inevitable.""

I stared at the keys. They seemed heavier than they should, like they were made of something denser than metal.

""Why me?""

""Because you followed the rules. Because when the loop tested you – with your mother, with your own reflection, with every temptation to leave early – you stayed. That kind of dedication is rare. The others who work here, they're just doing a job. You're doing something more.""

The clock above the register read 3:33 AM.

The doors chimed again. The black truck driver entered, still wearing that white mask. But now I could see through it, see the face underneath.

It was Dale. My manager Dale, but decades younger.

""Time to choose, Marcus,"" Dale's voice came from behind the mask. ""Tommy chose his truck and his eternal run. Miguel chose his Tuesday routine. The lady with the letter chose to remember things that were lost.""

""What about you?""

""I chose to manage this place. To guide each new night shift worker through their first encounters with the rules. To make sure the balance is maintained.""

The other me stepped closer. ""It's not a bad existence, Marcus. You'll get to help people. Strange people, people caught between worlds, but people nonetheless. You'll be part of a network that spans the highways, the truck stops, the spaces between normal places.""

""And if I walk away? Now?""

Dale answered: ""Then someone else will take your place. Someone who might not follow the rules as well. Someone who might let the balance tip.""

I looked at the letter in my hand. The woman had said I'd understand when I needed to. Now felt like the time. I opened it.

The handwriting was shaky but clear:

""Marcus, my dear grandson. If you're reading this, you've found your place in the web. Your grandmother chose to remember the highways as they were, before they became something else. Your grandfather chose his truck and his route. Now you must choose your role. There's no shame in walking away, but remember – everyone connected to this place has a part to play. Choose wisely. With love, Grandma Chen.""

Chen. Like Tommy Chen. Like the address on the envelope.

""Tommy is my grandfather,"" I said, understanding flooding through me.

""Was,"" Dale corrected. ""Now he's something else. Something that maintains the connections between places like this. The questions is: what do you want to become?""

The other me held out the keys again. They caught the fluorescent light and seemed to pulse with their own inner glow.

""I need time to think.""

""You have until dawn,"" Dale said. ""But remember – the choice will be made one way or another. The loop needs someone to walk it.""

4:00 AM. Two hours left.

I slipped the letter into my pocket next to the rules. The other me sat down behind the counter, and for a moment, we were both there, two versions of the same person separated by time and choices.

""It's peaceful, mostly,"" he said. ""The customers are rarely hostile. The rules make sense once you understand what they're protecting. And you get to be part of something larger than yourself.""

""But I'll never leave.""

""Define leaving. Your body will stay here, but your purpose will extend across every highway, every truck stop, every place where the strange travelers need shelter.""

Outside, the black truck waited patiently, its driver watching through dark windows.

The choice was mine.

But first, I had to survive the rest of the night.

The next hour passed in surreal calm. My other self sat behind the counter, humming that seven-note tune I'd caught myself singing the night before. He seemed content, almost meditative, like someone who'd finally found peace after a long struggle.

Dale removed his mask and hung it on a hook behind the register I'd never noticed before. Without it, he looked ordinary – tired middle management, graying hair, coffee stains on his shirt. But his eyes held depths that spoke of years spent managing more than just a convenience store.

""You have questions,"" he said.

""Thousands.""

""Ask the important ones. Time's limited.""

""How long has this been going on?""

""Depends how you measure. The network of strange travelers has existed since the first roads connected distant places. But this specific location? Since 1982, when we opened. That's when the confluence became strong enough to require management.""

""Confluence?""

""Places where different realities touch. Highway intersections, truck stops, airports – anywhere people from different worlds might meet. Most are minor, barely noticeable. This one's significant enough to need rules.""

A customer entered – a young woman in scrubs, probably coming off a hospital shift. She moved normally, bought coffee and a breakfast burrito normally, paid with a normal credit card. When she left, I realized how much I'd missed ordinary interactions.

""Not everyone who comes here is.. strange?"" I asked.

""Most aren't,"" Dale said. ""Maybe one in twenty are traveling between places that don't quite exist. But their presence affects everything. Like drops of food coloring in water – you need very little to change the whole glass.""

My other self spoke up: ""The rules exist to keep both types of customers safe. Normal people need protection from seeing too much. The others need protection from being seen too clearly.""

""What happens to people who break the rules?""

Dale's expression darkened. ""Depends on the rule. Minor ones, like serving the masked customer after 3:33, just create.. complications. Major ones can unravel someone's connection to their original reality. They become like Tommy, or Miguel, or any of the regulars. Stuck in loops, serving a function in the network.""

""And they're happy?""

""Happy might not be the right word. They're fulfilled. They have purpose. But they can't leave.""

Another customer entered – an elderly man in overalls, buying motor oil and a pack of crackers. Normal transaction, normal interaction. But when he left, I noticed his pickup truck had no license plate at all, just a blank metal rectangle.

""How many people like you are there? Managing these places?""

""Hundreds. Maybe thousands. Every major truck stop has someone. Most airports. Some train stations. Anywhere travelers gather, especially at night."" Dale checked his watch. ""We're recruited based on our ability to follow instructions precisely and adapt to unusual circumstances.""

""Recruited?""

""You think I applied for this job through Indeed?"" He smiled grimly. ""I was working nights at a gas station outside Amarillo fifteen years ago. Different rules, same basic situation. When I proved capable, I was offered a promotion. Better pay, better benefits, but the work never stops.""

My other self stood and stretched. ""It's not as bad as it sounds, Marcus. You'll find rhythms. Patterns. The strange customers become familiar. You'll look forward to Tommy's stories, Miguel's silent nods, even the coffee machine's color changes.""

""But I'll never see my family again. My friends.""

""You'll see them,"" Dale said. ""Just differently. Time moves strangely in the network. A night here might be minutes in the outside world, or it might be days. You'll age slower. Your relationships will.. adjust.""

5:17 AM. Less than an hour left to decide.

""Can I visit other locations? See other parts of this network?""

""Eventually. After you've proven stable, you can travel between nodes. Meet other managers, other chosen workers. Some people enjoy the community aspect.""

A phone rang – not the store phone, but a cell phone in Dale's pocket. He answered quickly.

""Yes? .. I see .. How many? .. Understood.""

He hung up and looked troubled.

""Problem?""

""There's been an incident in Oklahoma. A night manager broke protocol, tried to document everything with a camera. The local confluence is destabilizing. We might need to relocate some of the travelers.""

""Relocate?""

""People like Tommy, Miguel, the letter lady. Sometimes they need to move between locations to maintain balance. It's disruptive but necessary.""

The doors chimed, and a familiar figure entered – the woman who'd given me the letter. But she looked different now, younger, wearing modern clothes instead of vintage ones.

""Mrs.Chen,"" Dale greeted her. ""Is it time?""

""Nearly,"" she said, approaching the counter. She smiled at me, and I could see the family resemblance clearly now. ""Hello, grandson.""

""You're really my grandmother?""

""Was. Am. Will be. Time isn't linear in the network."" She patted my hand. ""I chose to remember our family's connections to these places. Your grandfather chose to maintain them through his traveling. Now you have the opportunity to guard them.""

""The letter you had me write,"" she continued, addressing Dale, ""it went through?""

""This morning. The Vancouver location confirmed receipt. They're prepared.""

She turned back to me. ""Your cousin David works the night shift at a truck stop outside Seattle. Same situation, same choice. Family often finds its way to these positions. We're drawn to them.""

My other self checked the clock. ""Thirty-seven minutes left.""

""What happens if I choose to leave?"" I asked.

Dale sighed. ""Then we find someone else. But transitions are difficult. The customers sense changes in management. Some of them don't handle it well. And honestly, Marcus, you're already deeply involved. The rules have been working through you for two nights. That connection isn't easy to sever.""

""Meaning?""

""You might leave physically, but part of you would remain here. You'd find yourself driving past at odd hours, remembering customers you'd never met, humming songs you'd never heard. It would pull at you until you either came back or went mad.""

""That's not really a choice, then.""

""It's as much choice as anyone gets in life,"" my grandmother said gently. ""The question isn't whether you'll be part of something larger than yourself. Everyone is, in some way. The question is whether you'll choose your role consciously or let it happen to you.""

Another customer entered – a trucker I'd never seen before, buying supplies for the road. But as he paid, I noticed his name tag: ""David Chen.""

My cousin. But this version looked older, wearier, like he'd been traveling much longer than any normal person should.

""Marcus?"" He looked surprised to see me. ""I didn't know you were working here.""

""Just started the night shift.""

""Ah."" Understanding flickered in his eyes. ""Your time to choose, then. It's not a bad life, cousin. Lonely sometimes, but meaningful. You'll help people who have nowhere else to go.""

He bought a coffee and a map of highways that didn't match any road atlas I'd ever seen. The routes were labeled with names like ""The Dreaming Path"" and ""Connection Avenue.""

""Maybe I'll see you around the network,"" he said, then left.

""How many family members are involved in this?""

""More than you might think,"" Grandmother Chen said. ""Your aunt runs a diner in New Mexico that serves similar functions. Your uncle manages a motel in Montana. We've been maintaining these connections for generations.""

5:45 AM. Fifteen minutes.

My other self took the keys from his pocket again. ""Last chance, Marcus. I've been doing this for.. I've lost track of how long. But I've helped thousands of travelers find what they needed. Some were lost souls looking for peace. Others were beings from different realities seeking safe passage. All needed someone to follow the rules, maintain the balance.""

""And if I take your place, you're free?""

""Free to move on. To whatever comes next for people like us.""

Dale nodded. ""The network doesn't trap people forever. When your replacement is ready, you'll have options. Some choose to move to higher positions – managing multiple locations, coordinating between regions. Others choose to step outside reality entirely.""

""What does that mean?""

""Hard to explain. But some former managers become something like guardian spirits for the entire network. They exist in the spaces between spaces, helping when things go wrong.""

The clock showed 5:50 AM.

Ten minutes.

I looked at the keys in my other self's hand. They seemed heavier now, weighted with responsibility and possibility.

""Marcus,"" Dale said quietly, ""understand this isn't just about you. The network needs people it can trust. People who'll follow rules not out of fear, but out of understanding. You've proven you can do that.""

""And if I screw up?""

""Then we'll help you fix it. That's what the network is for.""

5:55 AM.

Five minutes.

My grandmother squeezed my hand. ""Whatever you choose, I'm proud of you. You've honored our family's legacy just by being here.""

The automatic doors were silent. No more customers would come before dawn.

Four minutes.

I picked up the keys.

The keys felt warm in my palm, like they'd been held by someone for a very long time. Three minutes left.

""I need to know something,"" I said to my other self. ""When did you start? What year?""

He smiled sadly. ""2021. Three years ago, your time.""

""That's impossible. I started working here three years ago.""

""Time isn't linear in the network, Marcus. I'm you from another possibility. A version where you said yes the first night you were offered the choice. Where you took the keys immediately.""

Dale nodded. ""Sometimes the network shows people their alternative paths. Usually, it helps with the decision.""

""So he's not my replacement. He's what I become if I say yes?""

""One version of it,"" my other self confirmed. ""I've seen different paths too. A Marcus who became a regional coordinator, moving between dozen of locations. Another who chose the guardian path and became something that exists between realities. And one who walked away.""

""What happened to the one who walked away?""

The room grew cold. Outside, I could hear wind that hadn't been there before.

""He manages a 24-hour diner in Nebraska now,"" my other self said quietly. ""Still serves strange customers. Still follows rules. But he's alone. No network, no support, no understanding of what he's part of. The

1kuys9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1kuys9i/too_much_fiber/,Too much fiber?,"Hi all I wanted to get some opinions on something I'm experiencing.

I've created a meal plan for myself where I have 4 days of different meals that all hit my calorie and protein goals. In an attempt to get more fiber into my diet I have also ensured that each day has 50-75g of dietary fiber in the meal plan.

I've been eating like this for more than 2 months now and to be honest I've been seeing some really good benefits: haven't been sick once, mood is generally better, good energy levels etc.

Where I'm a little confused is my stool. It's generally not bad and is mostly a 4 on the Bristol scale, but is usually comes with some gas and can sometimes be a little explosive. Its very regular and will occur in the mornings whether I have coffee or not, and of course if I do have coffee it happens very soon after. Another thing is that sometimes I'll have to go multiple times in the morning - I could go once and then 30 mins - 1h later will have to go again, which tells me that there's some irregularity happening in the process.

What brought me to this question was that I spent a week on a camping trip and my diet changed completely, we ate a lot of wholemeal bread with cheese and ham, salads, curries, rice, pasta, eggs, various proteins. Now I feel like my stool was immaculate for this week - I'm wondering if it was because of the variety introduced compared to my normal plan, or the drastic change in environment, or maybe it was a reduced level of dietary fiber intake.

Curious to hear what people think - should I be trying to reduce my fiber intake in order to get closer to 3 on the scale?

Here's an example of 2 days of eating for reference:

Day 1 super high fiber

Kefir bowl - kefir, all bran, blueberries, honey, chia seeds, banana

Date toast - sourdough, 4 dates, peanut butter

Beef chili - beef, black beans, butter beans, garden peas, red peppers, rice, kimchi, 2 eggs

Apple

Day 2 lower fiber

Chicken salad - chicken, salad leaves, lentils, chickpeas, EVOO, cucumber, red pepper

Pesto pasta - chicken, wholewheat pasta, pesto, garden peas, broccoli

I’m 50, retired just over a year ago after spending most of my adult life in investment banking. It was the usual grind -  long hours, constant pressure, always chasing the next deal. I told myself I’d feel free once I stepped away. And for a little while, I did.

But lately… I don’t know. The novelty of sleeping in wore off. My friends are either still working crazy hours or scattered across the world. My kids are grown and busy with their own lives. My wife’s still working full-time - she enjoys what she does and she’s younger than me, so that makes sense - but it does mean I spend a lot of time alone.

Most days I’m just drifting between coffee shops, reading articles I’ll forget by dinner, and going on long solo walks while everyone else is at work.

I’m not trying to complain - I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways - but I didn’t expect to feel so... adrift. There’s this weird quietness that’s settled in. I stepped off a moving train and everything’s still, but not in a peaceful way.

So I guess I’m just wondering - are there any communities out there for folks like me? Retired a bit early, figuring out what this next chapter is meant to be, and looking to find some sense of purpose or connection again. Doesn’t have to be anything deep - just somewhere to talk, maybe laugh, maybe get involved with something that actually matters.

Would really appreciate any ideas.

1kuyqvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kuyqvt/i_allowed_my_stupidity_mental_health_to_ruin_a_6/,I allowed my stupidity & mental health to ruin a 6 year relationship that I thought would last forever,"For starters: I don't blame her at all. This situation is my own doing, and the consequences of my own actions. I also know how stupid I was in almost every decision I made in hindsight. I'm just looking to get this off my chest to help me heal.

In November 2024 I ended a 6 year relationship. I had been confused for a long time and had been struggling with mental health. She was understandably upset and wanted me back, but I knew I wasn't in the right place to commit to her as she deserved.

In February 2025, contact naturally started again after she posted a love letter through my door. I knew immediately that I wanted her back, but had given myself a 6 month minimum so I could mentally improve, but rather stupidly I didn't tell her that.

Contact continued regularly, as it went on it was getting to a point of messaging almost daily, but wasn't anything deep. At the end of April or start of May, she made another attempt to meet up, suggesting we get a coffee together. I didn't agree or disagree as the conversation moved on, but wanted to, however, I again thought that I was only 3 weeks away from 6 months and should stick to it.

Contact continued until Sunday 18th May, exactly 6 months after the breakup. I called her and told her how I felt and that I had improved and could commit now my mental health was better. She told me that she needed time to think. After 5 long, anxiety inducing days and 2 love letters that I wrote her, on Friday 23rd May she told me that after I didn't accept coffee with her, she accepted the fact that I wasn't coming back and decided to move on. She said that although it had only been 3 weeks, it was almost as if the entire 6 months of moving on hit her all at once. With that, she didn't see the future anymore, didn't feel the connection anymore and told me no. I could see in her face that she was emotionless to me, and that it was truly over.

We have now cut all contact and I am distraught. I am so angry at myself for so many reasons. I didn't truly know what I had until I left, I thought of 6 months as some golden rule rather than following my heart, and I should've just said yes to Coffee. I would've said yes to Coffee if I knew it was my last chance.

I know all the cliches of 'there's plenty more fish in the sea' and that 'it'll get easier with time', but at the moment I honestly feel that I've thrown away my entire life. I've thrown away the amazing future I've been dreaming of for 6 years, even during the 6 months apart as I thought we'd get back together once we had grown.

I am someone who struggles very much with connection due to my neurodiversity. In the 27 years I've been alive, she is the deepest connection I have ever had, she is the only person I have tolerated for such a prolonged time, she is the only person I have not been able to easily discard from my life like I have friends, and she is the only person I felt I could truly be myself around without judgement, no matter how weird I was. We got on so effortless and felt like we were meant to be so quickly after we started dating.

I have to accept I have made the biggest mistake of my life, and move on from it, but right now I cannot see myself making that same connection with anybody else ever, and don't want to. I am crying every hour, even whilst writing this, and don't see hope.",4,1748166221.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

The internet is filled with stories about people who “clip” out of reality and into somewhere else. Terms like Back-Rooms/States/Woods are common on Reddit. And I’m not here to argue semantics with you. I call them Fairy Pockets, but even that is just a term I made up, so use what you like, there are no word police. Not that I have found yet


There are no set rules by which one enters a Fairy Pocket; sometimes you just slip in by accident, though there’s usually an easy way out, if you know what to look for. Something that will just not look right and help you pull yourself back to reality. It’s hard to explain.


My job is that I find them, go into them, and figure out what, if anything, is valuable there and then sell that information to governments or private businesses. You would be shocked at the amount of natural resources some of these places hold. I can assure you that the Iraq War was not about oil without a shadow of a doubt. But they’re always dangerous, so it’s a tough call on whether or not they’re worth it. And, thank God, not mine to make. Usually, you can find some idiots willing to buy your dangerous claim for at least enough to break even, unless it’s Rockport. Nobody even tries to claim that godforsaken place anymore. Today I’m just gonna tell you about a few places I found, and then, if there are any questions, I’ll try and answer them, so without further ado, let’s start with Pittsburgh’s Infinite City


There is this one place in downtown Pittsburgh about two blocks from the old US Steel building, where if you follow a complicated set of turns and steps. (Which I can’t disclose due to an NDA) You will find yourself in a near-endless, entirely abandoned cityscape of almost identical brick tenements. It, as far as I could tell, served no real practical use to the people I sold it to, but mine is not to reason why. They paid well, and I don’t question money on general principle. That said, the thing that struck me as most strange about this place wasn’t how empty it was or who built it, being a total mystery. (I always have assumed something built these places.) No, the strangest part of this was that every single sign or any other piece of writing I could find in this city was written in what I eventually identified as a fourteenth-century dialect of Polish.


That’s a nice and simple one, not really scary. Though I confess, all those empty buildings did get eerie, but most of the things I find are like that, a little off-putting perhaps, but not anything special. And this memoir is dedicated more to my horrific experiences, after all, they’re the ones that make for good stories. Now, some places like that feel creepy, but are fine. Others, like what we’ll talk about next, feel fine but are potentially dangerous. 


If you’ve ever taken a road trip through Kansas, you’ll know how flat it is, but perhaps one or two of you, while driving, have thought you saw a mountain way off in the distance. You probably stopped and shook your head, maybe rubbed your eyes, and it was gone. Good, it doesn’t exist, and it can’t hurt you. Unless you drive exactly four miles over the speed limit for twenty minutes while staring at the mountain. Then take a sharp left onto a dirt road between two cornfields with a wooden sign on an archway over it. The sign may or may not say anything, that tends to change for some reason. The dirt farm road will soon turn into a paved highway, and you will be in Hascombe County. It’s a nice place if you don’t mind the smell of sulfur; it’s a geothermal hotspot, and the entire place stinks of eggs. The locals are nice, hard-working folks who will give you the shirt off their back, and really are fine people. But take my advice and don’t go to any of the churches in the county. They all have the same preacher who tells the same sermon every week, like a recording. And the people can get violent if you ever look bored during it. Other than that, it’s a great place to live, with property values that can’t be beat, on account of the fact that I am fairly certain it’s still 1973 there. 


A few hundred miles away, there’s one place in the Midwest. Again, for legal reasons, I can’t tell exactly how to find. What I can tell is that it’s a small regional airport in a big-ish city, that’s all I can say. The vending machines all sell products that aren’t in business anymore, but I am not entirely sure if that’s supernatural or just some strange gimmick on the part of the airport management. What is weird is that if you walk into one specific woman's bathroom on a Tuesday, there will be an elevator at the far end of the room past the last sink. It takes you up through 99 floors, 98 of which are identical open-plan office space. You cannot see the skyscraper from outside the airport, and actually, some planes fly right through where it should be. Every floor is the same, laid out in long rows of desks with big box computers and off-white landline phones with woodgrain siding, each station manned by workers dressed in business casual, talking on phones and generally doing what you’d expect from a call center. The only issue is that they are speaking exclusively in dead languages, Latin, Proto-Finnic, Occitan, I even heard some Akkadian when I was there. 


Honestly, it’s the most well-managed office I’ve ever seen, everyone works hard, and nothing ever goes majorly wrong. Which I suspect has something to do with the fact that as far as I could tell there were no managers to screw things up. I went up to floor 99, but decided against floor 100. You see, 99 was a waiting room like you’d find at a doctor’s office, and to access floor 100, you had to take the stairs. The sounds coming from up there cannot be described, and I do mean cannot. I have tried repeatedly, and it only leads to my having a seizure. Not wanting to repeat that, I will leave them to your imagination. A buddy of mine who is a priest suggested that I had found purgatory, and perhaps he was right. I’m no theologian, so I’ll leave that one to the church. 


There is an area in San Francisco where you can see what I think is Atlantis, where Alcatraz should be, but I haven’t figured out how to get there yet. And there is a way to get to the moon from Houston without NASA being involved. But by far the weirdest Fairy Pocket I ever found was Mount Prince Nelson National Park in West Virginia. It’s a beautiful place by the way, wonderful hiking, and some absolutely stunning views of the mountains. But I don’t recommend you take your kids. It is by far the most dangerous place I have ever been, and I lived in Chicago for three months. Long story, I was trying to figure out where all the damned clowns kept coming from. But I digress, Mt Prince Nelson is about 700 square miles, located within an area of West Virginia no larger than a Wal-Mart parking lot, which coincidentally is how you get there. Follow the steps correctly, and where the main doors are, a stone arch will appear with an NPS Ranger who charges you 42 cents as an entry fee, and hands you a waiver to sign in the reasonably likely event that you die in the park. There are miles and miles of roads, both paved and unpaved, and a core area around a lake that contains the majority of the tourist stuff. It’s more or less safe on account of the National Park Service maintaining a round-the-clock watch on the perimeter that would make the Marines look sloppy. And the flight of F-14 Eagle fighter jets flying 24/7 hot laps around the area is a great comfort. But we weren’t paid to be comfortable, and our bosses wanted us deeper in the park, and off trail. Once you get outside of the patrolled area, like we were, things take a turn; everything, and I do mean everything, wants to kill you. 


There are beetles (insect) the size of beetles (car) for starters. The cool part, however, is the dinosaurs that roam free in the park. Side note, that whole “They can’t see you if you don’t move” thing is bull. Ask me how I know. It’s a rainforest, so the backwoods camping isn’t easy, because hacking your way off-trail is a nightmare even without the venomous trees and psychic frogs. But I have to say, it really is beautiful, puts Yellowstone to shame on a bad day, and that’s saying it mildly. 


When I first went to Mt Prince Nelson, I was part of a team of specialists called in by the National Park Service to figure out why they kept getting paperwork from their employees there despite no knowledge of it existing. We spent about six months figuring out how to get in, and that’s when things started to go badly wrong. Our team lead, an older guy named Donald, was the first to die. He had taken watch around our camp on the first night after we left the Safe Zone, and some kind of big ape-looking thing came out of the woods and attacked. Beat poor Donnie half to death before we were able to kill it, and he was dead by the time we got him back to a ranger station for medivac. We had a job to do, and the pay was good, so we pushed on, deeper into the woods. Where the 9 surviving men of our team got knocked down to 5 on the third day by some kind of screaming fog, though all things considered, it wasn’t so bad, as it also killed the T-Rex that was chasing us. Jakoby, one of the newbies, went nuts that night and started talking about how he had communed with a goddess at the center of the mountain in his sleep. And that he needed to go out and join her amidst the rocks lest all reality be consumed. I had to put him down with my 45 before the crazy spread to the rest of the team, which might be my least favorite part of this damned job. The remaining 4 of us found an old cabin nearby and decided to hold up for the night. By the next morning, we were down to 3. I hadn’t gotten to Jakoby in time, I guess. 


We reached the decision that we were going to try and make our way back to the Safe Zone after a short debate. I always try to be democratic where possible. So we started back, when we had been walking for around 7 hours, Rodriguez, who was on point, signaled a halt. He said he thought he had heard a twig breaking about 100 yards to our right. He was right, too worst luck; if he hadn’t stopped, maybe that prick wouldn’t have been able to line up his shot. The arrow took Rodriguez in the chest, sending him to the ground. Me and O’Leary opened up with our weapons in the direction of the archer, but I don’t think we hit him. Rodriguez would have survived had the arrow not been poisoned, but he was already turning green and bleeding from his eyes by the time I got the bandage over the wound. I gave him “last rites” by sticking a stake through his heart and zip-tying a cross to his right hand so he wouldn’t come back as anything unnatural. Then the two of us left and set off again in the direction of home. 


O’Leary and I made it a long way that day without stopping and ended up camping close enough to the Safe Zone that we were fairly confident in making it there the next day. I took first watch and chewed coffee grounds to stay awake, as I had no doubts that we were still being hunted. The attack came sometime around zero dark thirty when I got a feeling on the back of my neck that I was being watched. I have learned to listen to these feelings, and it’s why I’m still alive. Diving for the ground, the arrow just narrowly missed me, slamming into a tree a few yards behind. O’Leary was awake now and scrambling for his rifle while I fired blindly into the trees from cover. We were unlikely to make it back without getting rid of this hunter, so I signaled for him to cover me as I crawled away from our camp. It took about ten minutes or so before I found his tracks, two muddy bootprints and a Snickers wrapper gave away where he had been standing, and a trail of greenish-blue blood leading away from the spot told me one of us had hit the bastard.


O’Leary and I stalked him for about half a mile before we found him collapsed by a creek bed, panting heavily. A handsome young man dressed in bright orange hunting gear: the only sign he wasn’t human was the metallic red hair and his almost neon green eyes. He cussed me out in what might have been an early ancestor of Welsh, before O’Leary blew his brains all over the forest floor. I wasn’t sure that would stop him for long, so just to be safe, I hog-tied him before we left. 


O’Leary quit this job after we made it back to civilization. I can’t blame him. The last I heard, he had become a Buddhist monk and lived up some mountain in Colorado. I just hoped it wasn’t anywhere near Rockport, that is one pocket that even I won’t go to. But the pay from the National Park Service was more than enough for me to retire on, had I wanted to. So there are certainly perks to this job. Why do I still do it? I would love to get philosophical, but frankly, I just like it. It tickles the part of the human spirit that first pushed man to sail across oceans or fly to the moon. And like those great explorers of the past, I’m not sure if I could stop even if I wanted to, it has its hooks in me and won’t let go. 


I have other stories, of course. Might even post them later, but these were a few that stood out to me. I will try to answer any questions, but given the number of NDAs and Ancient Blood Oaths I’ve had to sign over the years, I make no promises about how much I can deliver.


That said, if this job sounds fun to you, or the money sounds like a great way to get rich quick, I really, really do not recommend you take it up; people like that don’t tend to last long. And for the love of all that is holy, if you are in Colorado and see a sign for a town called Rockport, TURN AROUND.

1kuynhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kuynhc/need_advice/,Need advice,"Im 6’4” 280ish, I’ve been going to the gym 5 days a week. I broke my leg a couple years ago so I can’t do treadmill (the impact or running due to my weight hurts my plates and pins from the break)

Please help with how to move to the next step, I don’t know if more time or diet is more important, I think the right answer is both but I’d like some advice.

My normal routine is 5 days a week, one hour per day. I do cardio every day, 20 minutes on the elliptical on lift days, 45-60 minutes on cardio day (I usually do 45 at 10 resistance on elliptical then if I feel good I do either cycling or rowing for 15 minutes) Day one is arms and chest (I only use cable machines right now so chest press, bicep curl, butterfly, and lat pull down) day 2 is legs (horizontal leg press, weighted calf raise, lying leg curl, and hip adduction) I rest 2 days a week on average.

My current thought is more body weight exercise on off days, and also I have no idea how to work out core. I work from home and I think I could fit in a crunch, sit up, squat routine. But I’m open to suggestions.

I have 2 other major concerns, one is my diet. I do intermittent fasting  5 days a week (m-f) I only drink water or black coffee before 8pm, but I go a little crazy in the evenings. Usually 1-2 days a week is calorie conscious meals, but then I also eat out a lot and I use “being good” (working out) as an excuse to eat poorly.

My other concern is alcohol consumption, I use alcohol right now as a reward for working out 5 days a week, on average I drink a 20oz imperial (9%) IPA and a 24oz (5%) spiked seltzer every single night during the week after I work out. I drink more on weekends and some weekdays (upwards of 8+ drinks at least once a week, most weeks twice and sometimes more)

I would really appreciate any advice on next steps, if I’m being honest I can’t quit drinking right now, I can cut back, but I’m too far in to alcoholism to fully quit cold turkey (I’m in my late 30s and it’s been a part of my life for 20 years, all of my friends drink a lot and I’d lose a lot of my social support network if I stopped drinking, it’s sad but it’s how it is right now) That being said, personally my next step is to cut back to one drink per night during the week, and start with one day off of drinking each week and go from there.

I know this is a long, specific post, but any advice or experience or anything is much appreciated. Thank you",1,1748165816.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

Hey, AiContentAutomators fam! 🌟

Ever found yourself staring blankly at your screen, wondering how the heck to create engaging affiliate marketing content that actually *sells* without you losing your mind? You’re not alone! I’ve been there too, and spoiler alert: the struggle is REAL.

But what if I told you that AI is basically like having a super smart friend who never sleeps and doesn’t take lunch breaks? 🤖 Let’s dive into how AI can help you create conversion-optimized content at scale—because who wants to work harder when we can work smarter, am I right?

### Here’s the deal:

1. **Keyword Magic 🪄**
   - AI tools can analyze search trends and suggest keywords that your audience is actually looking for. No more guessing games!
   - Imagine having dozens of keyword ideas at your fingertips while you sip your morning coffee—*blissful*, right?

2. **Content Creation Galore 📝**
   - Need blog posts, emails, or social media content? AI can whip up drafts faster than you can say “I need coffee.” 
   - Plus, you get to sprinkle in your personal touch. It’s like cooking with a top chef—you do the seasoning!

3. **Data-Driven Insights 📊**
   - Ever thought, “Should I go for that catchy headline or the straightforward one?” Well, AI can analyze what worked for previous campaigns. 
   - Knowing you’re making decisions based on data instead of guesswork? *Total confidence boost!*

4. **A/B Testing Made Easy 🎯**
   - Tired of split-testing like a mad scientist? AI can automate this for you. Just set it and forget it. And trust me, getting actual insights from real activities is way more satisfying than stressing over numbers!

5. **Personalized Recommendations ❤️**
   - Use AI to create personalized content experiences. You know, the kind that makes your audience feel like you *really* understand them? 
   - More personalization = higher conversions. It’s like having a dedicated fan base rooting for you!

### But hold on a second! 🛑

Before you get too excited, there are a few traps to avoid:

- **Don't Get Lazy!** 🤷‍♀️ 
  - Just because AI can do some heavy lifting doesn’t mean you can skip out on your creative flair. Every creation needs that *human touch*.
  
- **Avoid Over-Reliance on AI!** 🚫
  - It’s easy to let AI take the wheel. Make sure you review everything. You wouldn’t want a robot to make your decisions… unless it’s about pizza toppings.

So, what’s stopping you from giving this a shot? Are there any AI tools you’ve tried or are curious about? Your experiences might just help someone else in the community! 

Let’s keep this convo rolling—who’s ready to let AI take their affiliate marketing game to the next level? 🚀",1,1748165786.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Didn't really care. After all, you've always wanted a little sister.","A chitter of tiny laughter echoed through Mark’s bedroom, followed by the pitter-patter of tiny plastic feet. Its feet bouncing off the carpet, shifting from hiding spot to hiding spot, observing the sleeping boy. The fake black pupils of the creature's eyes narrowing in on Mark as it shuffled closer to the bed. After assessing the situation, a cold fake hand grabbed the overhanging Pokémon blanket, scrunching Pikachu’s face as it climbed its way onto the bed, snickering to itself.

Mark let out small huffs in his sleep, his chest rising and falling with perfect ease, as if nothing could break him from his slumber. The doll shuffled its way along the blankets, sitting itself on his chest before poking his cheek. “Boo.”

The boy didn’t stir, only tilting his head away from the poke, trying to get comfortable again. While a weight on his chest would have usually woken him, the doll barely had a kilo to her, making it easy for him to ignore the uncomfortable feeling. The doll poked his other cheek this time, watching the boy’s face squish as she made contact. She then poked him again, and again, and-

“AUGHA.” The sound that left his lips mimicked the noise a mountain lion would make after finding out it had missed its 8:30am train. A pure roar of emotion that ended in confusion when it realized it didn’t need to catch the train to begin with. “Huh? Who are you?”

The doll stared at him, confused. It had memorized a bunch of lines to use on the boy. Lines like. I’m going to give you cotton eyeballs, or want to join me in a world of plastic joy? Give me your skin, and I’ll take you there. All great horror lines, she thought, but the boy hadn’t given her the scared scream she needed for that. Instead, he had asked a question.

“Me?” The doll was a vintage 1980s Cool Beach Gal figure. One who wore a blue sundress, star-shaped sunglasses, and had a surfboard attachment that had been lost years ago, after a bird swooped her on one of her rare trips outside the home. The pale, frozen skin of the doll stiffened, in a way that seemed impossible, given she was already made of plastic. Slowly, her hand reached around her side, grabbing a label on the back of her sundress, pulling it near her face. “Vintage 1980s cool beach gal.” She read.

“That’s not a name.” Mark muttered, wiping the sleep from his eyes. “I’m Mark. Don’t you have a name like that?”

“Mark?” she repeated. “No. No one ever named me. Can I pluck your eyes out?” She asked, trying to keep up her act of scaring these new people out of the home.

“Um, no. I don’t want you to do that.” Mark nervously said, as his hand went to touch his eyes, carefully tracing his eyelids, making sure he still had them.

“Oh. Ok.” The doll awkwardly slid off his chest, sitting by his side. She hadn’t thought this through that well. People who had spotted her in the past always fled at the first sight of her, so she assumed she had to be evil. This was the first time that someone had talked to her normally, and it was weirding her out.

The two stared at one another, trying to figure out what to do next, until Mark smiled. “Do you live here too?”

“I think I lived here. A long time ago. I believe.” She sighed, unsure if that was even true. She had vague memories of the home, even the rooms she couldn’t access because of her small doll body, but she wondered if those memories were even real, or if she had made them up during her time here.

“That makes you my sister if you’re living here. I’ve always wanted a little sister. Mom and dad said that can’t have one, so you can be my sister.” He said the words messily because of his excitement, barely breathing between them. In a quick flurry, he shoved his blankets aside and patted her head. “Want to be my little sister?”

“Your sister?” The doll bundled its tiny hands together, causing them to click into place momentarily before she untangled them. “YES. It’s so lonely not having any friends. I’ll be your sister.”

When morning came, Mark carried the doll around the house, earning a confused look from his parents. His mother, who had been preparing breakfast, paused. “Where did you find that doll?”

“It’s not a doll, it’s my little sister. Say, hi, sis.” Mark waved the doll’s hand while she remained quiet, freezing up at the sight of her new parents.

“Ok?” His mother said, giving him a small smile. She knew kids handled moving in different ways, and if this was helping him adjust to living in a new area away from his friends, she would let him believe that doll was his sister. “Pleased to meet her. What’s her name?”

“That’s what I wanted to ask you. You named me, didn’t you?” Mark asked.

“It was a joint effort.” His father said, handing his wife a coffee, before kissing her on the cheek. “Though I guess you did a lot more of the work.” He chuckled, helping her prepare the rest of the meal.

“Only carried him for nine months. I think we can say I did a lot more than half the work, but you helped me throughout it all, so I’ll cut you some slack.” She said, trying to think of a name. “You’re Mark, so how about we call her Melissa? You can be M&M. Like the chocolates.”

“Mark and Melissa. I like that.” His dad agreed.

“Hear that? You’re Melissa!” Mark spun the doll around in the air, the sudden movement causing her to freeze up, being unable to say anything, only letting out a tiny wheeze of air.

Mark sat at the table, setting his doll a small plate of food. “Here, you need to eat, too.”

Both Mark’s father and mother watched him stack a small plate of food for the doll, packing it with bacon, eggs, and some toast. Over the course of the breakfast, the food in front of the doll started shrinking, as Melissa took small bites when no one was looking. When the plate was empty, their father laughed.

“Melissa must have been hungry.” He chuckled, assuming Mark had been sneaking food off the plate.

“I don’t think she’s eaten in a while,” Mark admitted.

“Sorry.” The doll said, bowing her head. “I’m really thankful for the food, mom and dad.” She said, that stunning the parents at the table.

“That’s…. an interesting voice line to give a doll.” His mother said, nervously glancing at the doll which moved its head to stare back at her.

“Ah, I see the confusion. I’m not a doll, I’m Mark’s little sister.” It explained, leaving the parents dumfounded, though, their confusion faded when they recalled what the real estate agent had told them. The agent mentioning that previous residents had been screaming about some haunted doll or ghost, something the two of them hadn’t believed when they purchased the home.

The mother and father both shared a look, both understanding this was the haunted creature mentioned by the agent, and yet none of them felt any fear towards her. If anything, they feared the housing market, more than they feared being murdered by a doll, so they relaxed, going back to eating their breakfasts.

“Well, it’s nice to have a new member of our family,” Mark’s father said, sipping his coffee. “I hope you don’t mind us staying in your home.”

“Of course not, your family now.” She said, before grabbing Mark’s hand. “Can we play? I’m done eating.”

“Sure. Have you ever played Pokémon before? It’s awesome. There’s a Pokémon called treecko, and he’s like the best!” He picked up his little sister, carrying her to his room, telling her about all the Pokémon he liked.

“Should we be worried?” Mark’s mother asked, staring at her husband, who shrugged.

“She seems nice. If she wanted to hurt us, she would have done it already. It’s kind of nice having a daughter, too. Isn’t it? It’s like our babies looking out for us from the other side.”

The mother rested a hand on her stomach, nodding. “It feels like she’s still with us. Even if we never got to spend a lot of time with her.”

Mark’s father rose from his chair, embracing his wife, as the two accepted their new daughter into the family, wondering if this was perhaps a bigger gift than they ever could have imagined.",3,1748164535.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

I was absolutely broken beyond belief, I know young love never really does last but I thought this was different. After a few weeks of begging i finally forced myself no contact but due to my friend group and my route to work going past her house every day im always reminded of her. 

These 10 or so months have been some of the worst ever (Sick to the stomach every day imagining if i didnt make the mistakes i did) i didn't really have much emotion when i was young so I never really experienced grief and sadness like this ever before. I havent felt like wanting to date anyone ever since because even if i did like someone i just couldnt do it because i havent got over my last.

Last night i was at a party with some old friends and they were all drinking. One of my ex's friends saw me and as she was drunk just said absolutely everything to try and put me down (shes been dating other people just weeks after the breakup and the worst thing for me was the things she said about me before and after the breakup) I went home after that and because of the absolute state i was in foolishly broke no contact and asked if she wanted to meet up and go for a coffee just as friends to which she said she will think about today while she is at work as she is 100% sure she never wants to get back together again. I shouldnt have said that because i know the second i see her face and them beautiful brown eyes again i will just break down and the loop begins again

i just do not know what to do. im nervous and hate speaking with new people and i cant imagine giving another lady the love i gave my ex because i simply cant cope going through the emotions again if we broke up. My ex was literally my entire world and i still remember that very last kiss before she went to the airport.

Do i try and date again and just hope the love of my life randomly tries to talk to me one day? Do i just wait and see if she comes back one day? will this meetup for coffee make her feelings spark again?

I (host) have been thinking about my past and possible signals that could be an indicator that I have always been plural lately and just as I was having coffee a few minutes ago something popped up in my head, it's not much but I think it might be something nonetheless so it's probably worthy of being written just in case

Since I was very young I have always identified with this whole ""two faces of the same coin"" thing, for context, by entire coincidence (obviously) I had a twin during pregnancy (who didn't make it) and was born as a Geminis, something that in other circumstances would have probably just been a curious anecdote to share with friends but, that since I was so alone and going through hardships since a young age I kind of made part of ""myself"" in a way, I'm not sure if it at the beginning was just an innocent attempt of feeling less alone or it started happening due to the trauma I was going through, but, it surely got rooted on me with the pass of time, I practically took it as an actual true, that I wasn't alone, that l had this other me by my side who understood me and that we would never be alone because we had each other 

I don't think I really attributed this other ""face"" as my twin at the beginning (I only knew about my twin around 5/6 years old I believe but I had already been experiencing trauma since my 2,5 years for what I have been told) it was a way of dealing with everything, talking aloud to ""myself"" or the ""other me"", having dual conversations where ""I"" would ask and then answer as the other ""me"", or advice myself from an external point of view, soothe ""myself"" when things got hard, etc  (I would constantly alternate between first and second person when talking to myself, making this habit of separating ""me"" ""them/you"" and ""us"")

I think that at the beginning this was harmless, probably just a result of my autism and a reflection of how I processed things differently but once again it probably became more pathological due to trauma, I believe this was the first ""sign"" of fragmentation, that I started to separate this different ""selves"" all the time unconsciously 

For most of my life I only was aware of this other singular part, we were like the Ying and Yang, I was the most sensitive, ""emotional"" part (in the sense that things affected me more) while she was a ""colder"" and ""fighting"" counterpart, one that had put a wall between her feelings and the world 

I'm not sure if we experienced switches back then since I can't really remember, I know I have always had different ways of reacting to similar things, or at least by what I can manage to remember + what I have been told, but as I said I can't really remember if there were switches like now, I suspect they probably were more the type of where you become the other, by that time we still had the same name (we were born as girls but during our teenages I transitioned to male and changed my name while she kept our ""original"" name) so that most likely contributed to the switches not being that obvious besides the behavior 

I believe she and I were the first to appear, or at least the first to communicate between each other, though with time, specially during our teenages, this connection got weaker, most likely due to my own mental problems, the heavy medications and my rejection to both of ourselves 

I believe at 14 she took place as a host for a bit even if I wasn't exactly aware of that (I believe this because our behavior totally changed and while I had always been more masculine we suddenly became very feminine and started to worry about other things, also we got more outgoing which is something I struggle with

It wasn't until 16 that I became aware that what I was experiencing wasn't a ""common"" thing, I also became aware of others who I had never known about before (this was thanks to start dating another system and listen to their experiences, noticing how I had similar things happen to me, which obviously prompted me to ask more and investigate about plurality, it was like an immediate pull towards it, like it explained so many things, of course a lot of things happened afterwards but that's an story for another day 


With all of this having been said, I believe there were enough indicators back then for me to, at least, suspect we had always been like this 

If you had read all of this I want to apologize for the long ass text and thank you for listening to this confused dude. I hope you have found it interesting or even able to relate to something of it. I would be happy to receive some feedback and external opinions that aren't as biased as myself, with all of that, I hope you have a great day and once again, thanks for taking the time to read my rant",1,1748164410.0,plural,0,1.0,False

I’ve spent years and years dieting and I’ve always fallen into the trap of what can I eat the most of for my calories. Taste and food quality was almost second place to feeling full. 

The biggest change I have seen since starting mounjaro is because I don’t have the feeling of constant hunger I can actually enjoy food that for years I have ruled out. Bread / Butter / cooking with oil / avocado to name a few. 

Things that maybe aren’t strictly good for you from a calorie point of view but taste so much better and more importantly aren’t full of artificial silliness to make them low fat / low calorie etc etc. 

No longer being ruled by portion size and really enjoying what I’m eating and knowing what’s in it has been a huge win for me and has probably highlighted more than anything just how bad my diet was pre starting mounjaro. 

I’ve been taking it since September now and lost about 6stone. My next step is to start lowering the dosage gradually and hopefully keeping my new ways of eating in check. 

Best of luck for everyone else on their journeys. ",13,1748163960.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

I was a “full time smoker”.. first thing on waking I would be doing the zombie shuffle into the kitchen. Before bed, even if I was nodding off on the sofa I would still go and smoke before going to sleep! Seems crazy now, I guess it seemed crazy then. So I started to write all these things down, all the annoying behaviours smoking was causing in my life, all the dislikes and this became my “why I’m quitting” list.

Sometimes I was coming to the end of a pack so I would set the goal “when this pack is finished” or if I was really sick and tired of it I would just ditch whatever was left. I knew there would be some discomfort but that was ok because I WANTED to quit smoking. 

What I wasn’t prepared for was the mental  “civil war” when 8hrs, 2 days, 1 week in the thoughts would start coming through….
“You’ve proved you don’t need to smoke all the time now so you could restart and just smoke a few a day which won’t have all the side effects, just have a few a day, the ones you really like” 


This “debate” got me about 10 times!….
Because I listened to that voice as if it was my own reasoning, my own logic, my own will..

Have you ever had a drug addict come up to you on the street and tell you some ludicrous story in order to try and get some spare change? That’s basically what was happening! 
The part of my mind that was/is addicted would spin all sorts of crazy tales to get me to buy another pack! And it worked over and over and over again untill I started to really analyse what was going on. 
I made entries in phone notes for every relapse, prior and post and the data just did not add up!…for example 

Prior- “I’m just going to smoke a few a day, the ones I really enjoy and no heavy smoking” 
6hrs post relapse- “ I’ve already smoked 5 and regretting it, it’s not what I thought it was going to be.. i feel really disappointed. 

Prior-“ I’m just going to have one in the mornings with a coffee… it will be rich and aromatic and will make a nice start to the day.
Post- “ I didn’t even wait for the coffee to brew before I was lighting one up! And honestly it wasn’t rich and aromatic it was actually a bit grim 

I made sure to be 100% honest in these notes to give me a real idea of what was happening. 
And after some time it just became glaringly obvious that the nostalgic rose Tinted thoughts about smoking were all based on ILLUSION.

All this to say that if you set your mind that you truly want to stop smoking then please remember that junkie is gonna approach you internally and spin whatever tales it can to get you back on the smokes… and the best thing you can do is keep on walking, don’t debate it or give it any wiggle room, remember it’s all based on illusion & just keep on walking friend.

1kuy757,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpertSays/comments/1kuy757/how_to_tell_if_a_product_is_built_to_last_what/,How to Tell If a Product Is Built to Last - What Experts Look for That Most Shoppers Miss,"We’ve all had that moment. You buy something that looks great online  solid reviews, sleek design, maybe even backed by a big brand and then six months later, it’s falling apart, slowing down, or stuffed in a closet because it just doesn’t work like it should.

That’s not bad luck. That’s how most consumer products are built today: fast, cheap, and optimized to look good on a spec sheet not to survive years of real use.

But ask someone who uses their gear for a living  a chef with a favorite pan, an electrician with a daily-use drill, a designer who swears by a certain laptop and you’ll hear a different story. These people don’t chase trends. They buy with intent. They know how to judge a product not just by how it looks, but by how it’s built, how it performs under stress, and whether it’s designed for the long haul.

This post is about how experts think when they choose the tools, tech, clothing, or gear they rely on every day. It’s not about brand loyalty, influencer reviews, or flashy packaging. It’s about function, construction, serviceability, and design that respects the user.

If you want to stop wasting money on products that don’t last and start buying things that truly earn their place in your life  this breakdown is for you.

# 1. Form Follows Function

The best products aren’t the ones with the most features , they’re the ones that do one thing exceptionally well.

Experts look at what a product is designed to do and judge it based on:

* How well it performs that core function
* How consistently it does it under pressure or over time
* Whether extra features support or distract from the purpose

**Example:**  
A good pan doesn’t need ten layers of coating or Bluetooth.  
It needs:

* Even heat distribution
* A handle that stays cool
* A finish that resists warping over time

If a product’s design choices interfere with its performance, that’s a red flag.

# 2. Materials Matter - A Lot

Pros don’t trust “premium feel.” They look at what something’s made of  and what that tells you about its strength, repairability, and aging process.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

|Component|What Experts Want|What to Avoid|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Knife blade|High-carbon stainless steel (VG10, 440C)|“Surgical steel” or soft stamped blades|
|Backpack shell|Ballistic nylon or Cordura|Thin polyester or unbranded fabric|
|Cookware|Cast iron, stainless-clad aluminum|Thin aluminum, mystery coatings|
|Electronics chassis|CNC aluminum, magnesium alloy|Plastic shells with metallic paint|

They also consider how it will age. Will the surface scratch? Will the seal fail? Will heat warp it?

If it looks good new but can’t take wear, it’s not built for real use.

# 3. Fit, Finish, and Feedback

Before even turning it on, experts will hold the product and pay attention to:

* **Weight and balance**: Heavier isn’t always better, but it often means higher-grade materials.
* **Assembly precision**: Do the seams line up? Are the parts flush? Is there any wobble?
* **Tactile feedback**: Does the lid snap closed with confidence? Do the buttons give a clean click? Does the dial turn with resistance or wobble?

You can learn a lot about quality before ever using the product , just by how it feels in your hands.

# 4. Failure Points and Maintenance

Professionals know that every product has weak spots the question is whether they’re predictable, fixable, or fatal.

So they ask:

* Where is this most likely to fail?
* Can I replace or repair that part?
* Is this company known for support, or ghosting after sale?

**Good signs:**

* Parts kits and how-to guides available
* Modular designs (e.g., removable battery, replaceable strap)
* Community forums or Reddit threads about repair, not just reviews

**Bad signs:**

* Everything is glued or welded shut
* No replacement parts available
* “Contact support” is the only solution listed

# 5. Long-Term Behavior from the Brand

Experts don’t just evaluate the product ,they evaluate the company behind it.

They look at:

* **Track record**: Has this brand been consistent for years, or is this a one-hit wonder?
* **Responsiveness**: Do they respond to customer complaints and support tickets?
* **Product lineage**: Are they improving their line, or just changing colors and names?

They also look at how the brand treats power users. Is there a loyal customer base who upgrades within the brand or does everyone say “it used to be good”?

# 6. Community-Based Reality Checks

Finally, experts validate their instincts with real-world reports from other users who actually use the product  not just unboxing videos or affiliate posts.

They check:

* Reddit threads (“What’s held up after 2+ years?”)
* YouTube teardown videos
* Enthusiast forums (photography, coffee, tools, cycling, etc.)
* Reviews filtered by time (e.g., 6-month or 1-year updates)

They’re not looking for 5-star reviews ,they’re looking for patterns:

* “Still love it after a year”
* “Broke after light use”
* “Support helped me fix it”
* “Can’t get parts anymore”

I’ve expected a few months of business inside the house, but nowhere near this much. I’ve even paid an useless trainer (that was my mistake, that guy was a fraud). 

So we had pee pads, which he was only using half the time. After his vaccines were complete, we transitioned to outside walks. On and off he was either going only outside or only inside. Everyone told me to wait till he approaches one year, because no dog poops where he lives. 

I haven’t used a crate, it is quite expensive where I live and I don’t necessarily have the space for it. 

What tipped me off is that after last night, I said that this is enough and became determined to stop this behaviour the correct way. I decided to give him his meals outside, after he either pees or poops in portions. 

Last time he pooped was before his meal. So it’s been like 10 hours since he hasn’t been outside. Morning comes, we go for a walk. He pees, I reward. Great success! We walk some more, he pees again, I reward again. So now his stomach had some food in it. 

Long story short, I’ve walked him for a bit more than an hour after eating and he hasn’t pooped at all. We returned inside, I made myself a coffee, go upstairs, short silence, then he slowly walks upstairs as well. You can guess what happened. I’m losing it, I don’t know what to do. I tried to use nature’s miracle in the places he poops. I tried at least mitigating the damage with pads but he avoids them. 

What is making me angry the most is that he knows he’s not allowed to do this inside, because after every single time, he goes upstairs with a timid walk, and when I get down from the attic, he doesn’t greet me like he usually does. When it’s feeding time, he even refuses to go down the stairs. How can he like being corrected every single day? It’s the same result. He never had a bad experience when he went outside. 


What do I do? Please help me, I’m worried because we’re moving into a new apartment in one or two months and I’m not going to accept him going to town on the new parquet, one year from now he’ll ruin it like this.

Between work stress and trying to juggle calls with my long-distance boyfriend, I was kinda losing it. We hadn't seen each other in months, and even with the video calls, it felt difficult to stay connected some days. 

Then, out of the blue, he did something truly amazing. I'm not a morning person at all, and he knew I was dragging myself through early morning meetings. So, one day, he surprised me by reaching out to a new local café near my place and setting up a weekly breakfast delivery. I woke up to find a fresh cup of my favorite coffee and a bagel at my doorstep. 🥰 I couldn't believe he went through the trouble just so I could have one less thing to worry about.

Honestly, it's moments like these that make me realize how committed he is, even from afar. It's not just about the grand gestures but the little acts of service that mean the world. That one thoughtful act made me feel so loved, and it kinda gave me the spark I needed to keep pushing through. Long-distance relationships aren't easy, but having someone who puts in the effort makes all the difference. ❤️",5,1748162794.0,fiveWaysOfLove,0,1.0,False

The news greatly upset many of the staff — in particular, my daughter’s special education teacher cried on stage during the prekindergarten awards ceremony earlier this week.  The teacher is 78 years old, and has said that this will be her last year as an educator, as she had become very attached to the tiny school, and in her age she did not think she could continue somewhere new and start all over again.  Of course hearing this broke my heart, and I want to cheer her up by getting her an amazing final gift before school ends this month.

I am looking for a home espresso setup, and one of the legit option is MiCoffee Apex, as most of you already familiar with. I know that MiCoffee Apex (or Turin Legato or Gemilai CRM3700L etc.) V2 is an upgrade over V1 for sure, but I am not sure if that update worths 180€.

Btw, the version I am checking is called V1.1. They made a little bit of update before releasing V2. They wrote the updates as follows: ""New version 1.1: This version comes with a pre-infusion solution so you can adjust the amount of water, and a steam rod tip from one hole for better steam performance.""

As I understand the differences between V1.1 and V2 is added OPVs and temperature control for milk steaming. Milk steam temperature control is not important at all I guess. Then the question is coming down to the OPV. I do not think that it is worth 180€ extra, but still want to hear your thoughts on this. I also would love to hear if there is any difference I am missing between these two. I could also consider different options as well (don't want to go pricier than Apex V2).

Ahh the joys of 3rd party reservations and people who seemingly have no clue how hotels work. I'm the lovely night auditor of a west bestern and i had a couple wander into my establishment. No problem, however, they booked their reservation for the wrong night (the night of the 25th) and as this is being typed it is the night of the 24th. Compounding on this misfortune they booked and paid through a 3rd party. Of course this means their reservation is nuclear waste and cannot be altered in any way. I explain why I cannot check them in and tell them that I will allow them to cancel the 3rd party res and book the proper date directly with the hotel. They found this quite displeasing as the rate is ~$200. Cue them haggling about they're only going to be here like 5 hours(lol) and that i should cut them a deal and that every other hotel they've stayed at would cut them a deal blah blah blah. I'm already technically bending the rules by cancelling the 3rd party for free, now they want a room for like 50% off atop that. I wish I lacked the professionalism to not laugh at them.

1kuxubu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1kuxubu/everyone_except_my_baby_pisses_me_off/,everyone except my baby pisses me off.,"i’m 8 weeks pp and just really need to vent. my partner got 5 weeks off work when our daughter was born and those weeks were great; he was so helpful, always washing bottles and my pump, getting me food and water, changing diapers etc. 

since going back to work he’s been annoying the fuck out of me. he goes golfing for hours at a time most nights at the time of day the baby is usually the fussiest. he goes on the weekends too. he asked me if i was ok with it and i said honestly it makes me feel a little resentful towards you because you get to indulge in your hobby all the time while i haven’t even been able to open my colouring book in weeks. he got upset and said i was trying to make him feel bad, i was just trying to be honest. 

i exclusively pump and feed breastmilk to our daughter in bottles because even though she latches well, she’s very ineffective at sucking so she’ll eat for more than 40 minutes on one breast and not even be satisfied, so it was hard to get anything done with her constantly wanting to feed. at first he was really supportive of me pumping and saying he was just glad our baby was being fed no matter how we have to do it, but now it’s “why don’t you try breastfeeding again? i think she wants your breasts. we’re running out of fridge space with all these bottles. isn’t it better for bonding for her to feed from you?” 

the worst is when she fusses and he just. sits there. waiting for me to do something about it. while i’ll be trying to eat a meal, or enjoy the first actually hot cup of coffee i’ve had in weeks. i shouldn’t have to ask him to try to comfort our child while i finish eating the dinner i’ve already waited longer to eat because our baby needed to be cuddled for twenty minutes. when i ask him to feed her a bottle while i finish pumping he’ll ask “can’t you feed her while you pump?” and like, yeah i can, i have to when he’s not home, but it’s so awkward - i have to prop her up on my legs, feed her with one hand, and try to use the manual pump with my other hand while she’s actively kicking my pump or bumping my hands. 

the house is a disaster; if he’s not golfing he’s playing video games or outside smoking. i try to get what i can done, but the baby absolutely hates being put down in her swing or bouncer chair for more than 20 minutes at a time. 

his mom (who is usually wonderful…) keeps making comments about my pumping too. just yesterday she made a snide remark about me keeping milk in the fridge and feeding it to baby cold, because “breastmilk is nice and warm when it comes out of your body,” even though i defended myself and said baby has had no issue drinking it cold. 

a couple weeks ago i finally told him i think i’m dealing with PPD. there was an acquaintance of his who had PPD and took her own life, and all he really had to say was “i don’t want you to end up like her.” 

i feel like everyone around me is so fucking annoying, except my daughter. i don’t even want to leave my house or talk to anyone, i just want to play with and care for my girl all day, she’s the only person around me that loves me right now. i don’t know what to do.

For me, for example, my iop is usually lowest on the weekends or public holidays when I'm not working, just chilling but will go up during the week when I am working.  I noticed that became more stable (less large fluctuations) after moving my desk away from the time, I think the glare was causing my eyes to work harder.   I also noticed that coffee has no effect but green or black tea causes it to go up a lot more than usual.  Drinking water, hot or cold (although cold more) makes it go up, even in small sips a few minutes apart.  Mostly the pressure is highest between 10am and 12pm, after that it tends to tail off back into the normal range and is lowest (low teens) during the night from about 11pm and early morning hours.  Exercises during the peak times that raises my heart rate above 130bpm will cause it to drop within the normal range but only for about 10 to 15mins.

The fluctuations between trough and peak seem to be \~3 mins apart and normally range with 3 or 4 points.  Going for walks seems to go nothing in terms of controlling eye pressure even though I walk three times a day for 20 to 30 mins at a time.

## What is Instant Forteo?

**Instant Forteo is an AI-powered trading platform** designed to automate trades in cryptocurrency, forex, stocks, and a few other asset classes. It basically claims to take the guesswork out of trading by using algorithms that analyze market trends and execute trades accordingly.

It’s aimed at both beginners and folks with some experience in trading. You don’t need deep technical knowledge, which is a big bonus if you’re just starting out. The platform says it uses real-time data and predictive analytics to help users make smart trades 24/7 — even when they're asleep.

In terms of usability, it’s very plug-and-play. Just create an account, deposit the minimum, and let the algorithm do the heavy lifting. While it won’t make you rich overnight (spoiler: nothing will), it might give you a leg up if you’re cautious and do your homework.

## Who Created Instant Forteo?

The creators of **Instant Forteo** remain anonymous — which is honestly pretty common in this space. That said, the platform claims to have been developed by a group of fintech pros, software engineers, and crypto analysts. Sounds familiar? That’s because platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge have made similar claims.

The lack of transparency around the development team is a bit of a red flag, but not a dealbreaker. Some of the most popular crypto tools out there were started anonymously. What matters more is whether the platform performs well and handles user funds responsibly. So far, Instant Forteo seems to be doing just that.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Instant Forteo Today](https://tinyurl.com/yc5tydn9)
## How Does Instant Forteo Work?

**Instant Forteo uses machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades** on behalf of users. Once you fund your account, you can either trade manually or let the platform handle everything automatically.

Here’s the basic flow:
- The algorithm scans the market in real time.
- It identifies profitable trade opportunities based on historical data and current trends.
- It executes trades automatically, aiming to buy low and sell high.

What’s cool is that you can adjust the risk level depending on your comfort zone. So if you’re more conservative, you can dial it down. If you're a bit of a gambler, crank it up. The platform also includes demo trading, which is a great way to test it without risking real money.

## Instant Forteo Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real — no platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super beginner-friendly interface
- ✅ Multiple assets supported (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Real-time analytics powered by AI
- ✅ Mobile-friendly and no app download required
- ✅ Demo trading mode

**Cons:**
- ❌ Creators are anonymous
- ❌ No official mobile app (browser-based only)
- ❌ High risk involved like any trading platform
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit to start

### [👉 Open Your Instant Forteo Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/yc5tydn9)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Instant Forteo?

You can use **Instant Forteo on basically any device** that has internet access and a browser. It’s web-based, so there’s no need to download anything.

It works smoothly on:
- **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)

The mobile experience is surprisingly good. The UI scales well to smaller screens, and you can monitor trades or adjust settings on the go.

## Instant Forteo – Supported Countries

**Instant Forteo is available in most countries**, but there are some restrictions. If you’re in the U.S., for example, you might not have full access due to local regulations. Same goes for countries with strict trading laws like North Korea or Iran (obviously).

That said, most European, Asian, and South American countries can access the platform without issues. If you're not sure, just try to sign up — the system will tell you if your country is supported.

## Instant Forteo – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Instant Forteo shines. The algorithm is constantly crunching data to find trading opportunities. It pulls from multiple sources and adjusts trades based on real-time conditions, which helps reduce emotional decision-making.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded a day in your life, you’ll find the platform easy to use. The dashboard is clean, with big buttons and clear stats. You won’t get lost in a sea of confusing charts unless you *want* to.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app, no problem. The browser-based platform works great on mobile devices. You can check your trades while waiting in line for coffee. It’s fast, responsive, and doesn’t eat up bandwidth.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for price changes, trade executions, or even account balance updates. These are super helpful if you like to stay in the loop without being glued to your screen all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You’re not limited to crypto. You can also trade forex, stocks, and commodities. This is awesome if you want to diversify your portfolio or experiment with different markets.

## Is Instant Forteo a Scam?

Short answer: **It doesn’t look like it.**

Longer answer: Based on my experience and digging, **Instant Forteo appears to be a legit trading platform**. It has real-time market analysis, actual trade execution, and a working withdrawal system. That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose, and definitely don’t go all-in based on hype.

So far, I haven’t seen any red flags like withdrawal issues, fake testimonials, or shady upsells. But like all trading platforms, it carries risk.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Instant Forteo?

You’ll need at least **$250 to start trading**. This is pretty standard across similar platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge. It’s not outrageous, but definitely something to consider if you’re on a tight budget.

This amount gives you access to all features, including auto-trading, asset selection, and risk management tools.

### Instant Forteo Customer Support

Customer support is **available 24/7**, which is a nice touch. You can reach them via:
- **Live chat**
- **Email**

I tested the live chat and got a response in under 5 minutes. They were helpful and didn’t just copy/paste boilerplate answers. So yeah, thumbs up there.

## How do you start trading on Instant Forteo?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Instant Forteo homepage and fill out the signup form. You’ll need:
- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number

You don’t need to upload any documents at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be prompted to deposit **$250** via credit card, wire transfer, or crypto. They may ask for ID verification later — this helps prevent fraud.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either go manual or turn on auto-trading. I recommend starting with demo mode to get familiar with the layout. Then, adjust your risk settings and let it run.

## How to Delete an Instant Forteo Account?

If you ever want out, just **contact customer support**. They’ll guide you through the process, which includes:
- Withdrawing any remaining funds
- Confirming your identity
- Closing the account permanently

Pretty straightforward, no hidden catches.

## The Verdict

**Instant Forteo is a solid option** if you’re looking for a beginner-friendly trading platform that still offers powerful features under the hood. It’s not perfect — the anonymous developers and lack of a mobile app are minor drawbacks — but overall, it delivers.

If you’re new to trading or just want to test out an automated system without diving into the deep end, this platform is worth a shot. Just remember: **never invest more than you can afford to lose**. The algorithm is smart, but it’s not fortune-telling magic.
