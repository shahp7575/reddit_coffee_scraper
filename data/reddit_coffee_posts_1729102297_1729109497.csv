1g58sax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1g58sax/sudden_constipation/,Sudden constipation?,"Until the last 4 months or so, I always counted myself lucky to have the best, no-problems digestive system ever. A friend joked thatI could live on weeds and roadkill, lol. Every morning I would drink 1-2 cups of black coffee, then have a complete and perfect poop. Usually another one later in the day.

But 10 months ago, I (61F) made some positive changes in my life. I unexpectedly met someone, fell in love, and moved 600 miles away to live with him-- all in the space of three months. I had previously been physically very active, but overweight. I started intermittent fasting (16:8), became vegetarian, and lost 40 pounds in 7 months. As before, I eat lots of fiber, drink water all day, don't drink alcohol except maybe 1 beer a month.

Then out of the blue, I started getting weirdly shaped poop--like thin ribbons, or (bizarrely) squared-off rectangles. And would go 3-4 days with nothing at all. I had no pain or discomfort--but a thin, ribbon poop made me fear the worst (colon cancer?!) and I scheduled a colonoscopy.

No colon cancer, thank goodness--just constipation. At the doctor's suggestion, I take psyllium, a stool softener, and magnesium citrate. This *sort of* helps, but barely. I feel like it's just being pushed along, rather than moving naturally, if that makes sense, and never feels complete.

Why would this happen just when I'm happier, healthier, and eating better than ever? Surely neither being vegetarian or eating only within an 8 hour window would cause this? Yes, I'm 61, but otherwise healthy.

Have others experienced this sudden onset constipation? ",1,1729109424.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False
1g58r1m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g58r1m,Today's equipment haul ,"So I have been obsessing over espresso machines for the past two weeks so I finally decided to go and get me my first espresso machine, a Gaggia classic pro after tirelessly researching on it and it's mods. Went first to ""729 grams cafe"" in Koregaon Park (Pune) and had my mind blown after tasting what REAL espressos taste like. Literally geeked out with the barista for 30 minutes before ordering a couple of different espressos from different beans, blends and roasts. Then I went forth and met with Emaad at @coffchem fully prepared to purchase my first espresso machine. He pulled this amazing shot of espresso from the ""Cafflano Kompresso"" and my mind was blown for the second time. THATS WHEN I FINALLY REALISED, it's not all about the extraction method, how and what you GRIND is what makes a great coffee! 
Saner minds prevailed and instead of splurging on the espresso machine, I decided to first invest in a great grinder... Went with the ""Kinu M47 classic"" with an additional pour over burr. Got a good deal since I was lucky enough to get this beaut second hand...

1g58qws,https://www.reddit.com/r/craftsnark/comments/1g58qws/all_of_your_rhinebeck_questions_answered/,All of your Rhinebeck questions answered!!!!!!!!,"So we all know that the BESTTTT fiber festival (Rhinebeck) is happening this weekend, and as a FREQUENT RHINEBECK ATTENDER (see? I am better than you) I want to give my pro tips for Rhinebeck weekend!!!

TIP 1: ARRIVE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AT LEAST THREE DAYS BEFORE THE FESTIVAL STARTS

You need to do this in order to get hand-dyed yarn from a dyer who isn't going to Rhinebeck but is going to a secret other thing with an entry cost of 300 British pounds (yes I know this is the USA also they do only take hard currency no credit card, but also apparently they'll barter for LBA if you have Corrie Confetti in the shade I Went To Little Weasel In Paris And You ALL Must Know) and if you don't get this yarn you WILL be shamed on social media for it. I don't care if you don't have social media. They will find you. Also, you need to go as early as possible on the first day of Rhinebeck itself so that you can be at the fleece sale as soon as it starts. I don't care that you don't know how to spin. What if you're missing out? WHAT IF YOU'RE MISSING OUT???????

TIP 2: BRING YOUR KNITTING FOR THE INEVITABLE BACKUP ON THE RHINECLIFF BRIDGE (approx wait time: 7 hours)

This takes a very long time. It's also the only route you can possibly use. Seriously, it's the only route you can possibly use. There are no other roads in upstate New York. They don't exist. It's not as if a suburban area less than two hours outside of NYC has roads. Like are you kidding. Come on. Also bring chains for your tires. If your snow tires aren't on yet then fuck you. Are you even a northerner? Come on.

TIP 3: MAKE YOUR HUSBAND BRING HIS HIKING PACK FROM WHEN HE BACKPACKED AROUND EUROPE BEFORE HE GOT HIS FINANCE DEGREE (NOT THAT YOURE GOING TO TELL ANYONE HE WORKS IN FINANCE) AND MAYBE ADD SOME REFLECTIVE TAPE TO THE OSPREY LOGO IDK

They banned strollers at Rhinebeck for a reason: because everyone hates customers. You NEED him to come. You NEED him to be capable of carrying the 1kg of yarn you can DEFINITELY use in a timely manner and that you DEFINITELY actually need. What if you want to buy a spinning wheel? After all, you showed up for the fleece sale, and prices don't matter because your husband works in finance. He MUST have a backpack big enough to fit your yarn and the spinning wheel and the knitty knoddy whatever the fuck that's called and also your dozen cider donuts and the weird brussels sprouts vender? They're like crispy or something? Is that a fair food? But it doesn't matter if they're a fair food or not. You need to get them or else you're missing out.

TIP 4: EAT YOUR WEIGHT IN WARM CIDER DONUTS okay wait i can't take this anymore

I'm not local to the Rhinebeck area at all but my dad grew up a couple of towns over (if you're stuck on the Rhinecliff bridge route you can wave to my grandpa on your way by his house lmao) so I can go to Rhinebeck and avoid the craziness that out-of-towners experience (astronomical hotel prices etc) and have gone for the past few years. Last year, I was watching here intently with the Wool and Folk fiasco and I kept seeing this refrain of ""fantastic! Now I don't have FOMO anymore"" and it made me feel bad to see that because FOMO in general is just a gross experience to have and I don't want anyone to experience that. So part of me wants to crush all of the Rhinebeck FOMO!!!! Because in the end it is literally just a fiber festival. It's just a fiber festival. It's nothing but a fiber festival. But there's all of this pre-Rhinebeck buzz that's pervasive enough for me to struggle to find a bunch of real, concrete examples to show, but at the same time, we all keep hearing about it. And I kind of want to give yall some relief from that buzz.

The first year I went, I honestly felt let-down, so when I was watching a knitting podcaster who mentioned she was going to travel a great distance to go to Rhinebeck (fine it was aro knits and purls are you happy?????? stop asking gosh) I kind of winced because I didn't think Rhinebeck was THAT worthwhile of an experience. Traveling to or within the USA is astronomically expensive, and Rhinebeck...is just a fiber festival. If I'd blown $2k on that experience I would've felt like shit afterward because it hadn't delivered. And it's not a bad experience; it's just that it's JUST a fiber festival. There are animals, there is yarn, there's lots of stuff, but it's just a fiber festival. I think a lot of the internet hype forgets that. Even when I was there, I overheard someone say they were at a ""knitting convention"" and like girl what. That is exactly not what it was. Instead, it's a fairground full of fiber-related vendors and farmers in upstate New York (actually if you call that upstate New York you're insane but I digress) and my biggest take on it my first year was that it was probably ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SHIT EVER before the internet. Like, you can go to this fairground and leave with yarn grown and spun in the USA, hyperspecific knitting tools you'd never seen in-person before, a needle felting kit, a bottle of Soak, and some amazing alpaca socks, but also, I can order those online without having to leave my house, drive, or pay an entry fee. It was cool, but it wasn't THAT cool. And luckily I hadn't invested anything but gas money into the trip so I was overall content with the experience, but I really felt for people who traveled a great distance to be there. Like, how could it meet the Greatest Thing Ever expectations people have built up for it, especially when people are willing to travel far and wide for the event? It just felt like inevitable letdown to me.

But the next year I went, I had a lot more fun! Probably because I had zero expectations. I really just wanted to get sock yarn from one specific dyer whose colors make my heart sing in a way no other dyer's colors do and get socks from one mill that makes the BEST ski socks. And then I just kind of did whatever! The year beforehand, I'd been like ""meh, I can order Soak online"" but that year I was like ""okay I'm smelling ALL of the Soak scents Every Single One and writing in a note on my Notes app which ones I like AND THEN okay fineeee the wild mint one fucks. Hard. Rip $15"" and that was fun! Getting to see the animals was fun! It was a nice day out and I got to be outside! There were biplane rides overhead and I love planes! Woohoo! But the thing about all the fun I had at Rhinebeck was that almost none of it had to do with this being the Big Deal Fiber Festival and instead was just because this was A fiber festival at all, and a larger one at that. I've been to smaller local ones, and the big ones DO have a lot more to offer in ways that make them incomparable to the smaller ones. But when you compare big ones to big ones, a lot of them are going to be very similar. Even internationally, a lot of them are going to have similar (or even the same) vendors. I think Soak themselves (not spons'ed, I WISH!!!!!!!!!!) went to a festival in Poland, and they're a Canadian company, so it's not like that was a quick lil drive. There's way more out there than just Rhinebeck.

But none of this gets around the biggest, most inevitable FOMO of all: we all want to be one of the Cool Crafter Girls in the Cool Girl Circles with crafter friends who go to crafter events and have an amazing time. And we all see tons of that on social media whether we really want to or not. I'm totally willing to admit that I'm so jealous of these crafting friend groups in which every member of them has shared my ""I was the only person under 68 in my knitting group when I was 25"" experience, and now, they have friends their own age!!! WHO KNIT!!!!!! I want to be that girl soooooooooo bad. But right now that's just not in the cards for me and that's okay. And I imagine there are a lot of you out there right now who feel the same feeling and wish you could be at one of these events thriving with your friends and wearing a sweater you're really proud of and enjoying a lovely autumn day, but so little of that has anything to do with Rhinebeck. You can have that elsewhere. Maybe you can even have that right now, exactly where you currently live. Ask yourself what you can do to experience the same joy. Maybe there's a closer fiber festival you can go to. Maybe you can carpool with people from the knitting club at your local library. Maybe you can bring a family member, even one who doesn't care about crafts, because there will be animals to see, and that's fun! Or maybe you just invite someone to a coffee shop for some knitting time together. Or the local library, or the park. Or maybe you do that by yourself instead and just enjoy this season - of the year or of life - for what it is. You don't need Rhinebeck to bring you that joy. You can and will find it elsewhere. All you have to do is look.

""okay but im still going lol do you have any real tips"" FINE avoid the Rhinecliff bridge if you can, if you want cider donuts just call around to general stores or orchards in the area and get them there instead of waiting in line at the actual festival (I realize a lot of this is critical of high expectations but you WILL transcend dimensions if you eat one warm), wear shoes you wouldn't mind getting dirty because the parking is in grass and potentially mud. Sunday is less insane apparently. If you're looking to plan for the future, my personal recommendation as someone who vaguely knows the area would be to treat Rhinebeck week as a vacation instead and stay for the whole week, maybe somewhere farther north, enjoying the tourist season for what it is and going hiking or something instead of just going for Rhinebeck. If you're in that general area but not around the time of Rhinebeck, I absolutely recommend The Perfect Blend in Saugerties as a yarn shop, particularly for their samples; the shop owner oftentimes does popular Ravelry patterns in really creative yarn choices and it's very inspiring.

Oh also maybe this isn't a snarky enough. It's okay. What other Rhinebeck snark can I offer? One year, I was in barn B or something, and I overheard someone say ""yeah that's Uma Thurman over there"" with the greatest indifference you can imagine. No one cared, Uma. You're free now, Uma. You're free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,1729109326.0,craftsnark,0,1.0,False

You’re cruising through town, minding your business, when you spot it – a Bitcoin ATM, gleaming like a futuristic beacon of digital finance. You stop, momentarily mesmerized. “Could I just walk up to this thing, scan a QR code, and get some Bitcoin magic?” you think to yourself. The answer is a resounding “Yes!” But hold up, there's more to this story – and it involves you making that transaction even more seamless with our **Bitcoin QR code maker app** (link: [Bitcoin QR Code Maker App](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)).

Let’s dive into the wild world of Bitcoin ATMs and why our app is your ultimate sidekick in this cryptic quest for digital gold.

# The Rise of Bitcoin ATMs: Cash for Crypto

First things first: what the heck is a Bitcoin ATM? It’s exactly what it sounds like – an ATM, but instead of withdrawing dusty fiat bills (yawn), you can buy and sometimes sell Bitcoin (or other cryptos) directly. These bad boys are popping up all over the place like mushrooms after rain. Whether in coffee shops, gas stations, or shopping malls, they let you convert your cash into Bitcoin faster than you can say ""Satoshi Nakamoto.""

While regular ATMs connect to your traditional bank account, Bitcoin ATMs connect to the blockchain. That’s right – they’re like the portal between the physical world of cash and the decentralized digital universe of Bitcoin. All you need to get started is a smartphone, a wallet, and – you guessed it – a QR code. But not just any QR code, a rock-solid one like the ones you create with our handy app!

# Why QR Codes Are the Secret Sauce

So, why are QR codes the secret sauce that makes Bitcoin ATMs hum with digital glory? Well, think of them as the treasure map for your Bitcoin journey. They’re like those cheat codes in video games that give you instant access to the next level – but in this case, they’re guiding Bitcoin right to your wallet.

When you use a Bitcoin ATM, you don’t want to be fiddling with long Bitcoin addresses, manually typing in a string of gibberish like a medieval scribe. Ain’t nobody got time for that! Enter the QR code: a beautifully simple, scannable square that contains all the information you need to send or receive Bitcoin with the click of a button (or, more precisely, the blink of a camera).

But here’s the thing – not all QR codes are created equal. You want to be sure your code is accurate, secure, and easy to use. That’s where our **Bitcoin QR code maker app** steps in.

# How to Use a Bitcoin ATM Like a Pro (With a Little Help from Our App)

6. **Receive Bitcoin**: After confirming the transaction, the Bitcoin will be sent straight to your wallet. Easy peasy.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs (and Why You’ll Want to Stick Around)

As Bitcoin ATMs continue to spread, they’re making cryptocurrency more accessible to the everyday person. No need to mess with exchanges, long KYC processes, or confusing platforms. Just walk up, insert cash, and walk away with Bitcoin in your digital pocket.

And with our **Bitcoin QR code maker app**, you can rest assured that you’re ahead of the curve, riding the wave of crypto innovation with ease.

And with our **Bitcoin QR code maker app** by your side, the process is not only easy – it’s downright fun. So the next time you see a Bitcoin ATM, don’t be intimidated.

 Prededicated (5months):
I started with boards and beyond and FA. I solved questions from UW simultaneously. I completed UW with an average of 60%. I also used Randy Neil for biostats and dirty medicine for biochem and ethics. One mistake that I did during my prededicated was that I did not give specific days to revision hence I would forget the topics after 2-3 months.

After finishing the UW, going through UW incorrects really helped me. I could not finish them all because of time crunch but they helped me identify my weak topics.

Dedicated: I would divide the time between reading FA and doing 60-80 questions of UW per day. Every week I would give one NBME exam. I had solved NBME 21-23 in my prededicated. 
I focussed heavily on the topics I was weak on. During the last month I switched to more FA theory reading because I felt I had forgotten a few topics. 
I would recommend to revise biochem, microbiology and pharmacology in the last 15days because they are volatile.

NBME 25: 59% (offline)
NBME 26:60.5% (offline)
NBME 27:66% (offline)
NBME 28: 63% (offline)

New free 120: 71% (5days prior)

In the last 2 days I did pathoma ch1-3, HY arrows(mehlman), NBME images pdf and a few of my notes.

Exam day: I had a high protein breakfast and coffee. I had protein bars, coffee and a sandwich during the breaks. I took break after every block. My initial few breaks were around 3-5mins and in the last few blocks I took 10min breaks. 

During the exam: I felt the exam was heavy on ethics. But I felt some of the ethics question were experimental. The concepts that were tested were very similar to NBMEs but the length of questions were really long. I read the last line of the question and options first, then I would go through the question stem. The 7 blocks felt like a blur to me.
 
At the end confidence plays a huge role during the exam. So trust your NBMEs and consistency with the scores.

Thank you so much to the members of this group!

1g58icr,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1g58icr/newly_divorced_need_feedback_on_my_first/,Newly Divorced- need feedback on my first experience back to dating. ," I divorced in July my ex husbands who was an addict and extremely controlling we were married for almost 9 years and together for 12. I went on a dating site almost a month ago, and started talking with a guy, we agreed to meet up at a restaurant and had a really nice time, talked for four hours. We exchanged numbers and he asked if he could kiss me. I said yes, and it was just a nice peck on the lips. He text me the next day and asked for a second date. We met up 4 days later at a restaurant and chatted, and again had a nice time. He again asked if he could kiss me at the end, and it was a nice simple lip contact-only kiss. We both have kids and had our kids that weekend. But, he text me and then called and we talked for 40 min a few days later. We arranged a third date, at his place where we would cook dinner and watch a movie. I was nervous, but we again had a great time, we talked and I asked if we were to sleep together, would that be it? He told me he is not interested in just a one-night stand, that we've gone out multiple times, and that he likes me. I ended up sleeping over. The sex was incredible. The next morning he made us coffee, and we watched a movie and I left. We've text every other day. Last week we went to a movie and back to my place for a drink. I just asked him, how he was feeling and his thoughts. He told me that he's enjoyed getting to know me, and that he really likes me. I said the same, he asked if I was talking with anyone else and I said that I was chatting with a few people. I asked him and he said no, and then he asked if I would be open to being exclusive. Which we both defined as neither of us talking to others while we continue to date and get to know each other. I agreed. We text through the weekend. Yesterday late afternoon we solidified plans for a Wed date, and he sent me addresses. Then a few hours later he texts saying that he knows it's out of the blue but he just doesn't see this going anywhere, he's enjoyed getting to know me but we aren't a match. Fine. I text back, ""ok, bye."". I text him after a few hours asking him what had happened. I told him, I get it, but I'm curious and since I am still dating and new to online dating, maybe it would help. He replied with the fact that when his child moves out, we would still have 5 more years with my youngest (keep in mind we had not discussed our kids, or futures, or living together), then he says that he just wasn't excited to see me or talk to me like he should be, and doesn't want to waste any more time for either of us.

I was literally shocked. This guy, who had the biggest smile and gave his full attention when we talked, always initiated calls and dates, wanted to hold my hand, and asked me to go exclusive. Now, he has described in one text imagining our kids moving out to- he was never really into me. Like, what the hell. I text him back, that the next time he initiates ""exclusive"" he should make sure he's into her and not lead her on. My first reaction was anger that he kept seeing me even though he wasn't into me, and then my second was that he's full of shit. My thinking is that he scared himself, or that he met someone. What the hell? Am I wrong? I know about ""situationships"", but in all our discussions it was future related, but always separately as we were still getting to know each other. His actions and behavior never matched that final text. I am at a loss. I'm upset that my time was wasted and I'm hurt that he wasn't into me when he was acting and stating the opposite. I haven't heard anything and dont expect to. Part of me wants him to call and tell me it was a mistake, but the other part wants to punch him (which I wouldn't actually do). 

Did he like me? Was he leading me on the entire time? I would LOVE feedback. ",1,1729108717.0,datingoverforty,2,1.0,False

","Using a **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) can feel like stepping into a shield of security online. But what happens when you’re lured by the promise of a **free VPN**? Are you really getting protection, or are you walking into a trap?

Let’s get into the nitty-gritty of free VPNs. I’ll break down what you need to know to keep your online experience secure. So, grab a coffee, and let’s chat about it.

# What Is a Free VPN?

A free VPN allows you to surf the internet anonymously without paying a dime. You get to hide your IP address and encrypt your connection. Sounds great, right?

But hold on! Here’s the kicker:

* **No Cost, But at What Price?**
   * Many free VPNs come with hidden costs. They might monetize your data or serve you ads.

# The Allure of Free VPNs

* **Zero Subscription Fee:**
   * Who doesn’t love free stuff?
* **Easy Access:**
   * Most of them are simple to download and set up.

Yet, those perks might come with strings attached. You might be trading your privacy for a free service.

# How Free VPNs Make Money

Let’s talk about how these free services stay afloat. Spoiler alert: it’s not through charity.

# Common Monetization Methods

1. **Selling User Data:**
   * Yes, you heard that right. Your browsing habits might be sold to advertisers.
2. **Ads and Tracking:**
   * Ever notice how free apps show ads? Free VPNs do the same, often tracking your behavior to serve targeted ads.
3. **Limited Features:**
   * You might have to deal with slower speeds, data caps, and fewer server options.

These practices can severely compromise your **data privacy**. Why risk it?

# Common Risks of Using Free VPNs

So, what’s the real danger of using a free VPN? Here are the big red flags:

# Data Privacy Concerns

* **Data Collection:**
   * Many free VPNs log your activities and may share your data with third parties. This can include your browsing history, IP address, and even personal information.
* **Weak Encryption:**
   * Some free services use outdated or weak encryption methods, making it easier for hackers to access your data.

# Security Issues

* **Malware Risks:**
   * Some free VPNs can introduce malware into your device. A study found that about 38% of free VPNs contained malware or adware​.
* **Phishing Attempts:**
   * Users might be targeted with phishing scams that look genuine but are meant to steal your information.

# Performance Limitations

* **Speed Throttling:**
   * Free VPNs often slow down your connection. If you’re streaming or gaming, you might be left frustrated.
* **Limited Server Access:**
   * Fewer servers mean you might have trouble accessing geo-restricted content.

# Free vs. Paid VPN Features

|Feature|Free VPN|Paid VPN|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Data Limitations**|Often restricted|Unlimited|
|**Server Locations**|Limited options|Global access|
|**Privacy**|Risky|Secure|
|**Speed**|Throttled|High-speed|
|**Advertising**|Common|Usually ad-free|

# User Testimonials and Case Studies

Real stories can really shed light on the risks of free VPNs. Let’s look at a few experiences from users who went the free route:

* **Emma’s Experience:**
   * Emma downloaded a free VPN to access streaming services. What she didn’t know was that it collected her data and sold it. She noticed an increase in ads tailored to her browsing history.
* **Jake’s Security Breach:**
   * Jake thought he was safe using a free VPN. After a malware infection, he had to wipe his device clean. That free service ended up costing him a lot more than he anticipated.

These testimonials highlight that sometimes, “free” isn’t really free.

Free VPNs might seem appealing, but they come with serious risks. When it comes to your online security, can you really afford to take the gamble?

Investing in a **paid VPN** service like **Surfshark** can provide peace of mind. You’ll enjoy stronger security features, better privacy protections, and fast, reliable connections without the nagging worry about data breaches.",1,1729108608.0,PrivacySentinel,0,1.0,False
1g58gtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g58gtf/living_a_lie_how_my_wife_deceived_me_aitah_for/,"Living a lie how my wife deceived me, AITAH for considering divorce?","I never thought I’d be writing this post, pouring my heart out to strangers online, but life has a way of turning the familiar into the unrecognizable. This is a throwaway account for privacy reasons. I’m a 37M, I’m facing the end of my marriage, an end that came crashing down.

When I first met my wife, lets call her Sarah (not her real name), everything felt perfect. We shared countless late-night conversations over coffee, discussing everything from our dreams to our beliefs. I was open about my faith, how it guided my decisions and shaped my worldview. Sarah appeared to share that passion. We laughed, cried, and prayed together, creating an illusion of harmony. She even started attending church with me, and I felt a warm sense of hope that I had found my partner for life.

When we first started dating, religion was a big topic. I’m fairly religious, and I was upfront about my beliefs and how important they are to me. I told her that I envisioned a life with someone who shares those values, especially when it comes to raising a family. She seemed to agree wholeheartedly. 

However, things started to change. Over time, I noticed that she became increasingly distant during church services, often scrolling through her phone or zoning out. I brushed it off, thinking maybe she was just going through a phase. But recently, the truth came out in a way I never expected.

One evening, we were discussing our future and what kind of values we wanted to instill in our kids. I expressed my hopes about raising them with a strong sense of faith and community. That’s when she dropped the bombshell. She told me she doesn’t care about religion at all. Not only that, but she had been pretending to be someone she’s not just to please me.

To say I was heartbroken would be an understatement. I felt the world spin beneath my feet. The woman I had shared my life with for years, the woman I had envisioned as the mother of my children, had been living a lie. My mind raced back to all those moments of connection, the laughter we shared over spiritual discussions, the way we had prayed together. It all felt like an elaborate performance, and I was the fool clapping at the end of a tragic play.

In that moment, everything shifted. I realized that I could never trust her again. How could I build a life, a family, with someone who fundamentally disagreed with my core values? I felt a mix of anger, heartbreak, and a profound sense of loss. I had invested so much into this relationship, believing we were on the same path, only to find out we were miles apart.

When I confronted her about the deceit, instead of remorse, I was met with a dismissive attitude. She shrugged, saying, “It’s just not a big deal. Why make it one?” That lack of understanding of how deeply important faith was to me was a bitter pill to swallow. I know some people might think this is overreacting, but for me, faith is a core part of my identity. 

After sleepless nights filled with anguish and reflection, I made the hardest decision of my life. I’ve decided to file for divorce. It’s not an easy decision, and it hurts to let go of what I thought was a loving partnership. But I know that staying in a relationship based on lies would only lead to more pain down the line. 

I don’t want anyone to argue about religion in the comments. I just ask that you respect my perspective and the difficult path I’ve chosen. Life is too short to live in a shadow of deceit, and I hope that by sharing my experience, others can find the courage to seek truth and authenticity in their own lives.

I’m sharing this to seek support and advice from others who may have faced similar situations. Thank you for reading. ",1,1729108604.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

# Do you know what a rug is?

First, if this was a rug, it would have been done far more aggressively all the way down the line from the much larger MC (we were at 280). We also would be much lower than 50m MC. If you spend any amount of time watching meme coin launches you'll learn what real rugs and honey pot projects are.

The amount of time Miazaki spends with the community weekly for the past 7 months in and of itself suggests otherwise. Ignoring everything else, this is wildly elaborate for such a small little return. 

Kendu is backed by exceptional high audit scores (links in the post below) and low volatility (you're not going to lose your money).

The earth isn't flat and this isn't a rug. Just breath.

# Trading Volume vs. Holder Count

*First, make sure you're monitoring the right screeners that account for CEX and DEX.* Most that I'm aware of are buying Kendu from DEX or straight from their wallets. 

Volume is lower than we'd like, that's true. We've got cult-like holders. Lots of them. 14.4k and growing daily to be exact. Nonetheless, Kendu continues to hold a higher buyer to seller ratio and so continues to grow. 

Kendu is looking to approach this differently, highlighted in the Alpha below.

We're also here without paying for ads or KOL that could artificially pump a coin before cashing out and crashing the project. I was in an X spaces the other day where several KOLs were laughing about revenge rugging projects selling their holdings out of spite for one or more of its holders. You can invest in today's hype if you want, but you better hope you don't lose your money because of some vendetta you were unaware of. 

# The $280 million marketcap thats used as FUD.

*Kendu hit that $280m mark WITHIN 2 months of launch with no paid marketing or KOLs.* **Kendu got there with organic shilling and 7k holders.**

**We now have 14.5k holders.** What do you think we Kendu with that?

What is crazy is that the community believes we got there too soon because we weren't as distributed and layered with all the Alpha that I get in to below that would actually sustain and grow that kind of market cap.

What's even crazier is that hitting $280 million in 2 months with 7k holders and no paid advertising/KOLs is the only thing fudders can ever point to as the only real ""fud"".

Redistributing, landing, consolidating and organically finding support at $50 million within 7 months without any paid advertising or KOLs is something worth fading for the same fudders that claim rug without even knowing what term really means.

***Kendu doesn’t have sell outs.*** 

# Dislike ""The Process""?

For those who complain about what Miazaki sounds like, or the things he says, then consider asking yourself this question: wtf do you think you sound like when you tell your normie friends and family that you invest in memecoins? Go invest $1k in re tard coin or pepes peepee and then look your dad in the eyes when you tell him.

Don't point a finger before looking in the mirror. Or, as a wise philosopher once said, ""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" - I. Cube.

The consolidation curve that Kendu is in from ATH is not uncommon for any memecoin that lives for 24hrs or longer. It’s a macro cycle that only gets higher highs and higher lows as it consolidates before the next pump. Then, rinse and repeat.

# Miazaki is not working alone. 

He has a team, and has highlighted the process in his ongoing Medium articles linked below. He also has a regular X spaces and Telegram video chats where anybody can ask him questions. Have one? Hop in and ask yourself. 

[What. Why. Where. Who. - The path by Kendu Miazaki](https://medium.com/@kendumiazaki)

***\*To be clear a question means A Question. Not complaining, spreading fud and disinformation while providing no substantive input or clear insight being requested\****

# The Alpha

What is uncommon about Kendu’s marketing approach is that Kendu is creating products that it then markets in order to advertise the coin. In other words, it's providing investors something tangible as a means to advertise the token. 

This in turn:

* Focuses on IRL shilling just as much as online. ***By hosting video competitions giving away rewards like $50m Kendu (\~$60k USD)*** that promote capturing the most creative, unhinged approach to shilling, and sending it. Dozens of average everyday holders have gotten paid out .. what kind of scams pays out real rewards? 
* Creates and promotes IRL products and events like Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu supplements, Kendu Nights, etc. These are owned and managed by random, individual entrepreneurs within Kendu, not associated with leadership, and most having joined after I came in. There are 10k Kendu Energy drinks being planned for free distribution at universities in Australia for free as I type this. There is Kendu coffee being served to celebrities on movie sets. They are also being sold in more and more locations, and you'll see one soon. We are everywhere IRL. 
* Replaces KOLs that control enough of the coin supply to rug a project when they inevitably cash out. Instead, Kendu relies on its community to shill. And shill they do, so aggressively that we often get confused for bots. We are people and we are working for our bags. 
* Builds an ecosystem that currently contains the NFT marketplace that gives holders an ownership stake that generates margin-based profits while utilizing those same profits to sustain the coin and the community. It’s new and it is growing. 

***This will make Kendu bear market proof.***

Kendu billboards are going up, Kendu stickers are being plastered, and countless merch being made. 

-All of this without even getting into CoinBase, ties to Shiba Inu devs, and etcetera-  

**Kendu is promoting to the masses because it intends on capturing the normie masses. Not only bringing normies into Kendu, but bringing them to Crypto.** 

Kendu isn’t just a culty memecoin, it’s a marketing empire in the making that is looking to influence crypto but redefining how a coin can grow. 

The united, focused conviction Kendu holders have reminds me of the effect that roaring kitty and gamestop investors had on traditional markets a few years ago. 

Kendu is aiming to do the same in crypto.

***So, feel free to buy in at another coin, but you might be buying at their top. At Kendu today, you know you’re buying at the retested, supported bottom.***  

**- At Kendu Inu, we do not gamble, we fuckin work -**

Happy bull run to all.

1g58fkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PopularSupplements/comments/1g58fkg/the_lost_generator_a_journey_to_energy/,The Lost Generator: A Journey to Energy Independence,"In a quiet town in the Midwest, where the snow fell thick and the nights were long, the Jackson family found themselves facing a challenge that many American families can relate to. Ben and Emily Jackson, along with their two kids, Sarah and Josh, enjoyed a simple life filled with warmth, laughter, and the comforting hum of their home. But like many, they were also grappling with the rising costs of electricity and the unpredictable nature of winter storms that often left them in the dark.

One particularly brutal winter night, the storm hit hard. The howling winds rattled the windows as the snow piled high outside, blanketing the world in white. Suddenly, the power went out. With temperatures dropping rapidly, the Jacksons scrambled to find warmth. Their aging gas-powered generator was of little help; it had failed them in their time of need. In desperation, Ben remembered a conversation he had with a colleague, Walker, a retired electrician from Roanoke, Virginia, who had been raving about something called “The Lost Generator.”

“Ben, trust me,” Walker had said over coffee, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. “This isn’t just some gimmick; it’s a game-changer. The Lost Generator could change your life.” He described how the generator was inspired by the innovative spirit of Thomas Edison, who had dreamed of harnessing energy in ways that were accessible to everyone.

Skeptical yet intrigued, Ben dialed Walker’s number. “What exactly is this Lost Generator you keep talking about?” he asked, hope mingling with doubt.

“It’s a DIY project that allows you to create your own energy source at home,” Walker explained. “It’s easy to build, requires only basic materials, and can save you a fortune on your electricity bills. Plus, it runs on thermal energy, which is all around us.”

With nothing to lose, Ben decided to take the plunge. Walker sent him the blueprints and a detailed guide, filled with step-by-step instructions on how to construct the generator. As Ben looked through the materials list, he felt a mix of excitement and apprehension. Could he really build something that would power his home?

Ben enlisted the help of his teenage son, Josh. Together, they headed to the local hardware store, armed with the list Walker had provided. “Look at all this stuff, Dad,” Josh said, his eyes wide with curiosity. “It’s just a bunch of regular items. How is this going to make electricity?”

Ben smiled, feeling a spark of inspiration. “It’s about what we can create together. We’re taking control of our energy future.”

Back home in the garage, Ben and Josh set to work, their hands deftly assembling parts as they followed the blueprints. The design was straightforward, based on clever concepts that even a novice like Ben could grasp. As they worked side by side, Josh’s initial skepticism faded. The father and son duo bonded over tools and wires, the laughter echoing in the chilly garage.

After just under two hours, the moment of truth arrived. Ben’s heart raced as they prepared to fire up The Lost Generator. He flicked the switch, and with a soft whirring sound, the device sprang to life. “It’s working! It’s really working!” Ben exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with disbelief. The generator hummed steadily, a reassuring sound that filled the air with a sense of hope.

[The Lost Generator](https://preview.redd.it/f2sucbfn13vd1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bad8eec41d63b6e0f3efade62bbbaba068bb090)

While their neighbors struggled through the blackout, the Jacksons enjoyed the warmth of their home, powered by their newly built generator. They had heat, light, and even the ability to keep their food fresh—all thanks to their DIY effort. Sarah, who had rolled her eyes at the whole project initially, was now grateful for the power they had harnessed. She joined her brother in playing board games by the soft glow of their lights, laughter filling the space.

As the days passed and the storm cleared, word spread through the neighborhood about the Jacksons’ success. Friends and neighbors, like the O’Connors and the Simmses, came knocking on their door, curious about this newfound power source. Emily welcomed them in, eager to share their experience. “It’s not just about having electricity; it’s about being able to take care of ourselves,” she explained, pride swelling in her chest.

“Can we really build one, too?” a neighbor asked, eyes filled with hope.

“Absolutely!” Ben replied, beaming. He handed out copies of the blueprints and instructions, feeling a sense of purpose as he empowered others to take charge of their energy independence.

As the community came together, families across the town began building their own Lost Generators, inspired by the Jacksons’ resilience. The phenomenon spread like wildfire, with people from all walks of life discovering the power of renewable energy right in their backyards. Whether they were concerned about rising costs, the environment, or simply the unpredictability of the power grid, families realized that The Lost Generator was more than just a project; it was a lifeline.

Reflecting on their journey, Ben realized that the greatest takeaway was not merely the money saved on electricity bills, although that was a considerable benefit. It was the peace of mind that came with knowing he could protect his family from whatever challenges lay ahead. Whether faced with a blizzard, a hurricane, or just the occasional power outage, the Jacksons were now equipped with their own reliable source of power.

As they settled back into their daily lives, Ben dreamed of future projects. Perhaps they’d explore solar panels or wind energy next. But for now, The Lost Generator had given them exactly what they needed: energy independence, peace of mind, and a profound sense of empowerment. They were no longer at the mercy of energy companies or an aging infrastructure; they had taken matters into their own hands.

And so, the story of The Lost Generator continued, not just for the Jacksons but for families all across the country—an inspiring tale of hope, resilience, and the unwavering spirit of DIY ingenuity in the heart of America. **If you want more info about The Lost Generator visit official website:** [**https://thelostgenerator.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/LostGenerator.html)",1,1729108511.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

At first BM didn’t want anything to do with me said I’d have to wait 3 months before I could be around the kids but boyfriend and I have known each other since we were in diapers so I met the kids as soon as possible. So she had to get over that. But she would constantly text him about their past relationship together. And I told her to stop she did it at least 3 times after asking her to stop. So I figured I just needed to sit down with this girl let her know I’m here to stay. My boyfriend and I have been together now for 4 months and we live together I took BM out for lunch and a shopping trip. And she literally told me she still loves him  and wants him to give her another chance basically crying to me barking up the wrong tree. The reason they broke up in the first place is she cheated and had been cheating for months. That was a year ago next month. But recently. I was at work and my boyfriend brought me dinner was super cute I could’ve died but then he went and ruined my appetite saying BMs father is dying from cancer and she asked him to bring her some sugar. And he was gonna do it. And he asked me if it was ok. What was I supposed to say? Like no you can’t ? Well he does. Next day he tells me he brought her sugar and creamer. My question is why did she ask him to get those things for her. He said he was thinking the sugar was for his kids. When clearly she just wanted some coffee or to see him. Or use him. I don’t think it was innocence. Because she said the reason she didn’t want to get out was because their daughter was sick.. makes sense but why didn’t she ask her roommate to run to the store or her parents? And to top it off. We are all going to chuckecheeses today? But their daughter was sick yesterday.?? I don’t think she thinks I’m going to be there. Tbh. Am I being crazy?

Is it always this hard with other parents?

# Do you know what a rug is?

First, if this was a rug, it would have been done far more aggressively all the way down the line from the much larger MC (we were at 280). We also would be much lower than 50m MC. If you spend any amount of time watching meme coin launches you'll learn what real rugs and honey pot projects are.

The amount of time Miazaki spends with the community weekly for the past 7 months in and of itself suggests otherwise. Ignoring everything else, this is wildly elaborate for such a small little return. 

Kendu is backed by exceptional high audit scores (links in the post below) and low volatility (you're not going to lose your money).

The earth isn't flat and this isn't a rug. Just breath.

# Trading Volume vs. Holder Count

*First, make sure you're monitoring the right screeners that account for CEX and DEX.* Most that I'm aware of are buying Kendu from DEX or straight from their wallets. 

Volume is lower than we'd like, that's true. We've got cult-like holders. Lots of them. 14.4k and growing daily to be exact. Nonetheless, Kendu continues to hold a higher buyer to seller ratio and so continues to grow. 

Kendu is looking to approach this differently, highlighted in the Alpha below.

We're also here without paying for ads or KOL that could artificially pump a coin before cashing out and crashing the project. I was in an X spaces the other day where several KOLs were laughing about revenge rugging projects selling their holdings out of spite for one or more of its holders. You can invest in today's hype if you want, but you better hope you don't lose your money because of some vendetta you were unaware of. 

# The $280 million marketcap thats used as FUD.

*Kendu hit that $280m mark WITHIN 2 months of launch with no paid marketing or KOLs.* **Kendu got there with organic shilling and 7k holders.**

**We now have 14.5k holders.** What do you think we Kendu with that?

What is crazy is that the community believes we got there too soon because we weren't as distributed and layered with all the Alpha that I get in to below that would actually sustain and grow that kind of market cap.

What's even crazier is that hitting $280 million in 2 months with 7k holders and no paid advertising/KOLs is the only thing fudders can ever point to as the only real ""fud"".

Redistributing, landing, consolidating and organically finding support at $50 million within 7 months without any paid advertising or KOLs is something worth fading for the same fudders that claim rug without even knowing what term really means.

***Kendu doesn’t have sell outs.*** 

# Dislike ""The Process""?

For those who complain about what Miazaki sounds like, or the things he says, then consider asking yourself this question: wtf do you think you sound like when you tell your normie friends and family that you invest in memecoins? Go invest $1k in re tard coin or pepes peepee and then look your dad in the eyes when you tell him.

Don't point a finger before looking in the mirror. Or, as a wise philosopher once said, ""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" - I. Cube.

The consolidation curve that Kendu is in from ATH is not uncommon for any memecoin that lives for 24hrs or longer. It’s a macro cycle that only gets higher highs and higher lows as it consolidates before the next pump. Then, rinse and repeat.

# Miazaki is not working alone.

I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special 

I’m looking for preferably a girl best friends but anyone is welcome I also don’t mind any age . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

For those who complain about what Miazaki sounds like, or the things he says, then consider asking yourself this question: wtf do you think you sound like when you tell your normie friends and family that you invest in memecoins? Go invest $1k in re tard coin or pepes peepee and then look your dad in the eyes when you tell him.

Don't point a finger before looking in the mirror. Or, as a wise philosopher once said, ""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" - I. Cube.

The consolidation curve that Kendu is in from ATH is not uncommon for any memecoin that lives for 24hrs or longer. It’s a macro cycle that only gets higher highs and higher lows as it consolidates before the next pump. Then, rinse and repeat.

# Miazaki is not working alone. 

He has a team, and has highlighted the process in his ongoing Medium articles linked below. He also has a regular X spaces and Telegram video chats where anybody can ask him questions. Have one? Hop in and ask yourself. 

[What. Why. Where. Who. - The path by Kendu Miazaki](https://medium.com/@kendumiazaki)

***\*To be clear a question means A Question. Not complaining, spreading fud and disinformation while providing no substantive input or clear insight being requested\****

# The Alpha

What is uncommon about Kendu’s marketing approach is that Kendu is creating products that it then markets in order to advertise the coin. In other words, it's providing investors something tangible as a means to advertise the token. 

This in turn:

* Focuses on IRL shilling just as much as online. ***By hosting video competitions giving away rewards like $50m Kendu (\~$60k USD)*** that promote capturing the most creative, unhinged approach to shilling, and sending it. Dozens of average everyday holders have gotten paid out .. what kind of scams pays out real rewards? 
* Creates and promotes IRL products and events like Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu supplements, Kendu Nights, etc. These are owned and managed by random, individual entrepreneurs within Kendu, not associated with leadership, and most having joined after I came in. There are 10k Kendu Energy drinks being planned for free distribution at universities in Australia for free as I type this. There is Kendu coffee being served to celebrities on movie sets. They are also being sold in more and more locations, and you'll see one soon. We are everywhere IRL. 
* Replaces KOLs that control enough of the coin supply to rug a project when they inevitably cash out. Instead, Kendu relies on its community to shill. And shill they do, so aggressively that we often get confused for bots. We are people and we are working for our bags. 
* Builds an ecosystem that currently contains the NFT marketplace that gives holders an ownership stake that generates margin-based profits while utilizing those same profits to sustain the coin and the community. It’s new and it is growing. 

***This will make Kendu bear market proof.***

Kendu billboards are going up, Kendu stickers are being plastered, and countless merch being made. 

-All of this without even getting into CoinBase, ties to Shiba Inu devs, and etcetera-  

**Kendu is promoting to the masses because it intends on capturing the normie masses. Not only bringing normies into Kendu, but bringing them to Crypto.** 

Kendu isn’t just a culty memecoin, it’s a marketing empire in the making that is looking to influence crypto but redefining how a coin can grow. 

The united, focused conviction Kendu holders have reminds me of the effect that roaring kitty and gamestop investors had on traditional markets a few years ago. 

Kendu is aiming to do the same in crypto.

***So, feel free to buy in at another coin, but you might be buying at their top. At Kendu today, you know you’re buying at the retested, supported bottom.***  

**- At Kendu Inu, we do not gamble, we fuckin work -**

Happy bull run to all.

1g589xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g589xk/aitah_are_wetah_for_not_getting_approval_from_my/,Aitah (are WEtah) for not getting 'approval' from my ex before dating ,"This is weird AF to me. I have been with my SO now for 3 years. We knew each other before dating, we were both in the same friends group and they had all been friends since childhood (they moved into the city and met me later in life, when I was around 20). He divorced in 2018 and had been single since then. My relationship was rough, it ended on a pretty bad note, and then even after he was still trying to find ways to manipulate and control me. 

I was with my ex for about 6 years. He met those friends through me, but never made much attempt to be their friends so after we broke up he never talked to them again. I never ran into him at events or places, he lived in another town and I didn't see him out ever. But when we'd broken up, he would message or call me like something very tragic and urgent happened and I needed to get in touch right away, and then when I did it was nothing at all and he'd even be surprised I took it that was. I ended up blocking him on everything and he made vague but very serious posts online that came across to many people like he was going to hurt himself. They all panicked and, unable to reach him, started reaching out to me. I initially was worried and reached out to him, it worked how he wanted it to. He said ""oh people take things too seriously these days, I just meant I'm taking a social media break and they're reading was too much into it"" I was sent screenshots by these people, that was not the implication in the post. It pissed me off tbh because I had just that month lost 2 friends with no warning. So that's when I changed my number. He thought that worked once he'd try it again, he posted something similar but with more urgency. This time when people sent it to me I told them if they were worried to contact his family, call a wellness check. Don't keep calling me I don't live near him I'm not his gf anymore, and they did. And he flipped out about it but it seemed to stop. 

3 years went by after we broke up before I even started dating again. I actually ended up asking my friend out for coffee, we had always clicked so well as friends and being both single for a while we decided to spend more time together and things progressed slowly and naturally. We both want to take things slow, and it's honestly been amazing. We're so happy. 

So that means I had broken up with my ex 6 years ago at this point. And I haven't heard from him at all since that last attempt he made. I blocked him, I deleted my social media accounts, I changed my number, and started a new job. Even if he tried to reach out I didn't know and it's been so peaceful and happy since, I haven't even thought about it. None of my friends have even thought about him since. He's ancient history. 

So WHY did he show up at a beer only brewery (he doesn't drink beer) NOT INVITED to a PRIVATE party they were hosting for my friend who owns part of it??? I guess he saw some of the discussion about it online from my friends and the brewery idk. But he shows up and walks in like he's been invited and everyone's like, why is he here. Half these people don't know him, so everyone all together at least knows he's not supposed to be here. Before he even gets halfway in he's stopped and asked to leave. I thought that was that. 

But we get home, and my bf sees a message from him on Instagram. They haven't spoken since long before we broke up, it was from 2017 asking directions to a bbq we went to at his old place. 

So the new message is a mile long rambling about how he saw we were dating from people's stories (my bf is a private account, they're not connected on Instagram, and he also never posts on it, so my ex had to be searching through stories and posts of people we hang out with to see that since I'm not online). He said that he doesn't approve of our relationship, he says HE never came to him asking if it was ok to date as he should have before making any moves, and if he did, my ex would have told him no. So therefore, my bf needs to do the right thing and break things off because this is crossing the line. 

This is when I had a flashback suddenly to a moment in my past relationship. When this guy he knew online (he had a huge amount of friends online) was posting a lot of updates about his ex too and my bf messaged him out of the blue like ""hey are you dating my x S?"" The guy replied ""We have been spending a lot of time together but haven't put a label on it yet, it's still really new, but I like her a lot and I think it might go that way yes"" and my ex did the same thing, writing out this novel long reply like ""well, I'm not comfortable with that at all, I don't think it's appropriate. That's my ex and it's different if it was any other girl out there but you don't date your friends ex's"" and this guy said back ""I don't see it that way, I just met you once, we have nearly never interacted after that irl or online, and it seems like you just don't want anyone dating your ex because she told me you've sent this same message to people she's dated before"". 

I remember it starting an argument with us too, because him and this ex was not connected at all, they were not in contact, he didn't have her phone number didn't follow her online, so why was he so invested about who she's with that he's done this multiple times?! And I was like, you're dating ME right now, you should be focused on our relationship why are you bothering to think about her and who she's with at all? And he said stuff like, it's just the proper way things are done, you don't do that you respect your guys enough to not do that. And I said, this isn't your 'guy' this is some dude you met once and added online and never talk to. 

Now here I was on the other side of it too. I told my bf I didn't want anything to do with him, I don't want him involved in my life or my choices whatsoever, and my bf decided to leave him on read and just block him. I appreciated that. My bf even said it was super weird to do, he was saying it might be different if we were all actually friends and involved in our lives like, at work or events, but he's never popped up a single time before this. Now he wants to demand approval and I can't see who I please without his blessing? Any guy who's ever heard of him needs his approval? Absolutely not. I felt like this was insane. 

But here's why I'm tripping about this now. I mentioned it to one of our other friends, who's had a bit more history with dating. He said that's a totally normal thing to do and maybe we should have just messaged him beforehand so it wasn't such a shock later. I'm no contact, but my bf doing it, as the man, would be a sign of respect. He should know to do that. And I was honestly astounded. I would have honestly been heated if I discovered the man I choose to date, went behind my back to message my ex that i had to go no contact with because of how bad things ended, to tell him my personal information that I keep offline specifically because I didn't want to deal with exactly that. It would have been a betrayal. And my bf sees it that way too he thinks it's crazy people think that's the RIGHT thing to do. But yet here we are being told my people that's what should have happened??? 

Now, my ex and those people are a generation older (gen x) and I don't know if this is just the way they have done things. I have never before heard that, and it's not like they're the first gen x people I've ever encountered but I considered maybe it was uncommon even for them and they've just been some of the last people holding on to that. I personally think it's far more likely that that just think they're entitled to bless or deny the activity of their exes as though they're property that can be given or taken even after leaving, like they are so desperate for control and manipulation that they force their hand this way and make people think it's totally normal. I even dropped that friend completely after he said that to us. But now I'm here to ask you guys, is this normal?! Are we the assholes for NOT knowing and doing this?

1g588w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1g588w1/should_i_let_my_sb_go/,Should I let my SB go?,"I am a 35yo married SD living live in country A. Last month, I flew to country B for a short trip and arranged for a 2 day meetup on SA with a 25yo SB, Anne.

We had amazing bedroom and ""public"" chemistry. It was the best SR first meetup I've ever had. I was Anne's first physical SD meet and second guy she slept with after her ex. We both thought this would be my only trip to country B for a while, but we clicked so well that I impulsively visited again 2 weeks later. We had an amazing time again, this time with a pregnancy scare that we bonded over.

After that, she opened up more about her life. She is in some debt. She is considering a career switch. She wants a marriage soon but won't expect from me because I am married. She feels overwhelmed by men's attention. She has financial and life goals in mind but feel falling short despite being headturning gorgeous. My theory is, her dating her ex for 7 years somewhat stunted her early adulthood growth. She has the mind and heart of a teenage girl. Thats probably what drew me to her.

I flew to her for the third time last weekend, again had an amazing time. Two days prior, she reactivated seeking as petty revenge after I told her I met a SB over coffee in my country. She received dozens of offers in just a day before she deactivated. While we had a great time, I noticed she was replying to many messages. From what she told me, one SD clearly drew her attention. He's attractive, offers her roughly double my allowance, and sent her a photo of his 10inch dick (vs my 6inch)

I genuinely believe he's a better SD candidate than me, if only for the reason that he's single and lives in her city. In our monthlong texting, I've always expressed that I am not possessive, and won't mind her sleeping with other people. She has responded to that with anger because she felt it was my lack of emotional commitment. Now, I can see she's genuinely contemplating this offer. She started apologizing to me about being possessive and said she won't mind me sleeping with other girls, emotionally laying the path for both of us to be non exclusive.

We discussed flying her to me for a 2 week visit many times, but I need to give her some show money for immigration. I can tell her to forget about this guy, just come to me. The SR will likely run its natural course in a few months anyways. Or I can somewhat prematurely end what has been an emotionally and physically rewarding SR, to avoid some emotional damage on either of us.

1g586uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/1g586uz/back_to_the_basics_with_bear/,Back to the Basics with Bear,"Sometime during this last summer, I passed my 10 year mark of successfully completing my first month of eating this way. Back then, that mattered because we didn't count from our first attempt at eating this way. If we could, I would be able to date my tenure several months earlier. It was a different world back then. This way of eating was virtually unknown. The downside was that you really were going off into the wilderness almost on your own. The upside was that the information was limited to what was known to work. These days, everyone is talking about ""carnivore,"" even though it seems like the majority aren't doing it and don't understand it.  In this post, I am going to take you back. I am going to take you back to the basics. This will tell you what carnivore is and how it is supposed to be done. I'm going to use the words of ""The Bear"" for structure, because he was a modern contemporary example of actually doing it.

Who is the Bear? That's an interesting question. He's not a one-dimensional figure. For our purposes, I will allow him to introduce himself as he did:

>I have been eating the natural human dietary regime for over 47 years now. I do not eat anything whatsoever from vegetable sources. The only things veggie I use are spices. My diet is usually 60% fat and 40% protein by calories. I used to eat 80/20 when younger and about twice as much quantity of meat also, but that seems too much energy at my age, which is 71- even though I am very active.

The Bear found ""The Fat of the Land"" in his early days and started to eat that way. He ate this way until he died in a car accident. While he was still around, he shared his experience and his rules. He had what is normally summed up as 7 rules. At different times, he shared different rules. But, they usually included the same ideas.

From his original thread:

>Eat only from the animal kingdom. Avoid eating carby animal food, like lactose (dairy) and more than a very small, occasional, few ounces of liver.

>Do not measure what you eat and do not worry about variety.

>Do as little cooking of your food as you can tolerate.

>Eat the fatty part preferentially in each meal first, then finish as much of the lean as you want. Leftovers will keep.

>You do not need 'recipes' or 'sample meals' to follow.

>When away from home, no matter if it is a restaurant, family or friends, or business meal, eat only from the animal kingdom, avoid the rest, practice doing this unassumingly and make pleasant, distracting comments if bailed up on it. Learn to politely refuse alcohol.

From ZIOH:

>1- Eat only from the animal world (eggs, fish, red meat and fowl and some dairy are all animal-sourced foods, i.e.: meat).

>2- Eat nothing from the vegetable world whatsoever. (Very small amounts of flavourings such as garlic/chillies/spices/herbs which may be added, are not ‘food’).

>3- On diary: avoid milk and yoghurt (heavy carbs- lactose), use only pure (not ‘thickened’- heavy) cream (read the label), cheese and unsalted butter.

>4- Don’t cook your meat very much- just a little bit on the outside- for flavour- blood-rare or bleu. For this reason I advise against eating pork.

>5- Eat liver and brains only very infrequently- they are full of carbs.

>6- Be sure to have plenty of fat of animal origin at each meal and eat mostly of the fat until you feel you have had enough- you can eat more lean at this point if you like- calories are not important, nor is the number of meals/day. Vegetable oils are not good food.

>7- You do not need any supplements of any kind. Drink a lot of water and do not add salt to anything.

From ""Bear's Words of Wisdom""

>• Eat only food from animals  
• No vegetables  
• Limit liver intake  
• Avoid liquid milk (except for butter and cheese)  
• Eat as much fat as you like  
• Don’t cook your food much  
• Avoid salt  
And the most important one: Eat your meals as a matter of course, don’t waste any time thinking about food–it is merely a way to stay alive, and must not rule your life.  
By the way, for many obese people low carb does not work–only zero carb does (defined as less than 5 g/day).

So, there it is.  If it's not in the above rules, it isn't carnivore or it doesn't matter. Now look carefully, do you see how these rules differ from a lot of the ""carnivore"" plans that people are promoting? Do you see a difference in attitude and approach?

First, ""don't waste time thinking about food."" No recipes or sample meals or daily food guides. Don't measure shit, don't track stuff, don't obsess about purity and details. If you're out to eat, do your best to stick to pure meat, but don't obsess about trace amounts of impurities. That's the path to an eating disorder. Eat like an animal, you are one.  If you happen to end up consuming a trace amount of sugar or flour, while eating out, it's not a huge deal for most people. You move on and your body will be fine.

Second, limit liver and salt consumption. The modern ""gurus"" almost universally try and push over-consumption of both of these up to and way past the point of causing illness. You don't need either, ever. The people pushing these items are making their inexperience and ignorance obvious by putting it on display.

Third, dairy isn't a free food that you can just consume tons of. No milk. Creams and cheeses are more like seasonings than full foods. And butter is fine, but it's not something to cram down your gullet or hide in your coffee to consume extra.

Fourth, seasonings are fine. At least in the trivial amounts you should be using them. It doesn't take a lot to add flavor to meat. So often, I see people freaking out about how they are bored and can't eat. Then I also find out they are doing some super-weird and super-restrictive diet like only beef without any seasonings. That's silly. That's not required. There's no award for dumbest way to be carnivore or hardest time adapting. Actually, the award for hardest time adapting seems to be complete failure to adapt.

That's it folks. It really is. Eat fatty animal meat. Eat often and as much as you want. Stop thinking too much about it. Don't freak out about a little seasoning. Avoid vegetable oils and salt, but you also don't need to freak out and obsess about perfectly avoiding them. If you're thinking about this, you're making it harder than it is. And, yeah, carbs do still count. That's especially true for obese people. And, that means 0-5 g/day or you're going to have a bad time.",2,1729107882.0,zerocarb,0,0.75,False
1g586nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1g586nf/first_time_barista_am_i_doing_ok/,First time barista... Am I doing OK? ,"Hello everyone,
I know this is a bit of a dumb question, and also hard to answer since you can't actually see me work, but I'm going to ask anyway. 

I (24F) started my first job as a barista 4 weeks ago, I'm working part-time as I look for a job in my field of study. Currently, I do dishwasher, tables, cash register and handing out sandwiches/croissants. I'm not on coffee making yet, as that's probably the most complicated thing to learn. 

After the first week, my manager told me he was happy and that he'd renew my contract as soon as the current one was over (I have a short-term one as a trial period). Other coworkers have also told me that I'm doing good, in different ways and situations. 

However, I've been placed on closing shift a few times recently, and my manager made a comment about how I should try to be faster and more autonomous like all my other coworkers. For context, we close at 7 and we're supposed to have al the closing tasks done by 7:30... There's 2 people working the closing shifts, and me and the other woman finished at 8:30 last time and 8 this time. 

Here is where my question comes in: is it okay that I'm still somewhat slow? I'm able to complete all the tasks I'm told to do, and I do them well (I haven't heard any complaints) but should I be faster? Has it been long enough to expect me to be as fast as my coworkers? 

This is probably just my insecurity talking, and I'm working on not thinking about it as much, but I wanted to hear it from actual barista out there. Is 4 weeks long enough?

1g5869p,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1g5869p/stop_putting_off_going_to_the_dentist_even_if_you/,Stop putting off going to the dentist. Even if you brush your teeth twice daily and floss daily this is what can happen. Learn from my mistakes!,"**There's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news. Hopefully this will help motivate you to book that dentist appointment.** 

The *reason* I hadn't seen a dentist in eight years felt legitimate. It was because eight years ago I had a traumatic experience where I opted to go laughing-gas free (to save money) while getting my impacted wisdon teeth removed. Big mistake. They literally had to hammer my teeth out. I begged for laughing gas part way through and they said it was too late to stop. 

Naturally, I wanted to avoid the dentist at all costs after that. I was cavity free at the time, so I figured as long as I diligently brushed twice a day for two minutes with a good electric toothbrush, and never skipped flossing, and used alcohol-free mouthwash, that I might be in the clear, right? But then I met a guy who goes to the dentist twice a year, and he was shocked and vaguely repulsed that I hadn't been in so long. So last week I finally decided to just man up and do it. 

**The bad news:** At this visit I learned that I have not one, not two, but TWELVE cavities. And that my gums have larger gaps than they're supposed to...full of hardened bacteria or something like that (not gonna lie, I can't quite remember that part haha.) I was shocked because I thought I was taking such good care of my teeth, but apparently without professional cleanings, there's only so much you can do. 

**The good news:** Luckily my largest cavity is still small enough to fill. If I had let it go any longer apparently I could have needed a root canal. So I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. *(Though I had a friend who had to get a couple root canals, and even a couple of dental implants, and she lived. So even that is not the end of the world, my friends.)* The other good news is that after I finish the deep cleaning treatments (which they have to do in four segments because it's too intense to get it all done at once. They have to use novocaine and everything.) and after I get these cavities filled, as long as I start getting two professional cleanings a year, everything should be all good and much healthier. But this whole things is going to cost several thousand dollars, so dammit I'm kicking myself for not going all along like I should have.

**Fun facts I learned:**  1. Don't brush your teeth right after eating. That can just push the sugar and acids into your teeth and spread it around. Instead, rinse with water, or mouthwash, or chew sugar-free gum. Wait 30 minutes and THEN brush your teeth. I thought I was being so good by brushing right after eating. But nope! 

2. Coffee and alcohol and sugary beverages can be worse for your teeth than candy or dessert. Because you drink them over a longer period of time and they're super acidic which can lead to enamel loss and cavities etc. So make sure you drink your beverage faster (unless its alcohol, haha) and rinse your mouth out after. Then after 30 mins brush your teeth. 

  
**TL;DR:** Go to the dentist! Brushing and flossing 2x a day can only do so much. Even doing those things diligently, I still ended up with 12 cavities in eight years of avoiding the dentist. Professional cleanings twice a year are essential for preventing this!

If caffeine is a trigger for both anemia and rosacea, and I have both, how am I supposed to function in society without it??? I can’t be red and half dying all week anymore. It’s exhausting. 

I have adhd and have since I was dx at 8, and I take vyvanse which works really well for me (my pcp wanted me to drop it when she was trying to treat my anemia, but that’s a different bag of cats). I’ve tried going up on the dosage but it causes more anxiety than it is worth.

I just moved to a small town in Texas after a pretty bad breakup and its been pretty lonely here. Not tryna talk about my ex, just looking to regularly talk to some people and play some videogames if you're into that.

Aside from playing 7 days to Die, I spend a good amount of time meditating. I love esoterics and could give full blown lectures on metaphysics. Lol. Honestly, you gotta tell me when to shut up about it.

I'm a coffee connoisseur, was a barista for 3 years and worked at a roaster for a bit. How do you like your coffee? It'd be a great way to start the conversation.

I'm also a HUGE fan of music. Literally everything except country. Definitely metalhead/goth/punk leaning but I also get down to reggae, dubstep, lofi, hip-hop, jazz, will even throw on some classical from time to time. I'd love to swap bands with you!

I've started a hobby of making homemade mead and that's been super fun and interesting. I've been in the food science industry for a bit (chocolate mostly) so it's super fascinating to me to understand the mechanics behind it.

I enjoy anime and horror. First anime was Trigun, favorite horror film is As Above, So Below. I haven't divulged as many hours into anime as I'd like, so recommendations are always welcome! Superhero media is also very welcome here!

I used to be an avid reader so any books you want to add to my ever-growing list would be appreciated!

I've got other interests as well, but I guess you'll have to hit me up and find out! Love hearing about other people's passions as well and generally learning new things.

1g585gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1g585gp/easy_to_prep_proteins/,Easy to prep proteins?,"Hi! I’ve been doing a calorie deficit and some other dietary and lifestyle changes in the past month. I’m finding it hard to nail down my meals and would like some advice.

I’ve just switched my breakfast from a breakfast sandwich to simply 3 eggs (scrambled in 1tbsp butter) a scoop of protein powder in an iced coffee with heavy cream (25g protein). 

As for my lunches, it’s in the air whether or not I’ll have dinner leftovers to heat up, and I’m in office just 3 days a week. However I am up EARLY so I have a current consistent lunch I pack when there are no leftovers. Its:

- 2 rice cakes, with a tbsp of Kraft smooth PB on top each
- 1 Granny Smith apple
- 1 fibre 1 brownie, or “heavenly hunks” oatmeal cookie.
- 2 cups white cheddar smartfood

I enjoy these foods, they’re not hard to put together in the morning, and they maintain my goal of 500-600 calories at lunch. But I’m simply not getting enough protein. I’m not in control of what I eat for dinner as its my husbands joy to cook from me, so I fly by the seat of my pants with how much protein I get in that meal, which I’m okay with. But it does mean I have to increase my protein either in breakfast or lunch.

Here in Canada, proteins can be on the pricier side, so keep that in mind, but it’s not a dealbreaker if the quicker-to-prep items add onto the price a little bit. What could I get or prep that would be easy for these non-leftover lunch days? I have access to a microwave at work. I’m open to whatever I should be swapping out in that lunch I listed, or even breakfast if folks think that’s where the change is needed. As I said, I’m very new to dieting and these habits.

Thanks, all 😊

We were at a bar and Tom came along and we chatted for a lot of the night. We found out we both work quite close to each other and he suggested we grab a coffee one day after work or during lunch. He then also asked if I wanted to come to his birthday drinks the following weekend which I happily said yes to. 

So the weekend comes around and I go with my friend to Toms birthday drinks. Turns out he invited a huge number of people and was running back and forth between groups of people all night. We didn't get to talk much but did have a few exchanges. I ended up talking to a friend of his for a lot of the night, let's call him Jerry. Jerry was nice, attractive and smart but I certainly felt a lot more attraction towards Tom. Jerry asked me for my number when I left which I agreed to. Although Jerry and I had some really great conversations I was kinda sad I didn't get to spend more time with Tom. 

So the next day I messaged Tom and asked him if he'd still be down to grab a coffee at some point or maybe even drinks. He suggested we go for a run and grab a coffee sometime (we had established we were both runners the first time we met) which sounded great to me and I agreed. He's gone away for work for a bit so we're waiting till he's back to get a date in the diary. 

Then earlier today Jerry messaged me to ask if I'd like to go for dinner with him. So now I'm not sure what to do, because if Tom and Jerry weren't friends, I wouldn't hesitate to meet Jerry and get to know him better. But I'm much more attracted to Tom and so don't think it would be a good idea to go out with his friend. I don't know how close they are but I'm sure it wouldn't be a good idea. The only thing is I'm not even 100% sure if Tom has asked me out on a date. For some reason going for a run together feels quite platonic to me, but I'm not sure. 

I'm also not sure what I should say to Jerry. I can't tell him it's because I want to go on a date with his friend, but I also don't want to lie and say I'm not ready for dating or something like that. I suppose I could say I'm not interested but it feels harsh because I would be if it weren't for Tom...",1,1729107679.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1g583we,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/comments/1g583we/back_to_the_basics_with_bear/,Back to the Basics with Bear,"Sometime during this last summer, I passed my 10 year mark of successfully completing my first month of eating this way. Back then, that mattered because we didn't count from our first attempt at eating this way. If we could, I would be able to date my tenure several months earlier. It was a different world back then. This way of eating was virtually unknown. The downside was that you really were going off into the wilderness almost on your own. The upside was that the information was limited to what was known to work. These days, everyone is talking about ""carnivore,"" even though it seems like the majority aren't doing it and don't understand it.  In this post, I am going to take you back. I am going to take you back to the basics. This will tell you what carnivore is and how it is supposed to be done. I'm going to use the words of ""The Bear"" for structure, because he was a modern contemporary example of actually doing it.

Who is the Bear? That's an interesting question. He's not a one-dimensional figure. For our purposes, I will allow him to introduce himself as he did:

>I have been eating the natural human dietary regime for over 47 years now. I do not eat anything whatsoever from vegetable sources. The only things veggie I use are spices. My diet is usually 60% fat and 40% protein by calories. I used to eat 80/20 when younger and about twice as much quantity of meat also, but that seems too much energy at my age, which is 71- even though I am very active.

The Bear found ""The Fat of the Land"" in his early days and started to eat that way. He ate this way until he died in a car accident. While he was still around, he shared his experience and his rules. He had what is normally summed up as 7 rules. At different times, he shared different rules. But, they usually included the same ideas.

From his original thread:

>Eat only from the animal kingdom. Avoid eating carby animal food, like lactose (dairy) and more than a very small, occasional, few ounces of liver.

>Do not measure what you eat and do not worry about variety.

>Do as little cooking of your food as you can tolerate.

>Eat the fatty part preferentially in each meal first, then finish as much of the lean as you want. Leftovers will keep.

>You do not need 'recipes' or 'sample meals' to follow.

>When away from home, no matter if it is a restaurant, family or friends, or business meal, eat only from the animal kingdom, avoid the rest, practice doing this unassumingly and make pleasant, distracting comments if bailed up on it. Learn to politely refuse alcohol.

From ZIOH:

>1- Eat only from the animal world (eggs, fish, red meat and fowl and some dairy are all animal-sourced foods, i.e.: meat).

>2- Eat nothing from the vegetable world whatsoever. (Very small amounts of flavourings such as garlic/chillies/spices/herbs which may be added, are not ‘food’).

>3- On diary: avoid milk and yoghurt (heavy carbs- lactose), use only pure (not ‘thickened’- heavy) cream (read the label), cheese and unsalted butter.

>4- Don’t cook your meat very much- just a little bit on the outside- for flavour- blood-rare or bleu. For this reason I advise against eating pork.

>5- Eat liver and brains only very infrequently- they are full of carbs.

>6- Be sure to have plenty of fat of animal origin at each meal and eat mostly of the fat until you feel you have had enough- you can eat more lean at this point if you like- calories are not important, nor is the number of meals/day. Vegetable oils are not good food.

>7- You do not need any supplements of any kind. Drink a lot of water and do not add salt to anything.

From ""Bear's Words of Wisdom""

>• Eat only food from animals  
• No vegetables  
• Limit liver intake  
• Avoid liquid milk (except for butter and cheese)  
• Eat as much fat as you like  
• Don’t cook your food much  
• Avoid salt  
And the most important one: Eat your meals as a matter of course, don’t waste any time thinking about food–it is merely a way to stay alive, and must not rule your life.  
By the way, for many obese people low carb does not work–only zero carb does (defined as less than 5 g/day).

So, there it is.  If it's not in the above rules, it isn't carnivore or it doesn't matter. Now look carefully, do you see how these rules differ from a lot of the ""carnivore"" plans that people are promoting? Do you see a difference in attitude and approach?

First, ""don't waste time thinking about food."" No recipes or sample meals or daily food guides. Don't measure shit, don't track stuff, don't obsess about purity and details. If you're out to eat, do your best to stick to pure meat, but don't obsess about trace amounts of impurities. That's the path to an eating disorder. Eat like an animal, you are one.  If you happen to end up consuming a trace amount of sugar or flour, while eating out, it's not a huge deal for most people. You move on and your body will be fine.

Second, limit liver and salt consumption. The modern ""gurus"" almost universally try and push over-consumption of both of these up to and way past the point of causing illness. You don't need either, ever. The people pushing these items are making their inexperience and ignorance obvious by putting it on display.

Third, dairy isn't a free food that you can just consume tons of. No milk. Creams and cheeses are more like seasonings than full foods. And butter is fine, but it's not something to cram down your gullet or hide in your coffee to consume extra.

Fourth, seasonings are fine. At least in the trivial amounts you should be using them. It doesn't take a lot to add flavor to meat. So often, I see people freaking out about how they are bored and can't eat. Then I also find out they are doing some super-weird and super-restrictive diet like only beef without any seasonings. That's silly. That's not required. There's no award for dumbest way to be carnivore or hardest time adapting. Actually, the award for hardest time adapting seems to be complete failure to adapt.

That's it folks. It really is. Eat fatty animal meat. Eat often and as much as you want. Stop thinking too much about it. Don't freak out about a little seasoning. Avoid vegetable oils and salt, but you also don't need to freak out and obsess about perfectly avoiding them. If you're thinking about this, you're making it harder than it is. And, yeah, carbs do still count. That's especially true for obese people. And, that means 0-5 g/day or you're going to have a bad time.",3,1729107677.0,carnivore,4,0.8,False

I (32f) and he (35m) have been on 3 dates already. He has initiated every date before I even got the chance to ask him if he was interested in going out again.
He's super classy, respectful, and very intelligent. We've been talking over text for about a month and a half now. He's not great at texting (we both aren't great at it), but he has responded at least once a day up until after this last date.

We were initially going to go grab coffee together, but because it was rainy he came over instead. He stayed until 3 AM. That same night he asked if I'd like to go out again and try the coffee thing again. I said I would love that. I even expressed my surprise that he wanted to go out a fourth time. He asked why I was so surprised, and I told him it's because I never want to assume another date, especially in the beginning.

After he got home we texted each other for a bit and I told him that I would send him some money for the food we ordered in because I felt bad how expensive it was. No response. This was Sunday night and now it's Wednesday afternoon. I've heard absolutely nothing from him. Like I said, we usually text at least once a day.


Why tf would he initiate another date and then go silent? I'm so confused. I don't want to ask because I'm over it. If he can't communicate to me what I did wrong, or if he's maybe scared at how strong his feelings are that is not my problem. I don't want to be with someone who stops all communication without explanation randomly. I'm so over this ghosting bullshit.
What do y'all think the reason could be? We did cuddle, but we did not have sex, as we both established that we wanted to take it relatively slow.
I do feel like I should maybe reach out Friday and just ask if he still wants to do the date Sunday because if not, I'd like to make other plans. But then I think beating around the bush and ignoring the elephant in the room is also stupid and immature. 🤷
Any input would be much appreciated!

It permeates the marrow, makes home in that which keeps you upright and stepping forward. It’s propulsive in that manner and electric like the neurons firing in your brain that make consciousness possible. Their new single, “Peak A Boo,” exemplifies this. The song, like many of shadow work’s, is an exercise in tension, an ebb and flow kind of tune that walks the knife’s edge between control and chaos.” - 303 Magazine*

The man wakes up to the soft sound of birds chirping outside his window, sunlight pouring into his cozy kitchen. The smell of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. He reaches for his thermos on the counter, a familiar warmth spreading through his hands as he takes a sip, smiling at the memory of his wife preparing breakfast earlier. The packed lunch she made for him sits in a neat box, right where she always leaves it.

""Goodbye, kids!"" he calls out with a gentle chuckle, knowing they’re probably too absorbed in their games in the living room to respond. He hears their giggles echo through the house, the sound of toys clattering in the background. The love in their laughter makes his heart swell, even though he doesn’t glance their way.

He steps into his car, the world outside as serene as his heart feels. The roads are clear, not a single car in sight. It's a perfect, peaceful ride, his favorite tunes humming through the speakers. He takes in the lush, green landscape and the blue sky stretching wide above, the kind of morning that makes everything feel right in the world.

Arriving at work, the parking lot is calm. No hustle, no stress. As he walks into the office building, his secretary’s voice calls out a friendly greeting from behind the desk, welcoming him just like she does every morning. He nods, comforted by the routine, even though he doesn’t look her way.

He opens the door to his personal office and sinks into his plush chair, feeling the support of its familiar embrace. His desk is clean and organized, the perfect environment for what he loves most: his work. He begins evaluating tactical scenarios, immersed in combat simulations that demand his attention. Each scenario presents a problem, and he’s there to find the solution, just like always.

Yet, outside this idyllic creation, the reality is far from serene. His real body lies entombed in a stasis suit, deep in ADVENT’s clutches. His mind, unable to cope with the truth, has woven this perfect life—a dream world that protects him from the harshness of his captivity. The simulations he evaluates are real, but everything else, the family, the home, the drive, all exist only in his imagination, a wonderful lie crafted to keep his sanity intact while ADVENT exploits his strategic brilliance for their own ends.",1,1729106928.0,Xcom,0,1.0,False
1g57t6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1g57t6a/thoughts_on_coffee_cup_sizes/,Thoughts on coffee cup sizes?,"For context, Im an American who lived in Australia for nearly 8 years and was a barista there for most of that time. All my coffee-making experience is an accumulation of training/working with different roasters and cafes in Melbourne. 

I’ve recently returned to the States and am pleasantly surprised by the amount of local cafes and roasters that have popped up in the time I’ve been away. I know Americans have a bad coffee rep (I copped it all the time overseas) so I’ve been keen to try out these new places in search of coffee similar to what I used to have in Australia.

I still like a sugar bomb an on the rare occasion but I normally have a regular flat white or cappuccino and I was used to a regular/standard size in Melbourne being 6-8oz with 1 shot. 

What I’m finding here is that cup sizes are so big: 10-12oz for small hot/iced takeaway and anywhere between 16oz-24oz for the next size up. Pretty sure that’s always been the case bc everything is huge here lol but now that I’m aware of coffee to milk ratios and how it changes the overall taste, it’s become noticeable. I’m having trouble finding a good coffee but I feel like it’s purely bc of the size. 

What are your thoughts on cup size? Is it the bigger the better? Are ratios adjusted for the size? Do you think coffee here is generally weaker? Just keen to hear your opinions while I try to adjust to the American coffee scene, even better if you’re a fellow barista!

My daughter turned 3 this past Saturday 10/12 and we held her party on Sunday 10/13. It was at my home that I share with my wife of 10 years, and our two other children (boy 6, daughter 6 months). 10/13 is also my older sisters birthday (43). No husband, boyfriend, kids. She works in NY, travels the world, and since Covid, moved back into my parents home in CT. We have never been super close but I maintain a nice and civil relationship with her for my parents sake and so she can be part of her nieces/nephews lives. My wife and I are very private people. My parents come by once a week to help watch kids while we work and spend time with them, but other than that, we do like to spend time together as a family and I know my family doesn’t agree. My mother comes from a strict Sicilian background where tradition, religion, tight knit family is everything, but we’ve expressed that we aren’t religious anymore and we’re just raising our family how we see fit and we would love for them to be apart of it on our terms. My father is an old salty Vietnam Marine who just goes along with the program and I’m happy to see him finally enjoying life at 80, watching his grandkids grow. I digress. Weeks ago my wife asked my mother (they get along very well), if it’d be a problem to have our daughters party on my sisters bday because if so, we’d change the date (my sister and wife are not close, but are civil). My mom said “no problem” (and my sister has not wanted to celebrate her bday since she turned 40, since she has no significant other or kids and is I know is anxious about being alone rest of her life). 

My wife and I put a lot of time, effort, and money into this party. The wife loves themes and does balloon arches, has me make crafts to put on display, hangs banners, etc. Sunday comes alone and my father drops off some ice early on and says it’s for the “cake that mom is bringing.” I said I already have a cake. He mumbles something and goes to move his truck. I call my mother/sister riding together (to wish her happy bday) but also find out about “cakes.” As it turns out, my mother took it upon herself to bring two additional ice cream cakes so my sister and my daughter could so some kind of combined happy birthday…? Either way I said no thanks we have one, we made it abundantly clear it was Addie’s bday party. Voices were raised and I was accused of being inconsiderate and my sister is yelling in the car about how “mom and dad do everything for you and the kids” …. To which i replied two fold “I’m aware of what they do; but remember who’s living at their home rent free and they do plenty for her at no cost” (my sister wasn’t the most exemplary child to them growing up and i decided now was a good time to remind her); and secondly “if she didn’t want this birthday party/cake, why didn’t she stop my mom from bringing ice cream cakes and save it for another day. My point is, a 3 year olds bday party is EVERYTHING to them, so can’t a 43 year old take a back seat for a few hours and my family respect MY families choice? Now I’m the outcast (formerly perfect son) and the day was pretty bad with avoidance, not even my dad is speaking to me. He came to pick up his tables and chairs secretly the other morning, I didn’t even know. i already apologized for my raised voice to my mom and we will work through it, but they’re expecting an apology for my sister and my mother can’t seem to understand that I felt undermined and blindsided. She’s steadfast on tradition/family values and it’s not a big deal to have cake for them both. It wasn’t even a family party. Was mainly my daughters friends and close friend of ours that have kids around same age. The adults usually just sit there and drink coffee. Parents out there- young and old - do you agree parenting and boundaries are important and should be respected at whatever limits /family involvement you set them at??

I'm getting normal again or atleast what it's what I thought. I go to work and come back home at 6 or 7. Yesterday I even went out to eat and meet for coffee with a friend, who was visiting. I almost felt so normal these days, that I feel a bit guilty about it. When I came home, it came back, but not as dramatic anymore as before. And it made me question myself, if I can get back to normal like nothing, just being ""a little sad"" after not even a month. Made me feel horrible, how can I get normal again, when three weeks, 4 weeks ago I had him in my arms. Made me feel, like the whole mourning process was just ""for show"" and that now I'm ""free"".
Today I saw a dog in the park and thought ""I want that, I want a dog"" and thought about it  how it would be. I realised, I don't want another dog. I want my dog back. I want him back. I'm getting back the normal day to day, so where is he? He is part of that, so why is he not greeting me, when I come home, why don't I have to search for him, when he's sleeping somewhere and he hasn't realised that I'm home?

I saw a reel today about a Greek god, coming back to earth in disguise and only his dog, who was dying and laying in his feces, recognised him. It broke my heart. When I came home I broke down in tears in front of his urn, his picture and his candle. I just needed so bad his forgiveness. Everything came back, his last moments, how we had to decide to put him to sleep, how he was trying to eat though he couldn't move his head, his mouth anymore. How he peed himself and I tried to clean him up, but it didn't work so well, bc I would have to give him a shower, but he hated it and was always scared of it and I didn't want his last hours on earth having to endure that.
I miss him so much. And I hope he can forgive myself for everything I could have done better, all the time I could have spend more with him, forgive me, bc he was quite sick at the end with many things that was paining and killing him, but he also seemed like he got covid from us.
I hope  one day I see his little face again.
And that he doesn't feel like I betrayed him by deciding to put him to sleep.

Por favor perdoname por todo.

M35) - diagnosed 2 years ago with fibromyalgia 

I have an office job, working in project management. When I work from home I am fine. One cup of coffee next to me, sip from it throughout the day, even if it gets cold.

During office hours around 12pm to 2 pm my body falls asleep. It is next to imposssibe to stay awake, I black out during meetings for a few seconds with my eyes wide open.
I feel like my brain gets numb, my eyes sore, my head heavy and at any moment I could simply drop. 
It is so difficult to fight it. 

I tried getting coffee next to me to do the same as home, does not help. 
Tried eating and snacking just for energy, doesn’t help. 
Tried taking micro breaks to just go around the building, when I come back I get the same situation. 

I need to focus incredibly hard to just stay awake. I simply can’t function during these hours. If I fall asleep I might loose my job eventually or just be the joke of the department.

It really doesn't fit my parents, but I started to think about my grandma. I rarely saw her sit down. 

She was constantly up and cleaning. She had a TV in every room on her house including the bathrooms and washroom. She would pick a channel and change them all to that for the day so she could watch in every room while she wandered around. She said if she wasn't watching that it kept her company. 

She also drank coffee ALL day and night and still slept fine. And she smoked cigarettes pretty heavily. I also remember when she wasn't smoking them she would just be rolling them in her fingers or flipping the pack over and over. If she wasn't doing that she was chewing on her thumb without realizing lol. 

She also had notebooks full of research and plans that she was making, never executed one of them, but all the pens were chewed. 

She was a fun lady and would do wild stuff like climbing trees and getting stuck up in them when she remembered she was scared of heights. She dyed her hair red, liked to wear a red shirt that said ""hottie"" on it paired with bedazzled denim. She had lots of boyfriends after her husband died - especially those with motorcycles. Whenever she took me to the doctor she would blow up a bunch of the gloves like balloons and freak the doctor out when they came in. Might have been lack of impulse control; some people thought she was ""too much."" 

I always wanted to be more like her because I was scared of everything and trying to be perfect.

Prices are almost the same as in some cities in Europe, where the quality of life is much better, especially in Central Europe. There are a lot of beggars, no green spaces, no view, and even if you want to sit on a terrace, it’s too complicated. There’s always a security guard chasing away the beggars, plus the constant noise from motorcycles, and a lot of filth.

The same goes for the price per square meter, which is rising with this craze of people buying studios to rent . If everyone is buying studios and renting them at these prices, there must be demand. Who are the people renting these studios? Who are the people eating at these restaurants? I was shocked by restaurants that have the same standard as a regular brasserie abroad charging luxury restaurant prices.

Even for drinks like cappuccinos and lattes, they cost almost 40-50 dirhams in a decent coffee shop, which is really expensive. But I recently learned that many restaurants are also closing down. What do you all think about this? Do you think prices will drop? Will there be a correction, or are we stuck with this for a while?

I know Mac managed it, and the game offers a coffee shop with the same privileges; I wonder how much of the process could work as, say, a campaign goal for a group of PCs who want to set up something like that on their own.

I imagine it as part of at least two basic scenarios: one is to simply expand the options for such places in a city-setting where the supernatural population has expanded to the point that the single ""old local joint"" has become too crowded, and another is to replace the previous spot that got removed from play (either destroyed or the previous owner died before designating anyone to take over).

What I would like at this point is a rough guide to what the process could entail on average, so I could adjust it to my players' tastes. I still want to have at least a couple of in-game ""challenges/tests"" that they have to overcome to earn the status at all, but only adding more if the players are enjoying the struggle.

Once their business has earned the status, I figure that maintaining it will provide most of the story-complications and fun all on its own...

A. For pour-over: 1. grind consistency, 2. amount of small particles, 3. clarity, 4. acidity, 5. body, 6. aroma (richness, of the coffee, 7. ease of use, 8. make quality / whole package (accessories etc.)

Immediately on start up, I can tell it's not working properly in a few ways. I've been trying to troubleshoot for days with no luck, and I really need to get this thing going. These are my observations on start-up:

-The first function is ""filling up boiler"" which is taking over an hour. The machine will make a harsh clicking sound when it should be drawing water. Then the odd time it will actually sound like it's pulling water.

-the next function is ""heating up boiler"" which should apparently take 30 minutes tops. My machine times out twice before eventually getting to 104° but being unable to go higher. Once at 104° it'll switch between the ""heating up broiler"" and ""filling up broiler"" but never get higher.

- the pump pressure increases drastically during the heating stage. The boiler pressure will only climb 2 notches once at 104° but won't go higher.

- The only differences during set up is that I used a different hose, but still the same size.

- There is a motor in there attached to the water inlet, however it doesn't turn on at any point

Second week went by fine. I even went to the office 3 times but only for the mornings to show my face. I went out a few times to restaurants as well. I felt completely ok.
This week though I have been really stressed at work. I did my first full day in the office yesterday, second day today. I dealt with things that are not really in my remit but I was left to deal with them. They were quite hard tasks. I also dropped my lunch so I had some instant pasta thing from the vending machine at work. So I didn’t really have much nutrition in me and I also stupidly drank two cups of coffees which I never do as I feel anxious from caffeine. (Although I have to admit since my surgery I’ve been craving caffeine so I had it here and there but I’m very small doses and I felt fine)
So today I ended up with a panic attack and I feel like my insides where the operation happened are sooo sore. 

So here’s a reminder for myself and for you to take it easy. Even non physical work can be harsh on your body especially when you’re stressing over it. Eat nutritious food. You don’t actually have to go into the office when your workplace is fine with you working from home. Oh and sleep! I really didn’t sleep well last night  which probably doesn’t help my situation today. So tomorrow I’m staying home and I’ll tell my boss I need to rest and will switch off my work phone.

------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to selecting the right design for your home, the options are endless. However, choosing house plans for round home designs can offer incredible benefits that you may not have considered. The unique shape of a round home challenges conventional architectural norms, providing a blend of beauty, efficiency, and functionality. Here’s why going for this design can be a smart choice for you.

### Enhanced Energy Efficiency

One of the standout benefits of round home designs is their excellent energy efficiency. The circular shape reduces the exposure of exterior walls to the elements, which means less heat loss in winter and lower cooling costs in summer. You can enjoy a comfortable indoor environment year-round while saving on energy bills.

### Maximized Space Utilization

Round home plans often allow for more usable space compared to traditional rectangular designs. You can easily arrange furniture and maximize the flow of movement within the home. This design choice often leads to:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
- Less wasted space in corners and hallways
- Open floor plans that encourage social interactions
- Flexibility in room usage, as rounded spaces can serve multiple purposes

### Natural Light and Connection to Nature

Round homes allow for larger windows and strategic placements that let in plenty of natural light. The panoramic views from a rounded structure enhance your connection to the outdoors. Imagine sipping your coffee as sunlight floods your living room, or watching the sunset from a cozy nook. This integration with nature leads to:

- A more pleasant and uplifting atmosphere in your home
- Lower reliance on artificial lighting during the day
- An overall increase in well-being

### Structural Strength and Durability

The shape of round homes contributes to their structural integrity. With fewer corners, the design can better distribute wind and snow loads, making it resilient in harsh weather conditions. The circular structure minimizes stress points, increasing the longevity of the home, which can be especially beneficial in areas prone to extreme weather events.

### Cultural and Aesthetic Appeal

Choosing a round home design can set your home apart in a sea of square designs. The artistic appeal of a circular home can create a unique statement in your neighborhood. Round homes can evoke a sense of warmth and comfort, often reminiscent of ancient dwellings. Whether it’s a cozy retreat or a modern masterpiece, the design has aesthetic versatility.

### Simplified Construction Process

Interestingly, round homes can simplify the construction process. The symmetrical shape may allow for quicker building times, which can save costs in labor. Moreover, many modular designs can be prefabricated, meaning that sections are produced off-site and quickly assembled on your property. This streamlined approach offers advantages such as:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
- Reduced waste of materials
- Lower construction timelines
- Potential savings on labor costs

### Community and Wellness

Round homes are often designed with communal living in mind, promoting social interaction among family members or within a community. The layout encourages gatherings, helping to create bonds and shared experiences. This design aspect supports mental health and contributes to a sense of belonging.

### Endless Customization Options

One of the most exciting aspects of round home plans is the level of customization you can achieve. Whether you want a small, minimalist design or a larger, multi-level structure, the versatility in shapes and styles can accommodate your vision. Materials, finishes, and energy-efficient features can all be tailored to meet your preferences and environmental goals.

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
When it comes to choosing the right house plans, round home designs might just be the ideal solution for your needs. From energy efficiency to aesthetic appeal, the array of benefits makes them worth considering. With customization and space maximization, it’s no wonder that this design trend is gaining traction among modern homeowners. If you seek a unique, comfortable, and efficient living space, a round home should definitely be on your radar.

Creative Interior Solutions for Round Homes
-------------------------------------------

Creating a unique and functional space in a round home can be a rewarding challenge. The unconventional shape allows for creative interior solutions that can enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of your space. Whether you're designing from scratch or redesigning an existing round home, consider the following innovative ideas.

### Utilize Circular Furniture Arrangements

In a round home, embracing circular furniture can significantly enhance the overall flow and harmony of the space. Instead of traditional rectangular layouts, opt for:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
- **Curved Sofas:** Choose sofas with elegant curves that follow the circular theme.
- **Circular Coffee Tables:** These can act as focal points while complementing the room's shape.
- **Round Rugs:** Place round or oval rugs under furniture to define areas and add warmth.

This approach not only maintains the round design's integrity but also makes the space feel more cohesive and inviting.

### Open Concepts and Zones

Round homes often benefit from open-concept designs. By eliminating unnecessary walls, you can create a fluid environment that feels spacious. However, it's essential to establish different zones for various activities. Here are some ideas:

- **Living Areas:** Arrange furniture to create a cozy conversation area around a central feature, such as a fireplace.
- **Dining Spaces:** Position a round table in the center of the room, making it a natural gathering spot.
- **Work Areas:** Use gentle dividers like bookshelves to create a small office nook without compromising the open feel.

This strategy allows for seamless transitions while preserving the charm of a round design.

### Architectural Enhancements

To make your round home even more remarkable, consider integrating architectural features that enhance its uniqueness:

- **Vaulted Ceilings:** High ceilings can give a sense of spaciousness. Add skylights to increase natural light.
- **Curved Walls:** Leave some walls gently curved instead of perfectly straight, providing visual interest.
- **Arched Doorways:** Opt for arched or rounded doorways instead of standard rectangular frames.

These enhancements will not only make your home visually appealing but also allow for improved airflow and natural light.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Storage in a round home can be a bit tricky, but it isn't impossible. Utilize creative storage ideas that blend seamlessly with the design:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
- **Built-in Shelves:** Consider built-in curved shelves around the walls for books, decor, or plants.
- **Hidden Compartments:** Use furniture with built-in storage, like ottomans or coffee tables with hidden drawers.
- **Multi-functional Furniture:** Invest in pieces that can serve multiple purposes, such as benches that provide seating and storage.

This will help maximize space while keeping everything organized and aesthetically pleasing.

### Color and Lighting Techniques

Choosing the right colors and lighting is key to creating an inviting atmosphere in a round home:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/house-plans-round-home-design  
  
- **Light Colors:** Use lighter shades on the walls to brighten the space and make it feel larger.
- **Accent Walls:** Consider one feature wall with a bold color or wallpaper to create a visual focus.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Incorporate various lighting sources, such as pendant lights, floor lamps, and wall sconces to add depth and warmth.

By combining these elements, you create a dynamic play of light and color that keeps the environment engaging.

Transforming a round home into a beautiful living space requires imagination and resourcefulness. Embrace the unique structure by crafting circular arrangements, open zones, and integrating creative storage solutions. With an artistic approach to colors and lighting, you can turn any round house into a warm, stylish, and inviting home that reflects your taste and lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Choosing house plans for round home design offers a unique opportunity to embrace modern aesthetics while enjoying numerous practical benefits. Round homes not only exude a sense of harmony with nature, but they also provide energy efficiency, maximizing space and minimizing waste. The circular layout often creates an inviting atmosphere for social gatherings, allowing for seamless movement and interaction among family and friends.

Hey fellow wanderlusters, it's Derek here a.k.a. u/solopassions! Ever felt the itch to pack a bag and just... travel? Solo? 🙌 Let me tell you, there's nothing quite like it. Imagine being a lone wolf, strolling through breathtaking landscapes like South Korea's enchanting Jeju Island, feeling like a character in your own epic movie. 🎥 

**Unique Experiences: Jet Setting Alone! 🌟**
Let’s dive into the wild world of solo adventures. Fancy scaling Hallasan's sheer heights or chilling at Jeju’s pristine beaches adorned by the myths of the Haenyeo divers? As a solo traveler, you’re the captain of your ship - navigating sprawling forests, volcanic craters, and, yes, even trying to dance with the locals (I may have sprained an ankle attempting a K-pop move or two. No regrets!). 😄 The beauty of traveling alone is that every decision is yours. Feel like getting lost in a local market or ditching plans to meditate on a serene cliffside? Do it!

**Challenges? Oh Yeah, But Worth Every Sweatbead! 💪**
Sure, there were challenges. Like that time when my GPS decided to take a spontaneous coffee break and, lo and behold, all signs morphed into hieroglyphs! 😅 Yet, every hurdle refined my instincts, taught me resilience, and how to decode international mime language. 

**Growth? Transformational! 🌱**
Traveling solo isn’t just about crossing countries off a list; it’s about embarking on an introspective quest. Solo travel taught me to relish my own company and embrace solitude – it's surprisingly therapeutic. I became more empathetic, aware, and open to the world around me. 

**Advice for Future Solo Explorers: 🌟**
1. **Go With The (Tangerine Soju) Flow**: Plans will change. Sometimes you’ll wake up and spontaneously decide to follow locals to a festival or feast. Be flexible and let joy find you.
   
2. **Connect More, Worry Less**: Even when traveling alone, never underestimate the warmth of connecting with fellow travelers or locals. Every conversation is a page in your travel story.

3. **Capture Moments, Not Things**: Invest in experiences. Whether it's learning the mysterious Haenyeo dive technique (only figuratively for now 😅) or sampling Jeju’s culinary delights, these memories will linger longer than a cheap souvenir.

So, to all you potential solo travelers, if Derek can navigate the adventures of solo travel (and occasionally get lost with style), so can you! The world is a magnificent place, and there's an adventure out there with your name on it. Go find it, and remember u/solopassions is cheering for you! 🌍🧭✨ 

Now, who’s up for a tangerine soju toast to new beginnings? 🥂 Safe travels! 🚀",1,1729105004.0,solopassions,0,1.0,False

1g56zqh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g56zqh,Difficult layout for century home,"I’m totally failing at finding a satisfying layout for my 900sqft home. There’s a few problems mostly stemming from a lack of space and I’m hoping for a magic bullet solution. I’m trying to figure out how to get my living room and kitchen to maximize the space I have with the difficult constraints of the rooms. The blueprint shows the scale of the rooms (1 square is 1’) together.

The major challenge with the living room is balancing a lounge space with a dining table. The couch on the wall feels isolated from the chair in the corner, and the dining table in the corner is awkward to use. I can’t find any way to make the table less annoying to use in that location, but rearranging everything ends up too claustrophobic. Would maybe bench seating be better under the windows? Or perhaps removing the couch altogether into another room and putting the table into the center of the room with two comfy chairs in the corner? The biggest waste is over the inlet grate which I can’t block, but don’t know how to use the corner it takes up.

The kitchen is annoying because of an immovable wall dividing the rear space. I thought about doing a bench seating breakfast nook, but there’s already so little counter space and storage in the kitchen we thought it better to make it into a coffee bar situation with a breakfast bar on the wall. The pantry door space is totally wasted right now, I have to keep it clear enough for the door, and the window is stopping me from putting a cabinet or something there. I think this space is less of an arrangement puzzle and more of a “I can’t put a purpose on these nooks” issue that I need direction on.",1,1729104772.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Hi

I started experiencing sever constipation when I was on Clomipramine. I had a bowel movement every 3-5 days, sometimes even longer. During that time I had difficulty passing stool, I had to strain a lot. 

After stopping Clomipramine, I started to have more frequent bowel movements, but it was still every 2-3 days, where as before starting Clomipramine I had bowel movement everyday, especially after having coffee (which I read helps), and even without having a cup of coffee, it was usually once a day.

When I was still taking Clomipramine, I noticed some bright res blood on the toilet paper, but it wasn't a lot, however I forgot to look inside the toilet to check for traces of  blood.

Then after I stopped taking clomipramine, bright red on the toilet paper and a lot bright red blood inside the toilet.

I quickly made an appointment with my doctor and was referred to specialist, he asked some questions and determined that it's just hemorrhoids and that I should try taking lexatives.

I'm currently taking Prozac 20mg OD and Concerta XL 27mg OD. I never had issues with SSRIS causing constipation.

To this day I'm still having trouble with bowel movements, it's very irregular, but no blood. The sensation of wanting to poo is not the same, it comes slowly, and when I do want to poo, not a lot comes out, I have to strain and still, it feels like it's not completely emptied.

I tried drinking a lot of water and eating fruit and vegetables, but that didn't really help.

Could this be a sign of cancer? Should I be worried?

1g56u5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Modern_Family/comments/1g56u5q/ranking_the_main_characters_by_how_funny_i/,Ranking the main characters by how funny I thought they were.,"Just finished the show for the first time and loved it. Thought I would rank the main family members by who I found the funniest. Let me know where you agree/disagree! Note: I am weighing the earlier seasons more as the show starts a pretty steady decline around season 8 in my opinion.  

1. Phil

It may be obvious but it’s the right choice. By joke volume alone he wins. He has at least 10 zingers every episode and is the heart of the show. 

2. Jay

Maybe the best written character overall. He is definitely the least cartoonishly “sit-comy” character, and doesn’t rely on gimmicks. Just feels like your funny grandpa. 

3. Claire

Consistently funny the whole show. Love her on every Halloween and Valentine’s Day episode. Also the best cast member at physical comedy, it is hilarious any time she falls or is in some crazy predicament.

4. Gloria

Gloria mispronouncing things is never not funny. Also love any time her bad ass side comes out. Me and my wife have been saying “Aye Jay” to each other for like a month.

5. Luke

Early seasons Luke is my favorite character. He would only have like 5 lines an episode but they were all hilarious. Older Luke is not as funny, but still had some good moments. 

6. Haley

Maybe the best at funny faces, and her and Alex roasting each other are some of my favorite moments of the show. 

7. Mitch

Not my favorite at first, but he definitely grew on me as the show went on. Has some of the best moments on the show, and like Jay feels the most like a real person.

8. Alex

I love Alex and all her little snarky one liners. But like the middle child she is, she kinda gets lost in the shuffle most episodes. 

9. Lilly

Loses points for spending a third of the show as a baby, and didn’t love her character the last couple seasons, but there is a sweet spot where she is hilarious, even though she never has more than a few lines per episode. 

10. Cam

Has some really funny moments, but of all the adults, he feels the most one dimensional to me. Also they really lean into the whole Missouri thing in the later seasons, to the point it seems a little cartoony.

11. Joe

It took a while, but Joe adds some much needed energy to the show the last few seasons. 

12. Manny

In season 1 Manny is hilarious. Such a unique and funny character. The problem is nothing changes. He only has one pitch the whole show. There are only so many jokes you can make about a little kid drinking coffee and wearing blazers. 

Bonus

Favorite side character: Pepper

I loved it any time Pepper showed up. Always added some energy and fun

Least favorite side character: Pam

Just painfully unfunny. Don’t remember even chuckling at one thing she ever said.

Now to give you some context as to why im begging for help is that I did design some sort of layout for the book and then I submit it to my prof to only say that I failed misrablely cuz i cant design a layout without choosing the key visual first but im not familiar with Oppenheimer outside the fact that ""This guy is the Father of all bomb"" so I really cant visualized the key visual of the book and now Im nearing deadline, and I got another mountain of assignments to do. I dont know what to do anymore.

And my prof's request was not making it any better cuz she wanted our book to be ""experimental"" and also list of things that she wants in our book

- No pictures

- Experimenting with the Layouts

- 80 pages

- No shapes

- Only white background

- Key visual must play a major role in determening the layout

- Cant shape a body text to resembles an object (like making a block of text to to look like an apple is a no no)

- playing with grids

- Fonts must be related to key visual 

- body text size must be 12 to 14

- headline cant be too big

  
I really regretted picking Oppenheimer as the topic for my book for i dont even know how do i make a key visual out of a historical person who created atomic bomb.

I really cant do this alone. The rest of my group are a deadweight and I cant fail my this (Typography) class. So pls help me to god is someone that has made at least the similar book as I to give guidance and insight on how to properly design this Oppenheimer book of mine?

I wanted to introduce you to an indirect FINANCIAL GOAL HACKING FRAMEWORK here



Training (usually cardio or gym) is the simple quickest feedback loop to your brain. You don’t want to do it, and you do it, so you start believing you can do it. 💪🥋🏋️‍♂️



After the 6. Consecutive days of training you start believing you can do other things too (apply the 60 seconds rule to get started. Leave yourself the option that if you don’t like the first 60 seconds you can go back home 🏠) 



After the 18. Consecutive training day you start having confidence not only in training but anything else.



(Pro tip: you can start using music but after the 45. Leave it home. Your mind must be enough to keep going, also you need to talk to yourself sometimes 🙃)



On day 24 You’ll be freaking out and will not believe it’s you. 



You get an extra bonus: you get more sharp, you get more creative, you get endorphins and so having a better mood every day.



On day 30 you’ll feel you’ve accomplished so much and you want to skip the next few you will feel you deserve some days off. 🐐🐐



And I’ve got some bad news, you need ca 45 days to develop a new habit. You’re not a goat yet.



So if you don’t keep up… you’ll get lost and go back to zero when day 60 comes. 



And go back to your earlier life.



Then maybe on day 365 you get to start thinking you did accomplish shit again. 



Why I’m telling you this? Because I just got to the end of my day 365 😅 I achieved about 10% of my goals I set before because I could not do things I did not want to do. Simple as that.



Get back to day 1 and start it again! If you stay in the game you don’t loose. If you give up you already lost. 



But hey you can get max 1 day off every week. Also your training shouldn’t be overwhelming. The key is consistency.



So heads up, stay hard and join Tubebuilders if you wanna do something cool instead of Netflix and mediocre financial life and the trap of the “dream” $5,000/mo 9to5 income. 



P.S.- pay attention to the point when it gets hard, it’s the single best indicator for you: that’s the point when most people leave the game



The point when you can get ahead of 90% of those who give up



And when the next give up point comes - you can again get ahead of people. And so on



P.P.S this photo was made on a random weekday with my wife having a trip to our favourite coffee place over lake Balaton. Because we have no bosses anymore and can enjoy sometimes, some free time being free from the 9to5 “trap” and not worrying about the 6am mornings



And I want you to do the same whenever wherever



See you on the inside🐐🐐

We’d like to go on long walks with our toddler, but we’ve found that he somehow seems less stimulated by walks outside than when we just stay home and play with him. Like, he’s happier and naps better on days we’ve given him our full attention by sitting down and playing Duplos for the morning. (This doesn’t apply to the park / playground, but that’s an entirely different outing.) How do we go for a nice long walk with our coffee AND have a happy, well-entertained boy?

- We’ve tried bringing toys, but he mostly throws them out of his stroller

- We definitely point out things he’d be interested in, but he’s a bit too young for a sustained game like “see how many blue cars we can find on our walk today”

- He can walk a short distance, like halfway to our favorite park, but definitely not a hike or long walk like we have in mind

- Maybe using a carrier would keep him more engaged than his stroller?

For the past 3 months, I've been ruminating about everything I've done wrong in the relationship, and it won't stop. This is affecting our relationship, and I'm afraid I might push him to break up if I don't find a way to stop. I keep thinking back to when we first met in college. We lived in the same building and that's how we met. When we met for the first time, I had so much fun, but I wasn't entirely sure. At that time, I had no experience with guys at all, only chatting online. We hung out twice, and then I went back home. During those two weeks, I started chatting online with another guy, and I really liked him because he was direct, while my current boyfriend wasn’t showing any direct signs. And during those two weeks, he didn’t text me very often. When I returned to the city where I studied, I went for coffee with this other guy, and I didn’t like him. The very next day, I started liking my current boyfriend. I keep blaming myself for not knowing right away and for even talking to someone else.

The next thing I think about is that I couldn’t open up to him about private things, and that blocked me from committing to the relationship earlier. I have alopecia and wear a wig, and I didn’t want to commit to the relationship because I felt like I was withholding something important if he didn’t know.

There are some private things I didn’t tell him until now. I felt ashamed of the fact that I live with my family in a very small apartment, share a room with my brother, and my parents sleep in the living room. Everything is pretty old. I never talked about the issues at home with my brother, who hasn’t worked in a long time. Now I realize that none of those things are abnormal or something to be ashamed of. I feel like it really affected our relationship that I couldn’t open up about it.

The last thing I regret is related to sex. But that’s actually about my need for control. It was always important to me what date we had our first kiss, the date we officially started dating, and I wanted the first time we had sex to be with rose petals, candles... I regret wanting to control all of that. So it ended up happening six months after the official start of our relationship, although we had done other things in the meantime. I feel like I made that whole beginning more difficult. I hadn’t resolved everything within myself before meeting him, and I wasn’t mature enough for a relationship, and I regret not being able to give him everything. ",1,1729103986.0,self,1,1.0,False

It’s a love marriage, and she’s tried creating fights between us numerous times. She even went as far as visiting an astrologer, came back, and told us we were going to get divorced!

Her issues can be broadly classified as selfishness, greed, boredom, and laziness.

When my father-in-law lost money in his business, instead of supporting him, she made him feel worse about it and continued using ""her money"" (the money he's been giving her for years) to shop to her heart’s content.

She’s blown through all of my father-in-law’s money on gold, clothes, cars, and big houses. Now, she’s living a lavish life on my husband’s money. She’s brainwashed him into believing it’s his duty to give her every last penny or he’s a bad son.

She’s the laziest person I’ve ever met. She spends all day lying in bed on her phone while my father-in-law cooks and cleans. But when it comes to me, I'm the woman so I have to cook and clean for her son 🙄

She always needs people to talk to, but never speaks up at parties, so no one finds her interesting and doesn't call her. Instead, she calls my husband four times a day, and each time, it’s with the intention of creating fights between us. She’ll say things like, “Why isn’t she making you coffee?” or “So what if she’s handling the baby? It’s a woman’s job!” Just misogynistic nonsense constantly.

And now, despite going on a fast for us to have this baby, her only grandchild, she claims she can’t help with the baby because of her OCD. Meanwhile, my parents have been helping us for an year now, and it breaks my heart to see them stuck here, while she’s off enjoying vacations – using my husband’s money, no less!

Now with the baby here she wants to come visit every weekend. I ask my husband to say no (since she never asks me anyway), and she has the audacity to tell him - who is she to stop me from meeting my granddaughter! And shows up unannounced! 
Husband and I have had multiple fights over this, but she manages to emotionally blackmail and gets her way.

* Stay hydrated
* Do a slow refeeding window, such as starting with broth for the first day and move up from there.

3. How does plain coffee or tea affect the fast that people do water only?

**Question**  
  
When she was a child, my mother had a concussion that was not treated because she lived in a remote area.  She has had a variety of health problems, and doctors have urged her to for brain imaging - but she has refused because she is scared of the results.  

As far back as I can recall, her emotional maturity and personality have seemed to be that of a 13 year old girl and never of an adult.  I am wondering if that is due to Traumatic Brain Injury from her childhood concussion, or if that is something others have experienced.

Examples of the childish stuff that I don't know as typical to BDP people:  
  
\* My wife and I visited, and tried to watch a movie with her last year.  Out of the blue, my mom starts teasing me like a middle schooler over an actress: ""OOOoooh, look! it's your GIRLFRIEND!!!!!  You think she's so cute!""  The tone, subject and time were wildly inappropriate... and this was all based on my mother calling the actress ugly 20 years ago and me saying, ""most of the world thinks she is pretty, and I would agree"".

\* She throws temper tantrums, like a toddler, if she doesn't get her way.  This will escalate into a BPD attack episode if you don't give in, but the initial response is basically a child.

\* Everything has to be easy, she can't take any initiative. She can't take the time to learn anything SIMPLE (like a remote control or how to cook a certain dish), and says ""thats too hard""

\* She doesn't understand context or nuance.  Everything is literal and unconditional with her.  She doesn't understand things like ""I would be comfortable with X in one situation, but not in another"", or that ""Y"" could mean something in one context but is entirely different in another.

A lot of her other childish things fall squarely into the realm of common BPD traits, but I haven't seen these so I am wondering if this is related.

I come from two families steeped in domestic violence and emotional abuse, and there are a lot of overlapping issues.

I recently decided to permanently end contact with her, but I recognize she is a victim and I do want her to get help.  I just can't be a part of her journey anymore.  I am calling her primary care doctor to share some details he and her psychiatrist likely do not know, hoping they will try to confirm them and adjust treatment.  Her PCP had a Psychiatrist friend do a quick consult with her to determine anxiety meds a few years ago, and he just signs off on them now.  They only know what she tells them, which is ""I have anxiety!"" so they give her clonazepam and that's it!

**Intro**  
  
I (46M) am fairly certain my mother (82F) has BPD.  In the past, my therapists (I have PTSD from my father's drunk driving) have all said she is almost certainly has Narcissistic Personality Disorder, but recent experiences have led to memories and understandings have made it clear it is BDP.  I was NC with my mother most times I was in therapy, which is why those things were not discussed as part of my therapy.   After her last episode at me, I have decided to permanently terminate contact - she weaponized triggering my PTSD, and left me in a catatonic state for weeks.  

On the weaponization: My dad was a widely known to be a dysfunctional alcoholic (multiple: failed interventions, DUIs, car crashes, etc;) in denial and refused to give up control of the car during a terrifying drive. He started drinking as a pre-teen, from the abuse of his likely-BDP mother. I had to beat the shit out of him at an intersection to gain control of the car and drive home. That was it for me. With a therapist, I set hard boundaries for No Contact - my father would have to admit he had a problem, get sober and apologize.  My father continued to insist that he never had a drinking problem (there were two failed interventions by this point, multiple DUIs before and after this event, etc), didn't drink anything that night (he had not had a sober day since he was 11 years old), and I made everything up.  He died clinging to that vision.  
  
Although my mother was divorcing my father over the alcoholism (which she certainly contributed to), she was more upset at me.  She turned every interaction we had into an altercation over my father, despite me setting clear boundaries that will not be discussed, which would lead me to go NC for months of years with her.   She did not care that I was in therapy or that I had mental health worthy of respect.  She wanted me to ""forgive and forget"" and pretend nothing ever happened, insisting this was for my own good and best interests. She recruited my family to harass me over this, and spend the past 28 years gaslighting, victim blaming and DARVO-ing me on this.  I recently learned she told everyone that I was simply mad at my dad for drinking and became an ""elitist asshole"" at college, and she has convinced herself that I never had that drive or PTSD.

The last episode she had at me: I was in town cleaning out a storage unit after one of my dogs died - we have two home and have decided to spend most of our time outside the city because our surviving dog developed mobility issues.  I stupidly visited my mother.

I politely declined her requests to smother me for 15 minutes straight (that's her thing- do you want coffee? do you want tea?  can i get you water?  can i run to the store? can i run to the other store?), she became irate and went into a speech that about how I am failure, shame and utter embarrassment to her (she cracked a giddy and gleeful smile on those words).  I just let it wash over me, as I know she is diseased.  She didn't get the reaction she wanted, so eventually stopped.  About ten minutes later, I am fixing some broken furniture for her, and she starts with the smothering.  I turn to her and just say, ""These requests are getting ridiculous. I've asked you multiple times to please stop offering me things, but you can't help yourself.  Do you understand this is not only annoying me, but keeping me from helping you fix these things?""   She immediately went into a insult spree, then decided to trigger my PTSD by insisting I make things up, i threw out a perfectly good father, and I am an awful son for not visiting her all those years.  At that point i dropped everything, told I didn't have to tolerate this anymore, and packed to leave.  

Amongst her final insults and screams to me, was the only honest thing she ever said to me about this - which she had accidentally admitted at Christmas a year before - she holds ""all the resentment and hate in the world"" against me, because I couldn't ""grow the fuck up, stop being a child, and pretend my dad was perfect"" because... ""that's what my sister and your cousins did for your uncle, who beat them constantly!""  As I said earlier, I come from toxic families that normalize domestic violence.  

One of the reasons I put up with her for so long, was because I have estranged myself from my entire family due to their insane toxicity, and she always brings that up – blaming me for everything.  As my therapists reminded me though, all I ever did was stick up for myself when no-one else would.  I had already ended contact with my paternal family over their abuse - my grandmother (who abused my father, and certainly was BPD), always made it a point to remind me that I was the ""offspring"" of her ""idiot son and a dumb immigrant"" and would never amount to anything.  My mother forced her upon me, ""because she is family"".   My last straw with my grandparents was my grandmother laughing at the idea of me going to any college, much less a good one - ""why would any school take an idiot like you""? \[I had a full ride to a Top 5 school\].   Relations with my maternal family are strained, because everyone is mired in Generational Trauma and the normalization of domestic violence.  It's hard to have a calm conversation with people who speak in trauma responses, communicate by fighting, and will resort to physical violence. 

I have the least amount of mental disorders in my family, because dealing with my PTSD kept me away from the continued abuse, and I am probably the only person who went to therapy and learned to set boundaries and stick to them. I don't seem to have C-PTSD from my mom.  Her weaponization of my PTSD is too traumatic for that to even start - she just knows how to put me back in that car, scared for my life, and make me spend weeks questioning my memories and sanity as I endlessly relive those moments until CBT exercise and therapy can get me out of it.

1g567xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1g567xx/being_sober_for_a_month_has_been_illuminating/,Being sober for a month has been illuminating ,"My husband and I had a night about a month ago where we ended up going out and spending $250 on food/alcohol and it was not a good time. We were very ashamed of this fact and after literally pissing away the equivalent of my monthly student loan payment, my entire phone bill, and a good chunk of our internet bill, we decided we needed to make a change and decided to start small. Our plan was no alcohol for a month and we have kept to that for the most part. My husband's best friend was in town and they went for drinks, so that was the only exception and he asked if I would be okay with it which I was. If I had said no, he wouldn't have gone out but he hasn't seen his friend in months so I felt like it was an acceptable exception. This also led my husband to realize he has a drinking problem because he cannot just stop at a single drink. It is always 0-100 even if he goes with the plan of having one pint. My husband is never mean or acts out when drunk, he gets quite giggly and cuddly so thankfully that's not an issue. That night with his friend was $65. 

When we talked about finances yesterday, I asked if it was worth it and my husband instantly said that it wasn't because he could have bought a really fun video game that would be at least 20 hours of entertainment for less than that (assuming Steam sale). We also made a dedicated plan to record all our expenses onto a shared spreadsheet and we realized that I have a spending problem. Those little Amazon purchases quickly add up, especially when I can just click the ""Buy Now"" option. Just as my husband needs to take care of his drinking problem, I need to take care of my spending problem. We are supporting each other in this and not passing judgement because that does not help the situation.

Part of the plan for this month was also avoid eating out and we have done that, other than ordering two Dominos pizzas on days when we genuinely did not have a chance to make food and were running around. The four topping $15 large pizza is the best deal for us. Since I only eat two slices at a time, this means I have dinner and lunch the following day at work. Coffee is the one thing I can't compromise on no matter how hard I try. The cheaper coffees make me feel genuinely sick and caffeine does nothing for me so I am drinking for the taste and enjoyment of a warm drink. Not buying alcohol has made it so that the $50/month I was spending on nice coffee beans is much more affordable. The amount of money we had been spending on food/alcohol each month was appalling and explains where our disposable income has gone.

This month has also led to a very positive change in my husband. After the night out with his friend, he realized he truly cannot drink anymore without overdoing. He did that about 2 weeks into our month of sobriety and he realized how amazing he'd been feeling without alcohol. He has made a commitment to complete sobriety and not touching alcohol again. We're taking that one day at a time and I am so proud of him.

They are going to start pouring the foundation shortly. Drive by SW 35th and Lava Ave. to see the progress (near the Highland Baptist Church). At the same time, a levy was out for a vote as well to cover initial operational expenses. The levy did not pass in 2022. 

As you may have guessed the levy is back on the ballot this year with a reduced rate. The tax impact is $0.21 per $1000 assessed value of the property. For the average home assessed value of $250k, this is about $52 per year (think about a gallon of gas or a coffee per month). You can find your assessed value on a property tax statement or at https://dial.deschutes.org/

The levy will fund operational expenses for RAPRD and the new facility, such as utilities, staffing, equipment and supplies. It will ensure that the current swim center stays open to reduce user conflicts for the pool. It will make sure the new facility is ready to go as soon as construction is over. RAPRD hasn't increased their tax rate in decades, so this levy is to help with the increased operational expenses of the new facility. 

If we don't pass the levy, then the Cascade Swim Center will close. This puts us right back to the issue we've been having - space for all of our activities and those interested in doing them. Right now, there isn't enough time in the day to provide access for multiple school swim teams and waterpolo, fitness classes, recreational lap swim, swim lessons and family swim times. The fitness classes are often too full and the pool can't accommodate everyone for only one session a day. The school teams need to practice but this ties up the pool for hours a day and then it closes to the community when there are competitions. With both the swim center and the new rec center open, there will be enough space for everyone.

A failing levy also means other concessions will be made, like reduced hours, reduced fitness programs, and increased admission fees.

Let's support our community and the new facility by voting yes on the levy. The facility is going to be awesome and such an asset for Redmond.",4,1729102755.0,RedmondOR,0,0.84,False

No matter what period of life you're in, there's bound to be characters/moments that feel familiar, and that feels really good. 

* On the plus side: 
   * The main actors play really well and are full of chemistry. I loved the fact that their relationship isn't forced and that Seung Hyo makes sure every time that Seok Ryu agrees to every step he takes towards her. I also loved the little nods to other classic dramas here and there (something in the rain, coffee prince, we love it).
   * I also really liked the secondary actors, who all bring something to the story: 
      * The group of parents, all different, who manage to rise above their prejudices and ambitions for their children, while portraying real friendships with their ups and downs.
      * The best friend, dynamic and motivated, ready to do anything to realize her dreams, while remaining true to herself.
      * The clueless brother, who eventually accepts himself as he is and moves on. 
      * The journalist, a little withdrawn but full of love and acceptance of others.
      * The co-workers, all different but each bringing their own point of view to the story. 
   * Each episode of this drama is well balanced in terms of emotions (fear, laughter, sadness, joy, butterflies, etc.) and there's never a dull moment. 
* For the downsides (and I had to rack my brains to find some): 
   * I didn't really like any of the clothing styles (in fact, some of them really displeased me). 
   * Even though the episodes are well-balanced, I watched some passages at x1.5 because the actors took too long to get to the point. 

I really recommend this drama, it is an ode to self-acceptance and acceptance of others, and it reminded me on how important it is to rely on the people around us who love us at every stage of life, in order to move forward as serenely as possible. ",3,1729102691.0,asiandrama,0,1.0,False

He has seen his food therapist several times, which I consider to be part of his OT (he was born Sept 22) and we’ve had lots of cancellations on my end from flooded house issues to kiddo being sick or us getting Covid/similarly gross and contagious stuff (all in 3 months) and now on our first day of speech therapy with another person, but same organization, I honestly forgot it was today and it wasn’t documented via email or text otherwise (still my fault for not remembering) and he’s sick and I can’t reasonably have someone over for this because our house is a disaster but both my son and my husband are sick (700 sf home too, so not really possible to distance) and I can’t reasonably let someone expose themselves to whatever plague these two have, knowing that his therapists have so many other kiddos in their care. 

I want to make sure both of his therapists know I appreciate them and care - I bought them some smaller Stanley cups, as well as reusable “nice” hot coffee cups and got a $40 Starbucks GC for them. Each GC is $10, so $80 total for the cards. They are all (the cups too) in original boxes and they can regift them for all I care. But I just want to make sure they know we appreciate and value their time.

1g564ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkinitalian/comments/1g564ly/i_have_to_give_think_in_italian_some_credit_after/,"I have to give Think in Italian some credit. After just 100 days of using it, I went on vacation to Italy and was able to speak and understand Italian.","Praise must be given to Think in Italian for the immense impact it has had on this my recent trip to Italy. My wife and I needed first to take out this much anticipated vacation which we had been planning for close to a year and this time around, I intended to do more than just order food and ask directions. I began using Think in Italian, about 6 months before we left and spent possibly 30 minutes a day on it. I was not expecting much apart from the basics but by the time we were touching down in Venice, I was quite astounded at the level of ease at which I handled the navigation and conversing with the locals.

To begin with, I must confess that I was first a little cynical on whether such an application would hold my interest. I already have learned other languages using language apps, and I usually stop after a few days. Think in Italian was like a walk in the park in the beginning since all it involved was listening to an audio and repeating it back. But then I persisted with the lessons and came to the conclusion that the repetition was, in fact, engrossing. Over a period of time, the lessons became progressively complex and I noticed that I was thinking less in English and more in Italian.

Maybe the best was in a small trattoria in Trastevere: the waiter-he heard me speaking Italian, a bit slow with mistakes-began immediately to correct me, instead of continuing in English. It became a mini-lesson, and he explained the different pasta dishes on the menu. I came to learn the subtle differences between ""rigatoni"" and ""paccheri""-something one doesn't get from most textbooks. That little interaction gave me a big confidence boost.

Another memorable experience was at a small family-run winery in Siena. The owner spoke a little English, but once he realized I was attempting to speak Italian, he started telling us all about the history of the vineyard in Italian. I picked most of it up, even asked a few questions, which was altogether such a different experience than nodding and smiling to this person instead of just a tourist.

The mundane things, too, like buying coffee or asking for directions, went easier than expected. We stayed in a small B&B in the countryside where the owner didn't speak any English. With what I had learned, we were able to chat a bit. I was even able to have a conversation about the Italian breakfast tradition. I felt it made me feel a bit more like a local rather than just another tourist.

I have to also mention the AI tutor feature: I would, with every lesson, spend about 15 minutes practicing with it, and it truly made a huge difference in reinforcing what I'd just learned. It's not perfect, but that kind of immediate feedback was something I didn't get from other apps.

There are, however, some areas it could improve on. For example, it would be nice to have a native app instead of just one that can work in the browser, and the design felt a little old-fashioned when I first started. But to their credit, it does seem like the developers make updates regularly.

I'm still using it even now that we're back. That is, I have gone from viewing Italian as something I needed to learn to something I wanted to learn. I'm looking forward to continuing and, hopefully on our next trip, I can have complete conversations without reverting back to English at all. If you're looking to get beyond the basics and actually start thinking in the language, I'd definitely give it a shot.

There had been none of the usual trails on her when she left the Agora for the Sisters. Even with the extra precautions she took now, she still hadn’t seen anyone following in the crowd.

And that made it all so much worse.

The Guard had shown they could follow her invisibly. That woman in the shadows had followed her undetected. It all made her paranoid and twitchy, and sent her head reeling. But if she waited any longer without showing up as Tianna, then the whole plan was likely to crumble.

Now she had trouble stabilising into Tianna’s form, nubs of her horns poking out on her forehead.

“You’re wearing a trench in my floor again, girl,” Aliana said impatiently. “Sit down.”

She gave the priestess an impatient glare of her own and grumble before taking a seat, flattening her pointed hat. Her foot bounced as she surveyed the room for the hundredth time, taking stock of the exits, both seen and unseen, of the strange jars, the leaves, the sprouts on the roots, the instruments that she couldn’t name.

A glass was pushed into her hand and she drank without even looking at the thing. Tasted of berries. Had a decent kick. She sniffed in annoyance and held it out for a second shot. Aliana poured her more. At this rate she was likely to develop a habit.

“What’s there to follow,” the priestess of the Dryad said drily. “I need you to join me here two nights from now. Alone. And if I’m not clear enough, that means I need you to make absolutely certain you’re not followed.”

“But… why?” It was such an odd request, come at a terrible time. “I was certain nobody had followed me before, but even so they knew I was coming and going.”

“I’m aware.”

Nothing more was forthcoming on the subject. Aliana poured herself a thimble of drink and took sips. Mertle downed her second shot and it kicked somewhat harder than the first. She liked the aftertaste and could understand why Tallah kept… borrowing from the priestess’s impressive spirits collection. This, distilled once more, would be considered quite extravagant in Beril. For the elendars.

“Why are you helping?” she asked as various parts of her settled into the human shape. Her horns no longer tried to jut out through skin. Absently, she ran two fingers along her forehead, making sure she wasn’t unravelling anymore.

“Because I can. Get out. I’ve other business to see to.”

To her mounting annoyance, Aliana seemed unaware that Mertle couldn’t disregard the dangers to herself as easily as the High Priestess of the Sisters of Healing could. Not everyone could enjoy immunity such as hers—nobody, to her knowledge, was as highly stationed aside from Ort’s priesthood. Even those had to answer to the empress.

The dismissal goaded her into sullen defiance but she stamped it down. No time for fancies. She had two missions to deal with before the enchantment ran its course. She put on her shawls, carefully made herself indistinct, and headed out through the secret exit, different from the one she’d used to come in. Now that the Guard had shown they knew of her comings and going, she and Aliana had decided to alternate the days when Tianna showed up, make it harder for anyone to draw any connection between the two.

She found her way out into the cold through narrow, twisting tunnels dug by the roots. Scents of mildew and sap accompanied her passage up until it was replaced by wisps of smoke as she emerged behind a workshop someplace near the Guild. From there it was a matter of skulking like a rat through hidden alleys and squeezing gaps between buildings, heading slowly towards the Meadow.

Passing from the upper city into the lower, she used the worst set of stairs, out of the main ways and secluded in such a way that nobody could follow outside. Her disguise switched back to Tianna’s underclothes by the time she stepped out again.

Tianna had been gone for a couple of days now, but Verti had been forewarned of this. Either Tianna kept her own council and did not wish to be disturbed under any circumstances, or she prowled Valen’s streets for days on end. That was what the Meadow knew.

Mertle had heard the rumours swirling around the Agora. Verti and her daughters had particularly strong words to share out about the wayward aelir healer eloping with Lady Tianna’s beau. It couldn’t be helped; Sil would just need to find a different disguise when she came back. She, herself, had explained that Tianna must be preserved beyond any other concern. The rest was easier to solve, but the sorceress was important to their long-term plans.

“Good morning, your Ladyship.”

Using the front door seemed to summon Verti to her side. The way she emerged out of the crowd to fall into step with her had ceased surprising Mertle, though she still flinched at the polite words. Her carefully arrayed expression was one of tired resignation.

“Good morning to you too, Verti.” She stifled a half-honest yawn. “Any word while I was gone?”

“None as of yet.”

“Any callers?”

“Just that impolite girl from the Storm Guard. She’s not been very insistent this time.” Verti passed her a letter sealed with the signet of the Guard. “This was left with me for your eyes.”

Mertle slipped it inside her cloak and allowed Verti to lead her up to the room through the morning crowd. She’d stopped carrying the key with her for fear of misplacing it.

“Breakfast, please. Something light. I’ve no appetite for more.”

“Of course, your Ladyship. Coffee?”

“Strong. From your stock please.” Verti bought hers from a particular vendor that Mertle couldn’t normally afford. This was one of the best things about playing Tianna’s role. “It’s been a terribly long night.”

“Of course, your Ladyship.”

The narrative she worked with was that Tianna was not impressed by the rumours of her healer running off in some romantic tryst with the human man. Worry had given way to wounded pride in being abandoned after the events of the Descent, and now her search had a more vengeful air to it. If she found the two, she would roast them alive for the trouble caused. A pyromancer’s patience was short on the best of days, and adding insult to the mix only led to explosive outcomes.

“We’ve received more word from the caravan,” Verti said as she unlocked the door to the apartment. “The last of the escort’s returned to Valen. Cassiopa has overheard them talking in their cups. The caravan has passed Bastra’s last encampment and it took on fresh guards. Signs are good it will reach Solstice before the thaw.”

Mertle knew this, of course, from her own wandering around the Guild’s halls. She nodded as she stepped into the darkened hallway and closed the door behind her. The rooms were all exactly as she’d left them. No signs of tampering or intrusion.

She spent half of a bell taking stock of all precautions set about the place, even the low-brow ones that only particularly low-born spies made use of.

The apartment had become a truly unwelcoming place in its starkness. She disrobed and headed for a bath, allowing herself the small luxury that her little shop never could. Ever since she’d been a whelp, the only bathing she’d known had been with a sponge and a pail of cool water, or submerged in a forest stream. Beril’s countryside afforded nothing more.

A whole tub all to herself and warm water? Luxury undreamed of by most Nen-born elend.

She heard the door opening and a cart brought in. She would eat, get a wink of sleep—the enchantment held strongest if she slept—and then head out again to make a nuisance of herself somewhere. Probably the Guild as Lucian was due another visit.

Yes, Lucian for today. She’d prepared a couple of the orders she was behind on so Tummy would run deliveries and the shop would be closed. It afforded her to be gone for some time.

Clean and still steaming, she ate sparsely, set the coffee aside for later, and went to rest in Sil’s bed. Without her lover, the bed was too big, too soft, and too foreign for her to enjoy. But the room still held the subtle scent of alchemy and fresh soap, and that brought her a measure of comfort.

Without Sil’s breathing and heartbeat, and without Tummy’s hammering and muttering, silence seeped in. On the cusp of sleep, this was the silence of memory unchained and shaken loose by the stress of the charade she barely kept up.

She drifted away to the sound of her own quick heartbeat and the old whispers of a lifetime and a world away.

“There is a traitor in the household,” Protector Aranar said, addressing the gathered servants and vassals in the large hollow of the Olden. “I have been informed of this by a friend. There is an assassin here, sent to kill me.” They all laughed at the notion.

Mertle laughed with them, barely hearing the Protector in the back of the crowd. Even from afar he was an impressive aelir’sar, tall and broad of shoulder, still coming into his prime. Twin atagans shone on his belt.

She’d been with the household for three seasons now. She’d broken bread and drank wine with the other servants. Had even allowed some of the aelir low-born to take her into their bed so her place in the household would be secured.

“Ridiculous,” Protector Aranar went on, pacing on the dais where his table normally sat when he ate with the vassals. “If this assassin is indeed here, I urge them to come to me. I would show mercy for I am blessed and in good spirit. If they do not desire mercy, then I shall eagerly await the thrust of their traitorous dagger.”

Again, Mertle laughed with the others. Mercy from Protector Aranar meant being flayed rather than handed over to his wife and her ministrations. Aelir’matar Aranar wasn’t here now or the servants wouldn’t have dared even a smile.

Aelir’matar Sarrinare had warned the Protector. And Mertle had received thus her own warning. The mission was taking too long. She’d gone beyond her allotted time frame and the aelir’matar was displeased. The next message would unveil and leave her to Aranar’s fancies.

She went to work that night.

Moonlight found her crouching in shadow among the high canopy of the Olden tree. She’d climbed there by the light of the Mother, the path prepared after two seasons of exploration and planning. The deed was to happen that very night, or she might expect an unkind end. It would still be better than returning to the Sarrinare household with her task unaccomplished.

Protector Aranar’s household had treated her kindly and hadn’t suspected her purpose. Now, she climbed, her path secured. Guards were of no concern so high. She knew all their routes and all their secret hiding spots. She’d taken tea to them more than once, the half-wit elendine born so low in Beril that she might as well have been an animal. What did it matter what she overheard?

Some of them would be discovered come morning with throats slit. Some had been in her way. Some had not been kind and this was petty vengeance. For two, it was mercy to stave off their lord’s fury, a reward for their gentleness and propriety in how they treated her.

She crawled underneath the highest branches, hands finding thick vines to support her, as the light slowly faded when clouds crossed the Mother’s face. She would accomplish her mission and then disappear into the ever-forest. Supplies waited below, hidden in a hollow beneath the east-most root of the Olden. It would a season’s trek back to the Sarrinare household, through the wilds of the steppes.

Protector Aranar was no fool. His lady wife was obscenely powerful with a spectacular nose for poisons. Together, they were an ascendant force in the Dominion with an excellent claim for a centre position, a bold undertaking for a lowly steppe lord.

Mertle suspected this her reason for being there. Those outside the Hearth Circle should remain where their station dictated, not lay claims to positions above their worth. That had always been the Sarrinare stance, though they’d never claim it aloud.

She pulled herself up to the highest part of the Olden’s crown, bare head to the bare sky above, moonlight fleeting. Barefooted, she made her way slowly to her destination, walking softly on swaying platforms, hidden in the long shadow of her destination.

The star-gazing nest observatory, a bulbous growth atop the Olden, lay just ahead. Moonlight cast its shadow across the rustling leaves and Mertle herself, the Mother moon still low in the night sky. If Mertle were lucky, it would rain by midnight.

Tubes protruded out of the observatory, aimed at the sky above. The glint of reflected light onto glass lenses staring somewhere into the far darkness of the night.

She’d been up there many times, sent up with food and drink, or to guide some of the household’s guests. She knew the way and how there were only two entrances: one beneath, and the window for the strange apparatus to poke out. Two entrances for the civilised.

Aelir’rei Kaleo, single scion of Protector Aranar, would be working late, bent over her sketches and notes, on the light-side of the observatory. She drew graphs whenever the weather did not permit her to gaze freely upon the stars. Given the darkening night, she would likely be drawing in the *telescope* to secure it against the coming rain*.*

Mertle cut her way in from beneath, through the thick-leaf floor. It had never been fashioned to resist a blade, and certainly not hers. It took some effort, but she made her way inside through the cut, emerging sticky with sap right behind her target, her arrival disguised by the nest’s swaying in the gathering wind.

Sure enough, there Kaleo was, bent over her apparatus, adjusting a complicated series of dials and knobs for purposes that Mertle couldn’t even guess at. Plaques full of schematics and drawings of the night sky littered the walls, filled with tight annotations that nobody was likely to even decipher.

The knife cut into her neatly, just between the ribs to split her heart in two. Kaleo gasped and tried to pull away, but Mertle’s hand was on her mouth as she twisted the knife. Hot blood coated her cold hand.

She lowered the aelir’rei to the floor and let her blood pool beneath. Kaleo died with eyes staring out at the night and Mertle found she had no strength in her to close them.",2,1729102305.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
