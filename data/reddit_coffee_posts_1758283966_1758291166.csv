**Day 1** – Arrival, check-in at Nayara, relaxed in the hot springs, dinner at Ayla (amazing Mediterranean-Costa Rican fusion).  
**Day 2** – La Fortuna Waterfall, Mistico Hanging Bridges, Arenal Volcano hike, dinner at Asia Luna.  
**Day 3** – Morning volcano hike, ATV adventure, Tabacón Hot Springs in the evening, dinner at Jalapas (worth the taxi ride!).  
**Day 4** – White-water rafting on the Sarapiquí River (Class II/III, super fun and scenic), relaxed with room service after.  
**Day 5** – Horseback riding in the morning, coffee & chocolate tour in the afternoon, dinner at La Street Bistro.  
**Day 6** – Full Rio Celeste adventure: tubing, hiking to the waterfall, sloth spotting, and ziplining. Dinner back at the resort.  
**Day 7** – Spa day + hot springs at Nayara, finished with a farewell dinner at the resort.

Every day was a perfect mix of adventure and relaxation. If anyone’s debating between activities, rafting and Rio Celeste were huge highlights, and the food at Nayara (and around town) was way better than we expected.

1nl49m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nl49m5/evaluate_best_top_load_washer_performance_with_ge/,Evaluate best top load washer performance with GE GTW500ASNWS,"Testing out the GE GTW500ASNWS washer over the past few weeks has been quite the experience. This top-loading washer, with its 4.6 cu. ft. capacity and sleek white finish, has handled everything from my workout clothes to bulky blankets with surprising ease. It’s large and, let’s be honest, a bit heavy to move around at 147 pounds, but once in place, it’s a sturdy feature of my laundry room. The controls, which operate with simple push buttons, are intuitive—perfect for someone like me who doesn’t want to stare at the manual for hours.

**Design and Capacity**  
One of the first things I noticed about this washer was its stainless steel tub. This feature isn’t just about durability; it’s also practical. Unlike some other washers that may chip or rust, I found zero instances of clothing being snagged or damaged. The spacious 4.6 cu. ft. capacity feels even larger than anticipated—it easily fits multiple towels and even large bedding items. Laundry overloads no longer feel like a chore but a task completed in fewer cycles.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
Performance-wise, this washer isn’t just a looker—it delivers cleaning power that most will appreciate. The dual-action agitator is the real MVP here. I could physically see it reversing and implementing powerful wash actions, ensuring all my clothes got some love and attention. For someone who’s prone to accidentally spilling coffee on shirts, this capability is crucial. Additionally, the deep clean cycle blew me away. It claims to provide 67% more cleaning power compared to standard modes, and from my experience with messy jeans and stained T-shirts, it just might be accurate.

**Favorable Aspects**  
Here are some of the advantages I personally experienced with this washer:  
- The stainless steel basket prevents wear and tear on clothes.  
- Deep Fill option allows adding extra water to fully submerge clothes when I need it.  
- Speed Wash cycle is super convenient for quick loads, like refreshing workout gear midweek.

**Caveats**  
However, not everything was smooth sailing. A few areas stood out as needing improvement:  
- Spin cycles, while powerful at 800 RPM, can sometimes feel a bit noisy.  
- The machine doesn’t have as advanced smart features as some competitors.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this washer to alternatives like the LG WT7800CW or the Whirlpool WTW5000DW, some interesting patterns emerge. While the GE GTW500ASNWS wins on deep cleaning and basic functionality, it doesn’t quite match competitors in terms of tech-savvy features like smart connectivity or self-diagnosing systems. LG’s model, for instance, boasts a quieter operation and app control, while Whirlpool’s contender edges out with a more energy-efficient design. However, the stainless steel basket of the GE model feels more reliable and less prone to issues over time compared to some alternatives.

[""Check GE GTW500ASNWS price on Amazon.""](https://newcookware.com/p/b07p7zdtb9/)

**Energy Use and Maintenance**  
Being freestanding, the GE GTW500ASNWS doesn’t require any complicated installation, and maintenance is equally straightforward. The portable design was surprisingly handy when I wanted to rearrange the laundry room. I didn’t notice any excessive water or electricity usage, which is always a plus, especially when utility bills arrive. Additionally, the 13 different cycles—including options for baby clothes, extra rinsing, and draining—offer flexibility for every type of load I threw its way. The second rinse feature became my go-to for removing detergent residues from my sensitive skin loads.

**Value for Money**  
This washer delivers what it promises in most respects, but does the overall package justify the price tag? I’d say yes—but conditionally. If you prioritize strong cleaning capability and a durable build over flashy digital features, this washer is a solid contender. It’s built to last and handles stains like a pro. But for anyone who’s hoping for Wi-Fi compatibility or futuristic bells and whistles, other models may be more appealing.

What’s the point?,"The question is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but still something I am wondering about. There are a lot of fragrances where I am LOVING the dry-down, or even just 5-10 minutes in what the scent mellows out to. But the first spray is often just intensely alcohol or a sharp floral or citrus that has no staying power or longevity and has very little to do with the heart/base.  

For example, Cafe Tuberosa (Atelier Cologne) smells like alcohol and burnt coffee (no richness or depth - just a cheap cup of burned coffee) with acrid floral for the first 30 minutes or so to me. I hated it when I first tried it. But it mellows to a beautiful rich floral/spice with vestiges of a richer coffee that is delightful. It evokes what coffee would taste like to me if it were actually a tea, lol. 

I know a lot of people buy based off top notes or that initial spray even since that’s what we get in a store, or if we don’t take the time to wear it and come back a few hours later. And some wear beautiful and consistent in its feel while shifting throughout. I’m thinking of Oud Nude, or ELDO 500 Years or Marquis de Sade. It shifts- but it still feels the same in terms of the accords, just in different strengths. Like when you listen to symphonies and some parts crecendo and others diminuendo - the same overall piece, but with nuance.

But when they don’t “match,” so to speak, what is the point of something that is so fleeting, so different, and also sometimes so off-putting? ",1,1758290139.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

1nl46kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nl46kp/is_it_worth_investing_in_wireless_headphones/,Is it worth investing in wireless headphones?,"Hey everyone! I've been using wireless headphones for about 3 years now, and I thought I'd share my honest experience with you all. Trust me, I was super skeptical at first – I mean, who wants another device to charge, right?

But man, was I wrong. The freedom of movement you get with wireless headphones is just incredible. No more getting tangled up in wires while working out or accidentally yanking your phone off the table (we've all been there!). 

I remember this one time I was cleaning my house, moving from room to room, and I realized I hadn't thought about my headphones once. They just worked. That's when it hit me – this is what technology should feel like.

Speaking of which, I recently found some really good deals on wireless headphones here: https://athometouch.com/headphones. The prices are way better than what I paid for mine!

Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room – battery life. Modern wireless headphones typically last anywhere from 20-40 hours, depending on the model. Even the cheaper ones usually give you at least 15 hours. I charge mine about once a week, usually while I'm sleeping, so it's really not a hassle.

Sound quality has come a long way too. The latest Bluetooth standards are incredible – you probably won't notice any difference between wired and wireless anymore. Plus, many wireless headphones now come with active noise cancellation, which is a game-changer for commuting or working in noisy environments.

One thing I love is how smart they've become. Most wireless headphones automatically pause when you take them off and resume when you put them back on. Some even connect to multiple devices simultaneously, so you can switch between your phone and laptop seamlessly.

If you're on the fence about making the switch, I'd really recommend checking out the options available here: https://athometouch.com/headphones. There's something for every budget, and the convenience is totally worth it.

The only minor downside I've experienced is remembering to charge them, but it becomes part of your routine pretty quickly. Just like charging your phone, you know?

For gym-goers, wireless headphones are absolutely essential. I can't imagine going back to dealing with a cord while running or doing burpees. And if you work from home like me, being able to grab a coffee from the kitchen while still listening to your music or staying on a call is priceless.

Bottom line? Wireless headphones are definitely worth the investment in 2023. The technology has matured, prices have come down, and the benefits far outweigh any minor inconveniences. Just make sure to get a pair that fits your lifestyle and budget, and you'll wonder how you ever lived without them!",1,1758289962.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I can't ask my parents to buy these things, and there is no medical store nearby, so I can't go repeatedly. I will have to collect the money for it myself. That's why I'm asking, it seems very expensive online, but prices for most of the tables are higher online. So, could someone please tell me the approximate price? And is it sold as a whole box, or can you buy as much as you want? Like normal paracetamol Please let me know so I can go and buy it someday. My situation has become very bad, and I need it urgently.

1nl45ag,https://i.redd.it/7vdybi1jm4qf1.jpeg,"Christmas Dinner at Fort Monroe, 1936","Following the Folsom Prison episode where Max asked for menus, I remembered this one I saw years ago from Fort Monroe here in Virginia. https://www.instagram.com/share/p/BBKg6UEGaT

Since I saw it, I've wanted to recreate it some year, but perhaps I can live vicariously through Max. 

I would particularly like to see him create the oyster dressing, an old Virginia staple that I've had at many a Thanksgiving and Christmas. That with the creamed peas, sugar ham, and candied sweet potatoes would be the peak of a Tidewater Christmas feast. 

What I particularly like about this menu is the fact that they included the names of the men who made it and served it, very much with pride no doubt.

The story of Fort Monroe and the Hampton Roadstead are fascinating and cover the breadth of American history, from John Smith and Christopher Newport to the Seige of Yorktown and the War of 1812, to the Civil War and Reconstruction to WWI, WWII, and the modern day. Across the roads is the largest naval base in the world at Norfolk. A violent hurricane created Willoughby Spit just across the roadstead in the late 1600s, forming a narrower entrance to the James River bounded by the site of Fort Monroe (then Old Point Comfort) across the wide roads. Norfolk was home to loyalists during the Revolutionary War and was bombarded by both sides. During the Civil War, Fort Monroe was a crucial position for the north and south alike, and in addition to being a safe haven for escaped slaves was the spot where Jefferson Davis was held after his capture following the war. During WWI and WWII, it, along with a network of forts and installations, played a vital role in defending Norfolk, the Newport News shipyard, and the Chesapeake Bay. It served as an active military installation until 2011 and today houses a museum with a wealth of history. Fun fact, Fort Monroe is just next to one of the three bridge-tunnels in the region (and the only 3 in the US) which was the first one ever built in the world, and one of only 15 globally.

This menu is a glimpse into the history of Tidewater Virginia and the interconnectedness of the region with the military. Just 5 years before US involvement in WWII, no doubt some of the men listed served during the War, too. But in 1936, as the Depression was easing ever so slightly and before the scope of the European conflict reached America, the men at Fort Monroe settled down to a well-prepared Virginia feast.",7,1758289874.0,TastingHistory,0,1.0,False

1nl41ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nl41ds/mf_the_joy_we_give/,[MF] The Joy We Give,"When I first met him it was a warm night. Me and my wife had been invited to a house party. It was a friend of a friend’s, I didn’t know the host. 

I sat in a big fluffy chair against a wall and watched my wife enjoy herself. I wasn’t very social back then, I only came because she had asked me to. I heard a man take a seat on the couch to the left of me and when I turned to see who, I saw a man in a hoodie holding a big blue can of beer in my face. 

“Beer?” The man asked. 
“No I don’t drink but thank you” I politely answered. 
“Oh, why?” He said in a rather casual tone while he put the can on an end table next to him and took a drink of his opened one. I was confused by this and I guess I had shown it on my face. 
“I don’t mean to try and pressure you” he said “I only ask because there’s two kinds of non-drinkers. The ones who have trauma around it and the ones who don’t like the feeling or don’t like who they are when they’re drunk. I’ve always thought it’s kind of cool to see who is who."" He looked at me with a soft expression and kind smile, if he had seemed any different I would’ve gotten up and left. Instead I answered him. 

“Trauma” I said and that night was the first time I had a conversation without worrying if what I said was embarrassing. I learned that his name was Jason, he had come over from Iowa and that he didn’t like his family but never said why. I told him my name is Taylor and my fears about being a father. 

We had talked for so long that I had lost track of time. I only realized how late it had gotten when Anna, my wife, came to ask if I was ready to leave. I said goodbye to Jason, and got up to follow Anna. 

“Drive safe” Jason said “you’re gonna be an amazing father” he said to my back, and I felt as if he had really meant it. 



The second time I met him I didn’t recognize him. It was about a year later, my wife had gotten pregnant that night after the house party. I was out shopping for baby supplies for our new born daughter. 

I remember I was getting ready to pay for the assortment of food, diapers, and other things in my cart when a woman stopped right infront of me. 

“Taylor” she said with the tone of an old friend “how have you been?” She asked. 

“I’m sorry, do I know you?” I asked, looking her up and down trying to find something that stuck out, something that would pierce the fog of drowsiness in my mind. That’s when I looked into her eyes, that simple glance took me back to that night. 

“Oh” she began “I’m sorry I forget that others don’t ha-“ 

“Jason?” I cut her off “the house party right? I thought you were a dude”. I said with a bit of a laugh. She laughed a bit with me 

“Well I was back then, I started transitioning to a woman around a year ago. It’s Isabell now” she said with a bit of tension in her voice, as if bracing herself for something. 

“Oh” I said in thought, I hadn’t known that was a thing until now. “Well you look good, and really happy” as I said this she seemed to relax a bit, as if something I said soothed her but I didn’t understand what. 

“Thanks” She said back with a smile “you look like a father” 

We both laughed and continued to talk for longer than I really meant to. We talked about how it was possible for her to be a woman through hormones and how much of a little terror my daughter was. Just like the first time I felt free to say whatever I felt. 

Then my phone rang, it was Anna asking if I’d be home soon. I told her I’d be home as soon as I could be and said goodbye to Isabell for the second time. 


Quite a few years later I had forgotten all about Isabell. My career had taken off allowing me to buy a house, it wasn’t fancy but it was a good home. Anna had started her own business, my daughter was 12 now. My life, until this day, was going well. Earlier in the morning my daughter had told me something, something she made me promise not to tell mom. It was a subject I only knew about thanks to Isabell. 

I sat leaned back in my chair in the cafe, my laptop open in front of me but I was too lost in thought to see the screen. Instead I just scratched my lower lip and chin. Then, as if knowing I needed her, Isabell sat across from me. 

“Hi Taylor” she said, setting her purse on the table. This time I recognized her but she had changed so much. There was no sign of Jason anywhere except for soft her eyes and her kind smile. 

“Isabell?” I said somewhat shocked “what’re you doing here?” 

“Oh I was teaching one of my students not far from here and needed a late morning pick-me-up” she slightly shook her coffee as she said this. “I’m surprised you remember me after all this time” 

“I was actually thinking about you funny enough” I said then realized how that sounded and chuckled a bit “in a friendly way of course” 

She laughed a sweet laugh and said “don’t worry I’m not gonna go anywhere near Anna’s territory” she said, flicking her hand downward playfully at me. ""How's your wife and daughter doing?” 

I sighed and leaned forward, closing my laptop. “Actually I was just told I don’t have a daughter, I have a son and my wife doesn’t know it yet.” This got a side eye from Isabell “I don’t know what to do” I continued “I want what’s best for whatever type of kid I have and I’m scared because I don’t know what to expect. How was it when you started working on being a woman?” 

She looked down at her cup as if my words brought back a deep pain she forgot. As it turns out, it did. She explained everything to me. She told me about the town she grew up in and how scared she had been to tell her parents. Turns out her fears were right and her parents kicked her out, this is how she came to be at that house party. She had found a place to live with that friend of a friend of Anna’s. At the end of it all she told me that she was happier than she ever knew she could be. 

We sat in a long silence after her story, taking the entirety of her life that she had laid before me. 
“What if I mess it up?” I asked, I wasn’t asking Isabell specifically but she answered anyways 

“You will” she said and I looked up at her eyes as she spoke “it’s gonna happen no matter what, so give yourself room to say ‘I’m sorry’. My parents never did that, it would’ve changed a lot probably.” Then she looked out the window. We say for a bit longer talking here and there, nothing too serious. 

Then she got up and said that her next lesson was starting soon and that she needed to go. She handed me her card before she left in case me or my son needed anything. “Isabells magic keys” it said in bold leaders with a long winding line of piano keys on it. I kept the card, even to today. 



I wouldn’t get a chance to use it though. Two months later I got a call on my cell phone. I remember I had just sat on the couch to watch tv with Anna and Jason, my son. I answered the phone with a harsh annoyed tone, which dropped the moment a shaky voice started talking. The man who had called was a friend of Isabell’s, he explained that she had died and my name was on the list of people she wanted at her funeral. 

I didn’t understand why she had such a list or why I would be on it. I went regardless, I owed her that much. Anna and Jason also came. Anna had heard through her friends that Isabell had been murdered. A man posed as a father and used her business to get her into his house. To this day I will never understand such evil, I wonder if the man could ever understand the kindness he had taken away. 

While at the funeral I met lots of people who knew Isabell, they knew her more than I ever could. Many of them never knew she used to be Jason, that was known to only a few of us. During the wake I had walked up to the casket, it was closed. I looked over and saw a woman standing next to me, she looked almost like Isabell. 

“Did you know her well?” I said, stumbling over what to say. 

She looked at me with a harsh look “I knew my brother quite well, thank you” then she crossed her arms and stood there a bit angry. 

I looked at her with sadness that she never knew how amazing her sister was “no, you didn’t” I said in a factual tone and simply walked away. I walked by myself somewhat aimlessly until I found myself in a silent room. I stood for a second enjoying the silence when I heard someone sniffling. I looked over and saw a person in a chair, they wore a black dress that looked a bit too small on their wide frame. I walked over to them softly and as they looked up I could see the dark shade of a freshly shaved beard under their running makeup. 

I simply looked down at them and asked with a gentle smile “do you drink?” 

They shook their head no as another tear ran down their cheek.

1nl414f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nl414f/my_25m_girlfriend_25f_is_constantly_upset_how_do/,"My (25M) girlfriend (25F) is constantly upset. How do I support her, and when do I give up?","My girlfriend's childhood was difficult, both at school and back home.

Despite all that, she managed to finish a university degree.

With the state of the job market, though, she's back at it this year – and this new programme is much more theoretically challenging for her.

She's being extremely hard on herself about it, and four weeks in, she's already talking about being behind on reading. Not because she doesn't read, but because she feels slow and that little of it sticks.

That might be true, but she's talking herself down so so much. By this point, most of our phone calls are tainted by negativity. We spend a lot of our time together discussing her struggles.

Worst of all is how she's constantly comparing herself to others, though – me included, which I feel like is provoking arguments between us, and making it difficult for me to support her.

This isn't new behavior from her, as she focused a lot on the negative parts of her previous job before going back to school. When she got back to uni and one week had passed, most of her focus was on the fact that she didn't feel comfortable with the people there. As she got to know them better, her focus shifted to her negative feelings about the reading.

For a while I've felt that her negative attitude affects my own psyche, which unfortunately has affected my patience for it. I try to give her advice on how to handle both her studies and her headspace, as I too have struggled a lot with stress and my self-image. I work hard to counteract that now, and find solace in separating my work and relaxation time and spaces; in romanticizing aspects of every day life (like my 8 AM morning cup of coffee); by experiencing creative inspiration; and so on.

Now I feel like her struggles are taking me back to a place I don't want to be. That makes me panic sometimes, which isn't helpful to our communication – and I sometimes feel guilty, because I know she has it worse than I do.

1nl4120,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1nl4120/reveal_why_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Reveal Why the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Stanley Delivers,"Stanley 10-09566 Camp Pour Over Set has been part of my morning routine for a few months now, and as someone who relishes a good cup of coffee, I can’t help but appreciate the craftsmanship of this set. This pour-over coffee maker fits right into the lifestyle of camping enthusiasts or anyone who loves their coffee fresh and flavorful. The iconic Hammertone Green finish sparked nostalgia the first time I laid eyes on it, reminding me of classic outdoor gear passed down through family generations. Beyond aesthetics, this set—comprising a reusable filter and a sturdy 12-ounce camp mug—is a thoughtful invention with practicality and quality in mind.

**A Thoughtful Design for Coffee Lovers**

The compact and lightweight stainless steel design makes the pour-over maker ideal for outdoor adventures. My first impression was how solid it felt in hand, despite weighing in at just 1.45 pounds. Its dimensions, measuring 5.8 inches in length and width and standing 8.9 inches tall, ensure portability without compromising usability. The set’s rugged individuality is enhanced by its reusable filter, eliminating the need for wasteful paper filters—a bonus for the eco-conscious camper.

[Find the best price for Stanley 10-09566 Camp Pour Over Set on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b088jxmg3b/)

**What Sets the Stainless Steel Filter Apart**

Having used other drip coffee setups before, I quickly noticed the difference the stainless steel filter makes. Unlike paper filters, this reusable filter retains the subtle oils and notes of your coffee bean, giving a richer, fuller flavor. I experimented with different grinds and discovered that coarsely-ground beans get the best results. The process is simple yet satisfying—add coffee grinds, pour boiling water in a circular motion, stir, and let the brew work its magic. It didn’t take long for me to perfect my wrist movement, something the coffee enthusiast inside me relished.

**Effortless Setup and Easy Cleanup**

The simplicity of the operation impressed me right away. I’m not exactly patient when caffeine is calling my name, and the process of using this coffee maker felt refreshingly efficient. Once done, rinsing out the stainless steel filter took mere seconds, reducing downtime between my cups. Whether I was brewing on a campsite or at my kitchen counter, the ease of cleaning made it convenient to reuse.

**Strengths**

- Stainless steel filter ensures no loss of coffee’s aromatic oils.
- Reusable filter reduces the continuous need for paper alternatives.
- Compact and sturdy build is perfect for camping and outdoor trips.
- The timeless Hammertone Green finish is visually appealing.
- Easy-to-clean design makes it hassle-free for daily use.

**Shortcomings**

- Managing the wrist motion while pouring hot water might be tricky for beginners.
- The 12-ounce mug limits batch size, which might be restrictive for group settings.
- Some users may find it heavier compared to ultra-light backpacking counterparts.

**Alternative Offerings**

Against other pour-over coffee makers like the Hario V60 or Chemex, the Stanley 10-09566 stands out in ruggedness and portability. While the Chemex offers a more elegant, artistic experience for home use, it doesn’t match the outdoor-ready durability of this set. The Hario V60 ace in the deck is its lightweight design, but it requires disposable paper filters, which aren’t as eco-friendly. The Stanley set is a sweet spot between these options, especially for adventurous individuals looking for a sustainable and robust solution.

**Bang for the Buck**

The price-to-quality ratio feels incredibly reasonable, especially for a product built to last a lifetime. Stanley’s lifetime warranty puts the cherry on top, offering assurance that the investment is protected. The reusable filter pays for itself over time, saving money otherwise spent on disposable filters. For outdoor enthusiasts, this product proves its worth in both quality and practicality.

I’ve tried a bunch over the last year (across US, UK, CA, and FR channels), so here’s my totally personal, not-too-technical ranking of five IPTV services. Maybe it’ll save you a few late nights hunting for the “perfect” [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/).

* * *

### **1\.** [**XXIPTV**](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (or less if you commit to a longer plan)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, FR all covered)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (pretty much flawless—even when everyone’s watching the big US or UK games)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV was suggested by a Canadian [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) I know. After a week of testing everything from US news to French late-night movies, I was hooked. Their **best iptv trial** was quick to activate and worked on all my devices (even the ancient Android TV in my kitchen). The interface is clean, and even during peak hours, I rarely saw the dreaded buffering wheel.
    

* * *

### **2\.** [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (discounts for longer [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/))
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (huge variety for US, UK, CA, FR fans)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (super stable, but I noticed a tiny lag during some UK football matches)
    
*   **My experience:** I stumbled on IPTVMEZZY via a UK streaming group. The selection is massive, and I could flip from Canadian hockey to French documentaries with no trouble. Most nights it’s super smooth, but I had to refresh once or twice during big live UK sports.
    

* * *

### **3\.** [**Aurorastreaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK/FR, solid US/CA coverage)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (excellent for movies and shows, but UK sports can get choppy at times)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming was a bit of a surprise. I went in for the classic French films but ended up staying for the UK reality shows. Streams were reliable most of the time, though I did have to restart a few live matches when everyone seemed to be watching at once.
    

* * *

### **4\. PulsePlay IPTV**

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 20,000+ live, 62,000+ VOD (core US/UK/CA channels, lighter on FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for news and VOD, but live US and UK sports could buffer at peak times)
    
*   **My experience:** PulsePlay IPTV is my “background TV” pick. It’s perfect for US late-night, UK talk shows, or Canadian news. The French lineup is small but covers the basics. The sign-up process for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) was simple, and the support chat actually responds.
    

* * *

### **5\. StreamNest TV**

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 14,000+ live, 44,000+ VOD (US/UK focus, a handful of CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings meant more buffering, especially with live UK events)
    
*   **My experience:** StreamNest TV is more of a backup for me. It’s great for catching up on US sitcoms or UK news in the background, but not the best for big live events. If you’re curious about being an [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/), their dashboard is easy to find but I stuck to watching. It gets the job done for casual viewing.
    

* * *

**A Few Things I’ve Learned About IPTV in 2025**
------------------------------------------------

*   **Always take the best iptv trial** before you pay. Your setup, internet speed, and what you watch can change everything.
    
*   Don’t pick a provider just because of massive channel numbers. Figure out what you _really_ want to watch (for me: UK comedies, US news, and the occasional French thriller).
    
*   Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/) services have the occasional hiccup, especially during major live sports in the US or UK.
    
*   If you’re tempted to become an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/), just be ready for plenty of “why isn’t my stream working?” texts from friends.
    
*   And yes, always use a VPN for peace of mind and smoother streaming.",0,1758289551.0,EngineeringManagers,0,0.5,False

	•	Runs on Rive animations (blinks, wiggles, and fires a “speak” trigger when it mouths off).
	•	Talks to an LLM through n8n, so your messages actually go somewhere useful (well… as useful as the bot wants to be).
	•	Keeps up a rotation of idle taunts—if you ignore it, it will sass you every minute.
	•	Comes with sound effects + drid sounds for that extra “droid in your browser” feel.

🤖Why we did it:
Because customer service chatbots are boring. CH-11P is here to entertain, roast you a little, and maybe convince you to support the project with pizza or coffee.

🤖 How to try it:
	•	Load up https://ch11p.thesidequest.studio in your browser of choice. 
	•	Sit back and let Chillip either answer your question or insult your typing speed.

🤖 Pro tip:
If you walk away, the first taunt fires immediately. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

⸻

TL;DR: It’s a chatbot that refuses to behave, built with React + Vite, Rive, and n8n. Come for the tech stack, stay for the insults.",1,1758289149.0,GrowthHacking,0,1.0,False

1nl3pg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1nl3pg6/explore_best_gaming_keyboard_features_in_the_npet/,Explore Best Gaming Keyboard Features in the NPET K10 Review,"Testing the NPET K10 wired computer keyboard over the past month has genuinely been an experience worth sharing. As someone who spends hours typing and gaming, I’ve used my fair share of keyboards—ranging from pricey mechanical options to basic office hardware. This model pleasantly surprised me in places and slightly underwhelmed in others. Straight out of the box, the setup process was remarkably simple. The keyboard wastes no time; you plug it in via USB, and you’re ready to go. No extra software installations or configurations cluttered the experience, which I absolutely appreciated.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this keyboard is practical with a no-frills aesthetic. It's full-sized and comes with 104 keys, including a number pad and multimedia controls (triggered by FN+Function keys), which I found very handy when adjusting volume or skipping tracks. The black finish is sleek and doesn’t look out of place on any desk setup. The double-shot ABS keycaps are a plus since they resist fading, even with regular use. However, its build felt slightly lightweight at 1.85 pounds, which made it prone to sliding on smoother surfaces without a keyboard mat. Another standout design feature is its spill-resistant capabilities. Life happens—accidental coffee spills are almost unavoidable, but this keyboard holds its ground even when the unexpected occurs.

**Quiet, Comfortable Typing**  
Typing on this keyboard is surprisingly satisfying despite it not being mechanical. Each keystroke feels solid, and the low noise level kept me from annoying everyone nearby. Comfort was another noticeable aspect, although the quality slightly depends on personal preference. The keys have a decent resistance without feeling too stiff, which allowed me to type for hours without fatigue. For users who prioritize silent operation—say, for late-night gaming or working in shared spaces—this model is an excellent pick.

[Check NPET K10 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0bnhwkzbd/)  

**Performance and Durability**  
What this keyboard offers in performance is particularly appealing for its price range. The switch life promises up to 1,000,000 keystrokes. While I didn’t test all of them (obviously), the keys did hold up to some intensive gaming sessions and fast-paced typing marathons. The sturdy tilt legs with adjustable height were a thoughtful addition, although they could feel slightly flimsy if you tend to press down hard while gaming. With its longer 6.2ft USB cable, I never struggled to connect it to my PC, even with my setup being a bit far apart from the tower. 

**Compatibility and Adaptability**  
One of the core strengths here lies in its universal compatibility. This keyboard works with just about any PC running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10, and perhaps newer versions down the line too. It’s been a reliable everyday workhorse, seamlessly functioning across different laptops and desktops at both my home desk and my coworker's workspace when I loaned it for a day to test multiple setups. The plug-and-play functionality is highly dependable, and even my tech-challenged friend was up and running with it in under thirty seconds.

**Upsides**  
- Plug-and-play design eliminates the hassle of software installation.  
- Spill-resistant feature reduces accidental damage risk.  
- Full-size keyboard layout with multimedia functionality.  
- Quiet operation ideal for shared spaces.  

**Critiques**  
- Lightweight design can cause slight instability on smooth desks.  
- Adjustable tilt legs could feel fragile under excessive pressure.  
- Lacks the premium feel of higher-end mechanical keyboards.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking this keyboard up against models like the Redragon K552 or Logitech K120 reveals its strengths and areas for growth. Compared to the Redragon K552, its major advantage is the quiet typing experience. While Redragon keyboards offer the mechanical clicky switches gamers adore, they are noticeably louder. Logitech’s K120 stands on similar ground for affordability but feels comparatively outdated in terms of build durability and features like spill-proofing. NPET K10 strikes a unique balance between functional design and everyday practicality, making it a compelling option if price and utility are at the top of your list.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
In terms of value, this keyboard shines for someone who wants something affordable yet reliable. Merging features like media keys, spill resistance, and overall comfort into this price bracket makes it a practical choice. It doesn’t aim to be flashy or eyebrow-raising, but it delivers effectively for folks focused on getting robust daily functionality. I did find cheaper wired keyboards with fewer features, but the added extras on the NPET K10 justify stretching the budget slightly for the long-term durability it offers.

1nl3ow3,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nl3ow3/how_i_mistook_a_cult_for_a_yoga_meetup_and_why_i/,"How I Mistook a Cult for a Yoga Meetup ,and Why I Still Went Back the Next Week","It all started with a flyer. I was sitting at my favorite coffee shop, nursing a post-breakup cold brew and pretending to read a book when I noticed a neon yellow paper sticking out of the community corkboard.  
In Comic Sans a red flag I ignored, it read .***Find Your Inner Fire: Free Sunset Yoga & Community Circle  All Welcome.***

I had just started doing yoga via YouTube, and the idea of practicing outdoors with *real humans* sounded like exactly the kind of healing my therapist kept hinting at. The address led me to a quiet place at the edge of town, just where the woods started. Birds were chirping. The sun was doing that golden hour thing where it makes everything feel cinematic. A guy in white linen waved at me from the driveway and said, Ah, you're just in time. Welcome, traveler. Okay, a bit dramatic for yoga, but sure. I followed him around the side of the house where a dozen or so people sat cross legged in a wide circle. They were all wearing white. I was in gym shorts and an old Nirvana tee. Nobody blinked.

A woman handed me a glass of cucumber water and said,  We honor your path. I said, Thanks, because I wasn’t sure what else to say. Things started normally enough ,some deep breathing, light stretches, gentle affirmations. Then someone started humming. Then chanting. Then someone else passed around a jar labeled Moon Seeds.  I assumed it was trail mix. It was *not* trail mix. About halfway through the fire cleansing, I realized two things.

1. This was *not* a typical yoga meetup.
2. I didn’t want to leave.

There was something absurdly comforting about how welcoming they were. One man complimented my aura. A teenager told me I had cosmic shoulders. A woman twice my age hugged me like I’d just come back from war. When they asked me to write down my true name and place it in the flame of intention, I wrote Kevin my real name and threw it in. The fire crackled like it approved. At the end of the night, we all held hands, stared at the stars, and someone softly whispered, The universe brought Kevin to us tonight. Everyone clapped.

I left with a Ziploc of herbal tea, a pamphlet titled *Unlearning Time,* and a surprising sense of calm.

The wildest part? I went back the next week. Not because I believed in their cosmic kombucha or because I finally discovered my sun animal, but because it reminded me that sometimes the weirdest moments , the ones that don’t fit the plan ,are where the real connection hides.

I've considered changing it but i just can't do it in peace of mind. My mom LOVES Andrea. Like she even says it when ordering a table on a restaurant or getting a coffee (even when i'm not there).   
   
Anyway, i've been looking for a nickname for pretty much my whole life. I was never fond of Andy, but ever since a person i hated started calling me ""andy"" condescendingly back in HS, i just have a personal thing against it.   
   
I like Anya, if i could change my name i would change it to Anya, but i don't know about having it as a nickname since it's a name of it's own and it feels like a stretch using it as a nickname for Andrea.   
My family speaks Spanish so something like Drea would weird them out.   
My middle name starts with a J but i wouldn't use any nicknames of that name since most of them my family already uses for me since i was a kid, so it would be weird. And AJ sounds like a male nickname (which hey, fits with Andrea's meaning! 😂).

A white van pulls up behind me, blocking my exit and the doors open (""okay, I've had a good life"" I think).

Instead of swiss-cheesing me two charismatic men get out and come to my window. They are cartoonishly bubbly with energy, like a car salesmen after a 3rd divorce and 4th coffee. Just a tidal wave of positive vibes and ""man I wanna hook you up!""

We chat, mainly because it's a very public area and my awkward ass needs a segue to tell them to move their car. The back of their van is filled to the absolute brim with sealed projector displays. The story is *""my boss ran a rental business for these and is going bankrupt, we're gonna lose them anyway. Want it for $300?""* - he pulls out an order receipt showing them all bought for $8,000 a piece.

Oddly enough - my first thought is *""these are legit, but stolen""*. I'd later find out this was likely untrue, but the reaction was appropriate nonetheless.

I kept repeating *""I'm not your buyer, move the car""*. They pushed the sales press hard until I eventually just said *""no""*.

Their faces morphed like something out of an old Gumby movie. They suddenly LOOKED like hardened criminals just staring at me with a *""how dare you""* vibe, but didn't move to do anything. I felt a little better noticing that there was a healthy mix of disappointment in the rage.

I get back in my car and at the same time they close up the van and drive off.

**Where i was wrong** was the assumption that they were stolen and the risk was buying fenced goods. That's overthinking. They were simply some $50 Alibaba projectors and a fake receipt suggesting they were the serious $X,000 projectors a rental company would use.

**Where i was stupid** - *these* two weren't a threat, but why the fuck did i get out of my cozy locked car.

This scam is from the 80's and I was shocked to see it play out in front of me today. Even more shocked that it didn't click for me that the WHITE VAN was doing a WHITE VAN scam.",90,1758288397.0,Scams,23,0.92,False

1nl3ikm,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nl3ikm/murder_is_legal_in_my_small_town_but_i_am_yet_to/,Murder is legal in my small town. But I am yet to kill someone.,"Murder was legal in our town.

I grew up seeing it. At eight years old, I watched a man walk into our local café while I drank my peanut butter chocolate milkshake and killed two people dead. 

There was no malice in his eyes, no hatred. He was just a normal guy who smiled at the waitress and winked at me. 

Mom told me to keep drinking my milkshake, and I did, licking away the excess whipped cream while the bodies were carried out and the pooling red was cleaned from the floor. I could still see flecks of white in the red, and my stomach twisted.

But I didn’t feel scared. I had no reason to be. Nobody was screaming or crying.

The man who had shot them sat down to eat a burger and fries, not blinking an eye. 

That was my first experience seeing death. 

With no rules forbidding murder, you would think a town would tear itself apart.

That is not what happened.

Murder was legal, yes, but it didn’t happen every day. 

It happened when people had the urge. 

Mom explained it to me when I was old enough to understand. “The Urge” was a phenomenon that had been affecting the townspeople long before I was born, and there was no real way to stop it. 

So, it didn't stop. 

Mom told me she had killed her first person at the age of seventeen, her math teacher. There was no reason or motive. 

Mom said she just woke up one day and wanted to kill him.

That specific killing became more of a bedtime story to lull me to sleep.

I didn’t like her smile when she told me about her killing. Sometimes I got scared she was going to murder me too.

Growing up, I was constantly on edge. Every day I woke up and pressed my hand to my forehead, asking myself the same question: Did I want to kill anyone? 

Those thoughts blossomed into paranoia when I wasn’t sure what I was feeling. It’s not like I didn’t know what it was like.

Dad taught me how to use a knife and how to properly hold a weapon, and Mom gave me lessons in severing body parts.

Both of them wanted me to follow through with The Urge when it inevitably hit me. 

I wanted to fit in.

When I started middle school, our neighbors were caught killing and cannibalizing their children, turning them into bone broth. I knew both of the kids.

Clay and Clara.

I played with them in their yard and ate cookies with them.

Clara told me she wanted to be a nurse when she grew up, and Clay used to tug on my pigtails to get my attention.

They were like siblings to me. 

No matter what my parents said, or my teachers, my gut still twisted at the thought of my neighbors doing something like that.

Days after the cops arrived, I saw Mrs. Jenson watering her plants. But when I looked closer, there was no water.

She was just holding an empty hose over her prize roses.

I stood on my tiptoes, peering over our fence. “Mrs. Jenson?”

“I am okay, Elle.”

Her voice didn’t sound okay.

“Are you sure?” I asked. I pointed at the hose grasped in her hand. “You forgot to turn your water on.”

“I know.”

“Mrs. Jenson…” I took a deep breath before I could stop myself. “Did you like killing Clay and Clara?”

“Why, yes,” she hummed. “Of course I did.”

I nodded. “But… didn’t you love them?”

She didn’t reply for a moment before seemingly snapping out of it and turning to me with a bright smile. Too many teeth.

That was the first time I started to question The Urge.

It was supposed to make you feel good, acting like a relief, a weight lifted from your chest. Killing another human being was exactly what the people in our town needed. But what about killing their families and children?

Did it really make them feel good?

Looking at my neighbor, I couldn’t see the joy my Mom described. In fact, I couldn’t see *anything*.

Her expression was the kind of blank that scared me. It was oblivion staring back, stripped of real human emotion. 

Mrs. Jenson’s smile stretched across her lips, like she could sense my discomfort. I noticed she had yet to clean her hands.

Mrs. Jenson’s fingernails were still stained a scary shade of red. Instead of replying, the woman moved toward my fence in slow, stumbling strides. 

She was dragging herself, like moving caused her pain—agony I couldn’t understand. 

It was exactly what my mother had insisted didn’t exist when killing: pain.

Humanity. All the adults told us we would not feel those things when killing. We wouldn’t feel regret or contempt. We would just feel good.

It was a release, like cold water coming over us. We would never feel better in our lives than when we were killing and our first would be something special. 

When Mrs. Jenson’s fingers, still slick with her children’s blood, wrapped around the wooden fence, I found myself paralyzed. 

Her manic grin twisted and contorted into a silent wail, and once-vacant eyes popped open like she was seeing me for the very first time. “I want to go home,” she whispered, squeezing the wooden fence until her own fingers were bleeding.

“Can you tell them to let me go home? I would like to see my children. Right now. Do you hear me?” 

Mrs. Jenson wasn’t looking at me. Instead, her gaze was glued to thin air.

She was crying, screaming at something only she could see, and for a moment, I wondered if ghosts were real. 

I twisted around to see if there were any ghosts, specifically the ones of her children, but there was nothing. Just fall leaves spiraling in the air in pretty waves.

“Mrs. Jenson is sick,” Mom told me once I was sitting at the dinner table, eating melted ice cream. It tasted like barf running down my throat.

I didn’t see Mrs. Jenson after that.

Well, I did.

She looked different, however.

Not freakishly different, though I did notice her hair color had changed.

I remembered it being a deep shade of brown, and when my neighbor returned with an even wider smile, it was more of a blondish white. When I questioned this, Mom told me it was a makeover.

The Urge affected people in different ways, and with Mrs. Jenson, after having her come-down, she had decided on a change. Mom’s words were supposed to be reassuring, adding that there was no reason to be scared of The Urge.

But I didn’t want to be like Mrs. Jenson and have a mental breakdown over my killing. I wanted to be like Mom and have a glass of wine and laugh over the sensation of taking a life. 

Mrs. Jenson was my first real glimpse into the negativity of killing. 

Dying, for example, wasn’t feared. 

From a young age, we had been taught that it was a vital part of life, and dying meant finding peace. 

When I first started high school, I expected killing to happen. 

Puberty was when The Urge fully blossomed. 

Weapons were allowed, but only outside of classes. In other words, under no circumstances must we kill each other in class, but the hallways were a free-for-all.

I saw attempts during my freshman year, but no real killing.

Annalise Duval was infamously known as the junior girl who rejected The Urge and was thrown out of school. 

Struck with the stomach flu on the day of her attempted killing, I only knew the story from word-of-mouth.

Apparently, the girl had attempted to kill her mother at home, failed, and then bounded into school, screaming about laughter in the walls and people whispering in her head.

Obviously, my classmate was labeled insane, and judging from her nosebleed, the girl’s body had ultimately rejected The Urge, and her brain was going haywire. 

Nosebleeds were a common side effect.

I heard stories from kids saying there was blood everywhere, all over her hands and face, smeared under her chin. 

She had been screaming for help, but nobody dared go near her, like rejection was contagious. Annalise survived. Just. 

I still saw her on my daily bike ride to school.

She was always sitting cross-legged in front of the forest with her eyes closed, like she was praying. 

The rumor was, after being thrown out by her parents, the girl wandered around aimlessly, muttering about whispering people and laughter in her head. 

It was obvious her rejection had seriously affected her mental state, but I did feel sorry for her.

On my fourteenth birthday, I confused a swimming stomach and cramps for The Urge, which turned out to be my first period. I remember biking my way home, witnessing a man cut off another guy’s head with an axe.

It’s funny. I thought I would be desensitized to seeing human remains. 

I saw the passion in the man’s face as he swung the axe, digging in real hard, chopping right through bone and not stopping, even when intense red splattered his face and clothes. 

He didn’t stop until the head hit the ground, and that sent my stomach creeping into my throat.

Then, it was the vacancy in his eyes, the twitching smile as he held the axe like a prize.

Part of me wanted to stay, to see if he had a similar reaction to Mrs. Jenson. 

I wanted to know if he regretted what he had done, but once I met his gaze, and his grin widened, the toe of his boot kicking the guy’s motionless body, I turned away and pedaled faster, my eyes starting to water. 

It wasn’t long before my lunch was inching its way up my throat, and I was abandoning my bike on the side of the road, choking up undigested mac 'n' cheese onto the steaming tarmac.

I didn’t tell Mom about the man, and more importantly, about my odd reaction to his killing. I wasn’t supposed to feel sick to my stomach. Murder was normal. I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it, so why did seeing it make me sick?

I had been taught as a little kid that visceral reactions were normal, and it was okay to be scared of killing and murder. 

However, what our brains told us was right wasn’t always the truth. 

Our teacher held up a teddy bear and stabbed into its stuffing with a carving knife.

We all cried out until the teacher told us that the bear didn’t care about dying. 

In fact, it was ready to find peace, and it didn’t hurt him.

In other words, we had to ignore what our minds told us was bad.

Mom told me I would definitely start having conflicting feelings before my first killing, but that it was nothing to worry about.

I *did* worry, though. 

I started to wonder if I was going to become the next Annalise Duval. 

Maybe the two of us would become friends, sharing our delusions together.

My 17th birthday came and went and still no sign of The Urge. 

I noticed Mom was starting to grow impatient. She had a routine of coming to check my temperature every morning, regardless of whether I felt sick or not.

“How are you feeling?” I couldn’t help but notice Mom’s smile was fake.

She dumped my breakfast on a tray in front of me, and when I risked nibbling on a slice of toast, she dropped the bombshell.

“Elle, you are almost eighteen years old,” she said. I noticed her hands were clenched into fists. “Do you feel anything?”

I considered lying, though then I would have to kill someone, and without The Urge, I was pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to do that. “I don’t know,” I answered honestly, propping myself up on my pillows. “Most of the kids in my class—”

She cut me off with a frustrated hiss. “Yes, I know. They have all killed someone and you haven’t.” Her eyes narrowed. “People are starting to notice, Elle.” 

She spoke through a smile that was definitely a grimace. “And when people start to notice, they get suspicious. I’ve been on the phone with three different doctors this morning, and all of them want to book you in for an MRI. Just to make sure things are normal.”

“MRI?” I almost choked on the apple I had been chewing.

“Yes.” Mom sighed. “We can’t ignore that things aren’t... abnormal. You are seventeen years old and haven’t had one urge to kill. The minimum for your age is one kill,” she said. “*Minimum*, Elle. You haven't killed anyone, and when I bring it up, you change the subject.”

I changed the subject because she started asking if I wanted to practice. 

I wasn’t sure what “practice” meant, but from the slightly manic look in her eye, my mom wasn’t talking about dolls or teddy bears. 

It was normal to practice killing.

There were even people who volunteered to be targets at the local scrapyard.

Most of them were old people.

Joey Cunningham started training to kill when he was twelve years old. 

Five years on, Joey had accumulated a total of fourteen kills.

He never failed to remind everyone in almost every class. I could taste the apple growing sour in the back of my mouth.

Mom was just trying to help, and it’s not like I was doing this intentionally.

The idea of going to the scrapyard and killing people, even if they gave me permission to, wasn’t appealing in the slightest. 

“I’m okay,” I said, and when Mom’s eyes darkened, I followed that up with, “I mean… I have spare time after class, so…?”

I meant to finish with, “Maybe,” but the word tangled in my mouth when I took a chunk out of the apple, and pain struck.

Throbbing pain, which was enough to send my brain spinning off its axis.

For a moment, my vision feathered, and I was left blinking at my mother, who had become more silhouette than real person. 

I was aware of the apple dropping out of my hand, but I couldn’t think straight.

The pain came in waves, exploding in my mouth. When I was sure I could move without my head spinning, I slammed my hand over my mouth instinctively to nurse the pain, except that just made it worse. 

Fuck. 

Had I chipped my tooth? 

Blinking through blurry vision, I knew my mom was there. But so was something else.

As if my reality was splintering open, another seeping through, I suddenly had no idea where I was, and a familiar feeling of fear started to creep its way up my spine. The thing was, though, I knew exactly where I was. I had known this town, this house, my whole life.

So that feeling of fear didn’t make sense.

The more I mulled the thought over in my mind, however, pain striking like lightning bolts, something was blossoming.

It both didn’t make sense, and yet it also did. In the deep crevices of my mind, that feeling was familiar. And I had felt it before. No matter how hard I squinted, though, I couldn’t make it out.

When I squinted again, a sudden shriek of noise rattled in my skull, and it took me a disorienting moment to realize what I could hear was laughter. 

Hysterical laughter, which seemed to grow louder and louder, encompassing my thoughts until it was deafening.

Not just that. The walls were swimming, flashing in and out of existence before seemingly stabilizing themselves. 

I blinked. Was I… losing my mind?

Maybe this was a side-effect of rejecting The Urge.

“Elle?” Mom’s voice cut through the phantom laughter, which faded, and I blinked rapidly. “Sweetie, are you okay?”

“Yeah.”

The word was in my mouth before the thought could cross my mind. I shook my head, swallowing. “Yeah, I’m… fine.”

She nodded, though her expression darkened. Scrutinizing. I knew she couldn’t wait to get me under an MRI. 

“All right. Finish your breakfast. School starts in an hour.” Mom stopped at the threshold. “I really do think practicing killing will help a lot.

She left, and I rolled my eyes, mimicking her. 

I flinched when another wave of laughter slammed into my ears. 

Faded, but very much there. Definitely not a figment of my imagination.

Checking in my bedroom mirror, I didn’t have a loose tooth. 

Even thinking that, though, panic started to curl in the root of my gut.

My brain wouldn’t shut up on my way to school, my gut was twisting and turning, trying to projectile that meager slice of toast.

Annalise Duval had complained of a loose tooth before she rejected The Urge. 

Was that what was going to happen to me?

Was it all because of that stupid apple?

At school, I was surprised to be cornered by a classmate I had said maybe five words to in our combined time at Briarwood High.

Kaz Issacs was one of the first kids in my class to be hit with The Urge, and he almost ended up like Annalise Duval. 

I don’t even think it was The Urge. 

I think he was driven to kill through emotions, like so many adults had tried to tell us wasn’t real. 

Kaz was a confusing case where a teenager had actually blossomed early, or not at all, and struck with his own intent.

Kaz didn’t need The Urge. 

Halfway through math class, two years prior, I was daydreaming about the rain.

It rarely rained in Brightwood. Every day was picturesque. 

But I did *remember* rain. 

I knew what it felt like hitting my face, dropping into my open mouth and filling my cupped hands. I remembered the sensation on it soaking my clothes and glueing my hair to the back of my neck. 

When I asked Mom if it was ever going to rain, though, she got a funny look on her face.

*“Sweetie, it doesn’t rain in Brightwood.”*

It never rained. So, where had I jumped into puddles? 

My gaze was fixed on the windowpane, trying to imagine what a raindrop looked like sliding down the glass, when Kaz Issacs let out an exaggerated sigh behind me.

In front of him, Jessa Pollux had been tapping her pen on her desk. 

At first, it wasn’t annoying, but then she kept doing it—tap, tap, tappity tap. 

And then it became annoying. 

I could tell it was annoying because Kaz politely asked her three times to stop making noise. 

“Jessa, stop.” He groaned, half asleep in his arms. 

When she continued, his tone hardened. “Can you *stop* doing that?""

She ignored him and, if anything, tapped louder. 

I had grown up knowing that The Urge came without warning, motive, or reason. 

It happened whether you liked it or not. 

Kaz was different. His case was rare. 

This time, he did have a motive, and despite what we were taught, that killing didn’t require a reason and wasn’t driven by negative emotion. Kaz was driven by anger.

This time, I saw it happen clearly. 

When I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, I twisted around with the rest of the class to see Kaz halfway off his chair, his fingers wrapped around a knife. He was already smiling, already thrilled with the idea of killing. 

The Urge had *hit* him. 

Until that moment, he was a quiet kid who kept to himself. 

Jessa knew instantly what he was going to do, even without turning around. 

Like an animal, Kaz already had a tight hold of her ponytail and yanked her back. 

Though in fight or flight, the girl was screaming and flailing.

She didn’t want to die, I thought.

Was that normal?

Mom always insisted that if it was our time, it was our time. If someone attacked us, even family members, we were to accept it.

I caught the moment her elbow knocked into Kaz’s mouth, just as he drove the blade into her skull. 

Until then, Kaz had been consumed by a euphoric frenzy, intoxicated by the dark thrill of killing. It was as if the idea of ending a life had briefly elevated him to a state of pure euphoria. 

Growing up, Mom’s stories spoke of finding a twisted pleasure in murder, and for a moment, seeing *that* look in my classmates eyes, I understood *why* she described killing like a rush. 

It was a lunacy I didn't understand, complete unbridled insanity sending shivers down my spine. This was exactly what Mom was talking about.

She described it like floating on a cloud, lukewarm water pooling underneath her feet. 

But just as abruptly as it had enveloped him, that otherworldly glow faded from Kaz’s eyes. He crumpled to his knees, one hand clamped over his mouth, the knife slipping from his grasp. 

“That's enough.” Our teacher announced. “Kaz, go and clean yourself up.”

When he didn't respond, she snapped at him. 

“Mr Isaacs!”

Then, he did, his gaze flicking to his blood slicked hands. 

“Huh?”

He seemed like he was on another planet, swaying back and forth. 

There was a moment when I met his half lidded gaze, and he slowly inclined his head, like he was confused. Scared.

When Kaz lifted his head, I saw thick beads of red trickling down his chin, pooling down his fingers. 

It was the same look I had seen on Mrs. Jenson’s face. 

Kaz blinked again, before noticing the blood. 

“Fuck.” He whimpered, his voice muffled. 

His eyes, filled with panic, flickered wildly. Without another word, he scrambled to his feet, stumbling toward the classroom door. 

When I asked him what happened the next day, he explained it was just an ""abnormal reaction"" and that he was fine. 

But Kaz’s words were strange. 

He wasn’t even looking at me, and his smile was far too big. He got his first kill, though, so that gave him bragging rights as the first sophomore to come of age. 

Kaz Issacs and Annalise Duval both had similar experiences. 

One of them had clearly lost their mind, while the other seemingly avoided it.

And speaking of Kaz, it wasn’t the norm for him to be talking to me at school. But there he was, blocking my way into the classroom.

“Hey.” He quickly side-stepped in front of me when I tried pushing him out of the way. 

There had been a time the year before when I considered asking him to prom. 

He was a reasonably attractive guy, with reddish dark hair that curled slightly as it peeked out from under a well-worn baseball cap, a crooked smile that was never genuine, always leaning more toward irony.  

But then I remembered what he did to Jessa. 

I remembered the sound of his knife slicing through skin, cartilage, and bone, and despite her cries, her animalistic wails for him to stop, he kept going, driving it further and further into her skull. 

I couldn’t look him in the eye after that. 

Kaz inclined his head. “Can we talk?”

“No.”

My mouth was still sore, and I was questioning my sanity, so speaking to Kaz wasn’t really on my to-do list that morning.

Kaz didn’t move, sticking an arm out so I couldn’t get past him. “Do you have toothache by any chance?” 

To emphasize his words, he stuck his finger in his mouth, dragging his index finger across his upper incisors.

“Like, bad toothache.” His voice was muffled by his finger. Kaz leaned forward, arching a brow. “You do, don’t you? Right now, you feel like your whole mouth is on fire, and yet you can’t detect any wobblies.”

The guy’s words sent a sliver of ice tingling down my spine. He was right. I hadn’t felt right since biting into that apple.

When I didn’t say anything, his lip twitched into a scowl. “All right. You don’t want to talk.” He raised two fingers in a salute. “Suit yourself.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, mostly to humor him. 

He shrugged. “Maybe wait a few days, and then come talk to me, all right?”

Kaz’s words didn’t really hit me until several days later. 

I woke up with a throbbing mouth, knelt over the corpse of my mother.

The Urge had finally come. It was something I had been anticipating and fearing my whole life, terrified I wouldn’t get it and would end up ostracized by my loved ones.

But when I saw my mom’s body and the vague memory of plunging a kitchen knife into her chest hit me, I didn’t feel happy or relieved. 

I felt like I had done something bad, which was the wrong thing to think. 

Killing was good, the words echoed in my mind. Killing was our way of release.

How could I think that when there was a knife clutched between my fingers? 

The weapon that had killed her. Hurt her. How was this supposed to make me feel good? 

My mother’s eyes were closed.

Peaceful. Like she had accepted her death. 

The teeth of the blade dripped deep, dark red, and I knew I should have felt something. Joy or happiness.

Except all I felt was empty and numb, and fucking wrong. 

Alone. 

I felt despair in its purest form, which began to chew me up from the inside as I lulled from my foggy thoughts.  

I wasn’t supposed to scream. I wasn’t supposed to cry, but my eyes were stinging, and I felt like I was being suffocated. I saw flashes in quick succession: a room bumbling with moving silhouettes, and the smell of... coffee. Mom never let me try coffee, and I was sure we never had it in the house.

So, how did I know the feeling of it running down my throat? 

Just like in my bedroom, the walls started to swim. 

This time, I jumped to my feet and leaped over my mom’s corpse, slamming my hands into them. They were real. 

Almost as if on cue, there it was again.

Laughing. Loud shrieks of hysterical laughter thrumming in time with the dull pain pounding in my back tooth. 

Blinking through an intense fog choking my mind, my first coherent thought was that yes, Kaz was right.

I did have a loose tooth, and when I was sure of that, I was stuffing my bloody fingers inside my mouth, trying to find it.

I grabbed the knife feverishly, my first thought to cut it out, when there was a sudden knock at the front door.

Slipping barefoot on the blood pooling across our kitchen floor, I struggled to get to the door without throwing up my insides.

Annalise Duval was standing on my doorstep. I had seen her in odd assortments of clothes, but this one was definitely eye-catching. 

The girl was wearing a wedding dress that hung off her, the veil barely clinging to the mess of bedraggled curls she never brushed. Blinking at me through straggly blonde hair, she almost resembled an angel. The dress itself was filthy, blood and dirt smeared down the corset, the skirt torn up. 

“Hello Elle.” The girl lifted a hand in a wave. 

Her smile wasn’t crazed like my classmates had described.

Instead, it was… sad. Annalise’s gaze found my hands slick with my mother’s blood but barely seemed fazed. “Do you want to see the wall people?” 

Until then, I had ignored her ramblings. But when I started hearing the laughing, “wall people” didn’t sound so crazy after all.

I nodded.

“Can you hear the laughing?” I asked.

“Sometimes.”

“Sometimes?”

“Mmm.” She twirled in the dress. “That’s how it started for me. Laughing. I heard a looooot of laughing, and then I found the wall people.” I winced when she came close, so close, almost suffocating me. 

“Nobody believes me, and it’s sad. I’m just trying to tell people about the wall people, but they label me as crazy. They say something went wrong with my head.” 

Annalise stuck two fingers to her temple and pulled the imaginary trigger, her eyes rolling back, like she was mimicking her own death. “I’m not the one who’s wrong. I know about the wall people and the laughing. I know why I murdered my Mom.”

“Annalise,” I said calmly. “Can you tell me what you mean?”

“Hm?”

Her eyes were partially vacant, that one sliver of coherence quickly fading away.

Instead of speaking, I took her arm gently and pulled her down my driveway. “Can you show me what you found?”

Annalise danced ahead of me, tripping in her wedding dress. She cocked her head. 

“Did you kill your mother too?” Her lips twitched. “That’s funny. According to the wall people, you’re not supposed to kill someone until the end of seasonal three.”

The girl blinked, giggling, and I forced myself to run after her. Wow, she was fast, even in a wedding dress. Annalise leapt across the sidewalk, twisting and twirling around, like she was in her own world. 

Before she landed in front of me, her expression almost looked sane. 

“I wonder which season it will be. Will it be Summer? Maybe Fall, or Winter. I guess it’s not up to you, is it? It’s up to The Urge.”

Laughing again, the girl grabbed my hand, her fingernails biting into my skin. 

I glimpsed a single drop of red run from her nose, which she quickly wiped with the sleeve of her dress, leaving a scarlet smear.

“Let’s go and see the wall people, Elle,” she hummed. 

As her footsteps grew more stumbled, blood ran down her chin, spotting the sidewalk. 

I don’t know if coherency ever truly hit Annalise Duval, but knowing she was bleeding, her steps grew quicker, more frenzied, I quickened my own pace. 

“Your nose,” was all I could say.

Annalise nodded with a sad smile. “I know!” she said. “Don’t worry, it will stop when I shut up.” Her smile widened. 

“But what if I don’t shut up? What if I show you the wall people?” 

To my surprise, she leapt forward and flung out her arms, tipping her head back and yelling at the sky. “What if I don’t shut up?” Annalise laughed. “What are the wall people going to do, huh? Are you going to explode my brain?”

When people started to come out of their homes to see what was going on, I dragged her into a run.

“Are you insane?” I hissed.

“Maybe!”

Annalise seemed to be floating between awareness and whatever the fuck The Urge had done to her. “Don’t worry, they’re just peeking.”

“What?”

The girl had an attention span of a rock. Her gaze went to the sky. “They’re going to turn the sun off so I can’t show you.”

Her words meant nothing to me until the clouds started to darken. Just like Annalise had predicted, the sky began to get dark.

Knowing that somehow this supposedly crazy girl knew when things were going to happen only quickened my steps into a run.

“Hey!”

Halfway down the street, Kaz Issacs was riding his bike toward us, which I found odd. Kaz didn’t own a bike. He rode the bus to school.

“Elle!” Waving at me with one hand and grasping the handlebars with the other, Kaz pedaled faster. “Yo! Do you want to hang out?”

“Peeking,” Annalise said under her breath.

Ignoring Kaz, I nodded at Annalise to keep going, though the boy didn’t give up. 

We twisted around, and he caught up easily, skidding on the edge of the sidewalk. When he came to an abrupt stop in front of us, his gaze flicked to Annalise. 

He raised a brow. “Shouldn’t you be praying in the forest?”

The girl recoiled like a cat, hissing, “Peeking!”

Kaz shot me a look. “Of all the people you could have made friends with, you chose Annalise Duval?” His eyes softened when I ignored him and pulled the girl further down the road. Kaz followed slowly on his bike.

“Where are you going anyway? Isn't it late?”

It was 4pm. 

I decided to humor him. “We’re going to see the wall people.”

“You’re kidding.”

“Do I sound like I’m kidding?” I turned my attention to him. “You asked me if I had a toothache, right?”

His expression crumpled. “I did?”

I noticed Annalise was clingier with him around, sticking to my side. 

Every time he moved, she flinched, tightening her grip on my arm. 

The girl was leading us into the forest, and I swore, the closer we got to the clearing, the more townspeople were popping up out of nowhere. An old woman greeted us, followed by a man with a dog, and then a group of kids from school. Annalise entangled her fingers in mine, pulling me through the clearing.

Kaz followed, hesitantly, biking over rough ground. “Once again, I think this is a bad idea,” he said in a sing-song voice. “We should go back.”

When it was too dangerous for his bike, he abandoned it and joined my side.

“Elle, the girl is insane,” Kaz hissed. “What are you even doing? What is this going to accomplish except potentially getting lost?”

“I want to know if she’s telling the truth,” I murmured back.

He scoffed. “Telling the truth? Look at this place!” He spread his arms, gesturing to the rapidly darkening forest. “There’s nothing here!”

“No.” Annalise ran ahead, staggering over the tricky ground. “No, it’s right over here!” 

She was still fighting a nosebleed, and her words were starting to slur. The girl twisted to Kaz. “You’re peeking,” she spat, striding over to him until they were face to face. 

“Stop peeking,” she said, her fingers delving under her wedding skirt where she pulled out a knife and pressed it to his throat. “If you peek again, I will cut you open.”

Kaz nodded. “Got it, Blondie. No peeking.”

Annalise didn’t move for a second, her hands holding the knife trembling. “You’re not going to tell me I’m crazy again,” she whispered.

“You’re not crazy,” Kaz said dryly.

“Say it again.”

“You’re not crazy!” He yelped when she applied pressure to the blade. “Can you stop swinging that around? Jeez!”

Annalise shot me a grin, and it took a second for me to realize.

Kaz was scared of the knife.

He was scared of dying, which meant, whether he liked it or not, the boy had, in fact, not gone through with The Urge.

I thought the girl was going to slash Kaz’s throat open in delight, but instead, she looped her arm in his like they were suddenly best friends.

“Come on, Elle!” She danced forward, pulling the boy with her. “We’re closeeeee!”

I wasn’t sure about that.

What we were, however, was lost. 

When the three of us came to a stop, it was pitch black, and I was struggling to see in front of me. Annalise, however, walked straight over to thin air and gestured to it with a grin. “Tah-da!” Spluttering through pooling red, she let out a laugh.

“See!”

Kaz, who was still uncomfortably pressed to her no matter how hard he strained to get away, shot me a look I could barely make out.

“I’m sorry, *what* did I say? That we were going to get lost? That Annalise is certifiably crazy and is probably going to kill us?”

At first, I thought I really was crazy. Maybe Annalise’s condition was contagious. 

I could hear it again. Laughing.

But this time, it was coming from exactly where Annalise was pointing. When the girl slammed her hand into thin air, there was a loud clanging noise that sounded like metal.

Slowly, I made my way toward it, and when my hands touched sleek metal, what felt like the corners of a door, more pain struck my upper incisors.

“Holy shit.” Kaz was pressing himself against the door, then slamming his fists into it. “The crazy bitch was right.” 

His words hung in my thoughts on a constant cycle, as we delved into what should have been forest.

After all, we had been standing in the middle of nowhere. The laughter was deafening when I stepped over the threshold, and I had to slap my hands over my ears to block it out. Through the invisible door, however, was exactly what Annalise had described: wall people.

All around us were television screens, and on those screens were people. Faces.

They were not part of the laughter. The laughter was mechanical and wrong, rooted deep inside my skull. The faces that stared down at us were men and women, some teens, and even younger children. 

Annalise and Kaz were next to me, their heads tipped back, gazes glued to the screens. Not the ones I was looking at. 

The ones on tiny computer monitors.

When I finally tore my eyes from our audience, I began to see what made Kaz stiffen up next to me. One screen in particular, showed his face. 

He was younger, maybe a year or two. No, I thought, something slimy creeping up my throat. It was from when he had killed that girl. His hands clasped in his lap were still stained and slick with Jessa Pollux’s blood. 

The Kaz on the screen was far more relaxed, casually leaning back with his feet propped up on the table. 

His hair was shorter, and his clothes were more formal than what I was used to seeing him in. 

I usually saw him in jeans and hoodies, but this Kaz wore a crisp white collared shirt. 

Something hung around his neck, a thin strip of black fabric with a shiny card at the end, reminding me of some kind of badge.

“Why exactly have you signed up for this program?” a man’s voice crackled off-screen.

""Duh."" Kaz held up his scarlet hands, a grin twisting on his lips. His arrogant smile twisted my gut. ""So I can get my Darkroom rep back."" 

He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed. ""That is going to happen, right? I don’t do this shit for free, and I’ve got one million followers to impress, man. Darkroom loves me."" 

Kaz scoffed, crossing one left over the other. ""Even if I did go too far that one time, which wasn’t even *my* fault. What are you guys, fucking Twitch?""

“You are correct,” the man said. “Darkroom does benefit from its influencers. Our program aims to help satisfy certain… needs by broadcasting them right here.”

He paused. “You have killed five people before signing up for Darkroom, correct? Your parents?”

“Parents and brother,” Kaz's lips pricked into a smile. “I gutted them just to see what was inside, but *of course,* my TikTok got taken down by all the freaks in the comments trying to cancel me.” He rolled his eyes. “They worship you, call you a god, swear they’ll do anything for you-- and then *fuck* you.""

I flinched when he leaned forward, his gaze penetrating the camera. This guy knew exactly how to act in front of one.

The slight incline of his head, trying to get the best angle. 

“Can I tell you something?”

“Yes, of course, young man.”

“Have you ever been called a God? Because it's a *rush.*” He laughed. “I made stupid videos, and these people *worshipped* me. They loved me.""

Kaz clucked his tongue. “Buuuut the moment I show them my real self, they turn on me and try to end my career.” 

He leaned back in his chair with a sigh, glancing at the camera. “And then I found you guys! Who pay me to be my real authentic self. Now, how could I decline an offer like that?”

“And,” the man cleared his throat, “you will keep killing? We are aware the initial implant impacted your brain quite badly. In the subdued state, you will keep killing, as the so-called ‘urge’ says. However, in reality, we will be sending signals to your brain which will make you commit murder.”

“All right, I'll do it.”

“Are you sure? We couldn’t help noticing during your first kill, you seemed to… well, react in a way we haven’t seen before. It's possible there could be a potential fault.”

He cocked his head, like a puppet cut from strings. “Did the comments *like* it?”

“Well, yes—”

“Good.” Kaz held out his arm. “Do it again. And do it right this time. As long as I’m getting 40K every appearance, I’m good. You can slice my brain up all you want; I’m getting paid and followers. So.” His gaze found the camera. 

“What are you waiting for?”

When the screen went black, then flickered to a bird's-eye view, and finally a close-up of my house, I felt my legs give way.

As if on impulse, I prodded at my mouth and felt for the loose tooth.

“That…” Kaz spoke up, his voice a breathy whisper. His eyes were still glued to the screen, confusion crumpling his expression. 

“That… wasn’t me! Well, it was me... but I don’t… I don’t remember that!”

To my surprise, he turned to me, and I saw real fear in his eyes. 

“Elle.” He gritted out, “that is *not* me.”

Instead of answering him, I turned away when alarm bells started ringing, and the room was suddenly awash in flashing red light.

“Peeking!” Annalise squeaked, hiding behind me.

Ignoring her, I focused on Kaz. 

Or whoever the hell he was. 

I slammed the door shut, throwing myself against it. 

“You need to knock my tooth out.” I told him. “Now.”",3,1758288315.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1nl3gfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1nl3gfu/should_you_trust_the_best_over_ear_headphones/,Should You Trust the Best Over Ear Headphones Monolith M1060 Review,"Testing out the Monolith 116050 headphones was an interesting experience—I’ve never been one to shy away from giving my honest thoughts, and these planar magnetic headphones gave me a lot to talk about. As someone who spends a good chunk of my day listening to music, gaming, or editing audio, I was intrigued by the promise of a “true audiophile listening experience.” While the headphones deliver in a lot of areas, they’re not without a handful of quirks worth mentioning.

**Sleek Design with a Premium Touch**

Visually, the Monolith 116050 headphones make a bold impression. The mix of black and wood accents gives off an air of sophistication that not many headphones in this range manage to achieve. The open-back design not only contributes to the listening quality but makes the headphones look quite luxurious. While they do have a certain bulkiness, they manage to avoid appearing clunky. The padded headband and large, rounded earcups felt like they were designed for long hours of wear. The faux leather ear cushions were soft and accommodating, fitting snugly over my ears without creating pressure points, even during extended listening sessions.

**Immersive Sound Quality and Planar Drivers**

The sound quality exceeded my expectations—planar magnetic drivers are the secret sauce here. Thanks to the 106mm drivers, these headphones produce clarity and accuracy that smack you across the face (in the best way possible). Nearly every piece of music or layer of sound felt more detailed. The open-back design plays a huge role in this as well, creating that holographic sensation where it feels like the music surrounds you. If you've only used closed-back headphones, the shift can feel transformative. However, I noticed a slight shortfall—while the bass is accurate and precise, it doesn’t pack the punch that some bassheads might crave.

**Positives**

- Exceptional sound clarity with the 106mm planar magnetic drivers  
- Open-back design offers a wide and airy soundstage  
- Premium design with a beautiful mix of black and wood accents  
- Comfortable ear cups and headband allow for extended wear  
- Great for professional and studio-level work  

[Check Monolith 116050 price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b01n32n5dd/)  

**Areas of Concern**

Since nothing’s perfect, the Monolith M1060 does drop the ball in a few places. For starters, the headphones rely entirely on a wired setup with a 3.5mm jack. While this ensures sound quality, it limits the convenience factor a bit. Also, the open-back style that creates the incredible stage depth sacrifices sound isolation—you’ll hear ambient noise if you’re trying to use these in a busier environment like a coffee shop or a bustling home. Another nitpick: despite the snug fit, the odd weight distribution made me adjust the headband more often than I’d have liked.

- Open-back design offers no sound isolation, making them unsuitable for noisy spaces  
- Lack of wireless functionality limits flexibility  
- Might not appeal to those who prefer bass-heavy audio profiles  

**Competing Products**

When we look at rivals, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro comes to mind, known for its superb sound clarity and iconic design. While the Beyerdynamic's comfort factors and build quality are equally impressive, it falls slightly short in bass accuracy compared to the Monolith. The HiFiMan Sundara, another strong competitor, excels in tonal detail but takes a hit in headband comfort during long sessions. Monolith’s combination of affordability, soundstage, and premium design certainly adds weight to choosing these headphones over their more expensive counterparts, especially for those new to planar drivers.

**Bang for the Buck**

Cost-efficiency is often the elephant in the room with audio equipment. The Monolith M1060 manages to offer premium features like planar magnetic technology at a somewhat surprising price point. It’s hard to find this level of sound detail and craftsmanship in the same league without shelling out more cash. Still, be aware that the price may vary online, which makes keeping an eye out for discounts worthwhile.

The Elite Gourmet EKT719 electric kettle quickly became a staple in my daily routine, especially during travels and early mornings at home. Its compact size and versatility stood out immediately. As someone who often switches between US and international outlets, the dual-voltage capability is a game-changer. Switching between 120VAC and 220-240VAC is as simple as toggling the switch at the bottom of the kettle, which is a thoughtful touch that ensures I’m not stuck relying on adapters or risking voltage mismatches. 

The lightweight design and retractable handle make it incredibly easy to pack. I find myself stowing it in my luggage without worrying about space. With the ability to hold up to 0.6 liters (about 20 ounces), it’s perfect for a quick pour-over coffee session or a couple of cups of tea while on the go. 

[Check Elite Gourmet EKT719 price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0cr6tmxcx/)

**Simplicity and Effective Design**

Ease of use is where this kettle truly shines. A one-touch button initiates the boiling process, and the LED indicator offers a quick visual reference to confirm it's in operation. On mornings when I’m barely awake, the simplicity of not fumbling with complicated settings or multiple buttons makes all the difference. Safety features like Auto-Shut Off prevent any mishaps, and the Boil-Dry Protection adds an extra layer of assurance for those forgetful moments. 

The interior boasts stainless steel construction, ensuring water tastes clean without that odd metallic tang some kettles have. It’s always slightly comforting knowing I’m not dealing with harmful chemicals leeching into my water, thanks to the cool-touch matte exterior and double-wall design.

**Positives**

- Compact design, ideal for travel or small living spaces  
- Dual voltage adaptability makes it perfect for international use  
- Auto-Shut Off and Boil-Dry Protection enhance safety  
- Stainless steel interior guarantees clean water taste  
- Retractable handle and sleek cool-touch matte finish for convenience  

**Boons of its Double Wall Insulation**

One standout feature of this electric kettle is its clever double-wall insulation, ensuring the interior retains warmth for longer while the exterior remains cool to the touch. I was skeptical at first, but during one test, I boiled water for tea and came back 30 minutes later to pleasantly warm water. This certainly adds a layer of efficiency I didn’t anticipate, and for safety reasons, it’s reassuring knowing I can touch the exterior even when it’s fully heated.

**Areas of Concern**

- The 0.6-liter capacity is great for solo use but may not suit larger households  
- Changing the voltage switch could be easier—it’s slightly tucked underneath  
- Some might prefer a cord storage option for tidiness  

**Versatility in Small Packages**

If you’re imagining this kettle as just for tea or coffee, think again. I was stunned by how well it handled making oatmeal, instant ramen, or even baby formula during impromptu late-night feeding sessions for my niece. The free-flow filter spout ensures precise pours every time, so you’re not dealing with accidental overflows. Cleaning is straightforward, too. The hinged, pop-up lid operates with just a press of a button, giving you easy access to wipe it down.

**Product Rivals**

Compared to alternatives like the Russell Hobbs travel kettle or the Bonavita gooseneck model, this one stands out due to its dual voltage feature and lighter weight. While other brands often restrict you to a single voltage, making travel cumbersome, the Elite Gourmet EKT719 truly caters to a mobile lifestyle. Its double-wall insulation also gives it an edge, as many competitors either forego this feature or don’t execute it as effectively. On the downside, some other brands might offer greater boiling capacity, though they often sacrifice portability in the process.

**Quality for Price**

Given the advanced features packed within its sleek, travel-friendly design, the kettle provides excellent value. It holds up well against pricier competitors and is reliable for daily use. Investing in this kettle not only saves time but ensures your needs for hot water are met efficiently and stylishly.

1nl3f09,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nl3f09/dibble_and_the_case_of_the_wet_mop/,Dibble and the Case of the Wet Mop,"The Xerion Collective didn't believe in probability. When your entire species exists in quantum superposition, experiencing all possible outcomes simultaneously until observation collapses reality into a single timeline, ""maybe"" isn't a word it's an insult.

So when Ambassador Qex'tril was found murdered in seventeen different ways across seventeen different probability states, the Collective didn't just demand justice. They demanded it retroactively, in all timelines, with mathematical certainty.

And into this impossibility shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Still rumpled. Still clutching his coffee (now with a stain shaped like the Horsehead Nebula). Still the only investigator in the galaxy who solved crimes with intuition instead of algorithms.

""Here's what I don't get,"" Dibble said to the shimmering, probability-cloud suspect hovering before him. ""You folks see every possible future, right? Every outcome. Every choice. So how'd you not see this coming?""

The Xerion prosecutor, a being named Flux'ara who existed in at least forty three states of accusation, rippled with quantum indignation. ""Detective Dibble, the murder is probabilistically impossible. Our calculations show 0.000001% chance of success across all timelines. No rational actor would attempt it.""

Dibble scratched his head, leaving his hair more disheveled than quantum mechanics itself. ""Yeah, but here's the thing about us irrational actors..."" He pointed to the crime scene with his pencil. ""We don't check the math first.""

The victim, Ambassador Qex'tril, had been the Collective's liaison to the Linear Species. Those poor, limited creatures who experienced time in sequence, one moment after another. Humans. Vulkari. The slug-philosophers of Dendron Prime. Species cursed to live in singular reality.

The suspects were perfect, in seventeen different ways:

Dr. Vex'nul, quantum physicist who'd been arguing with Qex'tril about the ethics of probability manipulation. In Timeline A, she'd been in her lab. In Timeline B, she'd been asleep. In Timelines C through Q, she'd been gradually more suspicious.

Merchant Zyx'pol, who owed the Ambassador seventeen different debts across seventeen different probability states. His alibis were mathematically sound but emotionally inconsistent.

And the witness everyone ignored: Janitor Bob from Sanitation, a human who'd been mopping the corridor. Linear species couldn't be reliable witnesses to quantum events everyone knew that.

But Dibble had learned to love being everyone's blind spot.

""Tell me about the mop bucket,"" he said to Bob.

""What about it?""

""You were here for what, twenty minutes? But the water in your bucket"" Dibble dipped his pencil in, tasted it. ""this isn't cleaning solution. This is quantum stabilizer fluid. Industrial grade.""

Bob shifted nervously. ""I don't know nothing about—""

""See, here's what's funny,"" Dibble continued, ignoring the Xerion investigators who were vibrating with probability-based confusion. ""Your bucket's been here exactly seventeen minutes. Not eighteen, not sixteen. Seventeen. Same number as the Ambassador's death states.""

The Collective began to converge, their quantum consciousness focusing like a laser. Bob was just a human. Linear. Singular. Impossible.

Dibble smiled that tired smile of his. ""You folks keep thinking quantum. Big brains, big math, big possibilities. But what if the answer's smaller? What if the weapon wasn't quantum uncertainty—what if it was quantum certainty?""

He turned to the shimmering suspects. ""You can see every timeline, every possibility. But you can't see linear time. Can't experience the one thing Bob here does naturally—sequential causality. Cause, then effect. A to B to C.""

The breakthrough came when Dibble stopped thinking like a detective and started thinking like a janitor.

""Bob here's been cleaning this corridor for three years. Same route, same time, same bucket. Linear. Predictable. And the Xerions—they map probability, but they don't map janitor schedules.""

Dibble gestured to the crime scene. ""The Ambassador was killed in seventeen states because that's how long it took Bob to walk this corridor. Seventeen timeline-collapses. The killer followed Bob's linear path, using his quantum stability field as a weapon. Every step Bob took, he unknowingly collapsed another probability state—until only the murder remained.""

The silence was quantum-superposition heavy.

""But that means—"" Dr. Vex'nul flickered through several states of horrified realization.

""Yep."" Dibble nodded. ""The killer wasn't quantum. The killer was using Bob as an unwitting quantum anchor. Someone who knew his route. Who could predict his linear path. Who needed seventeen specific timeline collapses to commit the perfect quantum murder.""

He looked directly at Merchant Zyx'pol. ""Someone who'd been studying human behavior patterns. Someone who owed debts in seventeen different timelines and needed them all erased simultaneously.""

Zyx'pol's probability cloud collapsed into a single, guilty state.

""Seventeen timelines, seventeen debts, one linear human whose predictable path could anchor reality long enough for you to commit murder across all states simultaneously. The only flaw in your plan? You assumed nobody would ask the janitor what he saw.""

As they led Zyx'pol away (in quantum restraints across multiple probability states), Bob scratched his head. ""So I helped solve the case just by... mopping?""

""Best kind of police work,"" Dibble said, refilling his coffee cup. ""The kind nobody sees coming. Including the criminals.""

Later, filing his report in triplicate (which in quantum space meant filing it in 3\^17 probability states), Dibble added his usual note:

*""The Xerion Collective can see every possible future, but they missed the one variable that mattered: human routine. Sometimes the answer isn't in the quantum foam—it's in the mop bucket.""*

And somewhere in the Collective's vast probability matrices, a new calculation appeared:

*Dibble Factor: 0.000001% chance of solving impossible cases through sheer human stubbornness.*

*Success rate: 100%*

*Recommendation: Keep one rumpled detective on retainer. For the impossible cases. And the possible ones that hide in plain sight.*

*Case closed. In all timelines.*

**Chapter 4**

Gifford wouldn’t have been able to face Mardi Gras at the First Street house, so she has escaped to [Destin, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destin,_Florida), where she broods over Rowan’s disappearance. A few days after the incident, Gifford found a medal of [St. Michael the Archangel](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=308) at the First Street house and has been meaning to give it to Michael. Gifford is overwhelmed by Mona, particularly the girl’s sexual exploits, but is powerless to control her. Gifford loves Mona despite, or maybe because of, her rebellious ways. From Gifford’s musings we also learn that, in addition to sleeping with Julien at the age of thirteen, Ancient Evelyn also had an affair with Stella. 

Gifford’s husband, Ryan, calls and reveals that someone forged Rowan’s signature on the last two checks cashed to her account in New York two weeks ago. Ryan asks Gifford for her best guess as to what happened at the First Street house on Christmas. Gifford tells him the man came into the world, did something to Rowan, and departed from the First Street house, but Ryan doesn’t believe her. He tells her to lock up for the night and that he will pick her up in the morning.

Gifford ignores Ryan’s advice and instead goes for a late-night walk on the beach, returning to find a stranger in her house. He is Lasher, in the flesh, and he has come to seduce her. Lasher says he doesn’t remember her from when he was invisible but that she must have seen him; Gifford insists she doesn’t know him and orders him to leave. In the end, she isn’t able to resist him, and Lasher forces himself on her, saying she will be the mother of his child. But something goes wrong: Gifford wakes up in the surf in terrible pain and Lasher is walking away.



**Chapter 5**

From Emaleth’s perspective, we see Rowan is sick, tied up on a filthy bed. Lasher has told Emaleth that the two of them will conquer the world but that he still loves Rowan. They need Rowan’s milk so Emaleth can grow.



**Chapter 6**

Yuri is a member of the Talamasca, and the society’s Elders have ordered him to cut ties with Aaron Lightner, insisting that the file on the Mayfair Witches is closed. Yuri disobeys, leaving the London motherhouse for New Orleans.

Yuri doesn’t have special powers, but he is a thorough investigator and speaks many languages, which he learned from his mother’s cosmopolitan clients; she was a sex worker. After she died when Yuri was ten, he was compelled to work as a pickpocket but he escaped his masters and turned to sex work himself. One evening, he meets a [very sick](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis#tab=tab_1) man, Andrew, and helps him to a hotel. Andrew refuses to see a doctor but has Yuri call his father, who arrives the next evening. The man dies, and his visitor reveals he isn’t Andrew’s father, but a colleague. Reading Yuri’s mind, he offers to go to the bank with him to retrieve his mother’s [safe-deposit box](https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/five-things-know-about-safe-deposit-boxes-home-safes-and-your-valuables).

The man is Aaron Lightner, and he convinces Yuri to come to the Talamasca motherhouse in Amsterdam. The Talamasca arranges Yuri’s schooling and at age twenty-six, he becomes a regular member of the order. He has become close with Aaron over the years, so he knows something has gone wrong with the Mayfair Witches case. Aaron sends Yuri to Donnelaith to gather intelligence on Rowan and Lasher, but once Yuri adds his notes to the file, the Elders seal it and take Yuri off the case, assigning Erich Stolov instead. They forbid Yuri from going to or even speaking with Aaron, but Yuri knows he must.



**Chapter 7**

Dr. Larkin lands in New Orleans and is greeted by Aaron. The Mayfairs have had a family emergency, which is why Pierce and Ryan aren’t at the airport to meet Lark. They get into a limousine where Lark tells Aaron about his run-in with Stolov, who demanded Rowan’s samples. Aaron fishes for details about what Lark and the geneticist have discovered, but Lark only wants to tell Rowan or her next of kin. Aaron says it’s clear that Rowan’s main question is about whether Lasher can breed.",3,1758288045.0,bookclub,12,1.0,False

It's not super common these days for you to meet the actual love of your life that early in your adulthood and to stick with them for as long as we have.  I consider myself quite lucky.

We've developed a few silly little games that anyone on the outside looking in might think we're insane or hate each other when its just our way of showing love - like starting stupid fights just for fun.  The other immediately knows the game and plays along, that's part of our bond.  Just today when we were having our morning kitchen meetup to make coffee and get our daughter ready for school, she asked me if I could take the trash out today.  There's the trigger.  I put on my meanest voice that I've never actually used in anger - ""No, f- you! You're not the boss of me!""  She gets in my face and gives me a playful shove.  I shove back.  She starts cursing at me calling it abuse, she'll call the cops and have me dragged off, I accuse her of some other nonsense.  It all ends when one of us breaks ""character"" and starts laughing.  A stranger would think we're just a couple of grumpy jackasses.  Anyone else do this with their SO?

But that's not what bothers me. That's business. You're buying at a discount because of market factors. I would too. No, what bothers me is that you're buying my company with the sole intent of destroying it. You're *wielding* your money, Milt. That isn't business. It's not a sound *business* decision. My company was not competing with any of your companies, yet you're stomping it out because you can—because you…”

“Because I don't like you,” said Milton.

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. “You're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.”

“Are you finished?”

“Sure.”

“Good, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell—”

“I didn't! You know I didn't.”

“And whose fault is that, Charles?”

“It was an Act of God.”

“Then tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.”

“Twenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.”

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. “And your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.”

“I hope you get what's coming to you,” barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

- - -

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. “Aren't you going to ask me about my day?” he asked.

“How was your day?”

“Excellent. How was yours, my love?”

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. “Fine, too. I spent them at home.”

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure—a psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity—from having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! “You're a good mother,” he said. “How is our little angel?”

“Fine,” said Louisa.

“Aren't you going to say she misses me?”

“She's missed you terribly since morning,” said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

“You're sure?” asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. “I am absolutely positive,” said Wilbur. “I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa—*and this was her.*”

“Midtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?”

“Yes.”

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. “What was she doing?”

“Walking. Nothing more.”

“Alone?”

“Yes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.”

“Where *exactly* midtown was it?” asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

“My love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?” Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. “Out where?” she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

“Out of the house.”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.”

“I'm sure,” said Louisa.

“Mhm,” said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. “Good afternoon.”

“Who are you?” she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

“Ah, the parameters of the game.”

“What game—what is this—and just who in the world are you?” Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

“My name is Figaro,” he said. “I didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?”

She bit her lip.

“Yes,” she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. “Yes?” Louisa said.

“Oh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,” he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. “It's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.”

“And I yours, of course,” Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. “Goodbye,” he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

“Is that all you wanted?” the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. “Yes—but what if I should want something more?”

“Like what?”

“Please, sit,” he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. “I have a boyfriend,” she said. “He—”

“I didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?”

“No.”

“Does he have a habit of showing up unannounced?”

“No.”

“Could he be convinced,” said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, “never to come around again?”

“How much?” she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. “I suppose you must not love him very much,” he said.

“I suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.” She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: “What are you doing?” His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

“I thought—”

“You mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.” She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. “I want your violence.”

He gave her more money.

“Are you going to ask me my name, Figaro?” she asked.

“Your name is Louisa,” he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. “Louisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?”

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton’s cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. “Good. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.”

“I hate you!” she screamed—and the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

“Did something happen to your face?” Louisa asked.

“Nothing for you to worry about—but thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,” he said. “How was your day, my love?”

“Good.”

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. “Figaro.”

“Louisa. May I come in?”

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. “You bitch,” he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. “Louisa—” She kicked him in the stomach. “Louisa.” She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. “You're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.”

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn’t want a child for the simple reason that she didn’t want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicion.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she’d met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton’s house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny—and if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, “Excuse me,” until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. “I—do you… we are…”

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren’t. They’d been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. “It’s an OK job,” she said. “I bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I’ll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.” What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn’t going so well. “Everybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,” said Janine. “What I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven’t met anyone yet. I don’t know if I want to, not really. It’s the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?”

“I live in a cage,” said Louisa. “The cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it—except what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that’s the deal I made.” For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. “My husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He’s distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don’t know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don’t think I do either. There’s a nothingness to us both.”

“Is he abusive?” asked Janine.

“No, not physically,” said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

“We look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband’s happy?” said Janine.

“He wants a child which I’m preventing him from having,” said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine’s hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. “What if,” said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, “I offered you a role to play—paid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?”

“I’m not sure I follow,” said Janine.

“What if we switched lives?”

“How?”

“It would be easy. I don’t work, so you’d have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You’d have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.”

Janine stared. “Isn’t that crazy—and wouldn’t your husband… realize?”

“He wouldn’t. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.”

“You would give up everything for that?”

“Yes.”

“But for how long?”

“For as long as we’re both happier living other lives.”

“Forever?”

“Yes, if—**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as “Figaro” bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They’re both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. “I hate you,” she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. “I hate you,” repeats “Figaro,” which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. “I hate you so fucking much, Louisa,” he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it’s eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

“Excellent,” he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he’s in but doesn’t know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn’t very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They’re scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he’s a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr’s house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. “I didn’t, I… swear, Milt. If you think… that I had anything—”

“I don’t think you did.”

“So then why are you here?” asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

“I want to tell you you can have your company back,” says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. “Do you have a towel or something?”

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

“Are you OK?” asks a confused Thistleburr.

“I’m grand. I thought you’d be happy, you know—to have it back.”

“I would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.”

“Right, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I’m offering you a gift. Take it.” He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. “The lawyers say it’s all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Then don’t say it.”

“You’re a good man, Milt.”

“Bullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that’s the difference between good and bad. You’ve got no spine. But that’s all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I’m going to keep the towel.”

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: “Are you sure you’re OK, Milt? You look rough. I’m serious, If there’s anything I can do…”

Milton waves dismissively. “Enjoy your happy fucking ending.”",1,1758287807.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1nl3b79,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nl3b79/should_you_buy_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario V60,"The Hario V60-02W fits snugly into my daily morning routine, especially since I’ve grown particular about brewing coffee. Holding this ceramic pour-over coffee dripper in your hand, you instantly notice the effort put into its design. Crafted in Japan, the durable ceramic feels solid, yet carries an elegance reflective of its traditional Arita-yaki heritage. After weeks of use, I can confidently say that it’s not just a coffee maker; it’s an experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The smooth white ceramic finish not only looks sleek and fits beautifully on my counter but also serves a practical purpose. Heat retention is remarkable, which is essential when you’re brewing in small batches like I often do. Its minimalist design complements just about any kitchen aesthetic. I’m impressed by the clean, sharp edges that feel robust under everyday usage—it’s hard to imagine this cracking unless it suffers an unfortunate drop. However, being ceramic, you might find yourself being a little extra careful when handling it, especially before that first cup of coffee wakes you up.

**Brewing Excellence with the Cone-Shape**  
The star of the show here is the V60’s thoughtful brewing design. The specialty cone shape immediately stands out, and it’s not just for aesthetics. This shape encourages a deeper layering of ground coffee, giving a richer, more full-bodied flavor. While brewing, the coffee gracefully flows through the large hole at the bottom, and the spiral ridges inside the cone ensure water is evenly distributed throughout the coffee grounds. I've tried faster pours for a lighter taste on hot summer afternoons, and slower pours for a rich and comforting brew during chilly mornings. Both turned out beautifully.

**Advantages**  
• Exceptional heat retention due to ceramic build.  
• Spiral ridges ensure even water flow, enhancing flavor extraction.  
• Versatile pour control—adjust the flavor to your mood.  

[Check Hario V60-02W price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b000p4d5hg/)  

**Ease of Use and Adaptability**  
Operating the V60 is as easy as brewing gets, though it does demand attention to detail if you want perfection. I find the manual brewing process therapeutic—it’s your moment of zen before the world kicks in. You can achieve varying flavors simply by adjusting the grind size or pouring speed. That freedom felt refreshing compared to automatic brewers. However, it’s worth noting that getting there involves a bit of trial and error, particularly for those new to pour-over brewing.

**Limitations**  
• Ceramic is prone to damage if dropped.  
• Not the fastest option for your quick morning coffee rush.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this dripper is a breeze. Thankfully, it’s dishwasher safe, but honestly, I’ve just been rinsing it off most mornings without hesitation. The ceramic finish is resistant to staining, so even after consistent use, it still looks as pristine as when I first unboxed it. 

**Competing Products**  
The world of pour-over coffee drippers is a competitive one, and while the V60 shines, there are others worth mentioning. Chemex, for instance, offers a more mid-century modern vibe and a slightly larger capacity. While Chemex emphasizes smoother, lighter brews, the Hario V60 gives better control for richer, deeper flavors. On the other hand, Kalita Wave features a flat-bottom design which some claim offers more consistent brews, particularly for newcomers. If you're fussy about customization and hands-on control, the V60 sits comfortably at the top.

**Money’s Worth**  
Evaluating its price-to-quality ratio, the Hario V60 feels like an excellent investment.

1nl3b3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/10s/comments/1nl3b3c/serious_question_is_pickleball_the_devils_work/,Serious question - is pickleball the devil’s work?,"Hear me out - could pickleball be a trick of the devil to lure people away from the centuries-old, honest game of tennis?

1. It tempts people with laziness - Tennis demands endurance, footwork, fitness, and technical skill. Pickleball? Half a tennis court, basically no running, and a plastic ball that moves slower than molasses. It’s the sporting equivalent of instant coffee - easy, quick, and utterly devoid of the ritual and craft that makes tennis divine. 

2. It corrupts sacred spaces - Our temples are being desecrated by chalk lines, strange nets, and the awful pop-pop-pop of plastic wiffle balls. The satisfying and rhythmic sounds of well-struck forehands is now the sound of the devil’s typewriter clattering across hallowed ground. 

3. It undermines true skill - Tennis requires years to master. Pickleball? You can get the hang of it in a weekend. That’s not skill, that’s instant gratification - another of the devil’s favorite tricks. 

4. It sows division amongst the faithful - Where tennis unites across cultures and generations, pickleball creates schisms. Friends who once rallied on the baseline now defect to dink at the kitchen line. Families are torn, courts are split, and only the faithful are left defending the last bastion of true racket sport. 

5. It’s a distraction from greatness - Why strive for Federer’s grace, Serena’s power, or Djokovic’s resilience when you can paddle a wiffle ball in gym shorts? Because pickleball whispers: “Settle. Don’t challenge yourself. Forget the glory of an arduous 5-setter. Just dink forever…”

TLDR: Pickleball is no real sport, it’s a shortcut. It’s not exercise, it’s corruption. It’s clearly the devil’s work, creeping into our courts, trying to replace the cathedral of tennis with a backyard barbecue sideshow. 

So I ask you, brothers and sisters of the baseline — stand firm. Rally against the pickle. Protect our courts, our craft, and our calling. Tennis must not fall!!",49,1758287791.0,10s,31,0.82,False

But that's not what bothers me. That's business. You're buying at a discount because of market factors. I would too.

My company was not competing with any of your companies, yet you're stomping it out because you can—because you…”

“Because I don't like you,” said Milton.

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. “You're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.”

“Are you finished?”

“Sure.”

“Good, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell—”

“I didn't! You know I didn't.”

“And whose fault is that, Charles?”

“It was an Act of God.”

“Then tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.”

“Twenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.”

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. “And your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.”

“I hope you get what's coming to you,” barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

- - -

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. “Aren't you going to ask me about my day?” he asked.

“How was your day?”

“Excellent. How was yours, my love?”

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. “Fine, too. I spent them at home.”

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure—a psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity—from having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! “You're a good mother,” he said. “How is our little angel?”

“Fine,” said Louisa.

“Aren't you going to say she misses me?”

“She's missed you terribly since morning,” said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

“You're sure?” asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. “I am absolutely positive,” said Wilbur. “I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa—*and this was her.*”

“Midtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?”

“Yes.”

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. “What was she doing?”

“Walking. Nothing more.”

“Alone?”

“Yes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.”

“Where *exactly* midtown was it?” asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

“My love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?” Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. “Out where?” she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

“Out of the house.”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.”

“I'm sure,” said Louisa.

“Mhm,” said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. “Good afternoon.”

“Who are you?” she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

“Ah, the parameters of the game.”

“What game—what is this—and just who in the world are you?” Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

“My name is Figaro,” he said. “I didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?”

She bit her lip.

“Yes,” she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. “Yes?” Louisa said.

“Oh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,” he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. “It's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.”

“And I yours, of course,” Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. “Goodbye,” he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

“Is that all you wanted?” the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. “Yes—but what if I should want something more?”

“Like what?”

“Please, sit,” he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. “I have a boyfriend,” she said. “He—”

“I didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?”

“No.”

“Does he have a habit of showing up unannounced?”

“No.”

“Could he be convinced,” said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, “never to come around again?”

“How much?” she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. “I suppose you must not love him very much,” he said.

“I suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.” She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: “What are you doing?” His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

“I thought—”

“You mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.” She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. “I want your violence.”

He gave her more money.

“Are you going to ask me my name, Figaro?” she asked.

“Your name is Louisa,” he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. “Louisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?”

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton’s cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. “Good. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.”

“I hate you!” she screamed—and the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

“Did something happen to your face?” Louisa asked.

“Nothing for you to worry about—but thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,” he said. “How was your day, my love?”

“Good.”

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. “Figaro.”

“Louisa. May I come in?”

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. “You bitch,” he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. “Louisa—” She kicked him in the stomach. “Louisa.” She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. “You're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.”

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn’t want a child for the simple reason that she didn’t want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicion.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she’d met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton’s house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny—and if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, “Excuse me,” until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. “I—do you… we are…”

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren’t. They’d been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. “It’s an OK job,” she said. “I bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I’ll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.” What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn’t going so well. “Everybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,” said Janine. “What I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven’t met anyone yet. I don’t know if I want to, not really. It’s the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?”

“I live in a cage,” said Louisa. “The cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it—except what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that’s the deal I made.” For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. “My husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He’s distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don’t know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don’t think I do either. There’s a nothingness to us both.”

“Is he abusive?” asked Janine.

“No, not physically,” said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

“We look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband’s happy?” said Janine.

“He wants a child which I’m preventing him from having,” said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine’s hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. “What if,” said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, “I offered you a role to play—paid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?”

“I’m not sure I follow,” said Janine.

“What if we switched lives?”

“How?”

“It would be easy. I don’t work, so you’d have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You’d have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.”

Janine stared. “Isn’t that crazy—and wouldn’t your husband… realize?”

“He wouldn’t. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.”

“You would give up everything for that?”

“Yes.”

“But for how long?”

“For as long as we’re both happier living other lives.”

“Forever?”

“Yes, if—**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as “Figaro” bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They’re both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. “I hate you,” she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. “I hate you,” repeats “Figaro,” which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. “I hate you so fucking much, Louisa,” he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it’s eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

“Excellent,” he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he’s in but doesn’t know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn’t very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They’re scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he’s a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr’s house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. “I didn’t, I… swear, Milt. If you think… that I had anything—”

“I don’t think you did.”

“So then why are you here?” asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

“I want to tell you you can have your company back,” says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. “Do you have a towel or something?”

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

“Are you OK?” asks a confused Thistleburr.

“I’m grand. I thought you’d be happy, you know—to have it back.”

“I would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.”

“Right, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I’m offering you a gift. Take it.” He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. “The lawyers say it’s all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Then don’t say it.”

“You’re a good man, Milt.”

“Bullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that’s the difference between good and bad. You’ve got no spine. But that’s all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I’m going to keep the towel.”

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: “Are you sure you’re OK, Milt? You look rough. I’m serious, If there’s anything I can do…”

Milton waves dismissively. “Enjoy your happy fucking ending.”",3,1758287607.0,Odd_directions,4,0.8,False

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. “You're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.”

“Are you finished?”

“Sure.”

“Good, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell—”

“I didn't! You know I didn't.”

“And whose fault is that, Charles?”

“It was an Act of God.”

“Then tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.”

“Twenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.”

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. “And your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.”

“I hope you get what's coming to you,” barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

- - -

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. “Aren't you going to ask me about my day?” he asked.

“How was your day?”

“Excellent. How was yours, my love?”

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. “Fine, too. I spent them at home.”

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure—a psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity—from having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! “You're a good mother,” he said. “How is our little angel?”

“Fine,” said Louisa.

“Aren't you going to say she misses me?”

“She's missed you terribly since morning,” said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

“You're sure?” asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. “I am absolutely positive,” said Wilbur. “I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa—*and this was her.*”

“Midtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?”

“Yes.”

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. “What was she doing?”

“Walking. Nothing more.”

“Alone?”

“Yes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.”

“Where *exactly* midtown was it?” asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

“My love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?” Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. “Out where?” she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

“Out of the house.”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.”

“I'm sure,” said Louisa.

“Mhm,” said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. “Good afternoon.”

“Who are you?” she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

“Ah, the parameters of the game.”

“What game—what is this—and just who in the world are you?” Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

“My name is Figaro,” he said. “I didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?”

She bit her lip.

“Yes,” she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. “Yes?” Louisa said.

“Oh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,” he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. “It's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.”

“And I yours, of course,” Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. “Goodbye,” he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

“Is that all you wanted?” the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. “Yes—but what if I should want something more?”

“Like what?”

“Please, sit,” he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. “I have a boyfriend,” she said. “He—”

“I didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?”

“No.”

“Does he have a habit of showing up unannounced?”

“No.”

“Could he be convinced,” said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, “never to come around again?”

“How much?” she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. “I suppose you must not love him very much,” he said.

“I suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.” She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: “What are you doing?” His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

“I thought—”

“You mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.” She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. “I want your violence.”

He gave her more money.

“Are you going to ask me my name, Figaro?” she asked.

“Your name is Louisa,” he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. “Louisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?”

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton’s cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. “Good. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.”

“I hate you!” she screamed—and the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

“Did something happen to your face?” Louisa asked.

“Nothing for you to worry about—but thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,” he said. “How was your day, my love?”

“Good.”

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. “Figaro.”

“Louisa. May I come in?”

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. “You bitch,” he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. “Louisa—” She kicked him in the stomach. “Louisa.” She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. “You're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.”

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn’t want a child for the simple reason that she didn’t want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicion.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she’d met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton’s house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny—and if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, “Excuse me,” until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. “I—do you… we are…”

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren’t. They’d been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. “It’s an OK job,” she said. “I bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I’ll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.” What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn’t going so well. “Everybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,” said Janine. “What I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven’t met anyone yet. I don’t know if I want to, not really. It’s the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?”

“I live in a cage,” said Louisa. “The cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it—except what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that’s the deal I made.” For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. “My husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He’s distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don’t know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don’t think I do either. There’s a nothingness to us both.”

“Is he abusive?” asked Janine.

“No, not physically,” said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

“We look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband’s happy?” said Janine.

“He wants a child which I’m preventing him from having,” said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine’s hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. “What if,” said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, “I offered you a role to play—paid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?”

“I’m not sure I follow,” said Janine.

“What if we switched lives?”

“How?”

“It would be easy. I don’t work, so you’d have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You’d have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.”

Janine stared. “Isn’t that crazy—and wouldn’t your husband… realize?”

“He wouldn’t. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.”

“You would give up everything for that?”

“Yes.”

“But for how long?”

“For as long as we’re both happier living other lives.”

“Forever?”

“Yes, if—**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as “Figaro” bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They’re both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. “I hate you,” she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. “I hate you,” repeats “Figaro,” which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. “I hate you so fucking much, Louisa,” he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it’s eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

“Excellent,” he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he’s in but doesn’t know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn’t very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They’re scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he’s a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr’s house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. “I didn’t, I… swear, Milt. If you think… that I had anything—”

“I don’t think you did.”

“So then why are you here?” asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

“I want to tell you you can have your company back,” says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. “Do you have a towel or something?”

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

“Are you OK?” asks a confused Thistleburr.

“I’m grand. I thought you’d be happy, you know—to have it back.”

“I would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.”

“Right, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I’m offering you a gift. Take it.” He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. “The lawyers say it’s all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Then don’t say it.”

“You’re a good man, Milt.”

“Bullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that’s the difference between good and bad. You’ve got no spine. But that’s all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I’m going to keep the towel.”

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: “Are you sure you’re OK, Milt? You look rough. I’m serious, If there’s anything I can do…”

Milton waves dismissively. “Enjoy your happy fucking ending.”",1,1758287500.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up.

He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. “Louisa—” She kicked him in the stomach. “Louisa.” She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. “You're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.”

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn’t want a child for the simple reason that she didn’t want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicion.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she’d met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton’s house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny—and if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, “Excuse me,” until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. “I—do you… we are…”

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren’t. They’d been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. “It’s an OK job,” she said. “I bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I’ll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.” What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn’t going so well. “Everybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,” said Janine. “What I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven’t met anyone yet. I don’t know if I want to, not really. It’s the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?”

“I live in a cage,” said Louisa. “The cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it—except what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that’s the deal I made.” For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. “My husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He’s distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don’t know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don’t think I do either. There’s a nothingness to us both.”

“Is he abusive?” asked Janine.

“No, not physically,” said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

“We look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband’s happy?” said Janine.

“He wants a child which I’m preventing him from having,” said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine’s hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. “What if,” said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, “I offered you a role to play—paid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?”

“I’m not sure I follow,” said Janine.

“What if we switched lives?”

“How?”

“It would be easy. I don’t work, so you’d have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You’d have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.”

Janine stared. “Isn’t that crazy—and wouldn’t your husband… realize?”

“He wouldn’t. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.”

“You would give up everything for that?”

“Yes.”

“But for how long?”

“For as long as we’re both happier living other lives.”

“Forever?”

“Yes, if—**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as “Figaro” bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They’re both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. “I hate you,” she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. “I hate you,” repeats “Figaro,” which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. “I hate you so fucking much, Louisa,” he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it’s eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

“Excellent,” he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he’s in but doesn’t know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn’t very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They’re scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he’s a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr’s house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. “I didn’t, I… swear, Milt. If you think… that I had anything—”

“I don’t think you did.”

“So then why are you here?” asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

“I want to tell you you can have your company back,” says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. “Do you have a towel or something?”

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

“Are you OK?” asks a confused Thistleburr.

“I’m grand. I thought you’d be happy, you know—to have it back.”

“I would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.”

“Right, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I’m offering you a gift. Take it.” He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. “The lawyers say it’s all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Then don’t say it.”

“You’re a good man, Milt.”

“Bullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that’s the difference between good and bad. You’ve got no spine. But that’s all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I’m going to keep the towel.”

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: “Are you sure you’re OK, Milt? You look rough. I’m serious, If there’s anything I can do…”

Milton waves dismissively. “Enjoy your happy fucking ending.”",1,1758287477.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

But that's not what bothers me. That's business. You're buying at a discount because of market factors. I would too. No, what bothers me is that you're buying my company with the sole intent of destroying it. You're *wielding* your money, Milt. That isn't business. It's not a sound *business* decision. My company was not competing with any of your companies, yet you're stomping it out because you can—because you…”

“Because I don't like you,” said Milton.

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. “You're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.”

“Are you finished?”

“Sure.”

“Good, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell—”

“I didn't! You know I didn't.”

“And whose fault is that, Charles?”

“It was an Act of God.”

“Then tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.”

“Twenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.”

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. “And your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.”

“I hope you get what's coming to you,” barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

- - -

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. “Aren't you going to ask me about my day?” he asked.

“How was your day?”

“Excellent. How was yours, my love?”

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. “Fine, too. I spent them at home.”

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure—a psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity—from having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! “You're a good mother,” he said. “How is our little angel?”

“Fine,” said Louisa.

“Aren't you going to say she misses me?”

“She's missed you terribly since morning,” said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

“You're sure?” asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. “I am absolutely positive,” said Wilbur. “I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa—*and this was her.*”

“Midtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?”

“Yes.”

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. “What was she doing?”

“Walking. Nothing more.”

“Alone?”

“Yes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.”

“Where *exactly* midtown was it?” asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

“My love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?” Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. “Out where?” she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

“Out of the house.”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.”

“I'm sure,” said Louisa.

“Mhm,” said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. “Good afternoon.”

“Who are you?” she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

“Ah, the parameters of the game.”

“What game—what is this—and just who in the world are you?” Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

“My name is Figaro,” he said. “I didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?”

She bit her lip.

“Yes,” she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. “Yes?” Louisa said.

“Oh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,” he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. “It's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.”

“And I yours, of course,” Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. “Goodbye,” he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

“Is that all you wanted?” the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. “Yes—but what if I should want something more?”

“Like what?”

“Please, sit,” he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. “I have a boyfriend,” she said. “He—”

“I didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?”

“No.”

“Does he have a habit of showing up unannounced?”

“No.”

“Could he be convinced,” said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, “never to come around again?”

“How much?” she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. “I suppose you must not love him very much,” he said.

“I suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.” She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: “What are you doing?” His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

“I thought—”

“You mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.” She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. “I want your violence.”

He gave her more money.

“Are you going to ask me my name, Figaro?” she asked.

“Your name is Louisa,” he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. “Louisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?”

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton’s cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. “Good. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.”

“I hate you!” she screamed—and the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

“Did something happen to your face?” Louisa asked.

“Nothing for you to worry about—but thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,” he said. “How was your day, my love?”

“Good.”

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. “Figaro.”

“Louisa. May I come in?”

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. “You bitch,” he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

But that's not what bothers me. That's business. You're buying at a discount because of market factors. I would too. No, what bothers me is that you're buying my company with the sole intent of destroying it. You're *wielding* your money, Milt. That isn't business. It's not a sound *business* decision. My company was not competing with any of your companies, yet you're stomping it out because you can—because you…”

“Because I don't like you,” said Milton.

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. “You're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.”

“Are you finished?”

“Sure.”

“Good, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell—”

“I didn't! You know I didn't.”

“And whose fault is that, Charles?”

“It was an Act of God.”

“Then tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.”

“Twenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.”

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. “And your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.”

“I hope you get what's coming to you,” barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. “Aren't you going to ask me about my day?” he asked.

“How was your day?”

“Excellent. How was yours, my love?”

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. “Fine, too. I spent them at home.”

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure—a psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity—from having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! “You're a good mother,” he said. “How is our little angel?”

“Fine,” said Louisa.

“Aren't you going to say she misses me?”

“She's missed you terribly since morning,” said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

“You're sure?” asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. “I am absolutely positive,” said Wilbur. “I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa—*and this was her.*”

“Midtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?”

“Yes.”

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. “What was she doing?”

“Walking. Nothing more.”

“Alone?”

“Yes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.”

“Where *exactly* midtown was it?” asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

“My love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?” Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. “Out where?” she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

“Out of the house.”

“No.”

“Are you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.”

“I'm sure,” said Louisa.

“Mhm,” said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. “Good afternoon.”

“Who are you?” she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

“Ah, the parameters of the game.”

“What game—what is this—and just who in the world are you?” Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

“My name is Figaro,” he said. “I didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?”

She bit her lip.

“Yes,” she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. “Yes?” Louisa said.

“Oh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,” he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. “It's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.”

“And I yours, of course,” Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. “Goodbye,” he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

“Is that all you wanted?” the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. “Yes—but what if I should want something more?”

“Like what?”

“Please, sit,” he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. “I have a boyfriend,” she said. “He—”

“I didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?”

“No.”

“Does he have a habit of showing up unannounced?”

“No.”

“Could he be convinced,” said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, “never to come around again?”

“How much?” she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. “I suppose you must not love him very much,” he said.

“I suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.” She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: “What are you doing?” His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

“I thought—”

“You mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.” She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. “I want your violence.”

He gave her more money.

“Are you going to ask me my name, Figaro?” she asked.

“Your name is Louisa,” he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. “Louisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?”

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton’s cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. “Good. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.”

“I hate you!” she screamed—and the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

“Did something happen to your face?” Louisa asked.

“Nothing for you to worry about—but thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,” he said. “How was your day, my love?”

“Good.”

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. “Figaro.”

“Louisa. May I come in?”

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. “You bitch,” he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. “I hate you,” she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. “Louisa—” She kicked him in the stomach. “Louisa.” She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. “You're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.”

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn’t want a child for the simple reason that she didn’t want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicion.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she’d met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton’s house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny—and if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, “Excuse me,” until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. “I—do you… we are…”

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren’t. They’d been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. “It’s an OK job,” she said. “I bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I’ll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.” What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn’t going so well. “Everybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,” said Janine. “What I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven’t met anyone yet. I don’t know if I want to, not really. It’s the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?”

“I live in a cage,” said Louisa. “The cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it—except what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that’s the deal I made.” For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. “My husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He’s distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don’t know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don’t think I do either. There’s a nothingness to us both.”

“Is he abusive?” asked Janine.

“No, not physically,” said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

“We look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband’s happy?” said Janine.

“He wants a child which I’m preventing him from having,” said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine’s hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. “What if,” said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, “I offered you a role to play—paid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?”

“I’m not sure I follow,” said Janine.

“What if we switched lives?”

“How?”

“It would be easy. I don’t work, so you’d have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You’d have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.”

Janine stared. “Isn’t that crazy—and wouldn’t your husband… realize?”

“He wouldn’t. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.”

“You would give up everything for that?”

“Yes.”

“But for how long?”

“For as long as we’re both happier living other lives.”

“Forever?”

“Yes, if—**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as “Figaro” bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They’re both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. “I hate you,” she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. “I hate you,” repeats “Figaro,” which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. “I hate you so fucking much, Louisa,” he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it’s eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

“Excellent,” he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he’s in but doesn’t know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn’t very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They’re scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he’s a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr’s house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. “I didn’t, I… swear, Milt. If you think… that I had anything—”

“I don’t think you did.”

“So then why are you here?” asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

“I want to tell you you can have your company back,” says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. “Do you have a towel or something?”

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

“Are you OK?” asks a confused Thistleburr.

“I’m grand. I thought you’d be happy, you know—to have it back.”

“I would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.”

“Right, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I’m offering you a gift. Take it.” He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. “The lawyers say it’s all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Then don’t say it.”

“You’re a good man, Milt.”

“Bullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that’s the difference between good and bad. You’ve got no spine. But that’s all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I’m going to keep the towel.”

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: “Are you sure you’re OK, Milt? You look rough. I’m serious, If there’s anything I can do…”

Did a round of accutane in 2017, that was the first thing that really helped and it almost went into full remission, I think accutane should be a first line treatment for this condition.

A few years past and gradually symptoms began reappearing. Top pic is from 2022. I tried to go back on accutane but have since moved to a very dry climate and the side effects were much more difficult to tolerate. Keeping my head shaved seemed to keep the symptoms at bay but after a long day of work and sweating the inflammation would get very painful. If I bumped my head on something I'd double over in pain sometimes. A polycystic cluster developed at the base of my neck which really interfered with my sleep, sleeping on my back became painful. 

I had read a few case studies about using ND:yag laser hair removal as a successful treatment so I said screw it, I'd rather be bald than in pain. Found a cheap ish place ($100 a session) and got to work. First two sessions were excruciating but my laser tech worked fast. Caffeine sensitizes your skin so on days I forgot to skip my morning coffee the laser was exceptionally painful, but after the 3rd session as long as I abstained from caffeine it was a 2/10 pain, very tolerable.

After 2 sessions shaving my hair became much easier, the hair was less coarse and the follicles less dense, which was a significant plus.

Did 6-7 sessions and the place I was going went out of business. Symptoms would still flare up if I went a few days without shaving. Found a new place that was more expensive but used a newer dual wavelength laser (cutera) and this is my head clean shaven after 3 sessions at the new place. I feel free. You can't have follicular collapse if you have no follicles!

The ultrasound bedire didn't mention the one inside, but i had multiple on the outisde & my uterus measured like 14 weeks pregnant.My random thoughts/tips:
1. I choose hysterectomy because I'm 42, have 3 adult children,  and don't want to risk them returning prior to menopause.  Also,  bye periods!

2. I can't believe they send you home the same day. I have a Healthcare background, my husband did super well taking care of me. Have someone who can really help you because my husband still helps me in the shower. Bending is my limitation. 

3. I slept in a recliner the first day. The 2nd, I went upstairs to my bedroom, where I used a pregnancy pillow and another pillow for splinting. My husband bought me a hysterectomy pillow off Amazon,  which is nice because it has pockets. 

4. The gas pain was the worst. It still hurts for the gas to move down. I'm taking Tylenol and ibuprofen. Stopped taking oxycodone 3 or r days ago. Still need gas-X and stool softener though.

5. I have slept a lot. I mean a lot! Im grateful though. My appetite is down, the thought of some things make me nauseated still. I miss coffee

6. Ice packs and sleeping on my heating blanket have been life savers. Many recommend buying a lot of unnecessary things. Spend your money wisely. Use it to hire a cleaner to come to the house instead. 

7. I took 6 weeks off work and I work from home. The main reason is I want to avoid the fatigue while working and I'm also on a lifting restriction.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I don’t mean bars or clubs. I mean more like third places where people connect, like coffee spots, art/music spaces, game nights, or anything with a community feel. I’ve found a few one-off events, but nothing that feels like a regular spot for people in their 20s to 30s. I get that Dayton might not have a massive art or music scene, but there has to be some kind of small creative community out there. If you know of any go-to spots or groups, I’d love to check them out.

1nl311o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nl311o,Sanda Tank 1150G Review: A Cartier Look for the Price of a Big Mac,"# Sanda Tank 1150G Review

The Sanda Tank had been on my wishlist for quite some time. It is inspired by the legendary Cartier Tank, first introduced in 1918. The rectangular lines and proportions were modeled after the tanks used on the First World War battlefields, which explains the name.

More than a century later, the Cartier Tank has become one of the most stylish, sophisticated, and copied wristwatches ever. Even Casio has a Tank-style watch, which makes me wonder: if a Japanese brand produces one, it is considered a homage, but if a Chinese brand does the same, it is often called a clone. In Dutch we say *meten met twee maten*, measuring with two standards. Personally, I do not mind what people call them. I enjoy **Clomages** (clone plus homage) because they are fascinating, fun to collect, and affordable enough to try many models.

The Sanda Tank is one of the best-known budget dress watches and it can be delivered to your doorstep for the price of a Big Mac menu. Sometimes it is even as cheap as a beer on a terrace.

---

## Specifications

* **Movement:** Simple quartz, no lume, no complications
* **Model:** 1150G, 41 mm x 30 mm, available in silver or rose gold case
* **Dial options:** White dial with coffee leather strap or black dial with black leather strap
* **Alternative model:** 1108, smaller at 28 mm x 27 mm, only in silver, screw-down caseback
* **Case:** Zinc alloy
* **Crystal:** Mineral tempered glass
* **Caseback:** Stainless steel, press-fit rather than screws
* **Strap:** Genuine leather, very stiff at first

I chose the rose gold 1150G with coffee leather. It feels closer to the modern Cartier Tank Louis. The smaller 1108 looks more like a Tank Must homage.

---

## Price

I paid € 5,84 using AliExpress coin discounts. The retail price is usually around € 14. With coupons or during sales, it can be found even cheaper.

---

## The Good

* **Classy looks:** Stylish, minimal, and very wearable as a budget dress watch
* **Dial quality:** Nicely printed and cleanly executed
* **Very affordable:** A sub € 15 watch that looks more expensive than it is

---

## The Bad

* **Stiff strap:** The leather strap needs time to break in
* **Rough finishing:** Small imperfections around the crown and strap attachment, but not on the dial
* **Materials:** Zinc alloy case instead of stainless steel, which is expected at this price

---

## Final Verdict

The Sanda Tank 1150G is one of the strongest ultra-budget dress watches available. For less than € 15 you get a stylish homage to one of the most iconic watch designs in history. The materials are basic and the strap could be better, yet on the wrist the watch delivers surprising elegance.

If you are curious about Tank-style watches but do not want to spend much, or if you simply enjoy collecting Clomages, the Sanda Tank deserves a place in your collection. A great looker at a tiny price.

We’re Requiremints, a group that researches and compares products to make choices a little easier.

Recently we reviewed more than 30 different electric kettles in all kinds of price ranges. We figured it’d be useful to share some of what we found here and offer help if anyone’s looking for a new one.

Before picking an electric kettle, here are a few things worth keeping in mind:

* Capacity - do you need something small for one or two cups or bigger for family use
* Material - stainless steel, glass, or plastic can affect durability and taste
* Speed - some heat up water much faster than others
* Features - temperature control, keep-warm, auto shut-off can make a difference
* Style - some people want modern, others love a retro look

Here are some of the kettles that stood out to us:

* **\[Best Mid-Range Stainless\] Cuisinart Perfectemp CPK-17** \- A reliable 1.7L stainless steel kettle with six preset temps, keep warm mode, and auto shut-off. Great for tea and coffee lovers who want easy precision.
* **\[Best High-End Infuser\] Breville Tea Maker BTM800XL** \- Premium glass and stainless kettle with an automatic tea basket. Lets you brew with precision and keep warm for up to an hour.
* **\[Best Retro Design\] Smeg KLF03** \- Stylish 50s-inspired kettle with a 1.7L capacity and solid build. Lacks temperature control but perfect if design matters as much as function.
* **\[Best Budget Glass\] COSORI 1.7L with LED** \- Affordable glass kettle with LED indicator, auto shut-off, and quick boiling. Large enough for family use but exterior gets hot to the touch.
* **\[Best Stylish Gooseneck\] Fellow Stagg EKG** \- Nicely designed gooseneck kettle with precise temp control, hold function, and a built-in brew timer. Ideal for pour-over coffee and tea purists.
* **\[Best Mid-Range Gooseneck\] COSORI CO108-NK** \- Stainless steel gooseneck kettle with fast heating, auto shut-off, and keep warm mode. Good balance of price and performance, though temp accuracy isn’t perfect.
* **\[Best Compact Retro\] KitchenAid 1.25L Artisan** \- Small and stylish kettle that heats quickly. Great for smaller kitchens and makes just enough for a few cups without taking much counter space.
* **\[Best Easy Stainless\] Breville Soft Top Pure BKE700BSS** \- Simple stainless steel kettle with a soft-opening lid, clear water windows, and ergonomic handle. A safe, no-fuss pick with solid performance.

That’s a quick look at some favorites, but there are plenty of good options depending on budget and style.

In 2025, we juggle WhatsApp groups, Gmail labels, DMs across five apps, and UPI receipts that bury important names inside transaction logs. Relationships don’t fail loudly, they fade quietly-one missed follow-up at a time. That’s why personal CRMs powered by AI have moved from “nice to have” to “survival kit.” And because most people won’t babysit a spreadsheet or learn a complicated SaaS, the sweet spot now is no-code AI tools that catch the details, nudge you when it matters, and make reaching out feel natural again. On[ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-mane-0a7109229/), you’ll see the same pattern: the creators and operators who stay visible are not hustling harder-they’re systemizing gentle, timely touchpoints with the help of AI.

# Why Personal CRM Matters in 2025

Personal CRM isn’t about hoarding contacts; it’s about turning weak ties into real allies with a lightweight habit loop: capture, recall, reach out. AI lowers the friction on all three. It watches your inbox, calendar, notes, and call logs, then surfaces the right name at the right time with context that feels human. Add no-code building blocks and you get a simple, visual way to automate reminders, sync contact details, and personalize follow-ups without writing a single line of code.

Author Insight:[ Akash Mane](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/) is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows. He focuses on evidence-based reviews, clear benchmarks, and practical use cases that help creators and startups make smarter software choices. Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/), where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

**How AI transforms relationship management for individuals**

Traditional contact lists treat people like static entries. AI personal CRMs treat relationships like living systems. Here’s what changes when machine intelligence quietly works in the background:

* Capture becomes automatic. Instead of manually entering a phone number and notes after a coffee chat, AI parses the meeting invite, the call transcript, the email signature, and the post-meeting thank-you. It builds a contact profile with name, role, company, last interaction, and a few memorable details you’d otherwise forget.  
* Recall gets context-aware. When you search “Sara,” AI doesn’t just show a card. It suggests “Sara-the product manager you met last month in Pune-asked about an SDK guide; she tagged the GitHub repo you starred.” You get a one-screen brief that helps you write a relevant opener in seconds.  
* Reach-outs become timely. AI learns your cadence with each person: who appreciates quarterly check-ins, who is in an intense launch phase, who posts career updates each March. It nudges you on a rhythm that feels considerate instead of intrusive.  

Under the hood, two capabilities are doing the heavy lifting: entity extraction and intent prediction. Entity extraction pulls names, roles, and companies out of your communications-then cross-references public data to fill gaps. Intent prediction identifies whether a message was a handoff, a soft “not now,” or an invitation to circle back next week. The result: you stop relying on memory and start relying on signals.

A practical example: someone replies, “Circle back after Diwali.” A good AI CRM will (1) date-normalize that festival window to a specific week on your calendar, (2) tie the reminder to the original thread so you can reopen with context, and (3) suggest a draft that references their last concern and a short update from your side. That’s what turns a vague promise into a real follow-up.

**The hidden costs of missed follow-ups and lost opportunities**

We often underestimate the price of a dropped thread because the cost is silent. A single missed reply can look trivial in the moment, but it compounds over a quarter:

* Lost revenue: skip one warm conversation a month and you might lose one deal per quarter. If an average engagement is ₹40,000, you’re quietly burning ₹1.6 lakh a year by memory alone.  
* Shrinking surface area: algorithms reward active, reciprocal networks. When you fade from a contact’s inbox and feed, your visibility decays. AI CRMs help you reverse that decay with small, consistent touchpoints.  
* Emotional tax: there’s also the stress of mental tracking-“Did I get back to Anuj?”-which robs creative energy. Offload follow-up anxiety to a system that never sleeps and you get attention back for work that actually moves the needle.  

Notice how none of these require a massive CRM migration. You don’t need every feature under the sun; you need a minimal stack that catches near-term opportunities and reinforces long-term trust.

**Why no-code tools make CRM adoption easier than ever**

The old objection to CRMs was setup fatigue. No-code erased that. In 2025, you can assemble a personal relationship cockpit with drag-and-drop blocks:

* Visual automations: tools let you say, “When I star an email, create a follow-up task in seven days with the thread attached.” No scripting. No Zapier PhD. Just a recipe that works.  
* Simple data models: a lightweight table with columns for “Last Chat,” “Next Touch,” “Context,” and “Channel” beats a 50-field contact object. No-code databases feel like spreadsheets but behave like structured apps.  
* Plug-in intelligence: want sentiment analysis on replies or a summary of a 30-minute call? Attach an AI block that analyzes text and drops the highlights directly into the contact note.  

Adoption comes down to path of least resistance. The right no-code AI CRM slides into the tools you already use-email, calendar, notes-and builds scaffolding around your existing habits rather than asking you to adopt new ones.

**Personal experience** I used to “trust my brain” for follow-ups and would remember the big ones while losing the quiet maybes. One December, I opened an old thread and found a friendly “Ping me in March.” I had never pinged. I built a simple no-code flow that turns “Ping me” messages into dated reminders with the thread attached. Three months later, the same contact became a paying client because I was the only one who showed up exactly when they asked.

**Famous book insight** *Never Eat Alone* by Keith Ferrazzi (Chapter 3). Ferrazzi frames networking as a consistent, generous practice rather than sporadic extraction. An AI personal CRM operationalizes that philosophy by nudging small, timely acts of generosity-sharing a resource, checking in after a launch, or congratulating a milestone-so the habit compounds over time.

# Top AI-Powered Personal CRM Tools

Personal CRM in 2025 isn’t just about having a “Rolodex with AI slapped on.” The landscape has matured into specialized apps built for freelancers, early professionals, and creators who don’t want a Salesforce-sized headache. What separates the top players now is their blend of **no-code flexibility**, **AI-powered insights**, and **lightweight pricing** that makes them viable as daily companions instead of enterprise overhead.

**Best no-code AI CRM apps for solopreneurs and freelancers**

For solopreneurs and independent professionals, the dealbreaker is setup friction. Tools like **Clay**, **Folk**, and **Dex** dominate discussions on Product Hunt because they don’t demand months of onboarding.

* **Clay** shines by syncing with your email, calendar, and even Twitter/X to auto-enrich contacts. Freelancers who meet clients casually-say on a call or at a coworking event-find it useful because Clay will instantly pull in bios, LinkedIn links, and shared context.  
* **Folk** is more like “Notion meets CRM.” With drag-and-drop boards and Kanban views, it lets a small agency owner build relationship pipelines without needing engineering help. Its AI helps draft follow-up messages in tone variations (formal, casual, warm), making client communication feel native.  
* **Dex** focuses heavily on reminders and timelines. For a freelancer managing five retainer clients, Dex acts like a memory prosthetic. It tells you, “It’s been 29 days since you last updated Client B-time to send a check-in.”  

All three are no-code first. You can automate simple sequences-like “send an email draft when an event ends” or “tag new contacts from Calendly”-without leaving the app. According to reviews on G2, the adoption curve is under one week, which is the critical difference compared to traditional CRMs that sit unused.

**AI-driven CRMs that integrate seamlessly with Gmail and Outlook**

Email is still the backbone of professional networking. That’s why Gmail- and Outlook-friendly CRMs are thriving. Tools like **Affinity**, **Folk for Gmail**, and **Streak** stand out:

* **Streak** lives inside Gmail as a sidebar and pipeline view. You don’t toggle windows-it’s contact tracking, reminders, and AI-powered suggestions baked into your inbox. If you’re negotiating with multiple vendors, Streak threads them into one pipeline without leaving Gmail.  
* **Affinity** leans toward professional dealmakers, but individuals find it useful because of its AI “relationship intelligence.” It watches your email graph-who you talk to, how often, and when replies drop-and prioritizes who needs your attention.  
* **Folk’s Gmail integration** is newer but powerful. It turns flagged or starred emails into contact cards, enriched automatically, with one-click scheduling for follow-ups.  

Outlook users also benefit: **Outlook Customer Manager**, while basic, now has AI nudges that recommend follow-up times. Plus, third-party integrations like **Nimble** sync seamlessly with Outlook contacts and calendar, pulling in LinkedIn updates to remind you what your contact’s been posting before you hit send.

**Affordable personal CRM tools for students and early professionals**

One overlooked segment is students and early-career professionals. They don’t need enterprise pricing, but they need to manage mentors, internship leads, and early clients. Affordable AI CRMs in 2025 include:

* **Monica** (open-source, self-hosted). Students on tight budgets appreciate its free tier. It logs birthdays, notes, and last interactions in a dead-simple interface. AI plug-ins can summarize long email chains into bullet points for faster catch-up.  
* **Dex Student Plan** offers discounts and focuses on reminders for networking. Students prepping for campus placements can tag recruiters, set reminders to follow up after career fairs, and avoid ghosting connections.  
* **Notion + Tally + AI integrations** form a no-code CRM stack under $10/month. It’s less polished but powerful: use Notion tables for contacts, Tally forms to capture leads, and AI blocks to suggest drafts or summarize meetings.  

Reviews on Trustpilot show younger users value affordability and simplicity over feature bloat. A system that reminds you to reconnect with a professor or recruiter after two months is more valuable than advanced lead scoring at this stage.

**Personal experience** I once helped a friend in grad school set up a basic Notion + Zapier CRM. She tracked internship conversations with HR managers and professors she met at conferences. Within six months, she had built a rhythm of polite follow-ups-birthday wishes, “thank you” notes, and check-ins on research. That habit turned into three internship offers in a market where most peers struggled to even get callbacks.

**Famous book insight** *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (Chapter 4: “The Man Who Didn’t Look Right”). Clear explains how small, consistent cues build compounding change. Personal CRMs operationalize this principle-tiny nudges (like a reminder to message a contact) create outsized career outcomes over time. The consistency, not the one-off big push, is what shifts your trajectory.

# AI for Smart Follow-Ups

Smart follow-ups are the heartbeat of a personal CRM. In 2025, AI doesn’t just remind you when to send a message-it learns how to make that message land. It’s the difference between a bland “checking in” and a thoughtful note that references your last conversation or their recent LinkedIn post. With predictive models, natural language generation, and context pulled from multiple data streams, follow-ups feel less like transactions and more like genuine continuity.

**How predictive AI ensures timely reminders and nudges**

Predictive AI models inside modern CRMs analyze patterns in your past communication. If you usually reply to a mentor every 45 days, the AI flags when that window is about to close. If a client mentioned “circle back after Q2,” predictive engines tie that phrase to actual calendar weeks and create a reminder with context attached.

What’s powerful in 2025 is cross-channel prediction. AI doesn’t just track email cadence; it maps WhatsApp messages, calendar events, and even LinkedIn engagement. If you liked someone’s post but didn’t follow up, your CRM might nudge: “You interacted with Priya’s article but haven’t spoken directly in 90 days. Draft a note?”

This goes beyond reminders-it’s reputation management. Staying visible and relevant in someone’s mental inbox often comes down to timing. Predictive nudges make sure you show up in that narrow window when they’re still thinking about you.

**AI-generated email drafts for warm follow-up conversations**

Drafting follow-ups is where most people stall. The thought-“What do I even say?”-often kills momentum. AI-generated drafts remove that friction. Tools like **Superhuman with AI**, **Folk AI Writer**, and **Clay’s Smart Drafts** now generate context-aware notes:

* Superhuman can rephrase your short note into a warm, professional draft referencing the last thread.  
* Folk’s AI can create three tones-casual, concise, or formal-so you can pick one that fits your relationship.  
* Clay offers a “memory snapshot,” where it summarizes your last meeting or email and suggests a follow-up line like, “Hope the launch you mentioned last week went smoothly.”  

Real-world use: Imagine you met a designer at a hackathon and discussed AI prototypes. Two weeks later, you want to reconnect. Your AI CRM drafts: *“Hey Anjali, I enjoyed our chat at DevHack about AI design tools. Did you end up testing the workflow automation you mentioned? Would love to compare notes.”* That’s not robotic-it’s contextual and personal.

**Using AI to personalize follow-ups at scale without losing authenticity**

The biggest fear is that scaling follow-ups makes them feel fake. But personalization doesn’t mean manual drudgery; it means layering relevance into every message. AI now pulls micro-context automatically:

* It might reference a contact’s new job title scraped from LinkedIn.  
* It can highlight their company’s latest funding round from Crunchbase.  
* It could mention a blog they published last month, flagged via RSS.  

At scale, this means you can maintain 50 warm professional relationships without burning out. Each note feels like you actually remembered the person, when in reality your AI CRM remembered *for you.*

On Reddit threads, users often complain about “cold outreach spam.” The reason? Zero context. Personal CRMs with AI sidestep that mistake by embedding actual shared history and current relevance into each message, making even scaled communication feel one-to-one.

**Personal experience** I once used an AI CRM to follow up with 25 contacts after a product demo week. Normally, I would’ve blasted a generic “Thanks for attending” note. Instead, the CRM drafted 25 variations-one referenced a feature they asked about, another mentioned a bug they spotted, another congratulated someone on a recent career move. My response rate doubled because every message felt written for them, even though I hadn’t manually crafted each one.

**Famous book insight** *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie (Part Two, Chapter 1). Carnegie emphasizes remembering small details about people-their interests, their wins, their struggles-and bringing them up in conversations. AI personal CRMs are digital amplifiers of this principle, making sure no detail is lost and no follow-up feels generic.

# No-Code Integrations for Everyday Use

The real magic of AI personal CRMs in 2025 is how easily they slot into your daily tools without requiring you to hire a developer. Thanks to no-code platforms, connecting your CRM with everything from calendars to dashboards is now a drag-and-drop process. Instead of drowning in tabs or copy-pasting contact details, you build smooth workflows that save hours and reduce missed opportunities.

**Connecting CRMs with Zapier, Make, and other automation tools**

Zapier and Make (formerly Integromat) remain the backbone of no-code automation. In a personal CRM context, they act like invisible assistants:

* **Zapier**: Suppose you star an important email in Gmail. Zapier instantly creates a follow-up task in your CRM with the email thread attached. That one “star” action becomes a structured task you won’t forget.  
* **Make**: More flexible for heavy users. You could design a flow like: “When I add a new contact in Dex, fetch their latest LinkedIn profile updates, add them to a Notion dashboard, and create a calendar reminder for one month later.” That’s multi-step automation with zero coding.  
* **Native connectors**: Tools like Clay or Folk already come with built-in hooks for Slack, Notion, and Google Calendar. You don’t even need Zapier if you want basic syncing.  

Community posts on Product Hunt show that these integrations are the top reason solopreneurs adopt no-code CRMs. The promise is simple: one action in one app quietly creates the scaffolding for the next action, so you stay consistent without overthinking.

**How to set up no-code workflows for contact syncing**

Contact syncing sounds boring-until you realize it’s where most opportunities get lost. A business card never makes it to your system. A Calendly invite gets buried. AI CRMs combined with no-code workflows fix that:

1. **Capture**: Every new contact from Calendly, Google Contacts, or email signatures flows into your CRM automatically.  
2. **Enrich**: AI pulls additional data-LinkedIn bio, company details from Crunchbase, even their recent GitHub contributions if they’re technical.  
3. **Remind**: A workflow sets a touchpoint 14 days later, so you don’t let the new connection fade into silence.  

Example: I once built a Make scenario where every attendee from a Zoom call auto-synced into Notion as a new contact, enriched with their LinkedIn headline. The CRM then pinged me a week later to send a short “Thanks again for joining” note. That workflow turned what used to be manual chaos into a reliable rhythm.

**Best no-code dashboards for managing relationships visually**

Not everyone wants lists and spreadsheets. No-code dashboards give you visual clarity:

* **Airtable**: Perfect for a freelancer with 50+ active clients. You can design Kanban boards for “New Lead,” “In Touch,” “Dormant,” and see at a glance who needs a nudge.  
* **Notion**: Flexible for students or early professionals. Build a CRM table, add AI blocks for call summaries, and embed reminders right into your workspace.  
* **Coda**: More advanced, but powerful for multi-channel users. You can integrate sentiment analysis directly into your tables-so a “negative” flag shows up if your last email exchange seemed tense.  

Dashboards reduce overwhelm. Instead of flipping between apps, you glance at one board and know exactly who to reach out to this week. Reviews on Capterra show that users who switch to visual dashboards often increase follow-through by 40% because the system feels lighter and more engaging.

**Personal experience** I struggled to keep up with contacts after networking events because I’d forget who I’d already messaged. Building a Notion CRM with a Kanban view and simple color-coded tags changed everything. Green meant “active,” yellow meant “needs touch,” and red meant “dormant.” Pair that with an AI summary of our last chat, and I suddenly had a living map of my relationships that I actually enjoyed updating.

**Famous book insight** *Getting Things Done* by David Allen (Chapter 2: “Getting Control of Your Life”). Allen’s system is all about externalizing commitments into trusted systems. No-code AI CRMs bring this principle into networking: instead of holding relationship maintenance in your head, you offload it to dashboards and workflows that quietly track and remind you.

# Advanced Features in AI CRMs

Basic reminders and dashboards solve half the challenge, but in 2025, advanced AI features take personal CRMs beyond glorified contact lists. These features don’t just remind you to connect-they tell you *how* your relationships are going, *who* deserves priority, and even log interactions without you lifting a finger.

**Sentiment analysis for tracking conversation health**

Modern AI CRMs run natural language processing on your messages and calls to detect tone and sentiment. This isn’t about flagging “positive” or “negative” in a simplistic way-it’s about mapping conversation health over time.

* If your last three emails with a client are clipped, delayed, or marked by keywords like “concern” or “issue,” the CRM flags the relationship as cooling.  
* Conversely, if responses are prompt and warm, the system reinforces that you’re in a healthy engagement window.  

This is particularly useful for personal networking. Imagine reconnecting with a mentor who seems polite but disengaged. Sentiment tracking reveals a downward slope, nudging you to reframe your next message more thoughtfully-maybe sharing a resource instead of asking for help.

**AI-driven lead scoring for personal networking**

Lead scoring isn’t just for sales teams anymore. AI personal CRMs assign “relationship priority scores” based on:

* Recency of interaction  
* Relevance of their role to your goals  
* Responsiveness and engagement history  
* Shared context, such as projects or communities (Reddit groups, open-source repos, etc.)  

For example, if you’re a freelancer balancing 40 contacts, your CRM might tell you: “Top 5 people to message this week-two potential clients who engaged last month, one mentor whose score dropped, and two peers who just got promoted.”

Tools like Clay and Affinity already use graph analysis to suggest these priorities. By 2025, even lightweight CRMs like Dex have added scoring layers, making it easier to manage sprawling networks without dropping key threads.

**Voice-to-CRM: using AI to log meetings and calls automatically**

Manual note-taking after calls is the fastest way to kill consistency. Voice-to-CRM changes the game:

* During a Zoom or phone call, AI listens in (with permission) and transcribes the conversation.  
* It tags action items like “Send deck by Friday” and auto-attaches them to the contact.  
* It writes a short summary and updates the CRM timeline without you ever typing.  

Imagine finishing a 30-minute call, and by the time you hang up, your CRM already has: “Discussed pricing. Client interested in next quarter. Action: follow up with case study.” That’s hours saved and zero reliance on faulty memory.

GitHub communities have open-source transcription engines like Whisper being integrated directly into CRMs, while premium apps offer polished, privacy-compliant versions. According to user reviews on G2, these features often improve follow-up accuracy by more than 60%.

**Personal experience** I once ran three back-to-back calls in a single afternoon and forgot half the details by evening. When I later tested a voice-to-CRM setup, every conversation landed in my dashboard as structured notes. The next day, I sent crisp follow-ups with exact references-like “the pricing model you mentioned” or “the hiring timeline we discussed.” The feedback I got? “You’re incredibly attentive.” In truth, it was the AI doing the remembering.

**Famous book insight** *Deep Work* by Cal Newport (Chapter 1). Newport stresses that focus is squandered when your brain spends energy juggling small details. Voice-to-CRM tools embody this idea by outsourcing low-level memory tasks, freeing your attention for meaningful problem-solving and deeper relationship building.

# Choosing the Right AI CRM for Your Needs

By 2025, the challenge isn’t finding an AI-powered personal CRM-it’s choosing one from dozens that all promise smarter follow-ups, no-code workflows, and predictive nudges. The right fit depends less on flashy features and more on whether the tool aligns with your lifestyle, budget, and trust thresholds.

**Key factors to compare: pricing, ease of use, and scalability**

When comparing personal CRMs, three dimensions consistently show up in user reviews on Trustpilot and Capterra:

* **Pricing**: Some tools like Monica are open-source and free, while others like Clay start around $20/month and scale up to $99/month for premium features. Students or freelancers on a budget should weigh whether an extra $50/month actually produces ROI in saved deals or opportunities.  
* **Ease of use**: If it takes you weeks to understand, you won’t use it. No-code friendly tools like Dex and Folk are praised for their intuitive UIs, while heavier CRMs-even if packed with features-often sit abandoned.  
* **Scalability**: Do you just need 50 contacts and reminders, or do you anticipate managing 500+ across clients, mentors, and partners? Clay and Affinity scale well for volume, while Dex and Notion-based setups shine for smaller, more personal networks.  

Benchmarking ease of use is tricky, but a safe test is this: if you can set up meaningful automations within the first 48 hours without opening a YouTube tutorial, it’s a keeper.

**Privacy and data security considerations in personal CRMs**

Storing personal contact data comes with responsibility. As of mid-2025, the most respected AI CRMs emphasize:

* **Encryption**: End-to-end or at least AES-256 at rest.  
* **Permissions**: Options to exclude sensitive inboxes or social accounts from syncing.  
* **Transparency**: Public documentation of where data is stored (US, EU, India) and how AI models are trained.  

Privacy has become a decisive factor, especially after reports of smaller CRMs allegedly mishandling sync data in 2023–2024. Today, tools that publish clear privacy policies, undergo third-party audits, or open-source portions of their stack (see Monica) rank higher in trust. Checking a CRM’s domain on BuiltWith or WHOIS also helps verify legitimacy before committing sensitive data.

**Open-source vs. commercial AI CRM tools - which to pick?**

The choice between open-source and commercial boils down to control vs. convenience:

* **Open-source (e.g., Monica)**: Ideal for students, hobbyists, or privacy-conscious users. You host your own data, customize workflows, and avoid vendor lock-in. Downsides: setup can be technical, and AI features often require plug-ins.  
* **Commercial (e.g., Clay, Folk, Affinity)**: Faster to onboard, with polished interfaces, built-in AI, and native integrations. Downsides: higher cost and reliance on a vendor’s roadmap and compliance.  

A hybrid path is emerging too: using open-source databases like Airtable/Notion for contact storage, and layering commercial AI plug-ins for enrichment or drafting. That way, you keep data portable but still benefit from state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

**Personal experience** I tested both sides. With Monica (self-hosted), I had full control and zero subscription costs, but updates were patchy and integrations took effort. When I switched to Clay, I lost some control but gained a polished experience-automatic LinkedIn enrichment, smart drafts, and seamless Gmail sync. The trade-off was cost, but the time saved in consistent follow-ups outweighed the monthly fee.

**Famous book insight** *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen R. Covey (Habit 3: “Put First Things First”). Covey argues that tools should serve your priorities, not dictate them. Choosing an AI CRM is similar-you don’t need the most feature-rich system; you need the one that helps you consistently prioritize relationships that matter.

# Best Practices for Using AI Personal CRMs

Owning the right tool is just step one. The long-term payoff comes from how you use it-how you balance automation with authenticity, how often you clean your data, and how you layer AI on top of human effort without letting it take over completely. In 2025, the people getting the most from personal CRMs aren’t the ones automating everything-they’re the ones who know where *not* to automate.

**How often should you update and clean your CRM data?**

A cluttered CRM is as useless as a cluttered desk. Outdated emails, duplicate contacts, and stale notes can bury the relationships that actually matter. Best practice:

* **Quarterly audits**: Once every three months, prune contacts you haven’t engaged in a year, merge duplicates, and update job titles. AI enrichment can help, but manual oversight is still necessary.  
* **Post-event sweeps**: After conferences, webinars, or networking weeks, dedicate 30 minutes to tagging and categorizing new contacts. Waiting longer risks forgetting context.  
* **Light weekly checks**: A quick Friday ritual of scanning your “Next Touch” list ensures you stay ahead of nudges instead of reacting late.  

Clay and Folk now offer “smart hygiene” tools that flag outdated emails or catch bounces. Reviews on Capterra highlight that users who stick to a quarterly clean-up cycle report 25–30% higher response rates because they aren’t blasting dead addresses or old roles.

**Combining manual touchpoints with AI-driven follow-ups**

AI should draft, remind, and enrich-but the actual human spark still matters. The best rhythm is a blend:

* **AI handles scale**: auto-drafted warm notes, birthday reminders, contextual nudges.  
* **You handle depth**: voice notes, personal calls, or a shared article with a thoughtful comment.  

For example, your CRM drafts a note: *“Congrats on your promotion to Senior Analyst at XYZ.”* You add: *“I remember when we discussed your first project last year-this must feel like a full-circle moment.”* That single extra line shifts the message from automation to authenticity.

AI should be invisible scaffolding. The recipient should never feel like a bot reached out. Instead, they should feel like you remembered something meaningful, even though it was your system doing the remembering.

**Avoiding over-automation: keeping relationships authentic**

One of the most common pitfalls with AI CRMs is over-automation. If every interaction feels scheduled, contacts eventually sense the pattern. Signs you’re slipping into over-automation:

* You “check in” on exactly the same cadence every quarter, with no variation.  
* Messages are too polished, lacking small imperfections that show humanity.  
* You forget to actually read responses because the system is feeding you the next follow-up.  

Best practice is to leave **intentional gaps** for spontaneity. If your CRM nudges you to check in, don’t always send an email-maybe drop a casual WhatsApp message, comment on their Reddit post, or forward an article they’d actually enjoy. Relationships thrive on variety, not scripts.

**Personal experience** I once let my CRM run on autopilot for three months. It sent polished notes to everyone in my “warm” network, but the replies started to taper off. When I looked back, I realized the problem: everything sounded the same. I shifted to mixing in personal touches-voice notes, quick memes relevant to our shared interests-and the difference was immediate. People don’t mind AI help, but they crave a sense of spontaneity.

**Famous book insight** *Give and Take* by Adam Grant (Chapter 2: “The Peacock and the Panda”). Grant shows that authentic giving-small, tailored gestures-creates deeper relationships than transactional exchanges. AI CRMs can draft and remind, but it’s the personal additions you layer on top that turn contacts into allies.

# Future of Personal CRM with AI

The rise of AI-driven personal CRMs signals a bigger cultural shift: relationships are no longer tracked only in our heads or scattered apps-they’re actively shaped by machine intelligence. In 2025, these tools aren’t just keeping lists; they’re becoming copilots for how we manage careers, friendships, and networks. The open question is how far this evolution will go and whether it will completely replace the manual ways we’ve always managed contacts.

**Will AI CRMs replace traditional contact management entirely?**

Traditional methods-phonebooks, spreadsheets, even Outlook’s built-in contact list-are fast becoming obsolete. AI CRMs don’t just store information; they interpret it. That means:

* Instead of you remembering to follow up, the CRM predicts when to reach out.  
* Instead of blank fields, AI fills profiles with LinkedIn updates, Crunchbase funding data, or recent GitHub contributions.  
* Instead of static contacts, you see dynamic timelines that update automatically.  

That said, replacement isn’t absolute. Many professionals still keep a lightweight manual layer-sticky notes, personal journals, or small reminders-because human memory isn’t just about efficiency, it’s about meaning. The most likely future is a hybrid: AI does the heavy lifting, while humans add nuance.

**How AI copilots are reshaping networking in 2025**

AI copilots have turned networking from reactive to proactive. Instead of scrambling when someone pings you, your CRM whispers, *“It’s been 87 days since you last spoke with Arjun. He just shared an article on AI design ethics.”*

Some trends reshaping networking right now:

* **Context-first introductions**: CRMs now suggest intros between two contacts in your network who might benefit from knowing each other, turning you into a connector at scale.  
* **Emotional intelligence layers**: Sentiment analysis is getting granular-flagging not just positive/negative, but curious, skeptical, enthusiastic. This helps you adjust tone in real-time.  
* **Cross-platform fluency**: AI copilots track you across Gmail, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Reddit, so your network feels consistent instead of fragmented by platform.  

This shift is especially visible in industries like startups, where being the person who follows up *first* or shares the *right* resource can define opportunities.

**Predictions for AI-driven personal productivity tools**

Looking ahead, AI CRMs are likely to merge with broader productivity ecosystems:

* **Unified relationship dashboards**: Instead of separate apps, your personal CRM will be embedded in your calendar, task manager, and even payment apps (UPI, PayPal) to capture every touchpoint.  
* **Proactive nudging**: Instead of reminders, CRMs will draft whole outreach campaigns-reminders, messages, calendar holds-requiring just your approval.  
* **Ethical guardrails**: As public concern over data grows, the best CRMs will differentiate through transparency and compliance, possibly offering local-only AI models to process sensitive data.  
* **Wearable integration**: Smartwatches and AR glasses could soon prompt you in real-time: *“This is Meera, you last met at the Bangalore product meetup. She mentioned working on fintech APIs.”*  

The future of AI personal CRMs isn’t just about managing people you already know-it’s about augmenting your ability to build, sustain, and deepen networks without exhausting your mental bandwidth.

**Personal experience** Earlier this year, I tested an early beta of an AI CRM that plugged directly into my calendar and Slack. During a coffee meeting, it popped up a quick card with the person’s recent blog posts and their company’s hiring news. That 20-second glance completely shifted the quality of my conversation-I asked about their open roles, and they later invited me to collaborate. It felt like having a research assistant whispering just enough to keep me sharp.

**Famous book insight** *The Second Machine Age* by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (Chapter 6: “Artificial and Human Intelligence in the Digital Age”). The authors argue that machines excel at prediction while humans excel at judgment. AI CRMs embody this balance-predicting who, when, and how to connect, while leaving the judgment of *why* and *what to say* firmly in human hands.



# FAQ

# What is the easiest no-code AI CRM for beginners?

For beginners, **Dex** and **Folk** are the most user-friendly options in 2025. Dex focuses on simple reminders and timelines-you don’t need to be tech-savvy to get started. Folk offers drag-and-drop boards similar to Trello or Notion, which makes it easy to visually manage relationships. Both integrate with Gmail and calendars out of the box, and neither requires advanced automation setup. Reviews on Trustpilot highlight that users often get value within the first week of adoption.

# Are AI CRMs safe for storing personal contact data?

Most modern AI CRMs prioritize security because they know trust is a dealbreaker. As of mid-2025, the safer tools include features like **AES-256 encryption at rest**, **TLS encryption in transit**, and clear GDPR-compliant data policies. Some open-source CRMs, like Monica, even allow you to self-host so your data never leaves your server. That said, safety depends on the vendor’s transparency. Always check where their servers are hosted, how they train their AI models, and whether they undergo independent audits. BuiltWith or WHOIS lookups can help verify a tool’s infrastructure before you commit.

# Can AI tools really improve long-term networking outcomes?

Yes, when used correctly. AI tools don’t replace relationship-building-they **amplify consistency**. By remembering context, nudging you at the right time, and drafting personalized follow-ups, they prevent opportunities from slipping through cracks. For example, predictive nudges ensure you reconnect with mentors or clients before they forget the conversation. Over a year, this consistency compounds into stronger networks, better career opportunities, and more reliable collaborations. As Adam Grant suggests in *Give and Take*, relationships thrive on thoughtful, repeated giving. AI CRMs simply make those gestures more sustainable at scale.

**Personal experience** When I first tried Clay, I was skeptical. But after six months, I noticed patterns: people responded faster, conversations picked up where they left off, and introductions flowed more naturally. The AI wasn’t “doing networking” for me-it was keeping the threads alive so I could show up consistently. That consistency alone created new freelance gigs and collaborations I would have otherwise missed.

**Famous book insight** *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (Part 1, Chapter 1). Kahneman explains how human memory is prone to forgetting and bias. AI CRMs counter that by serving as an external “System 2,” making sure the slow, deliberate side of networking-remembering, planning, following up-doesn’t fail due to human error.",1,1758286607.0,AiReviewInsider,0,1.0,False

Live full time in a van so dont pay rent or bills however finding it hard to complete my goals due to my limited income.

Trying to pay off a 10k personal loan and save up for a house deposit

I live very frugally generally, and don't want to sacrifice my morning coffee and/or having good food and as I live in the van that's already quite a big sacrifice so I mostly just get a coffee and pastry for lunch and I'll cook for dinner (I only eat twice a day) so not super expensive but I could save more by not eating out but oh well. I also dont have any subscription services and cut my own hair and wash all my own clothes by hand in the sink at the gym. I really dont spend money other than food.

So whilst my frugality is good im still finding it taking years to get anywhere. 

My dad died at 38 of a very aggressive cancer that can be hereditary and he never travelled.

I dont want to buy before I feel like im well travelled however every day our government introduces more policies that are only going to inflate even studio apartments outside my budget before I can buy.

Its this constant battle of wanting to feel like ive lived enough but also this fear or missing out on buying a place.

I dont know how to prioritize anything first and I feel like ive reached my income bracket for my education level and dont feel like i can get much more than my current 86k at this stage in my career but I am actively applying within my company.

I want to do uber eats in my van for extra income (ive applied for hundreds of late night cleaning and bar jobs but think my current availability is a huge issue as im only free from like 8pm to 2am) but I also dont want to further depreciate my current ""home"" by driving it and doing deliveries.

I suppose my question is is it worth doing uber eats in the van that is also my home? Or is that not a good idea for additional income? I literally just cannot think of any other way of making more money apart from becoming an escort and dont think i have what that takes unfortunately haha.

I'm looking for some help with my Philips fully automatic coffee machine. It has recently started leaking, but not in a typical way.

It seems like some of the water is bypassing the internal drip tray completely. It runs down somewhere inside the machine and then pools on the counter underneath it. As you can see from the photos, it has already started to damage my wooden countertop.

Before I send the machine in for service or try to open it up myself, I wanted to ask if this is a known issue or if anyone has an idea what might be causing it.

Any advice on what I could check would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.",1,1758286318.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

That was when I first discovered LOA and then Neville.

At first It felt the same but it took some time to really understand what neville was actually saying.I was infact in a very bad phase at that point that anything I did was almost felt so desperate .

My wants became a need,to a point that I would sit and try to do every possible action to make it happen.

After a few months I did put the law into test and surprisingly I did get some results.  
I started listing out my small desires on my notepad every morning to start my day..

Things like :  
\-Iam getting a free cup of coffee (easiest and most fun to test in case you are a beginner)  
\-An old friend reached out to me  
\-A new client enquiry  
\-Compliments from women  
\-Invites to events

And much more.  
This almost became like a ritual and It did work! Later down the lane,I started desiring bigger.And i started creating scripts and imaginal acts with respect to that.

And it was time to revisit my desire at this point.  
This time,I wasnt so desperate but felt natural to ""feel the feelings"" of the scene.

I would have did it for like couple of days and I almost lost interest in the desire itself.  
I noticed my beliefs and habits radically shifted overnight (I talked about this in one of my comments that before receiving some bigger desires, my entire personal identity changed that it almost freaked me out)

In just two days people started noticing the difference.  
I felt so much conviction in my desire that day that I can already feel the sum of money in possession.

That evening,  
\-I stopped checking my phone if a new client called  
\-Ghosted almost all of my friends  
\-Didnt respond to any calls  
\-didnt have much interest to my lower pleasures (Vices basically)

All i desired was ""Silence"" ...  
From words,actions,even thoughts.

I'm not sure if that is the actual IAM state but I was craving so much silence that I shut my door and sat for like 2 hours in silence.

tears came down my eyes,I started feeling ecstatic for no reason.  
Once I got up ,  
I literally felt like i was reborn.

In 3 days my desire came into fruition and I changed completely as a person from that day.

I would say it is the thoughts which stopped me from myself getting the desire.learned the hardway.

I'll see you in the next one,  
Much Love,

I thanked them and went back to my seat, took a bite of my meal, and found myself smiling from ear to ear. It hit me then—I’m truly grateful that I even get to enjoy McDo from time to time.

After breakfast, I went back to my acads, thankful that I get to study in a good university where my main concern is just to learn. Later, I felt grateful again—this time for the chance to watch live volleyball games with my friends, for Kuya Moveit who drove me home safely and helped me with so much, and for the video call with my parents where I felt their love even from afar.

Gratitude kept piling up in small, simple moments.

As someone building a specialty coffee project in the U.S. focused on Panama origins, I’m curious what the community thinks: 

Are these prices a net positive (raising awareness, elevating specialty coffee, prestige effect)? Or do they hurt the industry by making specialty coffee look overpriced and inaccessible for most consumers?

Personally, I see both sides. On one hand, it’s amazing press for Panama coffee and proves there’s real demand for high-end origin lots. On the other, most consumers already think specialty coffee is “too expensive,” so headlines like this might reinforce that perception.

Alt text: Professional business people in a meeting, Bahrain company formation context., sipping cardamom-heavy qahwa served by the building’s porter, I realized mistakes here could mean weeks of delay. Even with my years helping others, Bahrain’s documentation rules stood out for their mix of hospitality, precision, and rapidly changing requirements.\
Surprisingly, by 2025, Bahrain’s stance on attestation—especially in the context of foreign ownership and swift digital processes—has shifted more than you might expect. Regulatory tweaks, global investor influx, and a push for regional competitiveness drive these changes, placing new demands on anyone eyeing Bahrain company formation.\

Bahrain Business Environment 2025: Landscape, Opportunity, and Change\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain corporate district., Bahrain’s economy expanded by 2.7% in the first quarter of 2025, outperforming much of the Gulf. The EDB’s investment drive (BHD 482 million inbound in Q1 2025) added more than 4,000 new jobs, with fintech, logistics, and tourism driving fresh business registrations.\
The country’s strategic position and liberal approach—99% foreign ownership in most sectors, as per the Economic Development Board—give it the edge over UAE’s more restrictive mainland company setups or Saudi’s heavier Saudization requirements. New free zones (Bahrain Logistics Zone, Bahrain Investment Wharf) tempt investors with simplified customs and full repatriation of profits. And even in 2025, Bahrain’s famed business majlis etiquette—informal coffee-led networking, family connections, and Ramadan hour shifts—sometimes matters as much as paperwork precision!\
For more context, major international sources like Forbes Business are spotlighting Bahrain’s pivot to “digital-by-default” government services and the kingdom’s rapid climb in Middle East Ease of Doing Business rankings.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Foreign Document Attestation Requirements Explained\
What is Attestation? Why Does It Matter?\
Attestation (sometimes referred to as legalization or apostille) certifies that a foreign document—like a certificate of incorporation, board resolution, or even a passport copy—is genuine, valid, and recognized by Bahrain’s authorities. For cross-border company formation, this step ties legal trustworthiness to your home country’s paperwork.\
The Law in 2025: What’s Changed?\
Importantly, in February 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) adjusted its Commercial Registration guidance: foreign documents for non-resident directors, shareholders, or parent entities must be attested up to the Bahrain embassy in the issuing country—then submitted for final validation to Bahrain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes:\
\
Certificates of incorporation (if setting up as a subsidiary)\
Power of attorney (if appointing a local representative)\
Board resolutions authorizing company formation\
Foreign ID/passport copies (sometimes for UBO checks)\
Financial statements (if required by EDB, Tamkeen, or regulatory authorities)\
\
However, if your country is a Hague Apostille Convention member, a valid apostille stamp may suffice—except for regulated sectors (finance, insurance, labor supply), where full embassy attestation is still enforced.\
I once encountered a frantic investor in Bahrain Bay who’d overlooked the need for embassy-level attestation of their parent company’s registration documents. Their UAE-based consultant had assumed apostille alone was enough. The resulting paperwork scramble delayed their launch by a month (and nearly cost them a major logistics contract with a Manama-based client).\
\
Types of Companies in Bahrain: Entity Structures and Attestation Demands\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration for company setup in Bahrain.: Most common among small-to-mid foreign owners. If foreign shareholders, their ID and corporate docs must be attested.\
- BSC (Closed or Public Joint Stock Company): Heavier document stack. Parent company resolutions and audited accounts (all attested if foreign) are standard.\
- Branch of Foreign Company: The head office’s incorporation certificate, articles, and authorization letters—every page must go through attestation.\
- Single Person Company (SPC): Easier if the sole shareholder is resident; harder if based overseas (attestation again required).\
- Free Zone Entity:** Rules are laxer for some zones, but Bahrain Logistics Zone typically enforces MOICT’s current attestation protocol.\
See Bahrain business type structures for specifics on each entity and related documentation tips.\
\
Step-by-Step: Document Attestation and Company Registration in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow.\
* Foreign shareholder/UBO passports\
* Board or shareholder resolutions\
* Financial statements/audited accounts (for regulated activities)\
Step 2: Get Documents Notarized Locally\
Your local notary authenticates the documents. Some countries require specific notary certifications compatible with the Hague Convention. Double-check for multi-lingual notary seals if your documents are not in English or Arabic.\
Step 3: Legalization by Foreign Affairs, Embassy, and Bahrain Authorities\
\
Submit notarized docs to your country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for authentication.\
Next, visit the Bahrain embassy for consular attestation (fees typically BHD 25-75 per document).\
Arriving in Bahrain, present these at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs counter in the Diplomatic Area or Seef. There’s often a same-day processing option (BHD 20–40) that saves time, especially if you queue before 9 AM—locals often take coffee breaks after 10 AM, so early birds avoid the lunch rush.\
\
Document preparation shortcut: If you’re dealing with a multi-lingual board, agree on one official document language—preferably English—before commissioning translations for attestation. Bahrain authorities are strict on consistency: mismatched language versions will be rejected and require re-attestation.\
Step 4: Submit to Sijilat for Company Registration\
Sijilat is Bahrain’s unified e-government portal (MOICT link). Upload all attested documents here; originals may be requested at the final licensing appointment. Don’t overlook digital signature registration, which is mandatory for company representatives.\
Step 5: LMRA, Tamkeen, and Regulatory Follow-ups\
If hiring foreign staff, the LMRA requires attested employment contracts and, for some sectors, proof of parent company support (again, attested at embassy level). Tamkeen often requests attested financial documentation for grant applications.\
See the official Bahrain company formation process for further details.\

Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Attestation and Registration in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.      |\
|---------------------------|------------------|\
| Local Notary              | 25-50            |\
| Foreign Affairs Auth.     | 30-70            |\
| Bahrain Embassy           | 25-75            |\
| Min. of Foreign Affairs   | 20-40            |\
Total per document: BHD 100-200 (multi-step process, courier fees extra if overseas).\
\
Budget tip: Bundle all documents for attestation in one go. Embassies sometimes discount for batches of 3+.\
Money-saving hack: Use reputable Bahrain-based document agents; they consolidate MOFA appointments and offer queue-jumping for a fee—my go-to firm in Seef District saved me half a day at least once a month.\
Optimal application timing: File before Ramadan or Bahraini public holidays—processing times double during these periods due to reduced working hours and heavy family obligations among government staff. And, submit docs early Monday to beat the mid-week rush.\

\
Regulatory Compliance: Common Mistakes, Insider Fixes, and Recent 2025 Updates\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain registration.. Too many entrepreneurs relied on outdated advice and saw their applications frozen.\
How I beat this:\
- Directly confirming requirements with the Sijilat help desk before each new application.\
- Subscribing to the MOICT, Gulf News Bahrain section, and KeyLinkBH’s regulatory updates so I never miss policy shifts.\
Networking During Regulatory Hurdles\
Often, relationships matter as much as correct paperwork. Bahrain’s business culture still thrives on introductions—fixing a minor documentation glitch over a quick majlis coffee at Bahrain Bay can open doors faster than a dozen emails. (Once, I sorted a last-minute company name amendment sitting cross-legged on a majlis cushion with an MOICT supervisor—who then expedited my client’s file as a favor.)\
Insider prevention strategies:\
- Always clarify document language requirements upfront.\
- Pre-book MOFA appointment slots via Sijilat for faster turnarounds.\
- Use local sponsorship services for regulated sectors where extra attestation evidence may be needed.\
Post-formation tip: Don’t neglect ongoing compliance. Bahrain’s accounting and bookkeeping services often require attested board resolutions for annual filings and banking—set up reminders for all recurring documents.\
\
Ownership, Activities, and Alternatives: Navigating Bahrain’s Foreign-Friendly Rules\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain. and 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain, make it regionally exceptional. But with this flexibility comes the need for extra documentary proof if board members or UBOs are overseas entities.\
\
For most trading, consulting, tech, and e-commerce setups, attested documentation is the final major hurdle to 100% foreign ownership.\
Regulated sectors (banking, insurance, labor supply) need enhanced diligence—expect additional attested compliance docs and periodic renewals.\
\
Comparison: UAE vs. Bahrain\
Unlike UAE mainland, where foreign owners often need a local Emirati partner, Bahrain’s model slashes barriers. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has eased the ownership route but still applies strict Saudization and documentation policies for foreign directors. Bahrain’s lighter touch (and English-friendly digital systems) wins for most global SMEs.\
For activity-specific, up-to-date guidance, check authoritative government resources and reliable partners with a Bahrain office presence.\
\
Tangent: Why I Love Registering Companies at Seef District (and How It Saved My Last Client)\
Walking into Seef District’s main Sijilat office, you feel plugged into Bahrain’s business heartbeat. The staff know the quirks of foreign document requirements better than almost anywhere else (case files handled: 250+ per day). Last year, during a Ramadan rush, my client’s courier-delivered attested documents from Canada were delayed by customs. I called in a favor with a local document agent, who met me at the office at 7:30 AM—with extra copies already Arabic-translated and certified on standby. We dodged a five-day wait just by being early and friendly with the right staff (pro tip: always bring pastries during Ramadan).\
Surprisingly, this kind of flexibility and relationship-building isn’t just cultural—it’s practical, and it regularly keeps company launches on track.\
\
FAQ: Foreign Documents & Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Do I need to attest every foreign document for registering a company in Bahrain?\
\
Usually yes for corporate/shareholder documents, but requirements depend on activity and entity (see company formation process). Apostille may suffice for some sectors, but embassy/Bahrain MOFA attestation is now standard for most.\
\
2. How long does attestation take, and can I finish it after arriving in Bahrain?\
\
Embassy + MOFA steps can take 1-2 weeks abroad, but Bahrain-side validation is usually 1-2 days (faster with an agent). Always start before traveling; delays locally during public holidays are common.\
\
3. Does Bahrain accept digital or scanned versions of attested documents?\
\
Sijilat accepts digital uploads for initial reviews, but you must present physical attested copies during final licensing or bank account opening stages.\
\
4. What’s the cost difference if using a local agent for attestation?\
\
Agent fees (typically BHD 50-100 per bundle) can save on courier costs, reduce queues, and spot errors before submission (see company formation costs).\
\
5. Is attestation required for ongoing compliance or just the setup phase?\
\
Common for annual meetings, board resolutions, and certain regulatory filings—especially if foreign shareholders or directors change (detailed at accounting and bookkeeping services).\
\
\
Bottom line:\
Attestation of foreign documents isn’t just a bureaucratic tick-box in Bahrain’s company registration—it’s a crucial step that, if fumbled, can stall your launch, eat up budgets, and damage credibility. Master the process, use insider tips, and always build relationships with those who can smooth your path at the Sijilat counter or the local embassy desk. For those who do, Bahrain’s dynamic, foreign-friendly business landscape is full of opportunity.\

What did that look like for you? Were you able to get off of hypoallergenic formula or breastfeed after a diagnosis?

My 10 week LO is suspected to have a milk intolerance, but I’m now wondering if she has an allergy or intolerance to something else. When breastfeeding/pumping she would scream for 11+ hours a day for weeks, completely inconsolable, it was absolutely heartbreaking and horrible for everybody involved. After talking with her pediatrician, it was suggested that she go on a hypoallergenic formula for 2-3 weeks until I can get dairy out of my system. I stopped eating dairy, pumped every few hours to keep my supply, and donated all of the milk. We ended up waiting 4 weeks no dairy to switch back, but my LO immediately was not doing well again. Screaming, gassy, stomach gargling, grabbing at face a lot, diarrhea. We stopped with the breastmilk and brought this up again at her 2 month check up. Our ped gave us a VERY slow and conservative schedule to follow to reintroduce BM in hopes that easing into it would help. 0.5 oz in one bottle for a few days, 0.5 oz in two bottles for a few days, 0.5 oz in three bottles for a few days, etc etc etc. We are currently doing just that- we’re on 0.5 oz in three out of her seven bottles and it’s not going well. With the little amount she’s having, she isn’t full on screaming or overly upset, but it’s obvious she’s very uncomfortable. She gets very gassy and throws her body around until we can help her burp or fart. Her stomach continues to make a bunch of noise and it takes about 30 minutes of burping and soothing for her to stop squirming after her meal. She stopped sleeping in 7-7.5 hour stretches and will only sleep for 2-3 hours at a time at night.

At this point I’m not really sure where to go from here, it doesn’t seem right that 1.5/24-28 oz a day is causing issues. The 0.5-1 oz of BM a day seemed fine, but it’s been a few days (probably closer to 4-5 honestly) on 1.5 oz and it hasn’t gotten better. I can’t tell if it’s something she needs to get used to, though it seems to be maybe something else aside from the dairy? My diet is fairly boring. I don’t consume a lot of soy, don’t eat greasy or fast foods, focus on protein and veggies, and have one or two coffees a day. Before we switched to formula, she was bottle fed BM due to a poor latch (though her lip tie has since been fixed). She also has reflux and is on meds for it.

Has anyone else been through something similar? I’m having a hard time trying to find any information or guidance. I would obviously love to breastfeed again but whatever is best for my LO is what’s most important.",1,1758285973.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

Important because now I think she's just wanting to be friends so she can get a permanent position in the company. She kept wanting to meet in office which I wasn't going to initially. Eventually I started showing up and we would go to lunch together or like coffee breaks. It felt nice as opposed to not having human interaction, she occasionally asked very uncomfortable questions about my pay grade or bonus...and I just dismissed this as a bit immature or impulsive (based on her travel stories etc).

Anyways I didn't mind because I see her for like a total of 2 hours a week maybe. 

Then for the past 3 weeks or so she got a bit more close..like wanting to sit next to each other whole day.. which I was ok with. And I felt good and thought maybe we could be good friends despite my discomfort at some questions. But she kept saying some other girl has been ignoring her and then it flashed that that's probably why she's been wanting to hang out whole day. 

She's a bit unprofessional and doesn't seem to worry about her job and my OCPD self sort of looks down on that 😔. She started opening up about her spontaneous travel with her boyfriend, drama with her teammates etc. and all this within 2 days of us hanging out whole work day.

1nl2hu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1nl2hu5/sanity_checkam_i_controlling/,Sanity check/Am I controlling?,"My (43m) wife (44f) had a mostly emotional affair about a year ago, D-day was 8/24. She said it was because of self-esteem issues and always feeling ugly and it was nice to feel seen etc. I never really cared who she hung out with or what she wore back then, never thought that she could betray me like that. Really messed me up and I’m still not OK, trying to manage. We are reconciling and I guess from the outside we seem OK.

We talked a lot obviously, and one of the issues in our marriage was that we didn’t really do much outside of the house on our own. I kind of lost contact with all of my male friends over time and we both became pretty boring people. We’ve been together for about 20 years, married for 17, and after a while you kind of run out of things to talk about if you don’t have a life outside of the house. 

So tonight she’s going to hang out with her girl friend and go to a coffee place and then go back to this girl’s house to hang out and drink. This morning I had some shitty intrusive thoughts that maybe this other girl is going to invite over some guys and my wife is going to be really flirty and drunk. It just kind of came out of nowhere. A little backstory is that my wife occasionally runs into some guy while she’s at work, she doesn’t really know him, but apparently he is friends with some of my friends and that’s how they got to talking. From what I understand they really just run into each other occasionally and say hi. My wife didn’t know this guy’s name up until about a month ago and as soon as she learned his name she looked him up on Facebook and then talked to this girl friend about him the last time they hung out. She said her friend described him as “ really sweet”. When she first started running into him, she asked me if I knew him too. I don’t know. I just get this vibe that she has a little crush on him, wouldn’t have thought this stuff before the whole cheating incident, but I’m in hypervigilant mode all the time it seems. 

My wife used to dress pretty modestly and it feels like over the past year She’s dressed more sexy? Like trying to attract attention. She has one shirt that’s really low-cut and kind of a belly shirt and wears it to work sometimes which I think is weird because she works for the government. She always says she feels like she’s fat in it but it doesn’t stop her from wearing it. 

So part of my intrusive thought this morning was that she was going to wear this shirt to work and then go out tonight , and that she’s wearing it to attract male attention. Lo and behold, she totally put that shirt on before she left for work, so part one of my intrusive thought came true.

I know I’m rambling but basically I can’t get it out of my head that she is wearing this shirt to get mail attention and that she’s going to encourage this girl to invite this guy over tonight and get drunk and be flirty and God knows what else. Her previous affair started in a similar way, some guy she ran into occasionally who eventually added her on Facebook and they started talking.

So am I crazy for thinking these things?  Am I overly controlling for feeling weird about her trying to dress attractively when she’s going out tonight?  Is there any kind of rule we could set that would make me feel better?  I just feel like an asshole, wouldn’t have cared about any of these things before.",8,1758285691.0,survivinginfidelity,12,0.84,False

Important because now I think she's just wanting to be friends so she can get a permanent position in the company. She kept wanting to meet in office which I wasn't going to initially. Eventually I started showing up and we would go to lunch together or like coffee breaks. It felt nice as opposed to not having human interaction, she occasionally asked very uncomfortable questions about my pay grade or bonus...and I just dismissed this as a bit immature or impulsive (based on her travel stories etc).

Anyways I didn't mind because I see her for like a total of 2 hours a week maybe. 

Then for the past 3 weeks or so she got a bit more close..like wanting to sit next to each other whole day.. which I was ok with. And I felt good and thought maybe we could be good friends despite my discomfort at some questions. But she kept saying some other girl has been ignoring her and then it flashed that that's probably why she's been wanting to hang out whole day. 

She's a bit unprofessional and doesn't seem to worry about her job and my OCPD self sort of looks down on that 😔. She started opening up about her spontaneous travel with her boyfriend, drama with her teammates etc. and all this within 2 days of us hanging out whole work day. 

So I stopped showing up to work again and now she won't respond to my work related email (her job!)

[**Canadians are taking a big step back from the U.S. — and here's the data to prove it**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-big-step-back-from-us-data-1.7637651). Data shows Canadians are significantly reducing ties with the U.S. following Trump's tariffs and trade war rhetoric, with travel cratering, exports declining, and consumer habits shifting away from American goods. Canadian visits to the U.S. have dropped 34% by car and 25.4% by air, while exports to non-U.S. countries have surged. The grassroots ""Buy Canadian"" campaign has reshaped retail landscapes, with grocers dropping U.S. products and adding dozens of domestic suppliers. There are even signs of cultural shifts, with increased viewership for Canadian content and rising support for Canadian institutions including the monarchy.

[**6 in 10 Canadians say they can never trust Americans the same way again**](https://globalnews.ca/news/11435168/ipsos-polling-canada-us-relationship/). An exclusive Ipsos poll for Global News reveals that 60% of Canadians say they can never trust Americans the same way again following months of Trump's tariffs and trade disputes with Canada. The polling shows 71% of Canadians believe these Canada-U.S. disputes will continue for several years and won't be resolved soon, reflecting what Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker described as a ""fundamental"" change in the relationship. While 51% approve of Prime Minister Mark Carney's handling of U.S. relations, only 42% believe he will succeed in negotiating a new trade deal with the Trump administration. The polling, conducted September 9-12, 2025, also found that the negative U.S. perception has coincided with renewed Canadian patriotism, with 47% saying they're more likely to feel proud to be Canadian than five years ago.

[**U.S. ambassador 'disappointed' with anti-American sentiment in Canada**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/us-ambassador-to-canada-disappointed-anti-american-campaign-1.7637534). U.S. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra expressed frustration over anti-American sentiment in Canada, criticizing what he called an ""anti-American campaign"" by Canadian politicians following Trump's tariffs. Hoekstra took issue with Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne describing the situation as a ""war"" and said such language is dangerous. The ambassador defended Trump's tariff agenda by arguing that other countries face higher rates than Canada, claiming Canada's ""relative position has improved."" Despite ongoing trade tensions, Hoekstra expressed optimism that a trade deal could eventually be reached.

[**Canada, Mexico agree to deepen ties in face of Trump's turbulent 2nd term**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-mexico-agree-new-partnership-1.7637709). Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum signed a ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" to deepen bilateral ties as both countries navigate uncertainty during Trump's second presidency. The agreement focuses on developing trade and security relationships, infrastructure investment, and climate initiatives, with Mexico expressing interest in Canada building ports and trade corridors. Both leaders emphasized their commitment to the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and rejected suggestions of pursuing separate bilateral deals with the U.S. The partnership comes as CUSMA faces a mandatory review next year, with Canada expected to launch formal consultations soon.

[**Carney says Mexican gangs operating in Canada 'and vice versa,' vows action**](https://globalnews.ca/news/11435778/carney-mexico-cartels-gangs-security-cooperation/). Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged that Mexican drug cartels operate in Canada while also admitting that ""Canadian gangs operate in Mexico,"" emphasizing the need for enhanced bilateral cooperation to combat transnational organized crime. Speaking alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico City, Carney announced a new comprehensive strategic partnership aimed at strengthening trade and security ties, including deepened surveillance and police cooperation. The comments come amid U.S. tariffs justified by concerns over cross-border fentanyl trafficking, with Canada recently declaring several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations following the U.S. lead. Recent reports indicate that Canadian organized crime groups manufacturing fentanyl are actively engaged with Latin American cartels, while Canadian law enforcement has dismantled multiple ""super laboratories"" in British Columbia producing drugs for international distribution.

[**Conservatives, Liberals spar over competing visions of bail reform**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bail-reform-1.7637352). Conservative and Liberal MPs clashed in the House of Commons over bail reform, with the Conservatives introducing a motion for a ""three-strikes-and-you're-out"" law targeting repeat violent offenders. Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre argued that Liberal laws have created a ""catch-and-release"" justice system allowing criminals to repeatedly reoffend, while targeting the 2019 Bill C-75's ""principle of restraint"" for bail conditions. Liberal MPs promised to introduce their own stricter bail legislation this fall, with Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree arguing that three-strike laws ""don't work"" and have been failures in U.S. jurisdictions. The Conservatives also introduced a private member's bill targeting intimate partner violence with enhanced Criminal Code provisions.

[**Government to table bill Friday criminalizing use of certain symbols to promote hate**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hate-symbols-bill-1.7636559). The Liberal government is introducing legislation Friday to criminalize the intentional promotion of hatred against identifiable groups using specific symbols like swastikas or those associated with terrorist entities including Hamas and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The bill would also remove requirements for provincial attorney general consent to lay hate propaganda charges, streamlining the prosecution process. The legislation builds on previous promises to address rising hate incidents in Canada, with police-reported hate crimes increasing from 2,646 in 2020 to 4,882 in 2024. Critics worry about potential Charter rights violations, but Justice Minister Sean Fraser says the government has balanced free speech protections with public safety imperatives.

[**NATO deterrence mission in Latvia drains the Canadian Army's fleet of vehicles**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-canadian-army-latvia-military-vehicles-1.7637922). The Canadian Army lacks sufficient vehicles to support both the NATO brigade in Latvia and similar-sized training exercises in Canada, with over 400 vehicles deployed to the Baltic deterrence mission. Military officials defended the controversial decision to shift combined arms training from Wainwright, Alberta to Latvia, arguing it provides real-world conditions and deterrence effects. However, the move has created training challenges, with internal documents revealing soldiers lacked proper training venues and had to rely on ""academic approaches"" to preparations. Critical spare parts shortages have forced the brigade to park vehicles including Leopard 2A4 tanks, though recent budget commitments of $9.3 billion are helping address supply chain issues.

[**Federal government pulls plug on home retrofit loan program**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-greener-homes-cghl-retrofit-1.7636591). The federal government is ending the Canada Greener Homes Loan program on October 1, 2025, citing that funding will soon be fully allocated after more than 120,000 loans totaling $2.9 billion were committed since May 2021. The program offered interest-free loans between $5,000 and $40,000 for energy efficiency upgrades like insulation, window replacement, and heat pumps. Energy efficiency experts warn the abrupt cancellation will disrupt businesses, eliminate skilled trade jobs, and break consumer trust, especially after the popular Greener Homes Grant was cancelled last year. The federal government continues offering some targeted programs for affordable housing and oil-to-heat pump conversions, with a limited replacement program currently only available in Manitoba.

[**Eby criticizes Smith's pipeline push, says feds' treatment of B.C. ferry passengers unfair**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/eby-smith-carney-pipeline-ferries-1.7637233). B.C. Premier David Eby criticized the federal government's unequal treatment of ferry passengers, noting B.C. ferry users receive only $1 in federal subsidies compared to $300 for eastern ferry users. Eby expressed frustration that Ottawa pays to build ferries for Atlantic Canada while only offering B.C. a low-interest loan, highlighting constitutional differences where eastern ferries connect provinces while B.C. ferries serve intra-provincial routes. He also warned that Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's aggressive pipeline advocacy is premature and risky, arguing there's no actual project, private proponent, or First Nations support for her proposed oilsands-to-coast pipeline. Eby suggested Smith's push could jeopardize tens of billions of dollars worth of existing projects in B.C. that depend on First Nations partnerships.

[**Former justice minister David Lametti named Canada's UN ambassador**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/david-lametti-canada-un-rep-1.7637462). Prime Minister Mark Carney officially appointed David Lametti as Canada's next ambassador to the United Nations, replacing Bob Rae on November 17. Lametti, who served as justice minister under Justin Trudeau from 2019 to 2023 and resigned from Parliament in 2024, had been working as Carney's principal secretary in the Prime Minister's Office. The former Liberal MP played hockey with Carney at Oxford University, and his appointment is part of Carney's mandate to strengthen and diversify Canada's international partnerships. Carney also announced Vera Alexander as Canada's next ambassador to Germany, replacing John Horgan who died last year.

[**Canada Post sending new offers to union after ban on flyer deliveries**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-post-union-new-global-offers-1.7637402). Canada Post is sending new contract offers to the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) following the union's implementation of a flyer delivery ban that began Monday. The Crown corporation hopes the new terms will allow both sides to return to bargaining next week, as pressure mounts with the holiday season approaching. CUPW, representing 55,000 postal workers, shifted from an overtime ban to the flyer ban and will ""thoroughly examine"" the offers while continuing the delivery restrictions. The two sides have been in contract talks for almost two years over wages and part-time workers, with negotiations complicated by Canada Post's ongoing financial losses and memories of last year's month-long strike and lockout during the crucial holiday period.

[**19-year-old charged in massive international extortion case**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/us115m-in-ransom-rcmp-aid-in-international-extortion-case-dubbed-scattered-spider/). The U.S. Department of Justice has charged Thalha Jubair, a 19-year-old U.K. national, with leading roles in the notorious Scattered Spider cybercrime group's international extortion campaign that targeted at least 47 U.S. victims and generated over $115 million in ransom payments. Jubair, operating under aliases including ""EarthtoStar"" and ""Austin,"" participated in approximately 120 network intrusions from May 2022 to September 2025, including attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure and court systems. The RCMP aided in the investigation alongside international partners targeting this cybercrime group known for sophisticated social engineering tactics including phishing, SIM-swapping, and fraudulent helpdesk calls. Authorities seized $36 million in cryptocurrency and identified another $8.4 million that Jubair allegedly transferred to evade seizure, with the case highlighting escalating international cooperation against major cybercrime operations.

[**Alberta to use notwithstanding clause on its three transgender laws: memo**](https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/alberta-to-use-notwithstanding-clause-on-three-transgender-laws/). Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has directed officials to invoke the Charter's notwithstanding clause on three laws affecting transgender people, according to a leaked government memo obtained by The Canadian Press. The September 10 internal document from the justice department outlines plans to amend legislation governing school pronoun rules, transgender sports participation, and gender-affirming healthcare to operate ""notwithstanding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."" The plan involves briefing Smith and bringing the proposal to cabinet on October 21, with the legislative session resuming two days later. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale and Skipping Stone are currently challenging these laws in court as discriminatory, with one law already under a temporary court injunction that prevents doctors from providing gender-affirming treatment to youth under 16.

[**NYC Democrats detained by DHS in Manhattan near immigration courts**](https://www.newsweek.com/ice-nyc-democrats-detained-immigration-court-sit-2132188). City Comptroller Brad Lander, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and several Democratic New York elected officials were detained by Department of Homeland Security agents Thursday during a protest at federal immigration courts in Lower Manhattan. The group staged a sit-in outside holding cells for immigrants at 26 Federal Plaza, demanding access to the lockup and being denied entry before their arrests, with Lander facing his second detention at the facility since June. State legislators including Senators Julia Salazar and Jabari Brisport, along with multiple Assembly members, were also arrested after protesters blocked ICE vans and demanded release of all detained at the facility. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Lander's ""obsession with attacking law enforcement,"" citing a 1000% surge in assaults on ICE officers, while officials argued they were conducting oversight to ensure compliance with a court-ordered preliminary injunction requiring improved detention conditions

[**House to vote on stopgap funding bill, but health care fight threatens a shutdown**](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545929/house-stopgap-funding-bill-government-shutdown). House Republicans are working to prevent a government shutdown with a Friday vote on legislation funding federal agencies through November 21 and boosting security for officials, but Democrats are threatening to oppose the bill over health care provisions. Democrats argue that millions relying on expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies risk losing coverage if Congress fails to act, with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries calling it a ""partisan spending bill."" Trump has backed the Republican measure on Truth Social, urging GOP lawmakers to stick together against ""Radical Left Democrat demands,"" but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats won't provide the 60 votes needed in the Senate. The health care dispute represents a departure from past practice where Democrats regularly supported continuing resolutions to keep government funded.

[**Trump suggests FCC could revoke licenses of TV broadcasters that give him too much 'bad publicity'**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-fcc-revoke-tv-broadcast-licenses-over-bad-publicity-rcna232339). President Trump suggested Thursday that TV broadcasters could lose their federal licenses over perceived negative coverage, telling reporters that late-night hosts who are ""against me"" and give him ""only bad publicity"" should potentially have their licenses revoked by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Trump argued that evening network shows that ""hit Trump"" are ""licensed"" and ""not allowed to do that"" because they're ""an arm of the Democrat Party,"" speaking a day after praising ABC for suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! following criticism over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination. House Democratic leaders led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called on Carr to resign, accusing him of ""corrupt abuse of power"" and describing the situation as Trump and Republicans' ""war on the First Amendment."" The FCC licenses individual broadcast stations but not TV networks, with stations required to operate in the ""public interest, convenience and necessity"" in exchange for using public airwaves.

[**Senate confirms 48 Trump nominees at once, including Kimberly Guilfoyle and Callista Gingrich**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirms-48-trump-nominees-kimberly-guilfoyle-callista-gingrich-rcna231946). The Senate confirmed 48 of President Trump's nominees in a single party-line vote of 51-47 on Thursday after Republicans triggered the ""nuclear option"" to bypass the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming nominees in batches. The confirmed nominees include former Rep. Brandon Williams as undersecretary of energy for nuclear security, former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece, and Callista Gingrich as ambassador to both Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Senate Majority Leader John Thune accused Democrats of unprecedented obstruction and slow-walking of Trump nominees, calling it a ""broken process"" that made the Senate dysfunctional, while Democrats argued Trump brought additional scrutiny on himself by choosing ""historically bad nominees"" and unqualified loyalists. The rule change allows the majority party to confirm unlimited nominees in blocs for executive branch positions subject to two hours of debate, though it doesn't apply to Cabinet nominees or judges, marking the latest move in 12 years of eroding minority power in the Senate.

[**CDC advisers vote to change guidance on MMRV vaccines**](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv). The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, now led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointees, voted 8-3 to change childhood vaccine recommendations by no longer allowing the MMRV combination shot for children under 4. The panel, chaired by Martin Kulldorff and composed entirely of Kennedy's handpicked members, cited concerns about slightly increased fever-related seizure risks in the combination vaccine compared to separate MMR and chickenpox shots. Medical groups strongly opposed the changes, with representatives arguing the move would spark public confusion, compromise insurance coverage, and potentially reduce vaccination rates. The controversial meeting comes after Kennedy fired former CDC Director Susan Monarez, who testified she was dismissed for refusing to preemptively approve vaccine schedule changes, with the American Academy of Pediatrics boycotting the proceedings entirely.

[**Grocery prices have jumped up, and there's no relief in sight**](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5539547/grocery-prices-tariffs-food-inflation). Grocery prices have risen 29% since February 2020, with food prices increasing 3.2% in the last 12 months and outpacing overall inflation, making groceries a major source of stress for 53% of Americans according to an Associated Press-NORC survey. The price increases stem from pandemic supply chain disruptions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, avian flu affecting egg prices, and now President Trump's tariffs on imported foods like bananas and coffee. Despite Trump's campaign promises to lower grocery prices, costs remain higher than when he took office, with his immigration crackdowns and tariffs potentially adding further upward pressure. Shoppers like retired nurse Shelia Fields are adapting by visiting multiple stores for sales, skipping meals, and stocking up on items like coffee before tariff-driven price increases take full effect.

[**RFK Jr. allies claim momentum as Florida targets vaccines in schools**](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/rfk-vaccine-mandate-maha-florida-00572512). Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced plans to eliminate all school vaccine requirements in the state, marking a national first that has shocked health officials but energized activists opposed to vaccine mandates. The move aligns with Florida's new Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative that supports HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s federal efforts, with Ladapo previously allowing parents to decide whether unvaccinated children should stay home during measles outbreaks. The announcement has drawn strong criticism from the public health community and comes as Kennedy's anti-vaccine measures are prompting resignations and firings of top CDC staff. More than 1,000 HHS employees have demanded Kennedy's resignation, warning that forcing CDC experts to abandon decades of sound science makes Americans less safe, while some GOP senators have expressed concerns that Kennedy's vaccine policies are risky for both public health and politics.

[**Erika Kirk appointed CEO of Turning Point USA**](https://globalnews.ca/news/11434912/erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-ceo/). Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, has been unanimously elected as the new CEO and Chair of the Board of Turning Point USA following her husband's death last week. Charlie Kirk, who co-founded the conservative organization at age 18 in suburban Chicago in 2012 with Tea Party activist William Montgomery, was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University. The organization's board announced that Charlie had previously expressed to multiple executives that he wanted his wife to lead in the event of his death. President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, and other U.S. officials are scheduled to speak at Kirk's memorial service on Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

[**Charlie Kirk killing flips how Trump's Republicans see US: Poll**](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-poll-republicans-charlie-kirk-ap-norc-2132450). A majority of Republicans (51%) now believe the U.S. is heading in the wrong direction following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, up dramatically from 29% in June according to a new AP-NORC poll. Kirk's death has ignited conservative anger about political violence from the left and sparked broader conversations about American civil society and the line between free speech and incitement to violence. The poll of 1,183 adults was conducted between September 11-15 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The assassination has fundamentally shifted Republican sentiment about the country's direction in the aftermath of the tragic event.

[**Democrats' chances of sweeping Virginia elections as early voting begins**](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-sweeping-virginia-elections-early-voting-2132177). Democratic candidates hold leads in all three Virginia statewide races as early voting began Friday, with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger leading Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by 12 points (52% to 40%) in the gubernatorial race according to a Christopher Newport University poll. State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi leads Republican John Reid by 11 points for lieutenant governor, while Democratic former legislator Jay Jones leads incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares by seven points. Virginia's off-year elections are viewed as a critical bellwether for the 2026 midterms, with Republicans having swept the state races in 2021 before later flipping control of the House. The poll of 808 registered voters was conducted September 8-14 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

[**Health insurance premiums could rise more than 80% next year**](https://www.newsweek.com/health-insurance-premiums-rising-80-percent-2026-2132062). Americans' health insurance premiums are projected to surge over 75% on average next year due to the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to analysis by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF. State-level analyses project even steeper increases, with Rhode Island expecting 85% increases and Pennsylvania anticipating 82% or higher rate hikes for marketplace enrollees. The enhanced subsidies, originally part of the American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025, helped ACA Marketplace enrollment more than double from 11.4 million to 24.3 million between 2020 and 2025. Harvard professor Benjamin Sommers co-authored research suggesting 3.7 million people could lose coverage and become uninsured due to the loss of premium tax credits, with the fate of extensions hinging on ongoing congressional spending bill negotiations.

[**How housing market could reach ""tipping point"" under Trump**](https://www.newsweek.com/how-housing-market-could-reach-tipping-point-under-trump-2131134). President Trump has a chance to address the U.S. housing affordability crisis through a potential national housing emergency declaration that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced could come as soon as the end of September, according to housing expert Pete Carroll. The U.S. faces a 4.5 million unit housing shortage that's ""growing every year,"" with home prices jumping over 40% since the pandemic began due to low mortgage rates and chronically low supply. Carroll suggests potential solutions including lowering closing costs, converting empty commercial office space (1 billion square feet nationwide) into residential housing, and releasing federal land for development in western states like Nevada and Utah. The housing market could reach a ""tipping point"" within Trump's administration if the right policies are implemented to increase inventory and reduce the housing deficit, though success depends on conforming to rule of law to avoid court challenges.

[**Trump admin hands immigrant farm workers major win**](https://www.newsweek.com/immigrant-farm-workers-h2a-visa-renewal-interviews-state-department-2132166). The Trump administration handed immigrant farm workers a significant victory Thursday when the State Department reversed its requirement for H-2A temporary farm workers to attend in-person interviews for visa renewals. The change, effective October 1, restores interview waivers for H-2A workers after the administration had eliminated most visa renewal waivers on September 2, requiring virtually all temporary visa holders to attend in-person interviews. Immigration attorney Matt Mauntel-Medici noted that agricultural delays were particularly harmful as farm operations are time-sensitive, and the reversal will speed processing and allow experienced workers to return to help farmers. The H-2A program allows temporary farm workers to stay in the U.S. for up to three years before requiring a 60-day return home, with the heavily-regulated program providing a crucial lifeline for American farmers to maintain domestic food production.

[**Donald Trump's helicopter Marine One in emergency landing**](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-marine-one-hydraulic-malfunction-uk-return-helicopter-2132098). President Trump's helicopter Marine One made an unscheduled landing in Britain due to a minor hydraulic problem before his departure for the United States, the White House announced Thursday. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the issue briefly delayed the helicopter's return to London Stansted Airport after leaving the prime minister's country residence, with pilots landing at a nearby airfield where Trump and Melania transferred to a backup aircraft. The incident occurred during the conclusion of Trump's second state visit to the UK, where he praised the pageantry and warm welcome while signing a science and technology agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. No injuries were reported, and the Trumps later boarded Air Force One without incident for their flight back to the U.S.

[**Supreme Court issues major announcement**](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-arguments-court-update-2131983). The Supreme Court will hear challenges to President Trump's tariff authority on November 5, scheduling arguments in Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections on an unusually expedited timeline. The cases challenge Trump's authority to impose broad tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law allowing presidential action during ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats to national security or the economy. Small businesses and states argue Trump illegally invoked emergency powers to levy import taxes on goods from nearly every country, pushing them toward potential collapse, while lower courts have largely sided with challengers but left most tariffs in place. The consolidated cases will receive one hour for argument, with the new Supreme Court term beginning October 6.

[**Tucker Carlson urges ""civil disobedience"" if Trump DOJ targets hate speech**](https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-jimmy-kimmel-abc-trump-free-speech-2131881). Tucker Carlson warned that ""civil disobedience"" could erupt if the Trump administration uses Charlie Kirk's death as justification to attack free speech, particularly criticizing Attorney General Pam Bondi's intent to crack down on ""hate speech"" nationwide. Carlson argued that restrictions on free speech represent treating people as ""meat puppets"" rather than humans with souls, and warned against using Kirk's murder to justify hate speech laws in America. The controversy intensified as ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! indefinitely following backlash over comments Kimmel made about Kirk, with the suspension coming after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's remarks and suggested regulatory consequences. The suspension raises questions about whether corporate and regulatory pressures influenced the network's response, particularly given Nexstar Media Group's pending $6.2 billion merger requiring FCC approval.

[**Warsaw turns to Ukraine for drone warfare expertise after Russian drones enter Polish airspace**](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/warsaw-turns-ukraine-drone-warfare-expertise-russian-drones-enter-poli-rcna232342). Poland is partnering with Ukraine on drone warfare expertise and joint military training programs following Russian drones entering Polish airspace last week, with officials signing a memorandum to create a joint working group for uncrewed systems. Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski reported ""increased activity of Belarusian and Russian drones which tried to cross into Polish airspace"" overnight Thursday, though none succeeded, prompting Poland to keep its border closed until further provocations are ruled out. Ukraine's Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced the countries will jointly test new drone interception methods and exchange military experience, while Ukrainian forces have retaken around 60 square miles in Donetsk and struck a Russian oil refinery more than 600 miles away. The cooperation comes as NATO strengthened its eastern flank defenses and Russia showcased military power in exercises with Belarus, highlighting the transformed nature of warfare where drones have taken a central battlefield role.

[**Gaza hit by telecoms blackout as Israeli tanks and infantry advance**](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/gaza-hit-telecoms-blackout-israeli-tanks-infantry-advance-rcna232338). Israeli tanks advanced along two gateways to Gaza City center Thursday while internet and phone lines were cut for several hours, signaling a potential escalation in ground operations with at least 85 Palestinians killed in the past 24 hours. Israeli forces have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas from their positions in Gaza City's eastern suburbs, positioning themselves to advance on central and western areas where most of the population shelters in improvised tent camps. The Palestinian Telecommunications Company said services were cut ""due to the ongoing aggression and the targeting of the main network routes,"" though fixed internet and landlines were later reactivated by nightfall. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City since Israel announced its intention to take control on August 10, but a greater number remain either in battered homes or makeshift encampments, with the total Palestinian death toll surpassing 65,000 according to Gaza health authorities.

[**Iran withdraws resolution to ban attacks on nuclear sites following U.S. pressure**](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/iran/iran-withdraws-resolution-banning-attacks-nuclear-sites-us-pressure-rcna232340). Iran withdrew a resolution prohibiting attacks on nuclear facilities at the last minute Thursday following heavy U.S. lobbying behind the scenes, with the U.S. raising the possibility of reducing funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency if the resolution was adopted. The resolution, co-sponsored with China, Russia, and other countries, would have ""strongly condemned"" the Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, which Iran said constituted a ""clear violation of international law."" Iran's U.N. Ambassador Reza Najafi announced the deferral was made ""guided by the spirit of goodwill and constructive engagement,"" though he criticized ""intimidation and political pressure exerted by one of the aggressors."" The withdrawal comes as France, Germany, and the UK have launched a ""snapback"" process to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran over noncompliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement, setting a 30-day deadline that could be extended if Iran resumes direct U.S. negotiations and allows U.N. inspector access to nuclear sites.

[**Satellite photo shows Taliban military base eyed by Trump**](https://www.newsweek.com/satellite-photo-bagram-afghanistan-trump-china-2132346). A satellite photo taken this week shows Afghanistan's Bagram Air Base, which President Trump said Thursday his administration would like to reacquire from the Taliban, highlighting its strategic importance due to its proximity to China's nuclear weapons facilities. Trump called Bagram ""one of the biggest air bases in the world"" that the U.S. relinquished ""for nothing,"" telling reporters at the British prime minister's residence that ""we're trying to get it back"" because ""it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons."" The base fell under Taliban control in August 2021 during the U.S. withdrawal and served as a central hub for U.S. and NATO military operations for nearly two decades following the 9/11 attacks. China responded Friday by calling for respect for Afghanistan's independence and sovereignty, while any U.S. effort to regain Bagram would carry significant diplomatic and geopolitical consequences for Taliban policy and U.S.-China competition in Central Asia.

[**Russia threatens NATO neighbor with ""Ukraine playbook""**](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-nato-finland-ukraine-war-isw-2132398). Top Russian officials are carrying out a Kremlin-coordinated campaign to threaten NATO ally Finland using the same tactics employed prior to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The Washington-based think tank warned that ""high-ranking Kremlin officials have increased threats against Finland in recent weeks, including by using language that mirrors the Kremlin's false justifications for its invasions of Ukraine."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Finland's ""neutral veneer peeled off"" and revanchism is ""literally on the rise,"" while Deputy Security Council member Dmitry Medvedev accused Finland of preparing to attack Russia after joining NATO. Finland joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the alliance's Article 5 binds members to collective defense if any ally comes under armed attack.

[**Pakistan opens nuclear weapons program to Saudi Arabia**](https://www.newsweek.com/pakistan-saudi-arabia-nuclear-weapons-program-pact-2132355). Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif announced that his nation's nuclear weapons capabilities ""will be made available"" to Saudi Arabia under their new mutual defense pact signed Wednesday, which declares that an attack on one nation would be an attack on both. The nuclear dimension raises the risk of nuclear war in the Middle East amid regional instability spanning Israel, Gaza, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, with Israel currently being the only Middle Eastern state with its own nuclear arsenal. The move is seen as a signal to Israel following its attack targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar that killed six people and sparked new concerns among Gulf Arab nations about their safety. According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Pakistan possesses approximately 170 nuclear warheads and is slowly modernizing its stockpile, while both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia remain key U.S. partners in their respective regions.

[**Putin orders succession plan for Russia's next leadership**](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-war-putin-succession-leadership-2131920). Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the next generation of the country's political leadership must be veterans of the Ukraine war, signaling further entrenchment of hard-line Russian nationalism that dominates political power under his rule. Speaking to State Duma factions, Putin said ""we must search for, find, and put forward people who are fearless in serving the Motherland and who have been willing to risk their health and even their lives,"" emphasizing that such people should be promoted to leadership positions as successors. Russia has drafted hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with independent estimates suggesting at least 130,150 troop losses and over 1.5 million Russian men and women participating in the war. The succession plan comes as the war continues despite President Trump's push to broker a peace deal, with Russia having seized around a fifth of Ukrainian territory and remaining major disagreements on territorial concessions and Ukrainian security architecture.

[**China signs submarine deal with US ally**](https://www.newsweek.com/china-signs-submarine-deal-thailand-2131665). Thailand signed a long-delayed agreement to acquire a Chinese S26T diesel-electric submarine, finalizing a purchase six years after the vessel's hull was laid down and making Thailand the sixth Southeast Asian nation to possess submarines. The deal, attended by Royal Thai Navy chief Admiral Jirapol Wongwit at China Shipbuilding headquarters in Beijing, ends uncertainty that began in 2017 when the program was scaled back from three submarines due to budget constraints and later stalled when Germany blocked engine exports citing EU arms embargoes on China. Analysts suggest the agreement signals Thailand's displeasure with Washington following U.S. criticism of the country's 2014 military coup and Congress's suspension of nearly $5 million in defense aid, despite Thailand being a major non-NATO ally since 2003. The submarine, originally set for 2023 delivery, is now scheduled for completion by the end of 2028 with Chinese-made engines that underwent over 6,000 hours of testing to meet agreement standards.",2,1758285554.0,CANUSHelp,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 On the eve of her wedding, Malayah Hudson discovered her fiancé, Desmond Martinez, whom she thought was left disabled by a car accident, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, passionately entwined with another woman. Resolute, she called her mother, ""Mom, I'm leaving the country in seven days. Can you help me make the arrangements?"" ""At last, you've come to your senses. Desmond never truly cared for you. Holding onto him won't lead to anything worthwhile,"" Holly Hudson's gentle voice carried a hint of relief. ""Come to Paris. We not only have the art you love but also plenty of charming gentlemen. You'll be swept off your feet."" ""Alright, I'll finish things up here and head over."" After the call, Malayah quietly walked from the living room to the bedroom door. Inside, the two had already moved to the bed. ""Desmond, you staged a car accident back then to break up with Malayah, pretending to be crippled and blind. I never thought she'd be so devoted, taking care of you all this time."" ""You're not planning to marry her, are you?"" Waverly Bell pouted beneath him, displeased. ""You should have always been mine."" ""Waverly, you're the only one I love. In seven days, I'll have her kidnapped. If she doesn't show up at the wedding, I can naturally have a new bride,"" Desmond murmured as he kissed Waverly's lips, but his words sent chills down Malayah’s spine. ""If she hadn't insisted on caring for me back then, I wouldn't have kept up this act for so long. I'm worn out."" Malayah couldn’t believe it was all a charade! She had returned drenched from the rain just to bring Desmond some coffee. Since the accident, his legs would ache on rainy days. Shivering slightly, her long hair stuck to her face. Compared to the warmth inside the bedroom, she seemed pitiful. Desmond's cold words shattered her heart completely. ""Waverly, hold on for seven more days, and I'll marry you."" With a loud ""Bang!"" the two inside the room quickly separated. Desmond's eyes snapped to the door. ""Who’s there?"" Malayah swallowed her tears. ""I accidentally spilled the coffee I made for you."" She crouched down, picking up the scattered glass shards. On hearing this, Desmond stiffened for a moment, then hurriedly pushed Waverly away, got dressed, and sat in his wheelchair, motioning for Waverly to wheel him out. He remembered he had to keep pretending to be blind. ""When did you get back? Waverly was just helping with some work, and I didn’t notice you,"" he kept his gaze above Malayah’s head, gripping the wheelchair tightly, probing as he spoke. Malayah wasn't fooled. She bit her lip, ""Just came in. You can carry on. I'll make more coffee."" The coffee was still hot, the glass shattered, staining her fingertips with blood. The spreading red was nothing compared to the pain in her heart. She had met Desmond at her graduation ceremony. He had been invited to speak as a successful alumnus. The moment he appeared, Malayah was struck by his presence. She pursued him fervently, joined his company, mirrored his interests, and naturally, they ended up together, until she mentioned marriage. The day after she brought up marriage, Desmond had the car accident. From the accident until now, three years had passed. During those three years, she had sacrificed everything, including her career, family, and dreams, to study alternative medicine and nutrition, striving to help Desmond walk again, regain his vision. Yet now, it was all an illusion! She looked down at her hands, once meant for sketching, now only covered in a thin layer of calluses. Clutching the glass shards tightly, she let the blood stain her fingertips. She raised her head and stared fiercely at the pair of traitors. Desmond frowned, irritated. ""I’ve told you my legs and eyes will never heal. Why do you keep doing these things every day? Are you reminding me that I’m a cripple?"" Malayah stood there, silent and expressionless, staring at him. Throughout these three years, because of his condition, she had tolerated his mood swings and occasional outbursts. Falling from grace and unable to bear his impotence, his drastic change in behavior was somewhat understandable. Malayah forced a laugh. Her chest heaving with anger, she finally composed herself. ""Fine, if you don’t like it, I’ll stop."" Desmond, we’re done. Desmond seemed surprised. Just as he was about to speak, Malayah had already turned toward the kitchen. She tossed the expensive ingredients she'd specifically bought into the trash. Since Desmond didn’t care about her efforts or her love, she decided to take it all back. She glanced at the calendar. March 27th was the wedding day. She had marked it with a little heart. Looking back now, it was bitterly ironic.

Chapter 2 Waverly Bell left her house and headed straight for the kitchen, where she raised an eyebrow at Malayah Hudson. ""Desmond still needs your care, Malayah."" Her tone was mocking, and her slightly open collar revealed faint marks on her neck. Malayah took a quick glance but remained unfazed. ""No need for you to worry."" Waverly scoffed and turned to leave. As soon as she closed the door, Malayah’s phone buzzed softly. She looked down to see a photo sent by Waverly. Desmond had Waverly in his arms, kissing her tenderly—a scene full of intimacy. Moreover, Desmond’s gaze was directed at the camera, filled with a tenderness Malayah hadn’t seen in the last three years. Her heart felt pierced, the pain overwhelming, making it hard to breathe. She clutched her chest as tears dripped into the sink. Years of affection and almost everything she had invested had led to this moment, leaving Malayah feeling as if her heart was being torn apart. ""Malayah, are you done yet? I'm exhausted; we need to rest. Come over and help me,"" Desmond called from the other room. Malayah entered to see Desmond sitting in his wheelchair, his gaze unfocused. He was acting, and it seemed a shame he hadn't won an Oscar for it. She looked at him coolly and said, ""It's been three years, and you still haven't learned how to get into bed?"" “Who stays stuck in despair as long as you do?” Desmond didn’t catch the sarcasm in her voice, only assuming she was tired of caring for him. ""Malayah, are you fed up with me now? Why did you propose to me in the first place? I'm just a wreck, a complete waste!"" His tone was agitated. In the past, Malayah would have immediately comforted him when he spoke like this. After hesitating for a few seconds, she helped Desmond into bed, but there was no trace of affection in her eyes. Once Desmond was in bed, he suddenly pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her tightly. His tone softened, ""I'm sorry, Malayah, I spoke out of turn. I didn't mean it; I just feel I’m not worthy of you in my current state."" ""Sorry, sorry..."" ""I've embarrassed you."" He always did this—after venting, he would begin to apologize for his words and actions. Malayah's soft heart would always forgive him. She closed her eyes lightly, suppressing the indescribable emotions within her. After a while, she turned, her gaze falling instantly on the lipstick stain on his pajamas. It must have been from his kiss with Waverly, or perhaps intentionally left by her. Malayah took a deep breath. ""Rest well; I’ll be sleeping in the study tonight."" With that, she left without looking back. Desmond instinctively tried to reach for her, but his hand was too slow, capturing only air. Watching Malayah leave without hesitation, an inexplicable frustration welled up within him. What did she mean by this? Three years had passed, and she wasn’t pretending anymore. Was she disgusted with him? He thought her love had no expiration date, but clearly, it was just shallow. Malayah returned to the study, sitting there through the night. Her mind was filled with memories of her time with Desmond. Over the past three years, she proposed five times. It was only last month that Desmond finally accepted. She had been ecstatic, arranging their wedding, setting a date for their photoshoot, joyfully writing invitations to their friends. Looking back now, it was all a joke she’d played on herself. Her supposed deep affection had only ever moved her, while Desmond didn't care at all. Unable to sleep, Malayah found herself with dark circles under her eyes the next morning. She was preparing breakfast when she received a call from the photographer, ""Miss Hudson, weren't you scheduled to take your wedding photos today? Why haven't you arrived?"" ""We won’t be taking wedding photos..."" Before she could finish, Desmond's voice came from nearby, ""Malayah, are you canceling because of my legs?"" He was bowing his head, his hand gripping his pant leg tightly. Malayah looked at him calmly and said, ""We’ll be there shortly; please wait."" At the photo shoot location, Malayah emerged in a wedding dress while Desmond wore a suit. The photographer encouraged them to get closer, smiling, ""You two make a lovely couple."" Despite Desmond's disability, his appearance was flawless. Malayah remained silent, and Desmond discreetly glanced at her. For some reason, he felt a chill emanating from her. That morning, the regular cup of coffee was missing, and the breakfast she prepared was perfunctory. Eating it left a bad taste in his mouth. Photographer: ""Get a bit closer, you two. You're engaged, so why so distant?"" Malayah didn’t move. Desmond instinctively tilted his head and turned his wheelchair, trying to get closer to Malayah. Just then, his phone rang. He fumbled to take it out, glanced at it, and answered. A few seconds later, Desmond spoke apologetically, ""Malayah, there’s an urgent matter at the office. I need to leave right away. Could we postpone the wedding photos?"" ""Let's take them another day."" Malayah replied coolly, ""Go handle your work."" Desmond was swiftly escorted away, leaving Malayah watching his retreating figure. Her lips parted momentarily. Desmond, we'll never have wedding photos in this lifetime.

Chapter 3 The photographer stood motionless, watching the bride left behind. Malayah Hudson spoke coolly, “We won’t be taking the wedding photos. I’ll still cover the cost.” She left the photography set and went to her workplace to inform her boss of her resignation. She had five different part-time jobs, selected to accommodate her studies in chiropractic and nutrition. Leaving them was straightforward enough. Finally, she went to see Dereck Ray, the experienced chiropractor who had been mentoring her. With a warm smile, Dereck greeted her, “Malayah, you’re early today. Come on, I'll show you a new technique. It might help your boyfriend's leg.” Malayah offered a faint smile, “No need, sir.” “Oh? Did you two break up?” She shook her head, “No, he just doesn't want me to treat him anymore.” Dereck hesitated, wanting to say more, but Malayah simply nodded. “Thank you for everything these past few years.” For the past three years, Dereck had supported her through emotional breakdowns. “Ah, there’s no need to thank me,” he said. “But don’t worry too much about his leg. He’ll be able to stand on his own again.” Malayah nodded without expression. Yes, he would stand again, but not with her. Back home, she began packing up all the recipes she had developed over the years. Her study, once filled with easels and sketchbooks, was now crowded with books on anatomy, charts, and medical texts. It's often said that prolonged illness makes a person their own doctor; Malayah was just shy of qualifying for a medical license. As she packed, she stumbled upon a dusty box containing letters she’d once written to Desmond Martinez. There was a time when he loved her, replying to every letter with affection. Malayah recalled Desmond’s words when they first started dating: “In this fast-paced world, you’re still writing love letters? That’s adorable, Malayah.” Spreading the letters across the table, she struck a match and watched as the flames consumed them, erasing all traces of her love. Meanwhile, her phone continued to ring. After the fire had fully burned out, she glanced at her phone. A slew of photos from Waverly Bell greeted her. They were wedding photos of Desmond and Waverly. As she swiped through the images, her heart grew heavier with each one. It felt as though a piece of her heart had been hollowed out, a chilling breeze blowing through the emptiness. The so-called “business matter” Desmond was attending to turned out to be a wedding photoshoot with Waverly. A solitary tear splashed onto her phone screen. Holding her phone, Malayah finally allowed herself to cry openly. For three years, she had endured Desmond’s indifference, while he showered his affections on another woman. Waverly's message taunted, “Take a good look at who Desmond truly loves.” “You’re just a distraction for him. If you had any sense, you’d step aside willingly.” “The one marrying him can only be me.” Malayah lowered her eyes, wiping away her tears. “Waverly, as you wish.” Desmond didn’t come home that night. Malayah, however, didn’t confront him, quietly packing her belongings instead. She continued to sleep in the study. In the middle of the night, her phone rang; it was Desmond. “Malayah, I’m out discussing business and had a bit to drink. It’s quite late—can you come pick me up?” “Malayah? You’re all I have. Can you come?” Malayah glanced at the time—3:30 a.m. What kind of business meeting goes this late into the night? She didn't call him out on the lie but instead got up, silently putting on her coat. “Okay, I’ll come get you.”

Chapter 4 The Twilight Bar buzzed with energy when Malayah Hudson arrived; the private room was drenched in neon lights, and the music thumped loudly. On stage, Desmond Martinez, who was typically confined to a wheelchair, sat on a high stool, strumming his guitar while singing love songs. He was free-spirited — a side Malayah had never seen before. His gaze was tender as he looked at Waverly Bell, standing like a star beneath the stage lights. With a gentle smile, he spoke into the microphone, ""Waverly, I love you. Let's get married."" Malayah stood at the entrance, her legs feeling like lead, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. How could she reconcile three years of emotions? Love and hate intertwined within her mind, and she wished she could rush in and demand an explanation. Why couldn't he just tell her he didn't want to marry her, instead of shattering her heart? Was her love truly so worthless? The crowd erupted at Desmond's declaration. ""Kiss! Kiss!"" Waverly shyly bowed her head. Desmond set down his guitar, climbed down from the stage, and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her in for a kiss. The spectators cheered wildly. After the kiss, Desmond tidied Waverly’s clothes and hair. Then someone remarked loudly, ""Desmond, but your wedding is in six days; did Malayah agree to the breakup?"" ""She’s clung to you so desperately over these years. Will she let go easily?"" ""Yeah, she even went to the doctor for your leg, she was so pathetic. I still have that photo."" ""Desmond, why was she so easy to manipulate?"" Desmond simply held Waverly on the couch, shooting his wheelchair a disdainful glance, ""She chose to."" Malayah bit her lip until it nearly bled. She leaned against the wall, feeling weak, her mind blank. Yet, this time, there was a sense of inevitability. Her heart didn’t feel as shattered as before. Just like Desmond said, she chose this path. Even if she stumbled and got hurt along the way, there was no one else to blame. At that moment, someone suggested, ""Desmond, let’s play a game. Want to try it? Waiting for Malayah to arrive..."" Malayah steadied herself, then tapped on the partially open door to the private room. Her eyes settled on Desmond Martinez, who had resumed his place in the wheelchair. She walked over, ""Desmond, I came to take you home."" Suddenly, someone viciously kicked Desmond’s wheelchair, sending him tumbling to the floor. His rowdy friends chimed in, ""You’re Desmond’s girlfriend? Desmond just lost a bet, and we were going to make him drink as a penalty, but look at him, blind and crippled. Why don’t you drink for him?"" Malayah saw the table was already covered in opened bottles. She turned her gaze to Desmond, her eyes meeting his. She knew he could see. ""Desmond, what do you want?"" ""Malayah, you play, you pay."" Malayah let out a bitter laugh, tears pooling. What a phrase, ""You play, you pay."" This was Desmond’s chance to prove himself. He knew she was allergic to alcohol. In their most tender times, Desmond would protect her from drinking at gatherings, saying indulgently, ""With me here, my girlfriend never has to drink."" Malayah downed one bottle after another. The liquor was cold. Yet her heart burned, feeling like it was ready to burst into flames. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Desmond watching her the entire time, as if observing a performer. Was every moment of her supposed deep affection seen as entertainment by him? Perhaps Waverly was right; Desmond didn’t love her. It was all just a game. The people around urged her on while Desmond remained silent and detached, watching as she finished the drinks. Malayah staggered, her figure unsteady, and as she walked toward Desmond, someone tripped her, sending her sprawling to the ground, pain shooting through her body. ""Desmond, are you satisfied?""

Chapter 5 Malayah Hudson fainted. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm. Her skin itched slightly, making her want to scratch it. Before she could, a hand gently stopped her. A familiar, calm voice said, ""Don't scratch. I'll put some ointment on

Ab wait krte krte meri aankh lag gyi bcs I was really exhausted that day. I had barely slept for 3 hours as I had gone to a school trip aur wahan se aake i joined my friends. Phir jab meri aankh khuli toh mere pas cup mein chai (supposedly) para tha aur meri dosten mjhse thori door bethi thi. Ab the thing is that I took a sip and it tasted like coffee however I asked for chai😭 (I can totally differentiate between chai and coffee). Toh maine bas pucha k mjhe galti se coffee toh nh dedya bcs it tasted bitter and i wanted chai. Idk why but they all started laughing to my face. Like prank wala hasna bhi nahi proper mock karne wali hasi😭Meri insecurties trigger hogyi aur main uth k jane lgi. I felt so embarassed that i started tearing up (im a bit sensitive kya kar skte hain). Two of my friends came with me and left the others. Later I told 2 of my friends (one that wasn't there that day and the other that isn't a part of that group) abt this and they both thought that I was exaggerating so I think maybe I did.

After that I kinda distanced myself from them for a month and they ofc didn't care. Uske baad phir normally milne lag gyi kuch doston se and that wasn't brought up until recently. So my friend was showing me stuff on her phone amd there came a video they made later that day in which they were mocking me like mimicking what i said and how i reacted and my friend didn't bother hiding it and straightforwardly said that we're making fun of u in this. Khair I didn't react to that.

So, my question is how would u react? Do you think I overreacted that day? (ik i kinda did but i blame the lack of sleep😭). Pls refrain from bashing me in the comments 😔🙏",3,1758285212.0,TeenPakistani,10,1.0,False

He said it’s best we don’t carry on, that I’m not what he’s looking for, and that he needs someone without kids. He also mentioned his mom isn’t well, he’s moving in with his dad with his kids. He basically mentioned that there’s been a discussion yesterday evening with his family where he will probably have to move in with his dad with his kids because his mum is unwell and I said okay that’s totally understandable. How long would that before? And he said forever so I explained that I would like a partner where we would live together and have that family unit And basically he went quiet and didn’t say anything on the phone

I just feel so low and rejected right now… it hurts because I was really starting to care, and now it just feels like I’m not enough. I’m trying to hold it together, but I’m just really tired and sad. I’m just sat here crying. I can’t stop blaming myself and wishing he would have been open to talking. I really liked him and my feelings were growing, and now it just hurts so much. I feel so low and rejected… I’m really struggling to hold it together right now. xxx",1,1758285172.0,self,2,0.67,False

I’m 36 and currently living in the US, but I didn’t grow up here. Back in my home country, making friends felt more natural—through school, neighbors, or even just everyday life. Here, I’ve met nice people, but it often feels like conversations stay at the small-talk stage and never grow into real friendships.

I’ve tried chatting with coworkers, joining some local events, and even online communities. Still, it feels difficult to find people who want a deeper, long-term friendship rather than just surface-level interactions.

A little about me: I love traveling, food, music, and coffee ☕. I’m friendly, curious, and really value good conversations.

So I’d love to hear from you:  
  
How have you built meaningful friendships as an adult?  
  
Are there approaches or mindsets that helped you break past the “acquaintance wall”?

# Chapter 2: A Memorable Halloween

 

# Oct 31, 2024: Jacqueline Flynn

***Enlightened human***

**10am**

Nixie is a hell of a resource.  That pixie can find out anything.  She pops into my office.  The pixie teleporting thing is crazy.  Even seeing Pat do it a lot, I am always shocked when I see one pop in.  Nixie smiles and bows a little.  “Good day Lady Jacqueline.”

I can’t help my scowl.  “Pat is a lady, I am just the gal in love with her. I am not someone that earned such a title.” 

She bows.  “Such things do not matter.  You are the consort of a queen. You have the title regardless.  I would also point out that I am giving you this because I believe you earned the title in your behavior towards Queen Patricia.  I saw how miserable she was in her hole in the wall apartment.  I saw her eyes light up when she looked at the schedule in the morning and saw your name.”

My heart flutters.  *What?*

She nods.  “My lady, I knew her heart had found yours before you made the deal with Queen Titania.  I saw that and I gave that information to someone as I was hired to.”

I get chills.  “Who?”

She gestures to a packet that has appeared on my desk.  “It is all in there. For you.”

“What will this cost me, Nixie?”

She shakes her head.  “I owe you and the Lady much.  Consider this a debt payment of sorts.   I also am unsure as to the goals of the entity involved.  I will not name her as doing so can sometimes call her attention.  Please enjoy the party tonight.”

“Thank you, Nixie.  I will keep your actions in mind.”  I wave as she vanishes.  Time to check this packet.  The first page makes my blood run cold.  There is a picture of a monitor with a project management software program I know and the title is “Project Patricia.”

That’s bad enough.  Seeing it in front of Mab is the thing that terrifies me.  There are some more hints and some information that is kinda scary.  I feature heavily in the papers.  My parents are there.  Huh?  Dad’s work?  Wait, Mab dumped a bunch of money into it earlier this year.  The company was struggling and now they are doing better.  She owned around 30% of their stock at one point and has sold it off since as they got better.  I mean, looks like she made good money, but if she hadn’t…

Mab saved my dad’s business when no one asked her to help.

I look, she’s been pushing for legislation to change how public works handles tree cutting. She wants them to allow owners of trees to have 4 weeks to challenge trees being destroyed before they can be removed.  She’s giving Connie breathing room…

Ed?  ED!  She helped Ed, the manager that was here before Pat, get a new location closer to his home.  He owns that franchise now.  She helped him buy it.  If he hadn’t moved locations the scumbag that owned this location prior to Pat would have sold it to Ed…

Every page is her working behind the scenes.  I see some notes on things the Summer Court did.  Pat’s first apartment with Skerrit, our first home, was their doing. I mean, they have a couple of bets including that first kiss from her. I see her helping them occasionally.

Mab’s up to something.  I can tell.  I don’t know what the end goal is, but I have a name for it.  And I know I am involved in it.  Maybe I can find out something at the party tonight?

 

# Oct 31, 2024: Pale Moonbeam, The Eminence of Fury.

***Werewolf***

The box in front of me is gift wrapped. It is around 12 feet long and thin. The wrapping paper has the smell of coffee beans.

I look at my subordinate, “open it.”

He nods and rips the paper off it. He smiles as he does so. “It’s like Christmas!”

Why do I have idiots following me?

The box is opened and a really fucking old spear is in it. The tip isn’t even made or steel, it is like brass or something.

“Boss, there’s a letter.”

Now I am curious, “Show me.”

“In the right hands this weapon can kill any of the creatures that act superior to your kind. Vampire, fairy, even angels.  Show them who is the strongest.”

Hmmmmm. Let’s see. I pick it up and feel the rush of power hit me. I can defeat anyone.

“I believe we have a new objective, boys. Everyone’s back on the menu.”

 

# Oct 31, 2024: Mona

***Incubus***

**8pm**

Quite possibly my favorite day of the year. The fact that there is a party at the CaFae just makes it better.

I am off tonight.  I had thought of doing my Dom gig with some clients but decided to come here instead.  I am glad I did. So many of the irregulars have dropped their glamour for the “cosplay and costume contest” tonight. I put on my booty shorts, a lacy top with the pentagram on it, thigh high skintight black leather high heel boots, and let my true form out. Everyone can see the tattoo that brands me as an incubus.  Hair in pigtails to let everyone enjoy the show.

I am not even close to being the worst one here. How are we getting away with this?  Almost a dozen regulars are here. 

Hell, Bob came to the contest. I gotta say, an old Mediterranean man with white hair and a beard holding three tablets with “the fifteen, whoops, ten, yes Ten Commandments” is making me giggle so often. How this man is standing next to Connie in wood nymph form and not enlightened, I don’t know.

Dis, the dark elf smoking hot babe is smiling and serving.  She dropped her mask fully and her ears and the lack of whites in her eyes barely register to people as strange, because “costume!” 

And then there is “The party.”

Jackie in a purple hood and outfit. She looks so fetching and didn’t have to change her hair. Lemar has a green wizard robe and a huge hat that he keeps pulling things out of. I wonder who loaned him that. May is in a white robe with a red wig on, obscure reference.  Her belly is huge…  Guess Presto sealed the deal with Varla?  Ricardo has a green leather outfit that should be illegal, Mike damn he looks good in that. Cindy is in a brown fur-covered outfit showing off her curves with a staff to finish the look and Ms. Wallace is wearing plate armor and has a shield. Seriously?  Her as Eric?  I know what they are, I laugh a lot at them all coming as the iconic cartoon D&D group.

“Aren’t you missing someone?”  I laugh as I say it to Jackie.

Her smirk tells me I am going to love the answer.

“No.”

The chime rings and Oberon’s theme plays. He walks in nearly topless. The leather rig along with the Viking helmet and the club are perfect. I see a unicorn outside.

“I can’t bring her in. Shame. I got ready for the part and everything!” His cheesy grin is the stuff of legends.

Ms. Wallace sees the unicorn.  “I give up. Trying to keep you guys from outing yourselves is impossible…”

Oberon laughs and the Unicorn vanishes.

After about 15 minutes of fun I am sitting in a booth with Connie when a very adorable Acrobat and an equally dreamy Ranger sit in the booth with us.

“Nice costume, Demon lady.”  Cindy breaks the ice. I wink.

“This is one of my work outfits.”  I laugh. They smile and Connie gives me a look. She can tell there is something going on. Ricardo is purposely not looking at her. Oh!

Connie smiles at him. “I am nude for everyone today and you aren’t going to look?”

He laughs and blushes. “I am so sorry about last time. I figured I should not look unless I was told it is okay.”

She leans forward. “Both my ladies love you. You can always look. Just ask permission from this one before you touch.”   She winks as she gestures towards Cindy and he gets even redder.

Cindy blushes a little. “What about me?”

Connie kisses her on the cheek. “That goes for both of you.  I need to go speak with my Lady. Mona, dear, please be good to these two. I would consider it a small favor.”  She winks at me.

I jump at the opportunity.  “I will hold you to that small favor.  A kiss works?”

She winks and kisses me on the cheek. “You never have to use a favor to ask for one with me.” 

Awwww yea, incubus mama still has it.   “Maybe I will ask for something else then.” 

As she leaves and I stare at that spectacular ass, I hear chuckles. Cindy winks at me, “You two are cute together.”

I smile. “Yea, but that one only has eyes for Ms. Wallace…”

Cindy laughs. “Pot have you met the kettle?”

I almost glare at her. “Point taken. Okay, who came up with the group costume idea?”

Ricardo laughs. “Would you believe Oberon?”

“What?!”

Cindy nods. “He did. It was hilarious. He’s been researching pop culture since someone told him he was causing a spike in the furry community at the shop and he went down a rabbit hole…”

It takes me less than 3 seconds.  “Jackie or Ms. Wallace mention furries?”

She laughs, “Pat.”

I nod.  Figures.

Cindy laughs, “I think he did it hoping Yunee could come in.  He wouldn’t stop talking about that unicorn asking him how she could get in.”

I think my puzzlement is obvious. “Why didn’t she just use glamour to look like a woman in a unicorn costume?”

Ricardo’s eyes get big. “One second hun!”  He takes off.

She laughs. “He really is the best kind of guy. Always trying new things and doing things for others.”

I smile at Cindy, “No wonder you fell in love with him. I heard that was awkward for a bit…”

She shrugs and smiles. “Still is. Am I in love with him?  Yes. Am I still in love with Jackie, also yes. Am I in love with Patricia?  Also, also yes.”

“I don’t know how being in love is…”

“Liar!” She damn near shouts it. Wow. She looks somewhat angry.

I stare at this woman. “No. I may be obsessed with Ms. Wallace. Okay, I am… I admire and defer to her and want to please her. I definitely have very lustful thoughts and desires towards her. But being in love is not something in my realm of ability. It requires a soul. I traded most of mine away and shredded the remains a long time ago.”

She looks at me with those sad brown eyes of hers.

I reach out and touch her hand, “Hey, no sadness. This isn’t a sad thing. Just my reality. I know my limits and capabilities.  I don’t have many emotions that are soft. But I do know how admiration works. I know that being in love is hard for a lot of people.  And I know you two have a very loving relationship.  Maybe wait for him to catch up. Also, look at him right now.”

Cindy turns to look at what I am seeing. He is talking with Ms. Wallace. Next to them is a very attractive “woman in a unicorn outfit” laughing along with Oberon.  His smile is broad and they are completely at ease. And then Ms. Wallace says something to him we can’t hear but we all see the look.  I have seen that same look directed at many people. Even me a few times.

“Fuck me, Ricky’s still in love with her.”  Cindy saw it too.

I wink at her.  “If that is the case, he isn’t as much of a serial monogamist as he seems. Hell, he might even like to experiment with someone safe.”

Cindy’s eyebrow goes up. “Someone experienced and casual that looks so fucking sexy he suggested we come talk so he could just look at you, um, her for a bit?”

I laugh, “An incubus is never safe. At least not to those looking for her services. Now for a friend, she might be.”  I’d never syphon anything from these two.  Never.

She gets up, leans down, and kisses my cheek. “I do look forward to becoming your friend.”

“Me too.”

She really is beautiful, this one. I can see why Jackie fell for her. I might well fall for her as well if my heart was capable of loving anyone.

As she leaves, I see Mab smiling and drinking with Morgana. She winks at me and motions for me to come over. I do and lean forward. May as well give her a show. 

She smiles and says, “Thank you, I was hoping for this view.” She is all but leering at me. Naughty queen.

I am shocked. “Is this why you called me over?”  I don’t move though, except to adjust my arms so the cleavage show is even better.  My smile and wink are completely genuine. She almost laughs at the move on my part.

“No, I am merely wishing to compliment you.  You are surprising in many ways, Desdemona.”  She winks at me.

I am on alert instantly.  No one at work knows my actual first name.  She dropped it quietly, casually, deliberately.  She sees my reaction.

Her hand touches mine.  “It is an easy thing to infer if you have resources and persistence.  Do not worry, pretty one, I don’t know the entire thing, I haven’t found the book.”

“You know, good lady, there are few around that I can look at as not just an equal, but my superior.  I thought Ms. Wallace might be the only one.  I see I was incorrect.  I have someone I want to talk to.  Do take care, Queen of Air and Darkness.”  I kiss her on the cheek and head off.  Good job me covering my terror just now. I can feel her eyes all over my backside.  I have my tail wave bye to her. I hear her giggle.

Still got it.

 

# Oct 31, 2024: Mab, Liege Lady of the Unseelie

***Sidhe***

Watching the demon walk away is both highly satisfying and highly frustrating.  She has definitely progressed towards being a fine creature.  One worthy of the goal given to me as the request for payment for a favor.  She also frustrates me because I have not had a dalliance with such a creature in hundreds of years and I find myself wondering how her skin would taste on my tongue.  Such a dalliance may end up hurting both of them. One of which I would never hurt. Shame.

Now to other matters, I need to know something.

I begin a walk through the event towards my goal. She is dressing as a male character in heavy armor and the symbolism is likely lost on her. She often pushes her gender to the side to allow an armored shell to defend her from emotions which would be better served by experiencing them.

Maybe in a few millennia she will figure that out.

Before I talk to her, let’s talk to her former lover. I was unable to speak much with the couple at the wedding.  It would have been tacky to bring this up anyway.  I look up at this tall man and I wonder if tonight is going to be a night of sexual frustration for me.  Probably.  He and his wife are talking with Jen.  The young lady who took her gender identity into her own hands and became what she felt is right. Her true self.  So very Fae of her.  Her costume is that of the Statue of Liberty.  Adorable.  She bids them goodbye as I get close. She is still wary of me.

They see me and Ricardo smiles. “You know, it really isn’t fair that your costume is just you being you.”  He winks. I laugh.

“I suppose it isn’t. Next time I will show up as a sexy witch.”

Cynthia chooses this moment to speak.  “Deal!”

I laugh. “It is only a deal if I get something as well, dear.”  I wink at her.

“If I can convince him we’ll take you home with us for a night of debauchery in the next year sound like a fair deal?”

Poor Ricardo looks terrified as I say, “Deal.”

They both also feel the air change. My grin is very likely terrifying.  I wish it was not at the moment.  Cynthia says what they are both thinking, “oh fuck!”

I waggle my eyebrows, “I certainly hope so. Do convince him. I know what I am wearing next year if you do.”

He looks a little concerned. She looks predatory.  Titania mentioned she is voracious in lust. I can wait a year. Maybe less. Hopefully less.

Back to business, “Tell me, Ricardo, has Patricia ever mentioned where she is from?  I have occasionally heard a hint of a southern accent, but I can never place it. I heard it again this week and became curious.”

He eyes me suspiciously.  Good instincts.  “I am sorry, good queen, but that is not my information to disclose.”

I wink at him.  “And that is why she still loves you.  Thank you, for that.”  I really am grateful.  He will not betray her even to a monster. I get on my tip toes, pull him down by the shoulder pad, and kiss his cheek. “May you always be rewarded for doing what is right for those you love.”

Cindy gasps a little. He blushes. I feel the blessing bind to him.  He was instrumental in Patricia’s happiness.  He deserves some of his own.

“Pardon me. I think I will ask her, then.”

I am almost to her when the first obstacle appears.  Ah yes, the shield maiden being a shield from potential danger. In this case she must believe the danger is to Patricia’s virtue. Not an unfounded belief.

Connie smiles at me and bows. “Good Queen, the dress is gorgeous tonight.” I smile. Tactful and complimentary.  She is not addressing my intention and attempting to distract me with sweet talking.

I wink at her, “Thank you, I must say, the form you have taken lately shows your soul reacting to the love you are shown and the love you feel. It suits you. If you ever wish to know a night of bliss, do tell me. I would be happy to make such a night happen.”

I don’t mind letting her see that I mean it. She reacts as I believed she would and blushes.

I take that opportunity to kiss her quickly on the lips and walk on by her while she is so flustered she cannot quite process how to act.

And now for the main… distraction.  Ah, Jacqueline.  She is very much the opposite of invisible. “Hello, Jacqueline, dear.”

She looks at me and smiles. “Mab, you have a goal, and I am not sure why you need to talk with Pat right now.”

I look at this woman, “I want to know some things. She and I are friends, and I realized I don’t even know where she is from.”

Her piercing gaze would back most mortals off. I shrug.

“Dear lady, don’t play coy. You want something.”

I laugh. “Of course I do, Jacqueline. I want to know more about my best friend. I feel like I am missing large sections of her life, and this has begun to bother me.”

She squints at me and shrugs. “Have fun trying to get blood out of that stone.” She smiles and moves out of my path between her and Patricia.  Interesting.

Patricia is talking with Titania and Oberon. They are laughing and obviously at ease with one another. I walk up and wait for a moment to enter the conversation.  My sister sees me and ignores me. I expected as much.

Patricia does notice me after almost a minute and turns. She has a drink in her hand. Dangerous for a uch a lightweight. “Mab!  Oh, you look gorgeous, which is just like you.  How are you, my dear friend?”

Well, that is a thing. My heart skipped a beat. My smile is genuine. “I am great. How are you, dear?”

She chuckles and waggles her finger. “Oh, you know, doing okay. Man, so many pretty people and here I am looking like a knight.  But I do have a gorgeous thief to go home with.  Heh. Shugah stole my heart…”

She is quite inebriated.  I think I can get the information I want. “Tell me Patricia, how are you so able hide that accent?  I just heard it and that is perhaps the third time I have heard even a hint of it.”

Oberon and Titania are curious. They know I am attempting to get the same information. They don’t interrupt.

“Oh, Mab, you know I am from the south. I mostly lost the accent cuz I like being in New York.” She almost drapes herself on me. We are now nose to nose. Why is my heart racing?

“Mab?  Why are you asking?”

“Because I would love to know more about you.”  I am not lying.

She narrows her eyes. “But why?”

“Because I am utterly in love with you.”

Her shocked look doesn’t hold fear, horror, or hate.  If anything, it holds love and caring. And most worriedly, sadness. She smiles and in what is possibly the first instance of me being scared, I react with fear.  “You will not remember this conversation, my love.”  I kiss her quickly on the lips. She looks even more in shock. I lean in and whisper, “I cannot handle the rejection of the person I love.”

“Mab, what did you just do to me?”  She looks very angry. 

I wink at her. “Protected myself from you. Goodbye.”

As I leave I feel the magic take hold and I know her memory of the conversation will not enter her long-term memory. 

She will remember me talking to her but not about what and she won’t remember the kiss. Or how my breath caught when I did it. Or my confession.  Why can I not tell her yet?

Titania walks up by my side. “Dangerous to push a spell onto the ruler of THIS domain. More dangerous for any of us to be falling in love, dear sister. Especially with one as powerful as her.”

I glare at my sister. “The Maiden in the triumvirate is allowed to be in love. And I did not choose this. She stormed her way into my heart as easily as she seems capable of doing it with you.”

Titania nods. “Yes, but I have ways of coping. Our emotions are so intense they can crush us. You have not felt like this about a mortal in how long, dear sister?”

“Millenia.  No, that is a lie.  I have not ever felt it this intensely.”

“This one is deserving of love. She has it. And I wonder how much of a hand you had in it.”

I look anywhere but at her.

She sighs and embraces me. “I will not interfere.  I will continue to try and win the bet on bedding her. But I will not push her away from your love.”

I hold my sister. “Thank you, darling sister. I won’t lose that bet, but I thank you anyway.”

She laughs as we pull away and wink at one another.

It appears I will have to work with the one she loves above all others to find the information I want.

We laugh as people claim we cheated to win the group costume contest.  I mean, come on, the only other groups were Samael wearing a Dark Helmet with Mike and Yuri as Lone Star and Barf from Spaceballs and the “Bob group” that are him as Moses, along with a priest as Torquemada, and one of his other friends as King Louis. The History of the World costume group is good, I give it that. Bob’s taking his third place finish with grace.  Sammy in second is talking about using his Schwartz on us…

I love this place. It still feels like home.

***Enlightened human***

All these costumes are amazing. Even the ones that are actual costumes. May is huge and due soon. Bringing her here as my love interest from the show was hilarious.

Our resident Dark Elf walks passed us. She’s a very popular worker and gets a lot of attention.  Her “cosplay ears” are a hit. She’s also a knockout. Being a dark elf makes her exotic even to the Fae. 

Mona is in an outfit that…  wow.  I almost forgot how insanely hot that demon is. She’s flirting with mortals, Fae, and even a queen.  I see her walk up to Jackie and Pat.  Does she know how she looks at Pat?  Ugh.  Poor girl has it bad.

Todd is literally a troll… he has Beth in a knight outfit and he keeps making comments about eating her later.  The way she keeps blushing tells me he intends to.

Even the regulars are in on the fun. Bob as black Moses from the History of the World part 1.  PERFECT.

All these costumes are great and we have such a fun time.  I also notice just how many of the staff look amazing in costumes.

You know, if we made a calendar of the employees in themed outfits we could make some bank.  Put that to the side Lemar, for now.

***Human ArchFae Queen***

I may be tipsy, but I feel and see the creature that “walks” into my shop. She’s got a Medusa costume. The hair is pretty obviously fake.  The snake body is not.

I see Oberon walk up and start talking to her. I listen in. “The accords are quite clear, dear lady, you are not allowed in this part of the city.

She looks so sad. I see her nod and then she wrings her hands.  Why am I walking that way?  Oh yea, I don’t like this.  As I am walking I hear her plea. “I swear I mean no one harm and I believe this a rare opportunity to be myself without fear.  Please allow me the privilege of being here. Please, good King.”

Oberon looks conflicted.  I decide to make a stand. “Oberon, I am aware you partially own this establishment, but as per the contract of the incorporation, I,  and only I, am in charge of the operations here.  My domain.”

He looks at me and shakes his head. “You are going to start something, you know that, right?” 

I shrug. “Fine by me. Welcome little lady, to the CaFae.”

She hugs me and I know I did the right thing. “Thank you, good Queen. I am Laika.” I am not sure how she knows who I am, but that’s fine.

1nl258v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WinterPale8537/comments/1nl258v/the_shocking_incident_on_the_wizard_of_oz_1939/,The Shocking Incident on The Wizard of Oz (1939),"Hollywood’s Golden Age is often remembered for its glamour, larger-than-life stars, and magical films. But behind the curtain, many dark and shocking incidents took place that the audience never knew. One of the most shocking and untold stories comes from the set of *The Wizard of Oz* (1939), a film loved for its fantasy world but infamous for its dangerous production conditions.

The most terrifying incident involved actress **Margaret Hamilton**, who played the Wicked Witch of the West. During the famous scene where the Witch disappears in a puff of smoke, the special effects went terribly wrong. Instead of safely vanishing through a hidden elevator, a trapdoor malfunctioned, and the flames and smoke shot up too early. Hamilton’s green copper-based makeup, which was already toxic, caught fire. Her face and hands suffered severe burns, and she was rushed to the hospital. The pain was so unbearable that she could not work for weeks. Despite this, when she returned, the studio forced her to continue using the same poisonous makeup, which she had to avoid swallowing or inhaling.

But the horror didn’t stop there. Her stunt double, **Betty Danko**, later took her place for another flying broomstick scene. During filming, the broomstick’s pipe, which was filled with flammable powder to create smoke effects, suddenly exploded. Danko was thrown violently to the ground and suffered severe injuries to her legs and pelvis, spending months recovering. This shocking accident revealed how little regard studios had for the safety of their cast and crew at that time.

Even more disturbing is the fact that Judy Garland, who played Dorothy, was only 16 years old but was constantly given drugs by MGM executives to control her appearance and energy levels. She was forced to take **amphetamines to stay awake** during long shooting hours and then **barbiturates to sleep** at night. The studio even criticized her weight and put her on a strict diet of chicken soup and black coffee, forbidding her from eating real meals. This mistreatment scarred her emotionally and physically, contributing to lifelong struggles with addiction.

Another shocking detail is how the Tin Man’s actor, Buddy Ebsen, originally cast for the role, had to quit the film because the aluminum powder in his silver makeup poisoned his lungs, leaving him hospitalized. Instead of fixing the makeup problem, the studio simply recast him with Jack Haley and modified the mixture slightly, still exposing him to danger.

The audience, enchanted by Dorothy’s ruby slippers and the cheerful song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” never saw the pain, burns, poisonings, and emotional abuse behind the scenes. *The Wizard of Oz* remains a classic, but its legacy is also a chilling reminder of how Hollywood once prioritized profit over human safety.

This story shows the shocking reality of how much suffering went into creating one of the most beloved films in history. It is funny to think of Oz as a magical place, yet untold truths from the set make it one of Hollywood’s darkest fairy tales.

\*\*\*

By this point, Tommy had begun searching the hotel room. The atmosphere was gloomy and claustrophobic, with a scratchy looking bed positioned in the center of the room between two reddish end tables. The bed was aimed at a dresser that had a blank tv, along with two old paintings set on the wall beside it. Like the others in the hotel, these were dated portraits of people dressed in renaissance era clothing, set on a faded backdrop. They were no less ominous than the others, with eyes that seemed to wander. I felt a growing weariness with each second that passed.

“What are you looking for?” I said, leering at Tommy from the entryway.

“Supplies or another way out,” he replied, peering under the bed. “Take a look in that dresser. See if you can find anything. I’m gonna check out the bathroom.”

I hesitated for a moment, wary of any more unwelcome surprise, before letting out a big sigh and traipsing over to the dresser. I rummaged around the surface of the dresser and found a remote to the tv, along with some paper coffee cups and an ice bucket. None of these seemed useful, so I reached for the handle on the top drawer. As I started pulling it open, the eyes of the painting seemed to burn down at me. Then the tv turned on to white static. I looked up; the people in the paintings were now grinning at me with wide eyes and wicked teeth. In the background I heard Tommy yelling “Jeff! Get in here!”

I slammed the drawer shut, causing the tv to go black, and the paintings to return to normal. Horribly shaken, I scurried over to Tommy. He was peering behind a shower curtain in the brightly lit bathroom.

“We gotta get out of here,” I trembled, looking over my shoulder into the dark room. “You won’t believe it, those paintings in there. . .” I stammered.

“We’re in luck!” he said, stepping away from the curtain. I looked at him suspiciously, pausing for a moment before walking slowly towards the shower. As I peered behind the curtain, I saw a white tiled hallway that trailed a short way down to a rounded turn, with soft light shining in from the other side. I could hear gently flowing water, too, echoing from down the tunnel.

“Let’s go.” Tommy said from behind me. I hesitated for a moment and looked over my shoulder at him; a pale face peering at us from a dim corner in the hotel room vanished before I could even tell Tommy. He looked at my wide eyes and spun around before looking back at me confused.

“What? What did you see?” he said, shaking his head.

“Nothing; let’s just get the hell out of here.” I said, turning to scurry into the tiled hallway. Tommy followed close behind. I never needed to visit The Terror Hotel again.

  
*Chapter 7*

**The Pool Rooms**

As we rounded the corner, the floor dipped down a short ways into a few inches of gently undulating turquoise water, leading off further into the tiled hall. Knowing there was no turning back, I took a careful step down into the water. It was lukewarm, and soaked through my boots, but was actually quite soothing. Our careful steps caused echoing splashes in the water that seemed to reverberate for miles down into what I imagined was a huge complex of corridors. The hallway we were in was wide, and quickly met a junction of interconnected rooms, all made up of the same white tile. The architecture was varied but connected, blending seamlessly into one another as one uniform space.

“Which way?” I said, coming to stop.

“Follow your gut.” Tommy answered, waiting patiently for me to make a choice. I looked around at the different rooms that all lead off into well-lit areas and could not help the feeling of Deja-vu. The geometry of the walls and ceiling were like nothing I had ever seen, but the feeling was inescapable. This place looked like the hallway between a locker room and indoor pool, but was so expansive and strangely designed that it had to be out of a dream.

“This way, I guess.” I said, nodding towards a room that appeared to have a large opening around the corner. The floor led up out of the water to tiled stairs and brought us to a bridge that ran alongside a small pool. The ceiling here was high and curved down to the water, but I thought this couldn’t be the main destination for the level.

“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” I asked as we walked alongside the lightly rippling water.

“Never.” Tommy answered in an awed voice. “It’s like pools from a dreamscape.”

The path along the water led us to another medium sized room that had a large, cylindrical support protruding from a shallow pool in the center that reached up to a tall, arched ceiling. The tiled path bent around it past three frosted, trapezial windows that illuminated the area with a mellow, white light before ending at a dark doorway on the far wall. Curious, I walked over to the windows to peer through to the other side, but they were completely opaque, only letting in the light. There were no silhouettes, shapes, or blotches of color behind them, just a uniform glow of soft light.

“What do you think is back there? Should we try to break through?” I said, looking over at Tommy.

“I wouldn’t.” he replied, shaking his head. “Let’s keep moving; this place is interesting.”

I nodded in agreement, and then led us into the next dark doorway. It took us through a narrow tunnel of dimly lit, echoing, rounded hallways, before dipping down into a small, short-ceilinged room. In the center sat a spiral staircase, seamlessly connected to the white tile of the floor. As I walked to the edge to investigate, I noticed that the stairs went down into water, as if they lead to a formerly accessible section that was now flooded.

“Looks like a dead-end.” Tommy said. “I’m not interested in going diving.”

“Me neither.” I replied, growing uneasy as I gazed at the submerged stairs that disappeared into darkness. We followed the tunnel back past the room with the tall cylindrical support and then into a series of interconnected rooms. They were all made up of the same strange, tiled geometry and polygonal pools. Large, crescent indentations in the walls and perfectly symmetrical overhangs in the ceiling made each room feel unique but connected so cohesively that the design appeared intentional. There was no rhyme or reason to any of it, though; support pillars were placed oddly, rooms varied in height, length, and design, with irregular angles of light casting gradients over the architecture. I struggled to find a purpose for any of it; why was this here? Everything was so pristine, too, the tile, turquoise water, and design. Who designed this, and to what end?

The path we had taken was leading us deeper into the level now. We had passed at least a half-dozen more junctions, and I was just following my instincts, mostly mesmerized by the surreal architecture that continued to stir feelings of strange nostalgia and liminal peculiarity. The rooms seemed to grow in complexity as we wandered deeper, too. Circular indentations high up on the walls merged with the dizzying spans of flawless tile. Not one square was out of place. Each tile blended into the warps and curves of the ceilings and walls, as if laser cut and robotically placed. The fact that we had seen a stairwell going down also gave me feelings of uneasy curiosity; how big was the area beneath us, and was it entirely flooded? Was there an upper area too? How big was this place?

Although unnerving, this level gave me far less dread than the ones before. I had no idea if there would be a savage entity around the next corner, but the sound of trickling water and patches of warmth soothed me. It was like an endless bath house of divine architecture and softly illuminated rooms, leading. . .where? Where was the center; the singularity? It really felt like it was taking us *somewhere*; to some large pool or a grand entry to the complex, but the rooms just continued, almost as if they were generated. Perhaps that’s what it was; a mathematical equation, with variables that ensure irregularity but always end in perfection. A network of complexly uniform rooms, all eerily fused into one master design that produced an endless journey with no destination.

We had reached the entrance to a particularly unique area when Tommy told me to stop.

“I’ve never been to a level like this before.” Tommy said hesitantly. “I say we find a place to rest.”

Ahead of us was a long, rectangular path, leading into a vast expanse of large, ogee arches that touched from ceiling to floor. A foot or so of standing, navy-blue water reached up the feet of the arches, spanning the whole area. The rectangular path stretched further than I could see, with evenly branched paths off of it between each line of parallel arches. This section was dimly lit, obscuring areas further off in the expanse.

“I don’t think we can’t stop here,” I said matter-of-factly. “We might as well keep going until we find somewhere dry.”

“Yeah. I’m just tired, and I don’t know if it’s safe to sleep in this level.” Tommy said, stepping in the room to look around. “I’m also getting low on almond water. Seems like the sanity drain is low here, but we’re going to need more soon.”

“How do we go about finding more?” I said, wading through the warm water. Tommy was now following close behind, immersed in the repeating architecture.

“Crates, cabinets, lockers; those sorts of things. Haven’t seen any here, though.” Tommy replied. He was looking side to side at the paths on both sides through the arches that seemed to stretch into oblivion.

“This thing is a labyrinth. Don’t get us lost.” Tommy warned.

“I figure we just stay on this main path; see where it takes us.” I reassured, glancing over my shoulder at the brightly lit doorway we had come in from. I could not see any edges of the room; just endless tiled arches disappearing into the abyss. Perhaps this was the main attraction; a vast, shallow underground pool, like some kind of sensory deprivation tank in the subterranean aquifer of the level. I wondered if we would just hit the perimeter at some point and see this was a dead end, forcing us to backtrack. If there was a perimeter, it was huge; we had already walked a straight half mile down the middle path. The low ceiling, along with the arches and shallow water, made it feel like we were in some sort of subterranean drainage area, like something under a massive bridge or city sewer. It was too immaculate to be a sewer, though; more like an underground spring that was converted to a man-made cave. This was the kind of place you end up after swimming through a secret underground tunnel in a hotel pool.

By now, the light of the entry was long gone; all we could see in any direction was the evenly submerged architecture and flat ceiling stretching into darkness. The splashes of our steps echoed through the expanse, alongside the gently undulating water; I dreaded what hearing anything other than that meant.

“How far. . .do you think this goes?” I said hesitantly. Tommy didn’t reply, so I looked over my shoulder and began to ask again. He wasn’t there. I looked in every direction, searching frantically. He was nowhere to be found in the infinite halls.

“Tommy!” My voice echoed far off into the expanse; into areas I had not been. I cried out for him again, desperate for a reply. Nothing; just the sound of my voice, fading into the void. Had I left him behind? Why wouldn’t he have said something? I had to find him, so I ran back. My feet thrashed through the water, soaking my pants as I ran through the sprays. It was exhausting, but I pressed on, back towards. . .where? Where was I going? I had lost my direction. I couldn’t tell where I had come from; it all looked the same; an endless maze of arches. I fell to my knees; the lukewarm water soaked up my shirt. I was completely lost.

What now? Wait here for Tommy? When had I even lost him? How would I find him? I had already called out to him, over and over, but he was gone. Maybe he had tired out and I just didn’t notice. Why here of all places? It wasn’t fair; I was completely alone.

“Tommy.” I said disparagingly before screaming “What do I do now!”

The unfeeling expanse stood still. It did not warp or change because of my loss, being nothing other than entirely indifferent. It was dead space; a callous surrounding that was completely detached from anything happening to me. It felt darker now; no longer bringing about feelings of sublimity and frightened awe. This was just a desolate, liminal abyss now, cut off from the rest of the world. Home, and my life before, felt so far away. I was unfathomably deep in some kind of wormhole; a transitional space; a purgatory that was unimaginably large. It was the place between “here” and “there” that I wasn’t supposed to see. Not just this vast expanse of perfectly tiled pool rooms either; the whole “Back Rooms” felt this way: a series of environments that were familiar, but so expansive and lacking any identifiable purpose that the only explanation was a glitch in reality. It all felt as if I had taken a wrong turn in a department store, hotel, or locker room, and wound up on a path that appeared to lead somewhere, but in fact, went nowhere, only leading further into itself.

But what was “it.” I was still trying to figure that out. The only place I had ever been like this was in a dream, where, while inside my house, I tried going to my garage. The familiar path from my bedroom to the garage was different though. Instead of finding the usual white hallway, with family pictures and pieces of furniture, I wound up in a far larger area. It had tall ceilings and strange architecture, but was made up of the same colors and aesthetic of my house. How had I never seen this part of my home, I thought, and where would it take me? This place stretched for forever; how had I never seen this part of my house? Indeed, these “Back Rooms” were the physical manifestation of a dream scape, created solely by the mind expanding on what it has formerly seen.

I knew of spaces in “the real world” that were not so dissimilar to these sorts of uncanny environments; I had worked in them plenty of times. Perhaps it was the human element of these liminal places that gave them such an eerie vibe. They were not alien or supernatural; instead, they were made of all familiar architecture and design that appeared to have been used at some point, but had been long forgotten. Now it stood just as an empty, abandoned space, waiting for. . .what?

I was back walking again at this point, despairing but faced with no other choice but to press on. I still couldn’t wrap my head around what was going on. What Tommy had told me about us having wound up in a liminal wormhole seemed irrefutable now. I had no doubt that I was somewhere outside of reality, albeit in a less common way. The Sci-fi movies I had watched never seemed to put the characters in a place like this. It was always some sort of surreal biome, a distant planet, or a fairy land tucked behind a wardrobe, not an endless series of liminal corridors. I mean, maybe in some horror films and purgatorial scenes there were similarities, but those places were never the point of the movie. They were quite literally transitional; relevant to the storyline in some way, but what was the story here? Get out? Was that all this place was; somewhere to be left far behind? And then what would become of it? Would it simply go on existing as this vast, strange, seemingly pointless space, frozen in time?

The thought of leaving it all behind as a distant memory was appealing, but unsettling at the same time. Of course, I desperately wanted out, but this place's very existence was haunting. What would it be like to go on living, knowing all the while that somewhere between the grooves of reality lies a network of bizarre, isolated corridors that wind endlessly through. . .what? What even was “outside?” A large concrete plain with a gargantuan complex built atop it, or just some kind of void? I didn’t know if I could even trust a natural setting if I found it; where was the line between “here” and “there?” If there was the sun, trees, and sky, but I was still technically in “The Back Rooms,” then how in the hell would I know I was home? Would I ever even trust my surroundings again?

The echoing splashes of my footsteps grew faint as I wandered through the repeating arches. My senses were dulled by the infinite, symmetrical expanse and warm water, which lulled me into trance. I wondered if I might be going insane, but I didn’t feel the same as when I had been in the hotel ballroom. I was much more numb and detached, just wandering, unsure if I would ever make it out of here. I suppose this was not the worst way to die; I would eventually just lie down quietly in the water and drift off, forever lost in this subterranean pool. No one would ever find me, and I would never get to know where I truly was.

Just as I had begun to give up hope, a change in the surface of the water caught my attention. It was rippling, glazed with a stream of golden-white light. I followed the light, which took me through an array of arches where, set perfectly in the center of them, a spiral staircase. It led up into the ceiling, illuminated by light shining from above, like a holy beacon. As I approached it, I did not feel the hope or relief I had experienced with the other “exits.” I was not anxious or excited. All I felt was a muted apathy. Before I started to climb up, I took one last look out at the liminal aquifer; I was leaving Tommy here, along with a part of me. Something had changed; I wasn’t scared anymore. There was only forward; no more trying to get out of this. Maybe Tommy had found a different way out, or maybe he would wander down here forever, but as for me, I had to go.

The staircase led up a half dozen turns, bringing me closer to the bright light. I was curious but hesitant; though I had been alone for what felt like hours, the environment hadn’t changed until now. There was a strange comfort in oblivion, and I knew this place was definitely not the boiler room that we were supposed to find in the hotel. I was no closer to the exit; for all I knew, I was still days or weeks away from ever getting out.

The stairs lead me up to a room that was large and rectangular, with a very high ceiling and skywalks, almost like some sort of Olympic pool room. Shallow canals of water branched through walkways in the floor, leading to drainage areas low on the walls, while the skywalk above led to dark openings that caught my attention. I could not help but wonder where they went, but the path to get up there was unclear. The lower level had at least five different routes, but I figured “up” was the only real sense of direction I had. Maybe I could reach the top of the structure and find a way out; what was above this place?

I followed a walkway across the water and then into a round ceilinged hall that I thought might take me up. Instead, it stopped in a medium-sized room with a polygonal pool in the center that occupied most of the floor space. The water gleamed with champagne light from a wide, trapezoid window, centered on the wall next to the pool. It was frosted and completely opaque, and seemed to shine brighter on a small, triangular peninsula of cream-colored tile. The whole floor was almost completely level with the water, where even a small wave would wash over it, but the sublimity of the space was unmistakable, like a summer day by the pool.

Whether it was my declining sanity or exhaustion and exceptional weariness from wandering for God knows how long, I wanted to lie down. My last “rest” had been in the office, back when I had first met up with Tommy. . . I hadn’t even really thought about him being gone yet; the environment had lulled me too much. Him being gone was. . .horrible. I had lost my only companion in this terrible place and couldn’t help but feel guilty. He had saved me more times than I could count, and I just left him. The thought of him down there alone, wandering endlessly, abandoned, wondering where his friend went; I couldn’t take it. What had I done? He was the only one here who cared about me.

I paced over to the peninsula and sat down, overcome with grief. To be alone here was miserable, and though it had started out like that, having Tommy, only to lose him hours later, made the loneliness that much worse. Going back and looking for him just seemed like a futile way of coping with the reality that he was gone; I knew there was no hope in finding him down there. I had wandered miles trying to find him, and the choice to take the stairs was not out of selfishness, but survival. That said, if he *did* find his way up, I should be visible. That’s what I would do, rest at the top of the stairs.

As I stood up to leave the poolside, a scrap of paper slipped out of my pocket down by the water’s edge. I looked at it curiously, having no recollection of its presence in my pocket, before swiping it up. It was a note, but not one I had written.

  
*Jeff,*

*I don’t know when or where you’ll find this, but I’m guessing when you do, you will want an explanation. After our close encounter with the moth in the hotel, I wrote this note to warn you that there is a chance that The Back Rooms will separate us. While getting lost is always a possibility, being separated by this places' nonlinear physical properties is more likely. There are many unconfirmed links between levels, and I’m guessing one of us found one and ended up no-clipping to a different level.*

*I didn’t tell you about this because I did not want it to scare you. This place feeds on fear, and I knew your sanity would drain quickly with the ever-present threat of being isolated again. Ignorance is bliss, right?*

*Well, the cold truth is that I am not sure if we will ever meet again. I’ve heard of a place called “The Hub” that has doors to every level in The Back Rooms. It’s a hidden level and looks like an underground car tunnel. As far as getting there, if you see a brown, metal door that looks out of place, no matter which level you are on, take it. I don’t know if it will get us any closer to escaping, but it’s the only reliable rendezvous point for getting back together.*

*I hope we make it out, Jeff. I’ll wait for you at the hub as long as I can.*

*Tommy*

  
I stared at the letter in disbelief, and then sighed, looking up at the ceiling. With no clear path out, and levels that now apparently teleported people at random, I could hardly hold on to the hope of getting home. I was quite literally in an unending nightmare, with impossible hurdles at seemingly every turn. Maybe there was no way out of here, and every soul unfortunate enough to come into contact with The Back Rooms was damned. I had nothing anymore; my phone was dead, my partner gone, and my sense of direction completely extinguished. The only thing I had to hold onto was getting to The Hub to see Tommy. I would have to fight total despair to see this thing through; I didn’t want to die. I wasn’t gonna just be another skeleton in liminal hell; I was going to make it out and tell my story.

These pool rooms were, at the very least, the most mellow place I had been in since I started this whole trip, which brought up the question, where exactly was I when this bad dream started? It had to be somewhere behind that first locked door; somewhere in Caius; the place where the fabric of reality ripped, and I fell in. This couldn’t be some kind of outrageous government experiment; it was too vast, horrible, and nonsensical to be of any use to politicians. The reality was far stranger than an evil experiment. It was as if I was in a procedurally generated environment from a haywire computer, lost in space that had no ongoing purpose. A forsaken limbo.

The absence of entity sightings and general calm of this gently illuminated peninsula was a mild antidote to my melancholy; I would rest here for the time being. Drink some almond water, try and get some sleep; anything to keep my mind at ease. Sanity was the currency here. It still felt strange to relax in a place so far away and liminal, but, part of me embraced it; a million miles from nowhere, lounged out next to a shallow pool no one even knows exists. It was like I was embracing being forgotten; committed to the void. Tucked away in this tiled labyrinth, far, far away from any other soul. No reason to fight it; just me and infinity. Mortal impermanence.

  
\*\*\*

  
I wasn’t sure how long I slept; it felt like at least six hours, and when I awoke, the sunlight seemed to be coming in through my bedroom window. As I rolled over and opened my eyes, the same, trapezoidal window casting soft, indifferent light across the still water and white tile took shape. The room hadn’t changed at all since I fell asleep; I was still in the middle of a surreal expanse of tiled pool rooms with the echoes of gently undulating water radiating through the endless corridors. Sleep had made me feel better; it was the most normal thing I had done in the last three days, and although lying here was preferable to exploring more, I had to keep moving.

Before leaving, I took a long look around the room that had given me my only real rest in the last 3 days. I held onto the feeling, savoring it; making sure I wouldn’t forget. I wanted to revisit this place in my mind someday, at a time when the crushing weight of the world and mortality was too much. I could think back to here, where there is nothing; back to a pure, enveloping, void who’s inescapably isolating atmosphere was unlike any place I had ever been. It was a break from everything; a nostalgia devoid of subsistence; a dreamlike peculiarity, totally separated from everything else.

My time of respite and reflection had given me a subtle appreciation for this experience, even in spite of the overwhelming horror. Whatever this place was, its novelty and strange effects on the human experience were powerfully unique, and aside from just getting home to safety, deep down, I desperately hoped that I would make it out so that I could unpack this whole thing and tell my story. I had never been to a place so bizarre and anomalous.

My plan was to try and find a way up to the skywalk that lined the perimeter of the tall room I had originally come in on. I traced my way back to that Olympic-pool room, and then took the first path that appeared to go up. It led me through a hall of stilted arches connected to the ceiling, with shallow, warm water reaching up their tiled legs. The hallway then ended at a stainless-steel ladder that I climbed up, taking me into a large chamber that had oval windows high up the left wall. Their grayish-blue light stretched across the tile path towards a large depression in the floor. It dropped at least twenty feet down into a bowl-shaped pool, appearing to have been drained of water. This depression rounded up the wall all the way to the ceiling with a sharp drop off next to the path. There would be no way out if I fell in; the walls were too steep to climb out of.

I stayed along the wall by the windows, wary of getting trapped until someone decided to fill the deep pool again. The walkway led to another room that had a tiled, square staircase leading up, which I followed for a short ways before it plateaued into a corridor that was illuminated by three circular windows. They cast irregular gradients of light along the tiled walls and polygonal pool, giving the room a distinct appearance of being basked in morning sunlight. Then, I noticed a square doorway out onto the skywalk, and immediately scurried past the pool towards it. My stomach churned as I looked down at the three-story drop, but I could see the spiral staircase I had come in from.

The walkway thankfully had a rounded, steel railing at waist height, which I kept my hand on while peering down at the floor below. I tried to push out thoughts of falling as I followed the skywalk along the top of the lengthy room, and couldn’t help but wonder about where all these hallways led to. The corridors of this place seemed to go on for miles, like a million hotel pools from a dream, winding like a maze that had no end. The image of perfectly geometric, tiled pool rooms stretching off into oblivion brought an overwhelming feeling of minimization, as I was an ant faced with crossing a football field. Getting lost was inevitable, and there was so much around me that I couldn’t even perceive.

As I gazed down at the dim, circular opening of the spiral staircase to the aquifer below, I thought of Tommy. Was he still down there, or had he no-clipped to another level? It didn’t really matter now; we were separated, and thinking about just how alone I really was brought a familiar, desolate feeling. I paused, staring out at the tiled expanse; one last look before I went. Forgetting this place was impossible; these bizarre halls and pools would go on existing in this weird purgatorial state forever. I might be leaving, but *they* will not be gone; their very existence would remain as an unnerving reminder to me that, somewhere between the threads of reality, there is a place so peculiar and anomalous; a place of unexplained corridors and rooms, all sharing an unmistakable theme of liminality and the feeling that you’re not supposed to be there. A kind of modern purgatory; this place was not meant for man to see; not meant to explored. It was to be left as is; a space between reality and heaven; the loading zone for matter before it is perceived.",1,1758284621.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

I could really use some advice. I’m 36, living in the US, but I’m not originally from here. Back home it felt easier to make friends—school, neighbors, coworkers… somehow connections just happened naturally.

Here, I’ve noticed it’s much harder. People are nice, but conversations often stop at small talk. I’d love to build deeper, long-term friendships, not just acquaintances.

A bit about me:  
I enjoy traveling, exploring food spots, music, and coffee ☕  
I’m friendly, open-minded, and love good conversations  
I’m looking for people who want genuine, lasting connections

So my question is:  
👉 How do you go from “casual chats” to actual *friendship* as an adult—especially in a new country? Any tips or personal experiences would mean a lot!

I love almost everything about autumn—except the huge piles of fur when my pup blows his coat.

This is just one brushing; I can pull this much a few times a day if he’d let me.

The coffee mug is for scale, not for serving up an “Aussie latte.”

Fellow Aussie folks: how do you keep the tumbleweeds at bay? Any deshedding hacks or favorite brushes that can stand up to the fur-pocalypse?

PS: Mug is a hand-painted Karen Donleavy Designs piece—highly recommend if you’re an Aussie art fan!

Chapter 1 On the eve of her wedding, Malayah Hudson discovered her fiancé, Desmond Martinez, whom she thought was left disabled by a car accident, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, passionately entwined with another woman. Resolute, she called her mother, ""Mom, I'm leaving the country in seven days. Can you help me make the arrangements?"" ""At last, you've come to your senses. Desmond never truly cared for you. Holding onto him won't lead to anything worthwhile,"" Holly Hudson's gentle voice carried a hint of relief. ""Come to Paris. We not only have the art you love but also plenty of charming gentlemen. You'll be swept off your feet."" ""Alright, I'll finish things up here and head over."" After the call, Malayah quietly walked from the living room to the bedroom door. Inside, the two had already moved to the bed. ""Desmond, you staged a car accident back then to break up with Malayah, pretending to be crippled and blind. I never thought she'd be so devoted, taking care of you all this time."" ""You're not planning to marry her, are you?"" Waverly Bell pouted beneath him, displeased. ""You should have always been mine."" ""Waverly, you're the only one I love. In seven days, I'll have her kidnapped. If she doesn't show up at the wedding, I can naturally have a new bride,"" Desmond murmured as he kissed Waverly's lips, but his words sent chills down Malayah’s spine. ""If she hadn't insisted on caring for me back then, I wouldn't have kept up this act for so long. I'm worn out."" Malayah couldn’t believe it was all a charade! She had returned drenched from the rain just to bring Desmond some coffee. Since the accident, his legs would ache on rainy days. Shivering slightly, her long hair stuck to her face. Compared to the warmth inside the bedroom, she seemed pitiful. Desmond's cold words shattered her heart completely. ""Waverly, hold on for seven more days, and I'll marry you."" With a loud ""Bang!"" the two inside the room quickly separated. Desmond's eyes snapped to the door. ""Who’s there?"" Malayah swallowed her tears. ""I accidentally spilled the coffee I made for you."" She crouched down, picking up the scattered glass shards. On hearing this, Desmond stiffened for a moment, then hurriedly pushed Waverly away, got dressed, and sat in his wheelchair, motioning for Waverly to wheel him out. He remembered he had to keep pretending to be blind. ""When did you get back? Waverly was just helping with some work, and I didn’t notice you,"" he kept his gaze above Malayah’s head, gripping the wheelchair tightly, probing as he spoke. Malayah wasn't fooled. She bit her lip, ""Just came in. You can carry on. I'll make more coffee."" The coffee was still hot, the glass shattered, staining her fingertips with blood. The spreading red was nothing compared to the pain in her heart. She had met Desmond at her graduation ceremony. He had been invited to speak as a successful alumnus. The moment he appeared, Malayah was struck by his presence. She pursued him fervently, joined his company, mirrored his interests, and naturally, they ended up together, until she mentioned marriage. The day after she brought up marriage, Desmond had the car accident. From the accident until now, three years had passed. During those three years, she had sacrificed everything, including her career, family, and dreams, to study alternative medicine and nutrition, striving to help Desmond walk again, regain his vision. Yet now, it was all an illusion! She looked down at her hands, once meant for sketching, now only covered in a thin layer of calluses. Clutching the glass shards tightly, she let the blood stain her fingertips. She raised her head and stared fiercely at the pair of traitors. Desmond frowned, irritated. ""I’ve told you my legs and eyes will never heal. Why do you keep doing these things every day? Are you reminding me that I’m a cripple?"" Malayah stood there, silent and expressionless, staring at him. Throughout these three years, because of his condition, she had tolerated his mood swings and occasional outbursts. Falling from grace and unable to bear his impotence, his drastic change in behavior was somewhat understandable. Malayah forced a laugh. Her chest heaving with anger, she finally composed herself. ""Fine, if you don’t like it, I’ll stop."" Desmond, we’re done. Desmond seemed surprised. Just as he was about to speak, Malayah had already turned toward the kitchen. She tossed the expensive ingredients she'd specifically bought into the trash. Since Desmond didn’t care about her efforts or her love, she decided to take it all back. She glanced at the calendar. March 27th was the wedding day. She had marked it with a little heart. Looking back now, it was bitterly ironic.

Chapter 2 Waverly Bell left her house and headed straight for the kitchen, where she raised an eyebrow at Malayah Hudson. ""Desmond still needs your care, Malayah."" Her tone was mocking, and her slightly open collar revealed faint marks on her neck. Malayah took a quick glance but remained unfazed. ""No need for you to worry."" Waverly scoffed and turned to leave. As soon as she closed the door, Malayah’s phone buzzed softly. She looked down to see a photo sent by Waverly. Desmond had Waverly in his arms, kissing her tenderly—a scene full of intimacy. Moreover, Desmond’s gaze was directed at the camera, filled with a tenderness Malayah hadn’t seen in the last three years. Her heart felt pierced, the pain overwhelming, making it hard to breathe. She clutched her chest as tears dripped into the sink. Years of affection and almost everything she had invested had led to this moment, leaving Malayah feeling as if her heart was being torn apart. ""Malayah, are you done yet? I'm exhausted; we need to rest. Come over and help me,"" Desmond called from the other room. Malayah entered to see Desmond sitting in his wheelchair, his gaze unfocused. He was acting, and it seemed a shame he hadn't won an Oscar for it. She looked at him coolly and said, ""It's been three years, and you still haven't learned how to get into bed?"" “Who stays stuck in despair as long as you do?” Desmond didn’t catch the sarcasm in her voice, only assuming she was tired of caring for him. ""Malayah, are you fed up with me now? Why did you propose to me in the first place? I'm just a wreck, a complete waste!"" His tone was agitated. In the past, Malayah would have immediately comforted him when he spoke like this. After hesitating for a few seconds, she helped Desmond into bed, but there was no trace of affection in her eyes. Once Desmond was in bed, he suddenly pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her tightly. His tone softened, ""I'm sorry, Malayah, I spoke out of turn. I didn't mean it; I just feel I’m not worthy of you in my current state."" ""Sorry, sorry..."" ""I've embarrassed you."" He always did this—after venting, he would begin to apologize for his words and actions. Malayah's soft heart would always forgive him. She closed her eyes lightly, suppressing the indescribable emotions within her. After a while, she turned, her gaze falling instantly on the lipstick stain on his pajamas. It must have been from his kiss with Waverly, or perhaps intentionally left by her. Malayah took a deep breath. ""Rest well; I’ll be sleeping in the study tonight."" With that, she left without looking back. Desmond instinctively tried to reach for her, but his hand was too slow, capturing only air. Watching Malayah leave without hesitation, an inexplicable frustration welled up within him. What did she mean by this? Three years had passed, and she wasn’t pretending anymore. Was she disgusted with him? He thought her love had no expiration date, but clearly, it was just shallow. Malayah returned to the study, sitting there through the night. Her mind was filled with memories of her time with Desmond. Over the past three years, she proposed five times. It was only last month that Desmond finally accepted. She had been ecstatic, arranging their wedding, setting a date for their photoshoot, joyfully writing invitations to their friends. Looking back now, it was all a joke she’d played on herself. Her supposed deep affection had only ever moved her, while Desmond didn't care at all. Unable to sleep, Malayah found herself with dark circles under her eyes the next morning. She was preparing breakfast when she received a call from the photographer, ""Miss Hudson, weren't you scheduled to take your wedding photos today? Why haven't you arrived?"" ""We won’t be taking wedding photos..."" Before she could finish, Desmond's voice came from nearby, ""Malayah, are you canceling because of my legs?"" He was bowing his head, his hand gripping his pant leg tightly. Malayah looked at him calmly and said, ""We’ll be there shortly; please wait."" At the photo shoot location, Malayah emerged in a wedding dress while Desmond wore a suit. The photographer encouraged them to get closer, smiling, ""You two make a lovely couple."" Despite Desmond's disability, his appearance was flawless. Malayah remained silent, and Desmond discreetly glanced at her. For some reason, he felt a chill emanating from her. That morning, the regular cup of coffee was missing, and the breakfast she prepared was perfunctory. Eating it left a bad taste in his mouth. Photographer: ""Get a bit closer, you two. You're engaged, so why so distant?"" Malayah didn’t move. Desmond instinctively tilted his head and turned his wheelchair, trying to get closer to Malayah. Just then, his phone rang. He fumbled to take it out, glanced at it, and answered. A few seconds later, Desmond spoke apologetically, ""Malayah, there’s an urgent matter at the office. I need to leave right away. Could we postpone the wedding photos?"" ""Let's take them another day."" Malayah replied coolly, ""Go handle your work."" Desmond was swiftly escorted away, leaving Malayah watching his retreating figure. Her lips parted momentarily. Desmond, we'll never have wedding photos in this lifetime.

Chapter 3 The photographer stood motionless, watching the bride left behind. Malayah Hudson spoke coolly, “We won’t be taking the wedding photos. I’ll still cover the cost.” She left the photography set and went to her workplace to inform her boss of her resignation. She had five different part-time jobs, selected to accommodate her studies in chiropractic and nutrition. Leaving them was straightforward enough. Finally, she went to see Dereck Ray, the experienced chiropractor who had been mentoring her. With a warm smile, Dereck greeted her, “Malayah, you’re early today. Come on, I'll show you a new technique. It might help your boyfriend's leg.” Malayah offered a faint smile, “No need, sir.” “Oh? Did you two break up?” She shook her head, “No, he just doesn't want me to treat him anymore.” Dereck hesitated, wanting to say more, but Malayah simply nodded. “Thank you for everything these past few years.” For the past three years, Dereck had supported her through emotional breakdowns. “Ah, there’s no need to thank me,” he said. “But don’t worry too much about his leg. He’ll be able to stand on his own again.” Malayah nodded without expression. Yes, he would stand again, but not with her. Back home, she began packing up all the recipes she had developed over the years. Her study, once filled with easels and sketchbooks, was now crowded with books on anatomy, charts, and medical texts. It's often said that prolonged illness makes a person their own doctor; Malayah was just shy of qualifying for a medical license. As she packed, she stumbled upon a dusty box containing letters she’d once written to Desmond Martinez. There was a time when he loved her, replying to every letter with affection. Malayah recalled Desmond’s words when they first started dating: “In this fast-paced world, you’re still writing love letters? That’s adorable, Malayah.” Spreading the letters across the table, she struck a match and watched as the flames consumed them, erasing all traces of her love. Meanwhile, her phone continued to ring. After the fire had fully burned out, she glanced at her phone. A slew of photos from Waverly Bell greeted her. They were wedding photos of Desmond and Waverly. As she swiped through the images, her heart grew heavier with each one. It felt as though a piece of her heart had been hollowed out, a chilling breeze blowing through the emptiness. The so-called “business matter” Desmond was attending to turned out to be a wedding photoshoot with Waverly. A solitary tear splashed onto her phone screen. Holding her phone, Malayah finally allowed herself to cry openly. For three years, she had endured Desmond’s indifference, while he showered his affections on another woman. Waverly's message taunted, “Take a good look at who Desmond truly loves.” “You’re just a distraction for him. If you had any sense, you’d step aside willingly.” “The one marrying him can only be me.” Malayah lowered her eyes, wiping away her tears. “Waverly, as you wish.” Desmond didn’t come home that night. Malayah, however, didn’t confront him, quietly packing her belongings instead. She continued to sleep in the study. In the middle of the night, her phone rang; it was Desmond. “Malayah, I’m out discussing business and had a bit to drink. It’s quite late—can you come pick me up?” “Malayah? You’re all I have. Can you come?” Malayah glanced at the time—3:30 a.m. What kind of business meeting goes this late into the night? She didn't call him out on the lie but instead got up, silently putting on her coat. “Okay, I’ll come get you.”

Chapter 4 The Twilight Bar buzzed with energy when Malayah Hudson arrived; the private room was drenched in neon lights, and the music thumped loudly. On stage, Desmond Martinez, who was typically confined to a wheelchair, sat on a high stool, strumming his guitar while singing love songs. He was free-spirited — a side Malayah had never seen before. His gaze was tender as he looked at Waverly Bell, standing like a star beneath the stage lights. With a gentle smile, he spoke into the microphone, ""Waverly, I love you. Let's get married."" Malayah stood at the entrance, her legs feeling like lead, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. How could she reconcile three years of emotions? Love and hate intertwined within her mind, and she wished she could rush in and demand an explanation. Why couldn't he just tell her he didn't want to marry her, instead of shattering her heart? Was her love truly so worthless? The crowd erupted at Desmond's declaration. ""Kiss! Kiss!"" Waverly shyly bowed her head. Desmond set down his guitar, climbed down from the stage, and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her in for a kiss. The spectators cheered wildly. After the kiss, Desmond tidied Waverly’s clothes and hair. Then someone remarked loudly, ""Desmond, but your wedding is in six days; did Malayah agree to the breakup?"" ""She’s clung to you so desperately over these years. Will she let go easily?"" ""Yeah, she even went to the doctor for your leg, she was so pathetic. I still have that photo."" ""Desmond, why was she so easy to manipulate?"" Desmond simply held Waverly on the couch, shooting his wheelchair a disdainful glance, ""She chose to."" Malayah bit her lip until it nearly bled. She leaned against the wall, feeling weak, her mind blank. Yet, this time, there was a sense of inevitability. Her heart didn’t feel as shattered as before. Just like Desmond said, she chose this path. Even if she stumbled and got hurt along the way, there was no one else to blame. At that moment, someone suggested, ""Desmond, let’s play a game. Want to try it? Waiting for Malayah to arrive..."" Malayah steadied herself, then tapped on the partially open door to the private room. Her eyes settled on Desmond Martinez, who had resumed his place in the wheelchair. She walked over, ""Desmond, I came to take you home."" Suddenly, someone viciously kicked Desmond’s wheelchair, sending him tumbling to the floor. His rowdy friends chimed in, ""You’re Desmond’s girlfriend? Desmond just lost a bet, and we were going to make him drink as a penalty, but look at him, blind and crippled. Why don’t you drink for him?"" Malayah saw the table was already covered in opened bottles. She turned her gaze to Desmond, her eyes meeting his. She knew he could see. ""Desmond, what do you want?"" ""Malayah, you play, you pay."" Malayah let out a bitter laugh, tears pooling. What a phrase, ""You play, you pay."" This was Desmond’s chance to prove himself. He knew she was allergic to alcohol. In their most tender times, Desmond would protect her from drinking at gatherings, saying indulgently, ""With me here, my girlfriend never has to drink."" Malayah downed one bottle after another. The liquor was cold. Yet her heart burned, feeling like it was ready to burst into flames. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Desmond watching her the entire time, as if observing a performer. Was every moment of her supposed deep affection seen as entertainment by him? Perhaps Waverly was right; Desmond didn’t love her. It was all just a game. The people around urged her on while Desmond remained silent and detached, watching as she finished the drinks. Malayah staggered, her figure unsteady, and as she walked toward Desmond, someone tripped her, sending her sprawling to the ground, pain shooting through her body. ""Desmond, are you satisfied?""

Chapter 5 Malayah Hudson fainted. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm. Her skin itched slightly, making her want to scratch it. Before she could, a hand gently stopped her. A familiar, calm voice said, ""Don't scratch. I'll put some ointment on

We’ve been riding in the car for the better part of \[one hour\], and Charlie has abjectly refused to tell me where we’re headed. Right after I’d finished my coffee, he’d practically pushed me out the door to the car. As I was getting into my seat, he placed a small black case into the rear sitting area as he got into the driver’s seat.

*What’s in the case? And why is he so excited?*

“I think you might like this place, Kosie. If you want to experience some purely human pastimes, this is where you go.”

He steered to the right, towards a small building with a multitude of cars in front of it.

*Bold City Shooters? What is this place?*

Charlie parks the car, and I slowly get out while he reaches back for the small case. I hear loud bangs coming from behind the facility.

“What is it you brought me here for?” I ask, my patience beginning to wane.

“We’re going to partake in one of the most American things on Earth.”

I sigh at his theatrics. “And that is?”

“We’re gonna go shoot guns.”

*Guns? As in kinetic weaponry?*

“You brought me out here to use firearms?”

“Great idea, isn’t it? I had the thought last night, and I wanted to see if you liked it.”

He’s obviously very excited about this.

*Can’t hurt to try.*

I lash my tail and try bobbing my head to tell him I liked it. Charlie’s face splits with his smile.

We walk into the small building, and Charlie pays while I look at all the firearms racked on the walls behind the counter.

*There’s so many!*

“Alright, I rented a Remington 700 and a Glock 40 for you to try out, along with enough ammo for what should be a few hours. Here, hold this, my arms are full.”

Charlie hands me a long thin weapon, surprisingly heavy for its size. I heft the firearm, inspecting it, and nearly drop it when Charlie yells.

“Whoa! Kosif, stop!” He holds his arm out like he’s about to grab the gun from me.

I freeze. *Oh no. Did I screw up already?*

“That one’s on me. First rule of guns: if you’re not using them, point the barrel at the sky or the ground. No exceptions.”

I dip my head as my tail twitches in embarrassment. “I’ve never used a kinetics weapon. Sorry.”

“Hey, no problem. Just… don’t do that again. Now let’s go shoot stuff.”

Charlie grabs two curved clamps, then we walk out the rear door into the actual range. Loud bangs constantly assault my ears, and I wince. My tail slowly sways back and forth. Charlie holds out one of the clamps to me.

“You’ll need this, unless you want to be deaf very early in life.”

I hold them for a moment, wondering what to do. Charlie slips his pair over his fleshy ears.

*Oh, these go over my earholes. Why don’t I catch on to these things faster?*

The ear covers squeeze my head gently, and the world outside goes nearly silent. Charlies waves his hand, beckoning me to follow him. He places his cargo onto a worn wooden table, and pops open the black case. Inside is a weapon like one of those he rented. It’s a small black firearm shaped like an \[L\], only slightly bigger than its rented counterpart. We sit down, and he shows me how to load and unload the gun I was handed, along with the other two. I also learn the two rules about guns.

First, the bad end of the boom stick only points to things I want to see through, and second, keep my booger hook off the bang switch until I’m ready to bring the hate.

After a few demonstrations, I get the hang of it and Charlies hands me a heavy box and points at an open stall. I bring the padded butt of the rifle to my shoulder like Charlie showed me. One claw goes under the barrel to aim, the other to the trigger. I lean my head down, shrugging my shoulder until my eye lines up with two metal blocks on the very end of the gun.

I sight a metal disc hanging from a chain far down the range. One eye closes automatically, and I line up the small metal blocks onto the target. My claw drifts to the trigger, and I pull. A bang penetrates through the ear covers, and the rifle kicks back with a surprising amount of force. Surprised, I take a step backwards, lowering the gun and turning to Charlie. He’s holding up two of his clawless ‘thumbs’ and smiling, so I must have done good. I look back down range.

My tail lashes in pride as I see the small disc swinging from the impact.

*I’m not too bad at this.*

The next few hours show me that I still have a lot to learn. I’m not too bad, but not all that great either. By the time we reach the end of our ammo, it’s about a 70-30 chance for whether I hit my target or not. The small firearms were hard to get used to, especially because I was afraid the gun would hit me in the face with how much recoil it had.

The ‘Remington’, Charlie called it, was where I seemed to shine. I certainly enjoyed using that one, and Charlie said we’ll have to do this again soon. I, for one, agree.

My setup: daily 16:8, plus once a month I go 7 days of one-meal-a-day and finish with two full fasting days.

The issue: I crash hard between lunch and dinner. Skipping breakfast is fine, but late afternoon I lose a lot of physical and mental energy - tough with my lifestyle.

What I do now: water, electrolytes, bone broth, creatine, and morning coffee.
What I want: strategies to fine-tune energy without giving up fasting (it’s been great for my body and bloodwork).
