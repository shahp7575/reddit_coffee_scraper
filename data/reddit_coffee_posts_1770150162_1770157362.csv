FEEDBACK WELCOME.,"I kept seeing small brands and creators struggle with the same thing, they want to run ads or post product content, but professional shoots, models, and editing cost a lot.

Most people I know can’t afford ₹5k–₹20k per shoot just to test ads.

So I started building a small tool that lets you upload a product photo and turn it into a short marketing video with an AI avatar doing the presentation part.

No camera. No studio. No complicated editing.

It’s still early and rough around the edges, but the goal is simple:

Make it possible for small businesses & remote people in remote parts to create decent-looking ad videos for the price of a coffee instead of a full shoot.

I’m not here to sell anything. I genuinely want feedback from people who sell products or run ads:

– Would this actually help you?

– What would make this more useful?

– What would stop you from using something like this?

Happy to share what I’m building if anyone’s curious.",1,1770157215.0,16mm,0,1.0,False

Red Flags (being honest) 
·Can seem emotionally distant before trust is built •Slow to open up; observes first, reveals later 
· Needs space to process instead of immediately talking things out ·Pulls back if communication feels inconsistent or unclear · Not naturally expressive in text 
·Won't chase someone who isn't curious back · If the vibe feels forced, I won't force it 
Beige Flags (depends on you) · Works a lot when focused · Can disappear briefly during deep work phases ·Not a constant texter · Dry humor / deadpan delivery · Not into clubbing ·Enjoys quiet dates (coffee, walks, bookstores, cooking) 
·Will nerd out about food, music, books, or random interests 
Green Flags 
· Respects time, energy, and boundaries ·Comfortable with quiet and presence ·Can banter and have serious conversations 
·Listens more than he talks (but talks well when it matters) · Consistent once invested 
·Gentle without being passive ·Makes plans and follows through · Acts the same online and in person

1qv60za,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1qv60za/trip_report_tips_with_children/,Trip report - tips with children,"I picked up some useful tips here so hopefully this helps others...

Travelled form the UK with a baby and a 3 year old. 3 days, 2 nights. That amount of time felt about right - the children were exhausted by the end. 

Overall, really enjoyed it and hope to go again. 3 yr old absolutely loved it. The vibe was great, staff fab and the park looked great. 

- Travel

Driving from the UK is really easy. Once you're on the French side it's an absolute breeze. Having the car meant we didn't need to worry about putting luggage in the bag storage on arrival. 

- Accomodation

Stayed at Newport Bay. Very solid. 

Easy arrival. Parked up no problem and went straight to the parks. 

Room was spacious. Nice and cozy. Very handy dressing room/washroom between the room and main bathroom. With small kids it was a useful area for sorting bags etc. while the children were asleep. Coffee machine good. 

Bit of a walk to the room from reception and there's a real bottleneck at the lift on return, which isn't ideal with a pram. Definitely worth finding the smaller entry doors which take you directly into the ground floor corridors. 

- Food

Take snacks! 

Refilling water bottles is easy.

We found the restaurants with mobile ordering to be excellent. Children's meals €10. Adults €15-€20. Options were more varied than I'd expected. Decent quality and portion sizes and the restaurants were comfortable. 

Rainforest Cafe was really good. Nice break from the park and there's lots for children to look at with the fish tanks, animal decor and thunder effect.

- Rides

3yr old loved Big Thunder and Buzz, each of which we did 5-6 times. Well worth doing both during the Magic hr. Baby swap worked well on Big Thunder. Pirates, Small World, Autopia, both Cars rides, Dumbo, Aladdin's Carpets, Slinky, Riverboat and Teacups all enjoyable. The only ride I didn't really rate was Pinocchio.

We did a few adult rides as well using either single rider or taking advantage of a short queue in the first hr. 

- Queues

We never queued much more than 15 mins and used the app heavily to try and avoid queing. While we could have done rides like Spiderman it was generally a 35min+ queue. I think we'd do rides like thay again in a few years when the children are older.

If you can keep the children going it's definitely worth doing a few rides later in the evening when a lot of queues reduce.  Pirates, for example, we never waited more than 5 minutes as the queue only really developed during the middle part of the day. 

- Entertainment

All the shows were excelllent. Lion King the strongest,  followed by Philarmagic and then Frozen. We waited for 15 mins or so for the Lion King but could have joined the queue later and walked into Philarmagic a few minutes before it started. Frozen is in a smaller venue and fills up faster so required a bit of waiting. 

- Characters

Wasn't sure how he'd respond to it but my son was keen to meet some characters once he'd seen them in the park. The interactions are really good and the cast members do a great job making it fun for the children.

The waits can be quite long so best to use it as some planned downtime. Alternatively, we had one adult wait in the line while the other took the children elsewhere for a while. 

- Fireworks/nighttime show

Really good. Loved the light projections on Main st, the drones were seriously impressive. 

- Misc

Videopolis was a handy place to regroup, refill water bottles and have a break. There are a couple of screen in there showing cartoons and it was very quiet when we were there. 

I can't think of and other practical points off the top of my head but if anyone has questions I'll try and answer.",1,1770156752.0,disneylandparis,0,1.0,False

If you’ve ever sat through a meal at a restaurant just to feel normal with friends or a partner, while the only thing you could manage was 9.5+ pH water—and everyone else ate freely and sipped red wine—you’re not alone. If you’ve ever hosted a holiday gathering, poured yourself into making it special, and still couldn’t take part in the food you prepared—you’re not alone. And if you’ve ever found yourself crying in the bathtub as a grown adult because this has hijacked your life and drained it of energy, happiness, and color—you’re not alone.



I’m incredibly fortunate to have an understanding and supportive partner, friends, and family—people who kept urging me to keep searching for answers to my swallowing issues (dysphagia), even when I wanted to give up. But the truth is, even with that support, I still felt profoundly alone—until I found this community and read your stories. Your fear. Your exhaustion. Your “just f\*ck it” moments (I’ve had those too).



I know there are countless devastating illnesses in the world—MS, ALS, cancer, and so many others. But there’s something uniquely brutal about a condition that can take over your daily life while remaining widely misunderstood and easily dismissed. So before I share anything else, I want to thank you. Truly. You kept me steady on nights I cried in bed, and on flights where I sat staring at a tray table, grieving something as basic as eating and drinking without thinking about it.



This community is proof that people across different backgrounds—different politics, religions, and identities—can become one another’s lifeline. In so many moments, we are each other’s support system when no one else knows what it’s like to live this.

On September 10, 2024, at around 8:52 a.m., I was settling into a Mexican-style coffee shop in Brooklyn, ready to eat scrambled eggs and drink my second iced latte of the morning… fine, it was my third. I took the first bite like an optimistic person who still believed in a functional esophagus, flipped open my laptop, and prepared to re-enter the corporate hunger games.



Everything felt normal—until I swallowed and the food reached the area around my Adam’s apple.



It wasn’t painful. It wasn’t dramatic. It was just… wrong. Like my throat suddenly remembered it had opinions. I swallowed again, and with a sip of iced latte, it seemed to go down. I told myself it was nothing—just a weird swallow, a fluke, a one-time glitch in the system.



Then I took a second bite.



This time, it did not go down. Not even a little. Even with the latte, it felt so stuck that I launched out of my seat like I was auditioning for a role called *Man Panics Quietly in Public.* I lunged for the refrigerator under the front counter, grabbed a bottle of water, and started drinking in big gulps—because in that moment my medical knowledge consisted of one single thought: *If water goes down, I’m not actively dying. Probably.*



The water went down, which was reassuring—for about five seconds.



Because the sensation didn’t move. Even after the water, it still felt like the egg was lodged right at the level of my Adam’s apple, like it had signed a lease and wasn’t planning to leave without a formal eviction.



I threw a $20 on the counter for the water and got the hell out. I knew there was a hospital about a ten-minute walk away, and I convinced myself that walking might help—like maybe I could just power-walk the egg into my stomach. New York logic: if you move fast enough, the problem gets scared and stops.



By the third block, I ran out of water. FML. The water had become my emotional support beverage—my one way to check, in real time, whether I was choking or just losing my mind. Without it, the panic had room to stretch out and get comfortable.



That’s when the saliva started—pooling in my mouth in thick, weird textures I’d never experienced before. Suddenly I wasn’t just having a “weird breakfast moment.” I was standing on a Brooklyn sidewalk, mouth full of what felt like experimental foam, thinking: *Oh. So this is how I go. Efficient. Bold. Totally unexpected.*



In my head, my obituary practically wrote itself. I could already hear my friends in disbelief: “Oh my God, I can’t believe he choked on an egg.” And then, inevitably: “So young.” (I mean… sort of. I was 32. Let’s not get carried away.)



And that was the moment it stopped feeling like a fluke—and started feeling like the beginning of something I didn’t understand.

That day launched an 18-month journey that tested me in every way possible. It also brought me up close and personal with the healthcare system—and showed me just how brutally broken it can be.



Over the last 18 months, I’ve lived with dysphagia. And if you’ve ever Googled dysphagia (like I did, immediately, because anxiety has Wi-Fi), you learn one thing fast: dysphagia isn’t a diagnosis. It’s a symptom—an alarm bell that something else is going on.



That alarm bell sent me everywhere.



I’ve been seen by four different ENTs (including the well-known and fantastic Dr. Michael Pitman at Columbia University Irving Medical Center), three GI doctors across NYU Langone Health, Northwestern Medicine, and the University of Chicago Medicine. I’ve seen two chiropractors, two speech-language pathologists, a neurologist, and a rotating cast of other specialists—enough that I should’ve earned airline status for hospital systems.



And the testing? A full gauntlet.



Multiple upper endoscopies (camera down the throat). A Bravo pH test (acid reflux monitoring). Two EndoFLIP procedures (how well the esophagus opens). Esophageal manometry (muscle function). Countless barium swallows / esophagrams. Several FEES exams (a scope-based swallow study with a speech therapist). The kind of medical résumé where, at a certain point, you start wondering if your esophagus is just trying to get discovered on IMDb.

I want to acknowledge up front that I’m incredibly fortunate to have what has turned out to be genuinely strong health insurance (shoutout to Cigna). I know many of you are still waiting—or have waited a long time—to get even one of these tests, and I don’t take that for granted.



Over the course of this 18-month stretch, I’ve had three upper endoscopies.



The first was at NYU Langone Health on September 19, 2024, shortly after the dysphagia started. Visually, everything looked normal: no strictures, rings, webs, narrowing, or visible esophagitis. They biopsied both the proximal and distal esophagus and the pathology came back normal—negative for eosinophilic esophagitis. Stomach and duodenum were normal too. In other words: structurally normal, and no clear inflammatory or obstructive explanation for why swallowing suddenly felt like a full-time job.



The second endoscopy—also at NYU Langone Health—was on October 24, 2024, because the dysphagia persisted and heartburn had entered the chat. That’s when they first identified two “kissing” inlet patches just below the upper esophageal sphincter. They also noted a \~3 cm sliding hiatal hernia with a Hill Grade III gastroesophageal flap valve, plus very mild LA Grade A esophagitis at the GE junction. My stomach showed patchy erythema, and biopsies were positive for H. pylori–associated gastritis, along with mild duodenitis. They attempted an EndoFLIP, but it had to be cut short because I was coughing/hiccupping—though what they did see didn’t suggest achalasia or an outflow obstruction. They also placed a Bravo pH capsule (6 cm above the GE junction) to evaluate reflux more objectively. Pathology from the esophagus showed only mild reactive changes—still no eosinophilic esophagitis and no Barrett’s. The takeaway: inlet patches were real and new information, reflux changes were present but mild, and there still wasn’t a mechanical obstruction that explained how dramatic the swallowing symptoms felt.



The third endoscopy was much later—January 29, 2026—at Northwestern Medicine, again for ongoing dysphagia. Once again, the esophagus looked normal throughout. They noted a smaller sliding hiatal hernia this time—about 1 cm—with the same Hill Grade III. The “kissing” inlet patches were still there, this time described as being in the cricopharynx, and they did targeted biopsies. They also performed an EndoFLIP with measurable results: an EGJ distensibility index of 4–5 and an EGJ diameter of 18–20 mm, with repetitive antegrade contractions present. Pathology confirmed gastric oxyntic-type mucosa with chronic inflammation—consistent with a gastric inlet patch—while the surrounding esophageal squamous mucosa remained normal.

After my second endoscopy at NYU Langone Health on October 24, I asked my GI doctor a very reasonable question: *Do these inlet patches matter? And could they be causing the dysphagia that’s currently ruining my ability to enjoy… food? Life? Basic human function?*



She was adamant—borderline offended by the suggestion—that neither the inlet patches nor my hiatal hernia could possibly be behind my symptoms. So I left the appointment with exactly zero answers and a consolation prize: a pharmacy shopping list long enough to qualify as a novella.



I walked out with treatment for H. pylori, a higher dose of acid meds (eventually up to 60 mg of omeprazole and 40 mg of famotidine), plus nortriptyline—and, for the grand finale, Ativan “for those days I might feel anxious.” Which, to be clear, is adorable. Because nothing calms anxiety quite like being told, “Good news: we don’t know why you can’t swallow. Bad news: here are fourteen pills. Try not to spiral.”

I recently moved to Chicago from New York and decided to take another swing at figuring this out. By the time I got here, I was more confused than ever. One ENT told me I had GERD. A second insisted it was LPR. A third basically said, “Neither—good luck.” Even Dr. Michael Pitman saw some traces of LPR, but not nearly the kind of damage he would’ve expected given how severe—and constant—my swallowing issues had been.



This time, I was determined to stop collecting contradictory diagnoses like they were souvenir magnets. So I booked another round of testing—this time with a GI at Northwestern Medicine.



Full disclosure: I was hesitant. He’d only been practicing a few years post–med school, and my inner skeptic was like, *Do I really want to hand my esophagus over to someone whose graduation photos are still in circulation?* But something told me to give him a shot. I booked the appointment. And honestly? I’m so glad I did.



He spent almost an hour with me. He actually listened—like, listened-listened. He read through my records, let me tell the whole story, and didn’t treat me like a routine reflux patient who just needed to stop eating pasta and start “managing stress.” For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel dismissed as someone with “LPR who hasn’t made lifestyle changes.”



Because here’s the thing: I’ve made lifestyle changes and then some. I’ve spent most of the last 18 months basically on a liquid diet. I elevated my bed. I sleep on a wedge pillow. I cut out acidic foods. I did the full reflux-friendly transformation—if this were a makeover show, my esophagus should be stepping out in a blazer, moisturized, employed, and thriving. I even moved from NYC to outside Chicago thinking maybe a slower pace of life could cure it. (Yes, I really tried relocating as a medical intervention. Desperation is creative.)



And he didn’t make me feel like this was all anxiety in a trench coat. Sure, I’ve always had a fear of flying—I travel a lot for work, and I still get anxious during takeoff. But swallowing? That’s not “just anxiety.” And for the first time, a doctor made me feel like that was obvious—not debatable.



My manometry was normal. My FEES were normal. My barium swallows looked normal. Every single test looked normal. Which is reassuring in the same way it’s reassuring when your car is making a demonic noise and the mechanic says, “Hmm, sounds fine to me.”



But here’s what wasn’t nothing: this GI took biopsies of my inlet patches—right where food always feels like it gets stuck (just below my Adam’s apple). And those biopsies came back showing gastric oxyntic-type mucosa with chronic inflammation—consistent with a gastric inlet patch.



The working theory we discussed was that reflux (including non-acid components like pepsin) could be irritating that tissue, and that irritation might keep the nerves in that area on high alert—so even normal contact from food can feel exaggerated, lingering, and genuinely alarming.



And I’ll be honest: I can’t prove whether food is truly getting physically “stuck” there, or whether the sensation just feels that real. But I’ve had moments where it’s been so convincing it might as well have been true—like the time I tried to eat a salad in one of my “fuck it” spirals, and I swear the feeling of that piece of lettuce hanging out in my throat lasted for almost two days.

So my next steps are to meet with a GI specialist who specializes in ablating these fuckers—and, if all goes well, have them removed and finally get on with my life.



I wish I’d been more aggressive in my advocacy back in 2024. I don’t think it would’ve changed that GI doctor’s mind, but I do think she would’ve referred me to someone else—someone more willing to explore the possibility instead of shutting it down immediately.



My hope is that if you’ve been told you have inlet patches and you’re dealing with symptoms like mine—especially that “stuck” sensation in the upper throat/esophagus—and doctors keep telling you they’re meaningless, you’ll hear this clearly: they are not always nothing.



Over the last 18 months, I’ve cycled through every theory imaginable. Maybe it was “just” LPR (which I do think is part of the story). Maybe it was my hernia pushing up and creating some kind of delay. Maybe I brushed my teeth with tap water in Mexico in 2023 and now I have an invasive species buried in my throat. None of it felt fully right. But the inlet patches? That’s the one thing that consistently matched where my symptoms live.



P.S. If you’re getting an endoscopy, tell your GI to specifically look for inlet patches. They tend to sit higher up in the esophagus—right near where it meets your throat—and they’re easy to miss. A lot of the focus is understandably lower down, and when the scope is being pulled out, that upper area doesn’t always get the same careful look.",1,1770156550.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I’m a new driver with a Kia Sonet, and while I love my car, I’ve realized how intimidating the usual car scene can be. I’m still learning the basics (tire pressure is a mystery to me lol) and I really wanted a space to ask ""dumb"" questions and just hang out without the ""car-bro"" ego.

So, I decided to just create it: **avenue collective** 🕊️💜

We’re a new group specifically for **women and LGBTQ+ car owners** (plus allies!). Whether you’re a pro or a total newbie who just got your first car, you’re welcome here.

**The Vibe:**

If you’ve ever sat through a meal at a restaurant just to feel normal with friends or a partner, while the only thing you could manage was 9.5+ pH water—and everyone else ate freely and sipped red wine—you’re not alone. If you’ve ever hosted a holiday gathering, poured yourself into making it special, and still couldn’t take part in the food you prepared—you’re not alone. And if you’ve ever found yourself crying in the bathtub as a grown adult because this has hijacked your life and drained it of energy, happiness, and color—you’re not alone.



I’m incredibly fortunate to have an understanding and supportive partner, friends, and family—people who kept urging me to keep searching for answers to my swallowing issues (dysphagia), even when I wanted to give up. But the truth is, even with that support, I still felt profoundly alone—until I found this community and read your stories. Your fear. Your exhaustion. Your “just f\*ck it” moments (I’ve had those too).



I know there are countless devastating illnesses in the world—MS, ALS, cancer, and so many others. But there’s something uniquely brutal about a condition that can take over your daily life while remaining widely misunderstood and easily dismissed. So before I share anything else, I want to thank you. Truly. You kept me steady on nights I cried in bed, and on flights where I sat staring at a tray table, grieving something as basic as eating and drinking without thinking about it.



This community is proof that people across different backgrounds—different politics, religions, and identities—can become one another’s lifeline. In so many moments, we are each other’s support system when no one else knows what it’s like to live this.

On September 10, 2024, at around 8:52 a.m., I was settling into a Mexican-style coffee shop in Brooklyn, ready to eat scrambled eggs and drink my second iced latte of the morning… fine, it was my third. I took the first bite like an optimistic person who still believed in a functional esophagus, flipped open my laptop, and prepared to re-enter the corporate hunger games.



Everything felt normal—until I swallowed and the food reached the area around my Adam’s apple.



It wasn’t painful. It wasn’t dramatic. It was just… wrong. Like my throat suddenly remembered it had opinions. I swallowed again, and with a sip of iced latte, it seemed to go down. I told myself it was nothing—just a weird swallow, a fluke, a one-time glitch in the system.



Then I took a second bite.



This time, it did not go down. Not even a little. Even with the latte, it felt so stuck that I launched out of my seat like I was auditioning for a role called *Man Panics Quietly in Public.* I lunged for the refrigerator under the front counter, grabbed a bottle of water, and started drinking in big gulps—because in that moment my medical knowledge consisted of one single thought: *If water goes down, I’m not actively dying. Probably.*



The water went down, which was reassuring—for about five seconds.



Because the sensation didn’t move. Even after the water, it still felt like the egg was lodged right at the level of my Adam’s apple, like it had signed a lease and wasn’t planning to leave without a formal eviction.



I threw a $20 on the counter for the water and got the hell out. I knew there was a hospital about a ten-minute walk away, and I convinced myself that walking might help—like maybe I could just power-walk the egg into my stomach. New York logic: if you move fast enough, the problem gets scared and stops.



By the third block, I ran out of water. FML. The water had become my emotional support beverage—my one way to check, in real time, whether I was choking or just losing my mind. Without it, the panic had room to stretch out and get comfortable.



That’s when the saliva started—pooling in my mouth in thick, weird textures I’d never experienced before. Suddenly I wasn’t just having a “weird breakfast moment.” I was standing on a Brooklyn sidewalk, mouth full of what felt like experimental foam, thinking: *Oh. So this is how I go. Efficient. Bold. Totally unexpected.*



In my head, my obituary practically wrote itself. I could already hear my friends in disbelief: “Oh my God, I can’t believe he choked on an egg.” And then, inevitably: “So young.” (I mean… sort of. I was 32. Let’s not get carried away.)



And that was the moment it stopped feeling like a fluke—and started feeling like the beginning of something I didn’t understand.

That day launched an 18-month journey that tested me in every way possible. It also brought me up close and personal with the healthcare system—and showed me just how brutally broken it can be.



Over the last 18 months, I’ve lived with dysphagia. And if you’ve ever Googled dysphagia (like I did, immediately, because anxiety has Wi-Fi), you learn one thing fast: dysphagia isn’t a diagnosis. It’s a symptom—an alarm bell that something else is going on.



That alarm bell sent me everywhere.



I’ve been seen by four different ENTs (including the well-known and fantastic Dr. Michael Pitman at Columbia University Irving Medical Center), three GI doctors across NYU Langone Health, Northwestern Medicine, and the University of Chicago Medicine. I’ve seen two chiropractors, two speech-language pathologists, a neurologist, and a rotating cast of other specialists—enough that I should’ve earned airline status for hospital systems.



And the testing? A full gauntlet.



Multiple upper endoscopies (camera down the throat). A Bravo pH test (acid reflux monitoring). Two EndoFLIP procedures (how well the esophagus opens). Esophageal manometry (muscle function). Countless barium swallows / esophagrams. Several FEES exams (a scope-based swallow study with a speech therapist). The kind of medical résumé where, at a certain point, you start wondering if your esophagus is just trying to get discovered on IMDb.

I want to acknowledge up front that I’m incredibly fortunate to have what has turned out to be genuinely strong health insurance (shoutout to Cigna). I know many of you are still waiting—or have waited a long time—to get even one of these tests, and I don’t take that for granted.



Over the course of this 18-month stretch, I’ve had three upper endoscopies.



The first was at NYU Langone Health on September 19, 2024, shortly after the dysphagia started. Visually, everything looked normal: no strictures, rings, webs, narrowing, or visible esophagitis. They biopsied both the proximal and distal esophagus and the pathology came back normal—negative for eosinophilic esophagitis. Stomach and duodenum were normal too. In other words: structurally normal, and no clear inflammatory or obstructive explanation for why swallowing suddenly felt like a full-time job.



The second endoscopy—also at NYU Langone Health—was on October 24, 2024, because the dysphagia persisted and heartburn had entered the chat. That’s when they first identified two “kissing” inlet patches just below the upper esophageal sphincter. They also noted a \~3 cm sliding hiatal hernia with a Hill Grade III gastroesophageal flap valve, plus very mild LA Grade A esophagitis at the GE junction. My stomach showed patchy erythema, and biopsies were positive for H. pylori–associated gastritis, along with mild duodenitis. They attempted an EndoFLIP, but it had to be cut short because I was coughing/hiccupping—though what they did see didn’t suggest achalasia or an outflow obstruction. They also placed a Bravo pH capsule (6 cm above the GE junction) to evaluate reflux more objectively. Pathology from the esophagus showed only mild reactive changes—still no eosinophilic esophagitis and no Barrett’s. The takeaway: inlet patches were real and new information, reflux changes were present but mild, and there still wasn’t a mechanical obstruction that explained how dramatic the swallowing symptoms felt.



The third endoscopy was much later—January 29, 2026—at Northwestern Medicine, again for ongoing dysphagia. Once again, the esophagus looked normal throughout. They noted a smaller sliding hiatal hernia this time—about 1 cm—with the same Hill Grade III. The “kissing” inlet patches were still there, this time described as being in the cricopharynx, and they did targeted biopsies. They also performed an EndoFLIP with measurable results: an EGJ distensibility index of 4–5 and an EGJ diameter of 18–20 mm, with repetitive antegrade contractions present. Pathology confirmed gastric oxyntic-type mucosa with chronic inflammation—consistent with a gastric inlet patch—while the surrounding esophageal squamous mucosa remained normal.

After my second endoscopy at NYU Langone Health on October 24, I asked my GI doctor a very reasonable question: *Do these inlet patches matter? And could they be causing the dysphagia that’s currently ruining my ability to enjoy… food? Life? Basic human function?*



She was adamant—borderline offended by the suggestion—that neither the inlet patches nor my hiatal hernia could possibly be behind my symptoms. So I left the appointment with exactly zero answers and a consolation prize: a pharmacy shopping list long enough to qualify as a novella.



I walked out with treatment for H. pylori, a higher dose of acid meds (eventually up to 60 mg of omeprazole and 40 mg of famotidine), plus nortriptyline—and, for the grand finale, Ativan “for those days I might feel anxious.” Which, to be clear, is adorable. Because nothing calms anxiety quite like being told, “Good news: we don’t know why you can’t swallow. Bad news: here are fourteen pills. Try not to spiral.”

I recently moved to Chicago from New York and decided to take another swing at figuring this out. By the time I got here, I was more confused than ever. One ENT told me I had GERD. A second insisted it was LPR. A third basically said, “Neither—good luck.” Even Dr. Michael Pitman saw some traces of LPR, but not nearly the kind of damage he would’ve expected given how severe—and constant—my swallowing issues had been.



This time, I was determined to stop collecting contradictory diagnoses like they were souvenir magnets. So I booked another round of testing—this time with a GI at Northwestern Medicine.



Full disclosure: I was hesitant. He’d only been practicing a few years post–med school, and my inner skeptic was like, *Do I really want to hand my esophagus over to someone whose graduation photos are still in circulation?* But something told me to give him a shot. I booked the appointment. And honestly? I’m so glad I did.



He spent almost an hour with me. He actually listened—like, listened-listened. He read through my records, let me tell the whole story, and didn’t treat me like a routine reflux patient who just needed to stop eating pasta and start “managing stress.” For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel dismissed as someone with “LPR who hasn’t made lifestyle changes.”



Because here’s the thing: I’ve made lifestyle changes and then some. I’ve spent most of the last 18 months basically on a liquid diet. I elevated my bed. I sleep on a wedge pillow. I cut out acidic foods. I did the full reflux-friendly transformation—if this were a makeover show, my esophagus should be stepping out in a blazer, moisturized, employed, and thriving. I even moved from NYC to outside Chicago thinking maybe a slower pace of life could cure it. (Yes, I really tried relocating as a medical intervention. Desperation is creative.)



And he didn’t make me feel like this was all anxiety in a trench coat. Sure, I’ve always had a fear of flying—I travel a lot for work, and I still get anxious during takeoff. But swallowing? That’s not “just anxiety.” And for the first time, a doctor made me feel like that was obvious—not debatable.



My manometry was normal. My FEES were normal. My barium swallows looked normal. Every single test looked normal. Which is reassuring in the same way it’s reassuring when your car is making a demonic noise and the mechanic says, “Hmm, sounds fine to me.”



But here’s what wasn’t nothing: this GI took biopsies of my inlet patches—right where food always feels like it gets stuck (just below my Adam’s apple). And those biopsies came back showing gastric oxyntic-type mucosa with chronic inflammation—consistent with a gastric inlet patch.



The working theory we discussed was that reflux (including non-acid components like pepsin) could be irritating that tissue, and that irritation might keep the nerves in that area on high alert—so even normal contact from food can feel exaggerated, lingering, and genuinely alarming.



And I’ll be honest: I can’t prove whether food is truly getting physically “stuck” there, or whether the sensation just feels that real. But I’ve had moments where it’s been so convincing it might as well have been true—like the time I tried to eat a salad in one of my “fuck it” spirals, and I swear the feeling of that piece of lettuce hanging out in my throat lasted for almost two days.

So my next steps are to meet with a GI specialist who specializes in ablating these fuckers—and, if all goes well, have them removed and finally get on with my life.



I wish I’d been more aggressive in my advocacy back in 2024. I don’t think it would’ve changed that GI doctor’s mind, but I do think she would’ve referred me to someone else—someone more willing to explore the possibility instead of shutting it down immediately.



My hope is that if you’ve been told you have inlet patches and you’re dealing with symptoms like mine—especially that “stuck” sensation in the upper throat/esophagus—and doctors keep telling you they’re meaningless, you’ll hear this clearly: they are not always nothing.



Over the last 18 months, I’ve cycled through every theory imaginable. Maybe it was “just” LPR (which I do think is part of the story). Maybe it was my hernia pushing up and creating some kind of delay. Maybe I brushed my teeth with tap water in Mexico in 2023 and now I have an invasive species buried in my throat. None of it felt fully right. But the inlet patches? That’s the one thing that consistently matched where my symptoms live.



P.S. If you’re getting an endoscopy, tell your GI to specifically look for inlet patches. They tend to sit higher up in the esophagus—right near where it meets your throat—and they’re easy to miss. A lot of the focus is understandably lower down, and when the scope is being pulled out, that upper area doesn’t always get the same careful look.",2,1770156413.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

He was charming in a very calculated way. Like he always knew what to say, always replied fast, always had the perfect balance of flirty and sweet. It felt almost too smooth, but I ignored that because honestly I was just happy to talk to someone who seemed serious.

After about a week, we planned a first date at a cafe.

Nothing fancy. Just coffee and pastries. Safe, public, normal.

I got there first, ordered my drink, and waited. He showed up about 10 minutes later, apologized, sat down, and things were actually going okay. He looked like his photos, he was polite, and he didn’t give off any immediate red flags.

Then about 20 minutes in, his phone rings.

He glances at the screen and his entire face changes. Like full panic mode.

He answers, stands up, and walks a few steps away. I can’t hear everything but I hear enough.

He says things like

What do you mean

Is she breathing

Call an ambulance

I felt my stomach drop.

When he comes back to the table, he looks stressed and says his mom collapsed at home and he has to leave immediately.

I told him of course, go. I even asked if he needed me to call someone or if he was okay to drive.

He nodded, thanked me, and rushed out.

I sat there stunned. Like what the hell. I felt bad for him. I felt bad for his mom. I even prayed quietly for a second because it sounded serious.

Then I get home.

And I see a story on his Instagram.

Not a hospital. Not his mom. Not anything related to an emergency.

It’s him.

At a bar.

With friends.

Laughing.

Drinks on the table.

I thought maybe it was an old story reposted or something, but no. It had the current timestamp. And he was wearing the same outfit he wore on the date.

So I messaged him.

I asked why he said his mom collapsed if he was out drinking.

He replied like it was nothing and said

Relax. My mom is fine. I just didn’t feel the vibe.

I was so mad I started shaking.

I told him that’s not just lying, that’s disgusting. You don’t use something like that as an excuse. He could have literally just said he wasn’t interested and left.

Then he dropped the real reason.

He said he wanted to see how I would react because he’s been with girls who are selfish and don’t care when something bad happens.

So he wanted to test if I was supportive.

A test.

On a first date.

Using a fake medical emergency about his mom.

I told him that was manipulative and insane. I blocked him.

Then he started messaging me from another account saying I’m overreacting, that I failed the test, and that I’m probably the type to abandon someone when things get hard.",27,1770156358.0,AmITheJerk,19,0.91,False

Because nothing calms anxiety quite like being told, “Good news: we don’t know why you can’t swallow. Bad news: here are fourteen pills. Try not to spiral.”

I recently moved to Chicago from New York and decided to take another swing at figuring this out. By the time I got here, I was more confused than ever. One ENT told me I had GERD. A second insisted it was LPR. A third basically said, “Neither—good luck.” Even Dr. Michael Pitman saw some traces of LPR, but not nearly the kind of damage he would’ve expected given how severe—and constant—my swallowing issues had been.



This time, I was determined to stop collecting contradictory diagnoses like they were souvenir magnets. So I booked another round of testing—this time with a GI at Northwestern Medicine.



Full disclosure: I was hesitant. He’d only been practicing a few years post–med school, and my inner skeptic was like, *Do I really want to hand my esophagus over to someone whose graduation photos are still in circulation?* But something told me to give him a shot. I booked the appointment. And honestly? I’m so glad I did.



He spent almost an hour with me. He actually listened—like, listened-listened. He read through my records, let me tell the whole story, and didn’t treat me like a routine reflux patient who just needed to stop eating pasta and start “managing stress.” For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel dismissed as someone with “LPR who hasn’t made lifestyle changes.”



Because here’s the thing: I’ve made lifestyle changes and then some. I’ve spent most of the last 18 months basically on a liquid diet. I elevated my bed. I sleep on a wedge pillow. I cut out acidic foods. I did the full reflux-friendly transformation—if this were a makeover show, my esophagus should be stepping out in a blazer, moisturized, employed, and thriving. I even moved from NYC to outside Chicago thinking maybe a slower pace of life could cure it. (Yes, I really tried relocating as a medical intervention. Desperation is creative.)



And he didn’t make me feel like this was all anxiety in a trench coat. Sure, I’ve always had a fear of flying—I travel a lot for work, and I still get anxious during takeoff. But swallowing? That’s not “just anxiety.” And for the first time, a doctor made me feel like that was obvious—not debatable.



My manometry was normal. My FEES were normal. My barium swallows looked normal. Every single test looked normal. Which is reassuring in the same way it’s reassuring when your car is making a demonic noise and the mechanic says, “Hmm, sounds fine to me.”



But here’s what wasn’t nothing: this GI took biopsies of my inlet patches—right where food always feels like it gets stuck (just below my Adam’s apple). And those biopsies came back showing gastric oxyntic-type mucosa with chronic inflammation—consistent with a gastric inlet patch.



The working theory we discussed was that reflux (including non-acid components like pepsin) could be irritating that tissue, and that irritation might keep the nerves in that area on high alert—so even normal contact from food can feel exaggerated, lingering, and genuinely alarming.



And I’ll be honest: I can’t prove whether food is truly getting physically “stuck” there, or whether the sensation just feels that real. But I’ve had moments where it’s been so convincing it might as well have been true—like the time I tried to eat a salad in one of my “fuck it” spirals, and I swear the feeling of that piece of lettuce hanging out in my throat lasted for almost two days.

So my next steps are to meet with a GI specialist who specializes in ablating these fuckers—and, if all goes well, have them removed and finally get on with my life.



I wish I’d been more aggressive in my advocacy back in 2024. I don’t think it would’ve changed that GI doctor’s mind, but I do think she would’ve referred me to someone else—someone more willing to explore the possibility instead of shutting it down immediately.



My hope is that if you’ve been told you have inlet patches and you’re dealing with symptoms like mine—especially that “stuck” sensation in the upper throat/esophagus—and doctors keep telling you they’re meaningless, you’ll hear this clearly: they are not always nothing.



Over the last 18 months, I’ve cycled through every theory imaginable. Maybe it was “just” LPR (which I do think is part of the story). Maybe it was my hernia pushing up and creating some kind of delay. Maybe I brushed my teeth with tap water in Mexico in 2023 and now I have an invasive species buried in my throat. None of it felt fully right. But the inlet patches? That’s the one thing that consistently matched where my symptoms live.



P.S. If you’re getting an endoscopy, tell your GI to specifically look for inlet patches. They tend to sit higher up in the esophagus—right near where it meets your throat—and they’re easy to miss. A lot of the focus is understandably lower down, and when the scope is being pulled out, that upper area doesn’t always get the same careful look.",2,1770156185.0,dysphagia,1,1.0,False

It's your brain literally changing structure because you have been running on fumes for too long.

I spent months researching this after watching half my friends hit walls in their mid-twenties, myself included. Pulled from neuroscience research, talked to therapists, read way too many books. Turns out most burnout advice is garbage because it treats symptoms, not causes. Here's what actually works, backed by people who study this stuff for a living.

**1. Understand your nervous system is fried, not your work ethic**

When you're burned out, your amygdala (fear center) is hyperactive while your prefrontal cortex (decision-making) goes offline. Dr Emily Nagoski explains this in ""[Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/Burnout-Secret-Unlocking-Stress-Cycle/dp/198481706X),"" which won tons of awards and breaks down the biological reality of stress. She's a PhD who researched this for decades. The book will completely reframe how you see exhaustion. It's not about working less; it's about completing the stress cycle your body gets stuck in.

Your body accumulates stress like plaque. You need physical release. Crying, laughing hard, creative expression, intense exercise. Anything that signals to your primitive brain ""the threat is over, you survived."" Most people just try to relax which doesn't work because your body is still holding all that cortisol.

2. Your brain needs actual rest, not just sleep\*\*

Sleep helps, but it's not enough when you're properly burned out. You need psychological detachment from work. Dr Sabine Sonnentag's research shows you need to completely stop thinking about work tasks during off hours. Sounds obvious, but most people don't do it.

Try the Insight Timer app for guided meditations specifically designed for nervous system regulation. It has thousands of free sessions. I use the NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) protocols, which are basically 10-20 minute sessions that give your brain the equivalent of hours of recovery. Sounds like nonsense, but the neuroscience checks out.

Also, block schedule your recovery time like it's a meeting. Your brain needs predictable rest periods to actually downregulate stress hormones.

**3. Burnout is a mismatch problem between you and your environment**

Christina Maslach literally created the burnout inventory used worldwide. Her research shows six major causes: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values. You're not broken; something in your environment is misaligned.

Go through each category and identify which ones are off. For me, it was control and values; I had zero autonomy and was doing work that felt meaningless. Sometimes you can negotiate changes; sometimes you need to leave. But knowing the specific mismatch helps you stop blaming yourself.

**4. Stop trying to optimize your way out of structural problems**

If your job requires 60 hour weeks, no amount of morning routines or productivity hacks will fix that. This is where most advice fails. It puts the burden entirely on you to adapt to unsustainable conditions.

Read ""[Laziness Does Not Exist](https://www.amazon.com/Laziness-Exist-Devon-Price-Ph-D/dp/1982140100)"" by Devon Price. Short book, insanely good read, completely dismantles the idea that burnout is a personal failing. He's a social psychologist who shows how burnout is often a reasonable response to unreasonable demands. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity culture.

Sometimes the answer isn't work harder on yourself; it's change your situation.

**5. Rebuild capacity slowly with energy accounting**

When you're burned out, you have limited energy. Treat it like a budget. Dr Saundra Dalton-Smith identifies seven types of rest you need: physical, mental, sensory, creative, emotional, social, and spiritual. Most people only focus on physical.

Track what depletes you and what restores you for a week. Be brutally honest. For me, Slack notifications drained mental energy faster than actual work. Social rest meant being around people without performing. Creative rest was just looking at art, not making it.

Then ruthlessly cut energy drains and add small restorative activities daily. Not huge changes, like five-minute walks between tasks or turning off your camera in meetings when possible.

If reading books feels overwhelming right now, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that turns psychology research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here into personalized audio sessions. You can type in something specific like ""recover from burnout as a perfectionist"" and it'll pull from relevant sources to create a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The depth control is helpful when your brain is foggy, you can start light and go deeper when you have energy. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, some people swear by the smoky, calming narrators for burnout content specifically.

**6. Your body keeps the score literally**

Unprocessed stress lives in your body as tension, pain, digestive issues, immune problems. ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk is the definitive book on trauma and stress. He's one of the world's leading trauma researchers. The book shows how psychological stress manifests physically and why traditional talk therapy sometimes isn't enough.

You need somatic practices. Yoga, stretching, massage, even just shaking your body. Sounds weird, but your nervous system needs physical release to reset. Ten minutes of intentional movement daily made more difference for me than months of trying to think my way out of burnout.

**7. Connection is medicine but only the right kind**

Burnout makes you want to isolate but loneliness makes it worse. However, forced socializing or being around demanding people will destroy you faster. You need what psychologists call ""passive social support,"" just being around safe people without having to perform.

Find low-pressure social activities. Coffee with one friend, not group dinners. Coworking silently, not collaborative projects. Let people know you're running on empty so they don't expect your usual energy.

**8. Sometimes you need professional help, and that's completely fine**

If you've been burned out for months, can't feel joy in things you used to love, or have physical symptoms, talk to someone qualified. Therapists who specialize in occupational stress or somatic therapy can help in ways self-help can't.

Burnout isn't weakness; it's what happens when you're strong for too long without support. Your body is trying to protect you by forcing you to stop. Listen to it before it makes you stop completely.

Most recovery isn't linear. You'll have good weeks and terrible days. That's normal. The goal isn't to feel tired, it's to build a sustainable relationship with your energy and stop treating yourself like a machine that just needs better maintenance.

The system that burned you out wants you to believe it's your fault so you'll keep trying to fix yourself instead of demanding better conditions. Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is rest without guilt and recognize you deserve a life that doesn't constantly deplete you.",1,1770156058.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

Right now, they are very moist, but the interior looks like a solid, unified ""fudge."" I want that bakery-style interior where you can see the air gaps and ""micro-circles""—I want it to look individualized and porous, but still stay very wet and moist. I definitely don't want it to be dry or bready.

The Recipe:

- 720g AP Flour
- 300g Brown Butter (chilled) + 50g Water (for rehydration). 
- 350g Brown Sugar
- 125g White Sugar
- 2 Whole Eggs
- 2 Egg Yolks
- 10g Baking Powder
- 5g Baking Soda
- 9g Instant Coffee
- 15g Salt
- 25g Cornstarch
- 560g Milk Chocolate Chunks

The Method:

- Brown the butter, add water, then chill until it is opaque in color.
- Mix the butter with the sugars.
- Add eggs one at a time, then add salt and coffee powder; mix.
- Add dry ingredients and mix briefly.
- Fold in chocolate chunks.
- Scoop into 120g balls and chill in the fridge for 24 hours.
- Bake for 18 minutes in a convection/fan oven.

My questions for the experts:

1) Should I increase the baking powder to force more air gaps and ""lift"" inside the dough?

2) Is the cornstarch actually causing the problem? Does it make the structure too smooth and unified? Should I remove it to get better particle definition?

3) Is 350g of brown sugar too much? Does it make the dough so soft that it just melts into a solid fudge instead of keeping a crumb structure?

Recently I self-published a hardcover art book with fancy finishes (Debossed Gold Foil, Smyth Sewn Binding, Spot UV Gloss, Printed End Sheets). I sold/shipped my art book all around the world, fulfilling a successful Kickstarter campaign.

I ordered my batch of \~500 hardcover art books from **“Ken the Book Printer,” a print broker based in Newark, California**. I highly recommend Ken’s services to anyone looking to print a book; he is professional, meticulous, and detail-oriented. My books were printed overseas and shipped via ocean freight to the U.S., where they arrived in perfect condition.

I learned that if you want superior color accuracy and beautiful finishes like gold foil and spot UV, then you need to go with a **professional offset printer (ideally one that uses top-tier German Heidelberg press machines**). The minimum quantities start at around 250 books, with huge price breaks at 500 and 1,000 books.

Funding such a huge project was an issue for me, so I turned to Kickstarter to fund the production costs. I sold over 100+ pre-orders of my art book to collectors around the world through my Kickstarter which ended in June 2025, and I finished fulfilling all the orders in February 2026. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

The final art book is beyond gorgeous and after fulfilling my Kickstarter orders, I still have many books left over to sell at local art fairs.

So, what does this mean? That each and every municipality listed here was being run from the top on down by scores of mouth breathing political hacks, completely ill-equipped to address a weather event? Maybe.  Or, what’s more likely is that this storm and its conditions, as well as storms that followed it in other regions, simply were the real deal - a true blast from the past, so to speak, of the old days when New England suffered majored blizzards and our primary concern had not yet shifted to rain-based flooding from climate change, as the science has indicated in recent years.  Providence, like these other municipalities, addressed the storm using the resources - finances, time, manpower - it had at its disposal - right now.  We don’t live in some fantasy land where the city remains constantly vigilant to address every ounce of snow that falls instantly (”but - but - Canada does it!”).  We don’t live in a city with multi-billion dollar budgets for such things (”but - but - look at NYC!”), some of whom still suffered the same effects of this storm as Providence.

I’m sorry it’s abnormally cold and grey and dark out and your seasonal depression is high.  I’m sorry it was more difficult for a few days to walk the sidewalks with your 45 cats to the coffee shop you found on TikTok for your $14 latte.  I’m sorry you’ve had to drive in a slightly more cautious manner lately - something foreign to us tailgating and road rage prone Rhode Island drivers - and your work commute increased by 5 minutes.  These things are annoying.  They’ll also pass.  But guess what?  They are not your government‘s fault.  I know you hate Smiley.  I know you think Morales would have done a better job, despite no real evidence indicating this.  Just because you felt energized and refreshed watching Mamdani campaign videos on TikTok and desperately want to recreate that energy here doesn’t mean Morales has some magical tools at his disposal where streets would have glistened and life went on as normal the day following 2 feet of snow.  Should you demand high quality results from your government? Absolutely.  But you also have to accept truth - Providence wasn’t unique; you haven’t uncovered some vast scheme to ignore the storm or respond poorly among its leaders just because you hate them; not everything is a conspiracy; not everything is the result of incompetence.  Life sometimes is just hard.  Lots of snow sometimes falls.

**Episode 11: The Alchemy of Detergent**

Author's Note: 

I am firmly on Team Gel Ball. Throwing them into the machine is oddly satisfying. Masanari agrees.

\[Day 11\]

\[Days Remaining: 89\]

The morning sun filtered through the cheap plastic blinds, illuminating my disgrace.

I knelt before the Spinning River Spirit—the white, boxy golem that governs the flow of water within this domicile. I was clad in my gi. Once, it possessed the pristine whiteness of winter frost, a symbol of purity and discipline. But thanks to the ""Red Sock Betrayal"" of two days ago, I was now the color of a cherry blossom in full bloom.

I was a pink ninja. The shame burned hotter than a branding iron, but a shinobi endures.

However, more pressing than my humiliation was the stench. Yesterday’s battles atop the Iron Steed—delivering sustenance to the lazy masses of Shibuya—had left my armor soaked in the miasma of sweat and exhaust fumes. I needed to purify my gear.

I reached for the white canister Aoi-dono had entrusted to me. The vessel of the cleaning agent.

I tipped it. Nothing.

I shook it. Silence.

""Impossible..."" I whispered, horror dawning upon me. ""The Well of Bubbles... has run dry.""

Behind me, the sliding door groaned open. Aoi-dono emerged from her slumber chamber, scratching her head. Her hair was a chaotic thicket that rivaled the dense forests of Iga. She wore an oversized shirt that proclaimed in the barbarian tongue: **PIZZA IS MY BOYFRIEND.**

""Masa... why are you kneeling on the floor?"" she yawned, blinking sleep from her eyes.

""My Liege,"" I said, bowing my head low. ""I have failed in my logistics. The alchemy fluid required to appease the River Spirit is depleted.""

She peered at the empty bottle. ""Oh, we’re out of detergent? My bad. I meant to buy some last week."" She shuffled toward the fridge, retrieving a can of coffee. ""Run to the drugstore and grab a refill. Just get whatever has the 'Indoor Drying' (Heyaboshi) kanji on it. And make it cheap. I'm broke until payday.""

""Indoor Drying... Cheap..."" I repeated the command, engraving it into my memory. ""I shall return with the elixir, My Lady. On my honor.""

The establishment was known as *Matsumoto Kiyoshi*.

To the untrained eye, it was a merchant’s shop. To me, it was clearly the Grand Library of the Alchemists.

As I approached, the glass gates parted automatically with a mechanical hum, welcoming me into a realm of aggressive illumination. The air was sterile, chilled to an unnatural degree. Rows upon rows of elixirs, poisons, and unguents stretched into the distance.

I navigated past the ""Corridor of Eye Potions"" and the ""Sector of Hair Dyes"" until I reached my destination: The Sector of Laundry.

I froze.

""By the chaotic gods...""

The wall before me was a towering fortification of cleaning agents. Hundreds of colorful bottles screamed for my attention. Scents of ""Morning Rose,"" ""Crystal Sky,"" and ""Anti-Bacterial Citrus"" assaulted my heightened senses.

I narrowed my eyes. I had to choose the optimal weapon for the war against stains. I crossed my arms and began my tactical analysis.

First, **The Liquid (Ekitai)**.

I lifted a ""refill pack""—a heavy, plastic bladder filled with fluid. According to the diagrams, one must pour this unstable bladder into the original bottle.

*Analysis: High risk. One slip of the hand, and the precious fluid will spill upon the floor. It requires the steady hand of a surgeon or an archer holding their breath. Furthermore, it is bulky to transport.*

Second, **The Powder (Funmatsu)**.

I examined a box heavy with white grit. Gunpowder? No... sand. A physical abrasive.

*Analysis: It looks powerful enough to scour the skin off a demon, but the water in the River Spirit is cold in the winter. If this powder does not dissolve, it will remain in the fibers of my gi like shrapnel. A double-edged sword.*

Then, my eyes fell upon the third option.

It sat in a transparent plastic sarcophagus on the top shelf. I picked up the container. Inside were squishy, sphere-like objects, swirling with three distinct colors: Blue, Green, and White.

**The Tri-Colored Jewels (Gel Ball).**

""Beautiful..."" I breathed.

They looked like the eyes of a dragon. Or perhaps highly condensed chakra stones, sealed in a dissolvable membrane. I read the sacred text on the box: **ONE TOSS. PERFECT CLEAN.**

""One toss...?""

The efficiency was staggering. No measuring. No pouring. No risk of spillage. Just a single, decisive throwing motion—a motion I had practiced with shuriken since I was a child of five.

This was not merely soap. This was a ninja tool disguised as a domestic product.

""Excuse me.""

I turned to a nearby store clerk, an elderly woman arranging toothbrushes. She looked up, startled by my sudden proximity (I had utilized my Stealth Walk inadvertently).

""Y-yes?"" she squeaked.

I held up the box of Gel Balls with reverence. ""Tell me, Wise One. Does this 'Tri-Colored Magic Stone' truly possess the power to cleanse an entire load of armor? Is the potency not too high? Will it detonate?""

The woman blinked. She looked at my pink gi, then at my intense expression. ""Uh... no? It doesn't explode. You just put one in the bottom of the washer. It's very popular.""

""I see."" I nodded gravely. ""And the membrane? It vanishes?""

""It dissolves in water. Just... um..."" She pointed to a warning label. ""Don't eat it, okay? Children sometimes think it's candy.""

I recoiled, genuinely shocked. ""Eat it? Who would consume a cleaning artifact? Do the people of this era possess iron stomachs, or merely leaden brains?""

""Please just don't eat it,"" she repeated, looking concerned.

I looked at the price tag. It was significantly higher than the liquid or powder. It lacked the ""Yellow Talisman of Half-Price.""

However.

Aoi-dono is a princess in hiding. Would a princess measure liquid like a common apothecary? No. She deserves the elegance of the Single Toss.

""I shall take this,"" I declared. ""The Dragon’s Eyes.""

Back at the Stronghold, I stood before the Spinning River Spirit once more.

I loaded my pink gi and Aoi-dono’s towel (which smelled faintly of beer) into the drum. I opened the box and took out a single Gel Ball. It felt soft, yielding, yet dangerous in my palm.

""Fly, oh jewel of the foam,"" I whispered.

With a flick of my wrist, I executed a perfect Shuriken Throw.

The Gel Ball sailed through the air, entering the washing machine with a satisfying *plap*.

I slammed the lid and pressed the button marked 'Start'. Water rushed in. Through the translucent lid, I watched as the membrane dissolved, releasing the three colors into the churning vortex. Suds rose instantly, white and thick.

""Alchemy,"" I murmured, wiping a tear from my eye. ""Truly, the future is a land of wonders.""

The front door clicked open.

""I'm home,"" Aoi called out, carrying a convenience store bag. She walked into the kitchen area, spotting the box on the counter.

Her eyes went wide.

""Masa!"" she shrieked. ""You bought the Gel Balls?!""

I turned, puffing out my chest in pride. ""Indeed, My Liege. I selected the most efficient tactical option. Observe the lack of mess! The speed of deployment!""

""These are like... three times the price of the powder!"" She grabbed the receipt, her face paling. ""I said cheap! We’re supposed to be saving for rent!""

""But..."" I faltered, my confidence cracking. ""It requires no measuring. It is... the shuriken of laundry.""

Aoi sighed, her shoulders slumping. She looked at the receipt, then at the spinning washing machine, and finally at me—a grown man in a pink gi, looking at her with the eyes of a puppy who just brought home a dead bird.

""The shuriken of laundry, huh?"" She rubbed her temples. ""God, you're weird.""

She ripped open her bag of chips.

""Whatever. At least it has fabric softener built-in. Just... use them sparingly, okay? One per load. No double-tapping.""

""Understood!"" I bowed. ""One kill, one hit.""

She offered me a chip. ""Want one? It's Consommé Punch flavor.""

I accepted the offering. The alchemy of the laundry was complete, but the mystery of the 'Consommé' was just beginning.

I have made a fun little (depressing - will explain) website. It is aimed at people in corporate jobs with an annual salary who want to procrastinate at work and see how much they are earning while doing so.

I was extremely bored at work and wondered how much I was actually getting paid to sit there and stare at a screen. Not how much I get paid per month, I know that amount - how much I actually got for day dreaming about my dream life for 10 minutes.

So I’ve created a website where you basically input your annual salary (it does not take into account tax as this varies by region and country) or your monthly take home income and how many hours you are contracted to work a week.

It basically then tells you how much you are earning per second/minute which is what can be the slightly depressing part depending on your salary/ how much you enjoy your job.

It was quite fun going to grab a coffee and procrastinate for 20 minutes to come back and find out I had actually earned £5 in that time lol.

It became slightly addictive checking it throughout the day.

I just thought it was fun and an even better way to procrastinate ahah

I am also extremely new to designing websites.

If anyone would want to try it out I am happy to send a link to the website - if allowed by the mods :)

Any feedback would be appreciated or potential features I could add to make it funner or more procrastination worthy!

Also, apologies if this is not the right place to demonstrate my idea :)",1,1770155687.0,website_ideas,0,1.0,False

In a search for some indoor hobby I decided to step up my coffee obsession and ordered Kaleido M1 Pro as my 1st roaster.

Soon after arrival, I was prepared (or so I tought, lol) and began seasoning the roaster. I live in the flat right under the roof. My initial hopes were to open the kitchen window and let the roasters exhaust to take care of any smoke. Surely small roaster like this with batch size of 100g could not cause much harm. To my surprise going beyond second crack start (recommended for seasoning) produce quuuuite a LOT of smoke. So much so that I was almost banished and I could smell the smoke next day when I returned from work.

So I took my little piece of hell outside to continue seasoning there. Surely, smoke was not that big of a deal anymore but sitting on a bench, freezing in 5C wasn’t the fun I had in mind, pressing that “checkout” button.. 

I went back on web trying to learn more about ventilation, dipping into thus sub as well. Anyway, I came with pretty easy sollution wich I hope could inspire someone in similar situation so I decided to share.

Although, I’m done seasoning, I will probably never go beyond SC again, I hope this will be sufficient to get rid of any smoke. So far tested on medium roasts, to everyones satisfaction (hopefully neighbours as well :-)) 

I basically put a wooden board into the kitchen window, cut a hole in it for flexi aluminium pipe, connected that with inline duct fan (Vevor 6inch (150mm)) and that’s it. I left a gap of about 50cm between roasters exhaust pipe and fan and also offset a fan to be a little higher in order to not directly suck the air from the roaster and allow the hot air to mix up with colder (as fans stated max operating temp is 45C). Next time roasting I will try to measure the inlet temp to the fan, but for now everything seems cool enough. 

One final note, I bought a bigger fan (550m3/h) and I’m glad I did so. I was considering smaller (4 inch) with half the flowrate but at the higher temperatures toward the end of the roast I found myself almost maxing power in 6 inch to get rid of the smoke and smell. 

So, for those of you wondering, roasting coffee in flat is possible, if you take care of venitlation, although roaster size could be a big variable.

More than two months ago my sister asked me which Zara perfume to buy for a friend since I am chronically online. I never smelled a single Zara perfume in my life and the day after I had to go and check if my suggestion made any sense.

And there it was: Zara Coffee Collection. Whipped Coffee smelled like a literal dream, and I waited for BF to buy it. Also there was a Cocoa Sunset on sale, so I bought that one as well. Both smell divine.

And then I fell into a rabbit hole. I was never a perfume lover, but I started watching reviews and it gave me so much joy. And it became a hunt. Gourmand Coffee was everyone's favorite and it was almost sold out. I bought the litteral last bottle. Then I started thinking about Mango Coffee. I mixed Whipped Coffee and my TBS Mango mist, and it was magnificent.

But Mango Coffee was sold out, so I planned the whole trip to another country with four people just to buy it. As we landed, first thing I did was go the the only shopping mall that still had it and bought again the litteral last bottle. The shopping assistant had to go to the backstock area to find it.

And then there was only Blush Coffee left. I intentionally watched only rave reviews until I convinced myself it is this magnificent blend of roses and coffee. After Zara sale it was 50% off and I got it.

I am still happy about this, though I see it is a radical behaviour. I was like this about makeup before. So I just hit the brakes on. This is it. Now when I go to a store that has perfumes I have to test smell think about it and of course watch countless videos. But, I don't buy anything.

Earlier today I was at a train station in South West London (closest station to my house) and a man started following me around the station, staring at me and approaching me repeatedly. I moved areas to try to get away, went into a coffee shop to ask for help, and eventually asked another woman to stay with me because I felt unsafe. When I tried to board my train, he followed me onto the carriage and approached me directly, which made me panic and get off immediately. Station staff were called and helped me.

Staff and people that helped me strongly advised me to report it to BTP, and I’ve since reported the incident to the police and been given a crime reference number. I’m home now and safe, but I’m extremely shaken.

What I’m now spiralling about is:

	•	Will the man be contacted straight away?

	•	Could he somehow know it was me who reported it?

	•	What if I bump into him again and he recognises me or threatens me?

I don’t understand how these investigations usually work, whether anything will even come of it, or what the realistic risks are. My brain is going to worst-case scenarios and I feel really scared.

If anyone has experience with reporting something like this, or knows how these things are typically handled in the UK, I’d really appreciate some reassurance. Even just hearing that this fear is normal would help.

Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

Instead of rejecting me outright, why not give me the opportunity to show you that I would be the right fit? I find this really unfair. When someone applies with previous experience, that should be a sign they’re coming to you with valuable skills to offer.

1qv563y,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1qv563y/unfiltered_first_excision_lap_recovery_experience/,Unfiltered first excision lap recovery experience,"Context: I am 25, I live in the UK, waited about 4 years for surgery after finally convincing a doctor to refer me, had diagnostic and excision surgery performed by endometriosis specialist **15 days ago**, stage of endometriosis was not confirmed but I was told endometriosis was found on the back of my uterus. 3 incision sites: umbilical, lateral lower tummy, centrally below tummy. Also had Mirena IUD placed in during surgery. The past two years I have been dealing very well with my symptoms and was lucky enough to have months in between pain flare ups (the years pre/post referral were not as lucky, with multiple flare ups most weeks along bladder/bowel symptoms). This was also my first surgery as an adult. 

  
Nothing could have prepared me for the recovery period - I did my thorough research, scoured every part of the internet, asked the doctors, but I was still hit with things I could have not expected. There's some great posts out there on what/how to prepare but it felt like a crazy experience for me, sometimes funny, sometimes scary. Obviously, everyone's experience is so different but here is a glimpse of mine. **If you read through this before your surgery, please don't panic - this is just me trying to normalise my experience.**

First few days were like a fever dream: 

* I was inflated like a balloon, needed constant assistance for most moves (sitting up, standing up, getting clothes on), I was lucky enough to be able to walk about in my flat from day 1 (very important to start to get the gas out).
* Pain was very well managed at home - I definitely felt in pain and uncomfy but I managed the first few days with co-codamol 30/500 and ibuprofen (I needed both). However, the first 4 mornings I almost fainted when getting out of bed (ears ringing, loss of vision, weakness, paleness) - I thought that this could be after-effects of the anesthesia but I now know that this was the cocodamol (I stopped it after and managed with ibuprofen and paracetamol instead and the near-fainting episodes stopped).
* The anesthesia and cocodamol constipate you so on day 3, it was my mission to poop! Equipped myself with some Lactulose, took a dose in the morning - and nothing the rest of the day. At dinner, I decide to take another dose. One hour from dinner passes and I successfully poop - I was very happy that the second dose did its job (but oh boy *was I WRONG - this was only the first dose hitting*). At 4am the second dose hit, and I was back and forth to the toilet for about 3 hours. This culminated in the morning: sun rises, I almost faint getting out of bed so decide to sit on the edge until all settles down and I am hit by the *urge*. I knew I had roughly 1 minute to get to the toilet - it was either shit myself or risk fully fainting on the way to the toilet. I had only been with my boyfriend for 6 months (who was in the room with me) so I did not particularly want to choose the first option. I managed to mutter to my boyfriend that I was about to shit myself and poor man had to direct me to the toilet whilst I was barely able to see (due to the near-fainting). Luckily: made it to the toilet. Unluckily: Boyfriend had to hold my hand while everything came out. *Deeply humbling experience*.
* THE GAS PAIN!!!!!! I was expecting shoulder pain, but I never expected to feel STABBED to the bones in the shoulders, I always thought it would feel like tension pain. The only things that helped me with these were heat pads and hourly movement (I even had to wake up in the night to walk around a bit)
* Had my first shower on day 3 and took dressings off (honestly I didn't know when was normal but I was told to keep my dressings dry for 3 days and I used wipes to clean myself until then) - did not realise how teary I would get when I saw my belly button cut through. It felt like there were so many changes within me and *I didn't feel like myself anymore*. 
* Minimally bled for 1 day post-surgery but it was expected.

End of first week/start of second week:

* Developed a small infection at the belly button (boooo) and started antibiotics.
* Developed a BIG bruise under the umbilical incision site (it took a few days for this to come through) - I was SO PANICKED! This was day 4/5 post-op and my head jumped straight to internal bleeding (you might be able to tell through this post that my head does jump to the worst conclusion first). Luckily it was just a bruise from how they worked on me, but it is not something I expected/read about anywhere??
* Started to walk small distances outside, go to coffee shops nearby - even if I felt painful and not fully mobile, I was gaining more confidence and ability.
* Whole tummy pain started to decrease and started to localise more towards pelvic area.

End of second week:

* To start this story - I got my period at day 12 post-op (right on time for my cycle). At discharge, I was told that the pain trend should go down every day, and that given the IUD, they could not be sure when I would get my first period.
* Days 9-11: pain started to increase, culminating to an UNIMAGINABLE level on day 11. The paracetamol and ibuprofen combos were not cutting it, I was scared to take cocodamol, and my pains were reaching excruciating levels. The moment it got to 8/10 I called the gynae team and I was told to go to the hospital ASAP. In the waiting room this pain definitely reached 10/10, it was a level I had never felt before. It felt like it was taking over my entire body. I genuinely thought this was going to be a complication. The doctor palpated my tummy, talked through the history, and through my cycle. The conclusion was that this was pre-menstrual pain, gave me diclofenac suppositories to take *rectally,* and to come back if the pain levels carry on like this for a couple of more days. Honestly, I left the hospital defeated - I thought surely my period pains can't be THAT GRUELING. Low and behold, the next day I got my period.
* Those suppositories have been life saving. I absolutely hate putting them in, and it genuinely makes me *sad* when I do but they are helping so much with the pain (and probably my stomach from not having deal with the painkillers).

  
Today I am on day 15 post-op. I wish I could say that I feel hopeful, that I feel brave and proud that I got my diagnosis. But honestly, I don't. I feel defeated - I am not sure why I thought this was going to be a smooth recovery? I thought I would be back at work today. I can definitely move so much better, and finally sleep on my side (YIPEE, I hate sleeping on my back). And there's only as much crafts, watching TV, and doomscrolling as I can do. I have had an incredible boyfriend around me that has truly tried to support me. But it's moments like these when you realise how important support *networks* are. So if you made it until the end of this long post, I have a couple of questions for you:

* If you had a tough recovery, how did you build yourself back up mentally? How did you move on? 
* If you are in the UK, how did you get access to more detailed findings around the surgery? I am meant to have an appointment in April via telephone but honestly I want access to photos etc.
* What kept you sane/entertained during recovery?

 In traditional Algerian architecture (especially in the Casbah), the house was designed with strict privacy in mind. The street belonged to the men, but the rooftops belonged to the women. The terrace was the one outdoor space where women could remove their veils (Haik), feel the breeze, and socialize freely with neighbors without being seen by men. The relaxed posture of the woman lying down emphasizes that this is a safe, private zone where they are the masters of their environment.

The Social Ritual of Coffee (El Qaada): The activity itself, preparing and serving coffee, is not just about quenching thirst. This represents hospitality and bonding. In a time when women's movement outside the home was limited, these rooftop gatherings were their primary source of news, entertainment, and emotional support.

2. Pull a longish shot (e.g., 18g in 50g out) salami-style, so first 25g in one cup and second 25g in the other
3. The first half is acidic/fruity, the second half is sweet or bitter and roastier
4. If I like the acidity, I grind coarse and pull longer shots to dilute the intensity while preserving the fruity notes (modern approach)

I (26F) went out with this guy (24M) about a week and half ago now? It wasn’t a proper date for the first, we hung out in his car and talked. I ended up doing things I didn’t want to do yet, but I didn’t protest much.

Anyways I was scared it was a one and done situation given what happened in his car. He texted me after and we made plans for another day so I assumed maybe he’s someone who enjoys moving fast! (me too) 

We go out and get coffee. I’m ngl there were moments of lull, but by the end we were laughing and flowing. Once we leave the coffee place, he’s cuddling me in his car since I was shaking from how cold it was. We kiss and whatnot and he says “I wish we could really cuddle” (he and I both live with our parents)

His house is empty for another hour or so, so he asks me if I want to go to his house. Tbh I assumed we were just going to cuddle. By this point I was still a virgin, had a ton of SH scars and wanted to have a conversation about myself and body before I gave myself to someone.

When we get there he brings me to a guest room and I realize quickly what it’s turning into. He noticed my hesitation because he asked a few different times. It was consensual, but I wish I didn’t have sex yet.

Anyways. His parents were leaving town for something and he asked if I wanted to come over 2 days after that point. I agreed.

Cut over to our texting and it’s not much. I felt like he texted a lot more before, and even then I made the assumption he’s more of an “in person” convo type, but  still.

We’ve maybe texted 4 times throughout the day? 

On the day before I was supposed to go to his house, I asked if plans were still on and he said no, since he had to take his parents to the airport early+homework he told me about when we were in the car together.

I didn’t pressure for a new day then. 

I feel silly since things aren’t that serious, but I think it’s just the notion of now my virginity is gone and I’m not getting the responses I used to.

I just mentioned to him today that we should plan something. It’s been about 6 hours but I’ve waited longer for a reply lol.

I built data-driven relocation dashboard for comparison cities. I've added some less obvious factors that don't seem so important, but for many, they're the most important. Did you know that weather is the most common reason for moving? But then there's more: some people value access to skiing, others simply want to live by the sea, and still others want to be able to quickly get away. I've included all of that - 50+ params. So you can compare up to five cities simultaneously in one place.

The number of international migrants increased from 275 million in 2020 to 304 million by 2024. So, my project is for those who don't yet know where they'll be moving.

I focus on SEO traffic. I've already had successful content projects.

My commercial target is translators, lawyers, realtors, and document assistants. I've already given them a lot of money. More on that below.

**Why me?**

I'm developer from Ukrain. For obvious reasons, I haven't lived at home for four years. So I got master degree in short term rent. I really can understand the quality of apartment by photos and description. 

But when I was choosing a place to live for my family long term, my browser was running out of tabs; all I did was constantly switching between them and creating Excel spreadsheets. Relocation assistants are often incompetent and 100% unwilling to delve into your specific needs. So I solved my own painful problem of comparing and searching for information.

And I have one living child from 2022.

We are about to TTC again, after taking a break to give my body some rest and so I could have my body to myself again after being pregnant for basically a whole year but with no living babies. The first trimester is always ROUGH for me and even though we are excited/hopeful to continue our journey I am NOT looking forward to being pregnant. With my daughter I really enjoyed my pregnancy, and I do love giving birth (even with my TFMR baby I enjoyed the act of giving birth). But this time, after two losses and having to do TWO first trimesters with no baby, I am dreading being pregnant. 

I don't want to feel sick or tired, I don't want to stop drinking 4x coffees all day (lol I know prob too many even when you're not preggo), I don't want to gain weight again because all I can eat is beige food, I just really want a baby but no pregnancy!!! Now I finally understand why rich folks use surrogates - I have some ethical concerns there too, but I GET IT NOW. I would loooove if I could just have a baby tomorrow. Well, I would want to be 38 weeks pregnant tomorrow so I can still have a few weeks of lovingly rubbing my belly and then giving birth peacefully at home because I do enjoy that, but I don't want the rest of the pregnancy. I have really been enjoying having my body just to myself and even though I do really want another baby I really do not want to be pregnant.

We’re a family of 3 (early 30s + baby under 1) currently living in Manhattan, NYC. We’ve lived here for almost a decade and genuinely love our life — strong group of friends, real community, walkability, nightlife, and the feeling that you can step outside at any time and the city feels alive. NYC has never felt lonely, dull, or isolating to us, which we really value.

That said, as we think long-term about raising a child, housing space, and finances, we’re exploring whether there’s a place where we could save more without giving up the lifestyle and energy we love. This isn’t about being unhappy in NYC — it’s about optimizing for the next phase of life.

Our top priorities

	1.	Community & social fabric

This is the biggest factor for us. We currently have a strong friend group and community in NYC, and we know that’s hard to replicate. We don’t have family anywhere in the U.S., so wherever we move needs to be a place where it’s realistically possible to build friendships, meet other families, and feel socially connected rather than isolated.

	2.	Walkability (non-negotiable)

We love walking and want daily life to be walkable — coffee, groceries, parks, school, casual dinners, etc. Car-dependent sprawl isn’t a fit.

	3.	Lively environment / city energy

We love being able to step out at night and feel energy — restaurants, people out, things happening. Quiet at home is great, but we don’t want a place that feels sleepy, dull, or socially disconnected. (For context, previously Hoboken/ Journal Square, NJ felt isolating.)

4.	Good public schools

Strong schools matter a lot to us. Not necessarily hyper-competitive pressure cookers, but solid, well-funded districts.

	5.	Affordability & ability to save

One of the main reasons we’re considering a move is to reduce housing costs and be able to save/invest more than we can in Manhattan — without a major lifestyle downgrade.

	6.	Quality of life + housing space

More space than NYC, access to parks/playgrounds, and a comfortable home.

Logistics

We’re open to renting initially, buying, or renting now and buying in the next 12–18 months, depending on the market and location.

Would love to hear from:

	•	People who loved NYC and moved somewhere that didn’t feel like a downgrade

	•	Families who successfully built community without nearby family

	•	Honest pros/cons of towns that actually feel social and alive

	•	Any underrated places we might be missing

1qv4r3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qv4r3j/the_passenger_in_the_glass/,The Passenger in the Glass,"I never thought routine could be dangerous.

I used to think it was the safest thing in the world.

Every night at 11:00 p.m., I left the library and took the subway home. Same platform. Same car. Same seat if it was available—the third from the door, right side, where the window turned into a mirror once the train disappeared into the tunnel. I liked watching my reflection float over the darkness. It made me feel like I was still here, even when everything outside vanished.

It started on a Tuesday.

The train was almost empty. A few people spaced far apart, all of us pretending not to see each other. When we slipped into the tunnel, the glass darkened, and my reflection sharpened.

That’s when I saw him.

He was sitting three rows behind me. He hadn’t been there when I boarded—I was sure of it. He wore a bright yellow raincoat, the kind that looked plasticky and stiff, the kind that crinkled when you moved. It caught the light in an unnatural way. It hadn’t rained in weeks.

He wasn’t looking at his phone. He wasn’t blinking.

He was looking at me.

Or rather, at the back of my head. Our eyes met only in the reflection, and something about that felt worse, like I wasn’t supposed to notice him yet.

I got off at my stop and waited until the doors were about to close before turning around. He didn’t move. He didn’t stand. He just watched as the train carried him away, his yellow shape shrinking into the tunnel.

I told myself it was nothing. People ride the same trains every day. People wear weird clothes.

On Wednesday, he was there again.

Same car. Same seat. Same yellow coat.

This time, I felt him before I saw him. That crawling sensation between the shoulders, the instinct that makes you straighten your spine without knowing why. When I looked into the glass, my reflection was pale and tight, and behind me, he was smiling.

He lifted his hands.

The scissors were small but sharp, their metal catching the overhead lights. He opened and closed them slowly.

Snip.

Snip.

Perfectly timed with the clatter of the rails. Each motion deliberate, careful, like he was practicing.

Practicing on me.

No one else reacted. No one looked up. I wanted to scream, but the sound stayed lodged in my chest, heavy and useless. When the train slowed, I stood up and got off three stops early. My legs shook so badly I almost fell onto the platform.

I spent two hours in a 24-hour diner, nursing a coffee I didn’t drink, my back pressed against the wall. Every time the door opened, my heart jumped. Every time someone wore yellow—hoodie, scarf, logo—I felt sick.

When I finally went home, the hallway outside my apartment was empty and silent. Too silent. As I unlocked the door, my finger brushed something thin.

A single yellow thread was caught in the doorframe.

I didn’t sleep that night. Or the next day.

By Thursday, I was sure of two things: he knew my routine, and he was getting closer.

I left the library early and ordered a ride-share instead of taking the train. I didn’t breathe properly until the car pulled away from the curb. The driver spoke as we merged into traffic.

“Rough night?”

His voice was low and dry, like he didn’t use it often.

“Just tired,” I said, staring out the window.

We passed beneath a streetlight. For half a second, the interior of the car lit up, and I saw his arm on the steering wheel.

Yellow sleeve.

My stomach dropped so hard I thought I might pass out. I looked at the dashboard. No navigation. No open app. I hadn’t checked the license plate. I hadn’t checked anything.

“You’re early tonight,” he whispered.

Then, softer: “I like when you change things up.”

We stopped at a red light.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. I forced my voice to stay steady. “I think I dropped my phone back there. Could you pull over?”

He laughed quietly and reached into his pocket.

“I picked it up for you.”

He held out my phone. My rose-gold case. The small scratch on the corner. I had left it on a library table an hour earlier. That meant he’d been inside. Close enough to hear me breathe.

As he leaned toward me, I grabbed my metal water bottle and smashed it into his head. The sound it made was wet and wrong. He swerved. The car jerked.

I yanked the manual handle and fell out onto the street, skin shredding against the asphalt. I ran toward the nearest fire station, screaming until my throat burned and my vision blurred.

The police found the car abandoned a few blocks away.

Inside, they found a scrapbook.

No pictures. Just hair. Locks of it, taped neatly to the pages. Different colors. Different textures. Every one labeled with a name and a date.

The last page had only one name written in yellow ink.

Mine.

Under it was tomorrow’s date.

I’m posting this from a friend’s place. I haven’t gone home. I haven’t slept. The police say they’re looking for him.

Tonight, when I washed my hands, I found a yellow thread wrapped around my wrist.

I don’t remember putting it there.

I tried to tell myself it was nothing. That I was exhausted. That fear was inventing patterns where there were none.

I went back to the living room and sat on the couch, careful not to wake my friend. The apartment was dark except for the faint glow of the TV screen, paused and black.

That’s when I realized the apartment was completely silent.

No traffic. No refrigerator hum.

No breathing from the bedroom.

I stood up slowly and took one step toward the hallway. My friend’s door was open wider than I remembered.

In the dark reflection of the TV screen, I saw movement behind me.

The yellow raincoat stood out immediately.

He was already inside.

Standing in the hallway, scissors hanging loosely at his side, yellow thread looped around his fingers like it had always belonged there.

He smiled when he saw that I’d noticed him.

“You broke your routine,” he whispered. “That always makes things messy.”",0,1770153870.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

My boyfriend has asked for 2 nights a week where i ""leave him alone""","my (f25) partner (m22) have been going through a difficult time recently. this situation is specifically about an argument we had today where he ended up basically asking me to leave him the hell alone for 2 nights a week.

for context, he is a pretty avid gamer and would probably spend all day and night playing videogames if he was able to. we've been living together for about a year a half and although i've tried to be supportive and understanding about this hobby, maybe im also in the wrong somewhat as well.

i have an extremely busy schedule at the moment, im studying a masters and working at the same time - sometimes my day is literally 7am - midnight. my partner is also a student and works but his schedule definitely isn't as busy as mine, and he quite often has a lot of free time during the day/in the evening where he can game freely without me getting in the way at all. we actually have quite a small flat where his pc is right in the doorway of our living room/kitchen so i'm quite often in and out of there which i can imagine is distracting.

anyway, today is my busiest day of the week where im literally out the house for over 12 hours, and the week before last he came to pick me up from work, telling me that i shouldn't have to get the bus back after such a long day and of course he's happy to come and get me, which i really appreciated and thought was really sweet. today i got up this morning to make him coffee me as i knew he had a busy day and needed to be up early also. i then asked him if he'd mind picking me up from work again later that night (remembering what he said the week before last) and i was honestly a bit sad when he said no because he wanted to play videogames.

for context, i'd suggested that we should try and spend an evening this weekend together as we really have had a rough time recently and it would be nice to try and rebuild our connection and sense of safety in the relationship. i also suggested he use tuesday (my busiest day) as a day to play videogames so he didn't feel like he would be ""missing out"" when we spent the evening together on saturday. although i understand this could be the reason he didn't want to, i really don't understand why all the hours he'd have at home doing that whilst i was out at uni and work wouldn't be enough. especially after what he had said to me about picking me up the week before.

i called him at some point during the day to say i was a bit upset about this sudden change (literally going from ""ofc i would never want you to get the bus home"" to ""i can't be bothered to come and get you later because it'll take 40 minutes off at least 5 hours already playing"".

the situation basically completely blew up, and he was shouting down the phone at me that he feels completely trapped and hates the way i am towards him, that he feels he's never able to just spend a whole evening playing games for as long as he wants to. i want to be completely transparent and say i really do feel guilty and sad he feels this way. id never want to make him feel trapped or like he can't do what he wants to do. i just honestly don't see why spending the amount of time he does doing it already isn't enough, and he isn't excited for me to get home from my long day and spend some time with me. i know that's how id feel if it was the other way around. he's now suggested that for 2 nights a week, i just completely leave him alone. he phrased it as ""not needing anything or wanting anything from him"". even after im already out the house for 12 hours and don't get home till midnight.

i'm just torn. both options make me really sad, whether ive truly done something terrible in making him feel this way about his time, or whether he just isn't that bothered about spending time with me after i've had a long day. as a non gamer, i just don't understand how he can only feel sated from gaming after at least an 8 hour session.

a further detail is that i'm dealing with some recent betrayal from him which i won't go into too much detail about, but i feel like maybe this is adding to my sadness. i also think that if our situation was reversed, i'd be doing everything i could for him to feel special and safe in the relationship again. not demanding 2 nights a week of basically no contact. but yeah, im also feeling really ashamed that maybe i have restricted him and made him feel like he can't just do what he wants to do, because it's true that although he does still game quite a lot, it's never till past like 1am as i do pretty often ask him to come to bed with me, or wait up until he's done. i just really don't know, and any insight either way would be appreciated.

\*slight edit for context, i also get flare ups of insomnia and do sleep a lot better when he's there. i try not to let this affect him but if i have something particularly important or early the next day, i will ask him to come to bed early with me. maybe this has contributed to his feelings as well",14,1770153533.0,AmIOverreacting,68,0.82,False

Advice?","I have never been in a relationship before. I have talked to guys and did stuff online but never more than that. Since the past month I met this guy on reddit from the city I live in from the sub of the city. When we were getting to know each other on chats he said he really really liked me. Then few days after the new years we met in real life. He picked me up bought me coffee we went to an outdoor place talked a lot and it was nice not awkward at all it felt like we knew each other for a long time. He said he felt the same and he felt comfortable with me. Then next day we were texting and he started dirty talking + flirting little which I played along with because I find him cute, he kept complimenting how beautiful I am as well. He asked me if I think he wants to fuck I said yes i think you do he said he wants to but not just fuck and dip he wants something meaningful with me I said I want that too. He told me he never had a gf before but he had an unplanned sex once and never spoke to her again because they weren’t supposed to have sex but it happened in the moment and she has a kid thats all. Anyways, I told him sexual things I’d love to try then he asked if we can do anything I said I’d love for him to kiss my neck and vice versa and he suggested we can do that in his car backseat. I agreed so we met up 2 days later at 10pm he drove somewhere up the hill and we talked for a bit then we started whatever we planned, none of us got unclothed just with clothes on grinding and stuff but he got his hands under my hoodie which I didn’t mind and I got to touch his body under sweater too. It was beautiful then 2 weeks later we met again and this time we talked for a long time then I got on top of him on the drivers seat and grinded on him a lot it was fun. But I feel like from the 2nd meet onwards we started getting sexual which is healthy or not I don’t know as I’ve never done anything before with anyone and don’t know who to ask. I told him I feel we are rushing and he reassured me that we are not and it’s ok. He is very caring and reassuring which I really love and he really cares about my comfort and never forces anything in real life which I also love but I noticed that everytime we aren’t seeing each other he either replies late or texts less. It’s like I’m waiting for him all the time. He told me few times he just sleeps a lot when he’s broke which he usually is broke. I don’t know if I must believe his words. He said few days ago he wants to come see me but then he begun asking what are we doing when we meet… now I’m starting to think does he want to meet me just when he’s so uncontrollably horny. It’s again 2 weeks I haven’t seen him. We don’t even live far his drive from his to mine is 10-15 mins. 30 mins with bus. I really don’t know what’s happening between us because we aren’t even in a relationship also he always wants to meet in the night time which is very questionable I really don’t know I need advice

1qv4iz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qv4iz2/how_to_hack_your_adhd_brain_the_science_based/,How to Hack Your ADHD Brain The Science Based Dopamine Guide That Actually Works,"okay so i spent the last year researching this because my brain literally felt like a browser with 47 tabs open and three of them playing music. read a ton of books, listened to neuroscience podcasts, watched Dr. Russell Barkley's lectures on repeat (the guy's basically the ADHD research god). and holy shit, the stuff we're NOT told about dopamine and ADHD is wild.

here's the thing everyone gets wrong: ADHD isn't about lacking focus. it's about inconsistent dopamine signaling in your prefrontal cortex. your brain is literally wired differently. which means those ""just focus harder"" tips are about as useful as telling someone to simply grow taller. but once you understand how your dopamine system works, you can actually work WITH your brain instead of against it.

**the dopamine deficit reality**

ADHD brains have lower baseline dopamine and norepinephrine transmission. this isn't laziness or moral failure, it's neurobiology. your brain is constantly seeking stimulation to reach normal dopamine levels. that's why you can hyperfocus on video games for 6 hours but can't read one work email. games provide immediate dopamine hits, emails don't.

[Dr. Ned Hallowell](https://drhallowell.com) (Harvard psychiatrist who literally has ADHD himself) explains this perfectly in ""ADHD 2.0"". the book won multiple awards and completely changed how i understood my brain. he breaks down how ADHD brains are actually seeking optimal stimulation, not avoiding work. when a task isn't stimulating enough, your brain literally can't engage properly. the chapters on positive emotional states and finding your ""zone of optimal stimulation"" are game changing. this is hands down the most practical ADHD book that doesn't just regurgitate medication info.

**body doubling is criminally underrated**

your brain focuses better when someone else is present, even if they're doing completely different work. sounds weird but the research backs it up. the presence of another person provides just enough external stimulation and accountability to keep your dopamine regulated.

try Focusmate, it's a virtual coworking platform where you get paired with random people for 50 minute work sessions. cameras on, brief intro, then you both just work silently. costs like $5/month. the mild social pressure is chef's kiss for ADHD brains. i've gotten more done in 3 hour Focusmate sessions than entire previous weeks of ""trying to focus alone.""

**the 2 minute brain dump trick**

before starting ANY task, spend exactly 2 minutes writing down every random thought bouncing around your skull. grocery lists, shower thoughts, that embarrassing thing you said in 2015, all of it. this clears your mental RAM.

ADHD brains struggle with working memory, we literally can't hold as much information consciously as neurotypical brains. those intrusive thoughts aren't distractions, they're your brain terrified of forgetting something. write them down, your brain can relax, dopamine can actually flow to the task at hand.

**strategic caffeine timing**

caffeine works differently for ADHD brains because it affects dopamine receptors. but timing matters. having coffee 30 minutes BEFORE your hardest task primes your dopamine system. pair it with a 10 minute walk (movement increases dopamine too) right before you need to focus.

Dr. Andrew Huberman covers this extensively in his podcast episode on optimizing dopamine. he's a Stanford neuroscientist and his breakdown of dopamine dynamics is insanely good. the episode on ADHD and focus explains why random stuff like cold showers and bright light exposure in the morning actually help ADHD symptoms by regulating baseline dopamine throughout the day.

if you want to go deeper on understanding how your specific ADHD brain works but don't have the energy to sit through hours of lectures or dense research papers, there's this app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that's been really helpful. it's an AI learning platform built by former Google engineers that pulls from neuroscience research, ADHD expert talks, and books like the ones mentioned here.

you can type in something like ""i have ADHD and struggle with starting tasks, help me understand my dopamine system and build better habits"" and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio lessons just for you. what's cool is you control the depth, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with research citations and real examples. plus you can pick different voices, some people swear by the calm one for evening learning or the energetic one for morning commutes. it basically turns all this ADHD science into digestible audio you can listen to while doing other stuff, which honestly fits way better with how ADHD brains actually learn.

**temptation bundling for boring tasks**

pair something boring with something your brain actually wants. fold laundry while watching your favorite show. listen to a podcast you love during exercise. answer emails while having your favorite snack.

this isn't ""rewarding yourself after,"" it's simultaneous dopamine stacking. your brain gets enough stimulation from the enjoyable thing to maintain focus on the boring one. James Clear talks about this in ""Atomic Habits"" but it's especially powerful for ADHD brains that need more dopamine to engage.

**the** [pomodoro method](https://www.asundergrad.pitt.edu/study-lab/study-skills-tools-resources/pomodoro-technique) **modified**

traditional pomodoro is 25 min work, 5 min break. but ADHD brains often need shorter intervals initially. start with 15 min work, 5 min break. or even 10/5. gradually increase as your brain builds tolerance.

during breaks, do something PHYSICAL. don't scroll your phone, that's just more screen time. do pushups, walk outside, pet your dog, anything that moves your body. physical movement increases dopamine and norepinephrine naturally.

use an app like Forest that gamifies focus sessions. you plant a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. sounds dumb but that tiny bit of consequence creates just enough urgency for ADHD brains to stay on task.

**accept that some days just suck**

dopamine levels fluctuate based on sleep, stress, diet, even weather. some days your brain will cooperate, others it won't. fighting it creates shame spirals that tank dopamine even further.

on low dopamine days, do easier tasks. batch emails, organize files, plan future projects. save cognitively demanding work for high dopamine days. this isn't giving up, it's strategic energy management.

the mental health app Finch is surprisingly great for this. it's a little bird that you take care of by completing self care tasks and goals. helps you track patterns in your energy and mood without feeling like homework. plus the bird sends you encouraging messages which honestly helps on days when your brain is being mean to you.

**environmental dopamine optimization**

your environment massively impacts focus. ADHD brains are more sensitive to environmental stimuli. noise cancelling headphones aren't optional, they're essential. brown noise or binaural beats provide just enough auditory stimulation without being distracting.

keep your workspace visually minimal. clutter competes for your brain's attention. but having one or two fidget items helps, your hands need something to do while your brain focuses. i keep a small smooth stone on my desk, sounds weird but tactile stimulation helps.

work near a window if possible. natural light regulates circadian rhythms which directly impact dopamine production. if you can't, get a SAD lamp, especially in winter.

**protein timing for sustained focus**

eating protein rich breakfast increases dopamine and norepinephrine precursors (tyrosine and phenylalanine). this gives your brain the raw materials it needs for neurotransmitter production. sugary breakfast spikes and crashes blood sugar, taking your dopamine with it.

this isn't diet culture BS, it's brain chemistry. eggs, greek yogurt, nuts, protein smoothies, whatever works. you're literally feeding your dopamine system.

**the bigger picture mindset shift**

ADHD brains aren't broken, they're just optimized for different environments. we're novelty seekers, pattern recognizers, crisis responders. in a hunter gatherer society, these traits were advantages. modern office work with repetitive tasks and arbitrary deadlines, not so much.

stop trying to force yourself into neurotypical productivity systems. they weren't built for your brain. instead, design systems that leverage your natural dopamine seeking tendencies. use your hyperfocus powers strategically. embrace that you'll always need more stimulation and structure that in proactively.

your brain needs more dopamine to function at baseline. that's not a character flaw, it's neurochemistry. the sooner you accept that and work with it instead of against it, the sooner you stop fighting yourself every single day.",1,1770153363.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

I’m a classically trained actor with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, hundreds of auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. Last week, I had auditions for a series regular on Joel Kinnamin's next Amazon show, a recurring guest for the Bosch prequel, and a large multi scene costar for Power Origins, just for context of where I’m at professionally and what I bring to the table.

My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & a horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Veep, Sopranos, Fargo, Leftovers, Mad Men, Succession, Mr InBetween, Arrested Development, Barry, The Terror, There Will Be Blood, Charlie Kaufman, Danny McBride, Adult Swim, Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, etc. you get the idea.

My goal is to build a portfolio to use to solicit financing for a slate of features & series down the road + expand my network of filmmaker friends.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee or Zoom & talk shop.

I’m making this post because I’m wondering if any of you can give me some insight on the Job Corps here in El Paso. Basically, I’m gonna be out of a home in less than two months, and getting a job is difficult. 

A little backstory as to why I’m in the situation I am: I finished high school in Vernon TX up till 10th grade, had a 3.7 GPA, but had to drop out due to being homeless for a couple of months. This of course snowballed into a mental health crisis for me and ever since then, I have been studying for my GED but not making enough progress. I’m 19 years old now, still don’t have my drivers licence, but I have had a job working at a coffee and donut place for 5 months while in New York (moving has been chaotic) I moved here initially to help my disabled parents with the house but now they need to move elsewhere and I can’t come with them. 

I unfortunately do not know very much Spanish. I’ve been reading up on a few reviews for the David L. Carrasco Job Corps Center, and I’ve seen some complaints which is bound to happen (especially for job corps) but one part that’s really sticking out to me is that most people there will be speaking mostly Spanish. That’s not a huge problem, it’s about time I started learning Spanish anyhow. I don’t think I can go there just to get my GED then learn a trade, since I actually still really need to learn some of the curriculum in order to pass. So I think I’ll be getting my diploma? Not entirely sure.

Does anyone have personal experience with that Job Corps? Any stories? Advice? Anything I need to know really? I honestly don’t mind if the place isn’t in the best shape, I’ve lived in poverty most of my time growing up and a roof over my head is usually worth it. But if there’s anything I should consider before possibly choosing this specific Job Corps, please let me know .",2,1770153019.0,ElPaso,1,0.67,False

He will make me breakfast a few times during the week, usually the weekend. Ill usually make us breakfast other times. Lately he's been asking me to make him breakfast and I havent been able to because my mornings have just been so busy with just getting ready + work, ( i dont even have time to make breakfast for myself), and hes been upset about this saying I dont want to make him breakfast, that I can just stop my work in the morning and make him something (this goes back to him thinking my work is chill). That i can do it but i wont bc im selfish, etc. This weekend he asked me to make him breakfast again and I say okay ill make you something but let me finish my coffee first, and he got so upset and started saying ""you never make me breakfast"" and it became a whole fight. 

And so i made this chores list and got really upset about it because I was doing alot more of the chores, even the shared chores are chores that I end up doing or I have to nag him to do. Like the bathroom sink, if I dont nag it wont get done or I just end up doing it. 

And looking at this list, I got mad and got upset at him and said obviously I cant give him more attention when im doing so much of the chores. He said I was over reacting to this, that his chores are more difficult, and im actually not doing as much or I dont need to, hes like ""cleaning the microwave isnt a real chore"". This really upset me even more and now we're at a standstill. 

 I don't really know where to go from here.

I got diagnosed at 43 and I am currently 45 now. Living my whole life undiagnosed led to of course anxiety and depression. My mind races and bounces everywhere all the time, just scrambled.

  
I'd like to know whats your guys' journey with meds and what has worked with what dose? It seems as though for me I'm going to need a high dose or above the recommended maximum. So basically Im looking for a common denominator in what is most effective.

For me 20-30 mg adderal plus 300mg wellbutrin seems to be not bad but still not good. I can also drink 2 cups of coffee with this cocktail and then I feel pretty normal lol.

Honestly, I don’t even remember the exact date because the proposal wasn’t romantic, he ordered the ring online and just let me open the package myself. I felt like there was no effort, and it made me question whether he truly values me.

Tonight we had a fight. The mall near us is only a 7-minute walk, but the road is dark and unsafe. Still, I went alone around 9 PM and stayed at a coffee shop until midnight. I expected him to follow me or at least pick me up, but he didn’t.

Recently, I also read a message he sent to a friend saying he didn’t even need to court me when we started dating. In the early stage of our relationship, he kept it a secret, only a few people knew. But when I saw how proud he was of his previous girlfriend, it hurt me deeply.

1qv4b14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qv4b14/how_i_orchestrated_claude_code_with_openclaw_to/,"How I orchestrated Claude Code with OpenClaw to handle multi-repo dev cycles (Reviewer-of-Reviewers, Task Tracking, and Mobile Notifications)","I love Claude Code, but the ""management tax"" is real. Manually finding the right directory, spawning sessions, and babysitting multiple workers across different repos was killing my flow.

I decided to stop ""using"" Claude Code manually and started **orchestrating** it using **OpenClaw** (that new agentic framework blowing up recently). Now, I don't manage sessions; I manage a team.

**The ""Walking the Dog"" Workflow:**

I can be out for a coffee or walking the dog and send a single voice note or message to my system. **OpenClaw** handles the rest:

1. **Smart Triage:** An agent captures the context and drafts a structured task in my CLI-native **Command Center**.
2. **Autonomous Spawn:** The system identifies the repo, creates a fresh Git worktree, and spawns a Claude Code worker with the task pre-loaded.
3. **The ""Reviewer Review"":** One agent reviews Claude's PR, and then a second agent **reviews the review** to filter out hallucinations. It’s a high-level quality gate that ensures the PRs I see are actually solid.
4. **Telegram SOS:** If a worker gets stuck or needs a human decision, it **pings me on Telegram**. I can unblock it from my phone while I'm still at the park.

**The Experience:**

I still have full observability and can jump into any Claude session manually, but I no longer have to babysit. I get the high-level milestones and critical updates streamed to my dashboard, while the agents handle the pedals. It turns Claude Code from a CLI tool you \*use\* into an autonomous dev team that just delivers results.

**Full Disclosure:**

I am the architect of this specific workflow and orchestration layer. I’m currently offering this setup as **paid consulting and modular ""Configuration Blocks""** to help me continue improving and scaling this system. If you're a power user or a team looking to skip the weeks of hook-writing and move straight to autonomous delegation, I’d love to show you a demo.

DM me if you'd like to discuss a custom config for your workflow!

1qv47ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1qv47ya/is_buttherefore_useful_in_prose/,Is BUT/THEREFORE Useful in Prose?,"During a dry spell, I came across a piece of screenwriting advice by South Park's directors: [Writing Advice from Matt Stone & Trey Parker @ NYU | MTVU's ""Stand In""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUNqq3jVLg)

BUT/THEREFORE.

So, this guideline? The written word and screenwriting are different mediums, but it seems like an interchangeable principle? I quote a basic example from a Redditor on the subject:

""I woke-up this morning and made breakfast -- **BUT** I realised I had no milk -- **THEREFORE** I got dressed and walked to the shop -- **BUT** I forgot it was Sunday and the shop wasn't open -- **THEREFORE** I couldn't get the milk -- **BUT** on my walk back I remembered there was a vending machine -- **THEREFORE** I could get my milk -- **BUT** all I had was my credit card, and the machine was malfunctioning -- **THEREFORE** my plans for a milky coffee were ruined again -- **BUT** on the way back to my apartment I noticed my neighbour hadn't collected the milk by her door, left by her milkman -- **THEREFORE** I stole it so I could make my latte -- **BUT** when I got back there was a power cut, so my coffee machine didn't work -- **THEREFORE** I was going to have to go my entire day un-caffeinated.""

Is this too reductive to use with creative writing overall, or does it have merit? I need to check my understanding. It's a universal law, causality, but does it transfer 1:1? I imagine in prose writing, there's a lot more…garnish(?) in-between these buzz words, as one thing leads to the other, if this even applies? Correct me if I'm wrong, I am a hobbyist. Have mercy.

1qv47lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qv47lt/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_after_she_said/,AITA for kicking my sister out after she said that about my son?,"My sister looked right at my son across the dinner table and said, ""Some kids are just born behind,"" and then she laughed like she'd said something clever.

I put my fork down. Didn't say anything for a second. My son was sitting right there. He's seven. He had his little plate of pasta in front of him, the kind with the small shells he likes, and he didn't even look up. He doesn't always catch things like that. And honestly, that made it worse.

My mom was visiting. That's why we were all at the table. My sister had been staying with us for about three months at that point, her and her two kids. She said it was temporary. She said she just needed a few weeks to get back on her feet after the divorce. Three months. Her kids were in the guest room. Her groceries were in my fridge. Her car was in my driveway.

I don't know why I thought dinner would go fine.

So she said it. And she laughed. And I just sat there for a second, because I was trying to figure out if she actually just said that. And she did. She said it again, quieter this time, like she was clarifying. ""I'm just saying. Some kids take longer. Some kids are just, you know. Behind.""

I looked at her. I kept my voice flat. I said, ""Behind, like how you and your kids are still in my house and eating my groceries?""

She stopped stirring her drink. Her whole face changed. Not embarrassed. Annoyed. Like I was the one who started something.

My mom whispered, ""Please don't do this.""

But I was already past that.

I should back up a little. Not a lot. Just enough.

My son was diagnosed when he was four. Took us a long time to get there, actually. He wasn't hitting the milestones the other kids were hitting, and every time I brought it up to the pediatrician they kept saying ""boys develop differently"" and ""give it time."" It wasn't until I pushed hard, like, really pushed, that we got the evaluation done. He has a learning disability. He gets an IEP at school. He goes to therapy twice a week. It is not easy and it is not cheap and we have been fighting for this kid every single day of his life.

My sister knows all of this. She has been in my house for three months. She has sat at this table while I talked about his therapy appointments. She has seen the paperwork on the counter. She knows.

So when she said what she said, it wasn't a mistake. It wasn't a slip. She knew exactly what she was doing.

She didn't back down. That's the thing. I said what I said about the groceries and she just kind of laughed again, quieter this time, and she said, ""Oh, so now it's about money? I'm just being realistic about your son's future, and suddenly I'm the bad guy?""

I said, ""What does that mean? His future?""

She shrugged. Actually shrugged. And she said, ""I just mean, at some point you have to be honest with yourself about what he's going to be able to do. You can't just keep throwing money at it.""

My mom put her hand on the table. ""That's enough. Both of you.""

But she was looking at me when she said it. Not at my sister. At me.

I felt something crack in my chest. Not from my sister, honestly. From my mom. Because I looked at my mom and I said, ""You're not going to tell her that's wrong?""

And my mom just looked away.

I didn't yell. I didn't cry. I sat there for about ten seconds and just breathed. My son was still eating his pasta. He hadn't looked up the whole time. And I just thought, OK. This is it. This is the thing that ends it.

I looked at my sister and I said, very calmly, ""You have thirty days to find somewhere else to live.""

She almost dropped her glass. ""What?""

""Thirty days,"" I said. ""I'll help you look if you want. But you need to be out of this house.""

She stared at me like I was crazy. And then she started laughing. Not a real laugh. That kind of laugh people do when they're nervous and trying to make you feel stupid. She said, ""You're joking.""

""I'm not.""

She looked at my mom. My mom opened her mouth and I said, ""Don't. Don't do that right now.""

That's when it went sideways. She pushed back from the table, the chair scraping loud against the floor, and she said, ""This is unbelievable. I come here when I have nowhere else to go and this is how you treat me?"" Her voice was getting louder. Loud enough to wake up her own kids, probably. And mine.

I said, ""You just told my son, to his face, that he's not going to amount to anything. In my house. At my table.""

""That is NOT what I said.""

""It's exactly what you said.""

""I said he's behind. That's a fact. His teachers say it. You know it's true.""

I stood up then. Not fast, not dramatic. I just stood up and I said, ""Get out of the kitchen.""

She didn't move. She just kept going. ""So you're going to kick me out over this? Over one comment? You're being insane.""

""I'm not kicking you out over one comment,"" I said. ""I'm kicking you out because this is what you do. This is what you've been doing since you got here. And I'm done.""

She looked at my mom again. My mom was staring at the table.

After that it was ugly. My sister cried. Then she got mean. Then she cried again. She said I was jealous of her. Jealous of what, I have no idea, she was sleeping on a pullout couch. She said my husband was going to agree with her. He wasn't home, he works nights, so she couldn't test that theory right then.

My mom left pretty early. Said she didn't want to be in the middle of it. Which, again, she wasn't in the middle of anything. She was on my sister's side. She just didn't want to say it out loud.

I texted my husband everything that night. Wrote it all out. Every word my sister said. The look on my son's face, the way he didn't even flinch because he's so used to feeling like he's the one doing something wrong. I told him what I did and what I said and I told him I needed him to back me up on this. He called me on his break. He said, ""Yeah. She's out.""

That was it. No argument. No ""let's talk about it."" Just, yeah, she's out.

I spent the next two days writing everything down. Not just the dinner thing. Everything. The comments she'd made about my son over the past three months. The one time she told her oldest, loud enough for everyone to hear, ""At least you're not like him."" The way she talked about the therapy appointments, like they were a waste. I wrote it all down with dates. I kept it in my phone.

My sister tried to act like nothing happened the next day. Came out in the morning, made coffee, sat down. I said, ""The thirty days still stand."" She looked at me with this expression, like I was being ridiculous, and she said, ""Can we just talk about this like adults?""

I said, ""I've been an adult about this for three months. You're the one who said what you said to my son.""

She didn't push it after that. Not right away.

The thirty days came. She didn't leave.

So I did what I said I would do. I had my husband handle it. He came home that morning, sat her down, and told her she needed to be out by end of day. Not thirty days from now. Today. Because she hadn't made any effort. No apartment applications. No calls. Nothing. She'd been waiting for me to back down.

I didn't back down.

She left that afternoon. Took her kids, took her stuff, and left. She didn't say goodbye to my son. She didn't say goodbye to me. She just packed up and walked out.

Two weeks later she showed up at the door crying. Said she wanted to talk. Said she was sorry. Said she had nowhere to go and could she just come in for a minute.

I looked at her through the door. I said, ""I hope you find a place.""

And I closed it.

My mom called me after that. Said I was being cruel. Said family doesn't do this to each other. Said I needed to forgive her and let her come back.

I said, ""She said that to my son. In my house. And you looked away.""

My mom hung up.

I don't know. Maybe I'm too harsh. Maybe I should have let it go like I did the other times. Maybe thirty days was too much and I should have just had a conversation and moved on.

But every time I think about my son sitting there with his little plate of pasta, not even looking up because he already knows he's the weird kid, I think, no. I'm not letting that happen in my own house.

People are telling me I went too far. My mom won't talk to me. My sister sent me a long message about how I ruined her life.

Did I?

We took a walk around the town. The usual boring stuff. Before this, he insisted on doing a video call and I agreed. We did almost an hour call. He didn't look weird.

I didn't feel the chemistry but agreed to give it a try. Throughout the date he tried to build physical connection. Telling me to sit facing him on the sofa, he was smart choosing cozy cafe with sofa. Checked how small my hands were. Next we checked a store and went in the elevator. He tried to kiss me and I stopped him with my hands.

It was awkward after that but date almost ended. Then we walked to the metro together cos our home is close to each other. He insisted we took a bit of quiet route. I felt off but went along cos it was still bright and people still around.

I was wearing a hat and he said to take it off. I did then for a bit cos I took it off here and there outside. Then he tried to pull me in in the middle of alley and said ""come here"" I stopped him and asked what are you doing? He said he wanted to kiss me and I said I'm not kissing a literal stranger I just met. He then went on saying kiss is expected in the first date and 70% even want sex. I was like wth this dude is creepy but I got a bit scared so we walked straight to the metro and then I told him I needed to go somewhere else. Said goodbye and run away.

He's weird to expect this right? Also I expect someone would ask if I want a kiss but that's also weird. But how can you not see there's no chemistry or connection yet?

Apparently I have not purchased flowers in a long time, as that shit was EXSPENSIVE. So I figured I do the next best thing, Doordash a coffee and munchkins(donut holes) from Dunks. I put the order in, a few minutes later the drive accepts, and I message him to let him know that it was for ""my wife"", and the she's working the front desk today. It gets delivered, and the delivery pic has my wife in the background, so I know she got it.

I said nothing to her, as Mondays are crazy busy for her, and I figured the name on the cup would clue her in to who sent it.

Unbeknownst to me, my wife was having the worst day up to that point. She works in a cat hospital, and while Mondays are already hectic, they apparently had 4 emergency euthanasia's. She's use to them happening, but from what I understand that many back to back is an outlier, and it tends to weigh heavy on the whole team.

After the last one, I guess she made a comment about how she couldn't wait for the day to be over so she could get home to me and out daughter. A few minutes later in walks the coffee. Now the order is obviously from me, but the name on the account, and by extension the sticker on the cup, is our daughters. Doordash offered us some special off several orders right after she was born, but we needed a new account.

According to her, and the vet tech she was talking to, seeing the name on the cup, and realizing who sent it, caused her to start crying and she had to go sit in her car for like 10 minutes. After that, even though it was still busy, I guess the day was far more bearable for her and the rest of the team, which may or may not be because I sent 50 munchkins to be shared lol.

We have recently had an uptick in incidents where very clearly drugged out men are coming in and screaming at customers, yelling slurs, scaring small children, and overall creating a very hostile environment.

Wha can management do to keep both customers and staff safe? I've been told to threaten to and call the police but sometimes they lash out and run away and the damage has already been done. The police are also going to take a while to get there.

She is incredibly sweet and caring, we share our similar love for animals, as she deeply loves her dog and likewise with my cat. I like fairness when dating and she has reciprocated paying on our third date which I really appreciate. She also initiates ideas for our dates which I like. Our 2nd date I chose to do mini golf and 3rd she chose to watch a play. After each date we have gone out to eat or drinks.

She is reserved and has explicitly told me she is very independent. In person, it is sometimes tough because I am initiating 90% of the conversations. Once we get on a conversation she connects with, she gets more chatty. On our third date, I tried asking deeper questions. She mentioned her longest relationship was about 7 years ago and lasted for 5 months. It ended because he was too clingy and would say stuff like ""I love you so much, do you love me?"" For context, I have had two 2 year relationships.

We have a fourth date set up for this Saturday. I booked a guided group painting session. After every date, I have asked her if she wanted to hang out again and she has said ""of course"" or ""I would love to"" so I think there is enthusiasm there. 

My issue is that during the week, she is a terrible texter. In the past, I'm used to texting during the week and sending memes or pictures of our animals, and general conversation. She responds well to set the date plans or if the plans needs adjustments during the week, but besides that, she either ignores my texts or responds with one word. For example, I sent a picture of my cat when I was leaving home because he was begging to go outside with me, and captioned ""going in-office is difficult for everyone"" then she just didn't respond. I have sent my cat photos previously and she would at least say ""he is adorable!"" It is giving me so much anxiety it is affecting my mood and I struggle to function during the day. 

We haven't done anything physical besides hugging goodbye after every date.  I'm thinking of asking to hold her hand on our 4th date to see what she does. I'm purposely moving slowly because of her reserved nature. But I'm really struggling with the silence during the week. ",2,1770152136.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

For some context, there's one guy who comes in to my work reasonably often. I was friendly to him first time I helped him (about 2 years ago?) and the next few times he came in, he kept asking me if I was still with my partner (I mentioned what my partner and I were doing for the holidays or something before) I said and always say something along the lines of: ""yes and I always will be"" and after a few times even told him my answer will never change so he shouldn't bother asking. I don't see him everyday but over 2 years maybe 1-3 times every month or so? And he didn't get to ask every time because after he didn't stop  I didn't chat to him as much and if I could, I would avoid him or pretend I was being called over somewhere to help one of my collegues. In my mind this was the most polite way to show him I didn't really care whilst being polite and professional. If he got the chance to say it, I would say the same thing I always do.

I told my partner about this when it first happened and then after I didnt bother because it was the same thing and honestly sometimes I just forgot about it and didnt really care.

A few days ago, the customer was at a cafe which is on my way to work. I walked past and didn't realise he was there but he walked up to me and said hi so to be polite I just said hi back and that I was on the way to work. He asked if I had time for a coffee and I said no and that I was heading to work and left after wishing him a good week (as I do to everyone). I didn't like the fact that he knew where I lived now and since I was texting my partner already, I told him about my weird interaction with this guy who has asked if I'm single quite a few times and how it made me feel a little uneasy. My partner didn't like this and it escalated into an argument.

He said how I was being secretive about how often the customer asked and how its micro cheating that I didn't tell him the frequency. He then said I was enjoying the ego boost for 2 years. 

Bit more context. A year or so ago, I was getting something out of my partner's wallet and he has a bunch of business cards in there. Amongst them I found a ""cutie card"". It was a pink card with ""cutie card "" on one side and on the other ""hey youre a cutie!"" With a handwritten number and an ""x"" at the end. I was so angry and asked why the hell he had it. He said a customer of his gave it to him and he just put it in his wallet. I told him it wasn't a business card and that it was disrespectful to keep it like he had any interest of going back to it. He told me I could bin it so I did. 

I brought this up because he never told me about that card and hung onto it. I found out myself and it was very hurtful to think he was keeping flirtatious cards from someone in work. 

He said how they're different situations because his was a single interaction with that woman and he just put the card in his wallet and hasn't seen her since then. (He had the card for a few months before I found it) But with my situation with this guy, there was continuous interaction with him over a period of 2 years. I said how I understand that they're different situations (I never claimed the situations were the exact same, just that if I shouldn't be secret neither should he) and will let him know if he comes in again but that at the same time he needs to understand that it was harsh to accuse me of micro cheating and a bit hypocritical too. And that he needs to be transparent with me too.

He said I'm creating a false equivalency and this card hasn't been part of our lives for 2 years like the customer has. I told him if I hadn't found the card he would still have it and how this customer isn't and I couldn't make that clearer to him

My partner has been cheated on. So I understand why he would be hurt. I will be telling him whenever this person or anyone else comes in and acts inappropriately. But I am wrong for also wanting to know if he ever gets any ""cutie cards""? And does what I'm describing sound like a genuine business card because I really don't see it. And there was obviously a reason I singled that card out of the many genuine business cards in his wallet. Why am I wrong if I'm not completely transparent with him but it's fine if he isn't??

BBC news reports that Starbucks is implementing new technology at locations across the United States, where customers at some drive-through locations are now being greeted by AI robots that take their orders instead of human staff members. Inside stores, baristas have access to a virtual personal assistant that helps them recall recipes and manage their work schedules. In the back rooms, scanning tools have replaced the manual inventory counting process, eliminating one of retail’s most time-consuming tasks and addressing stock shortage issues that have plagued the company.

These technological upgrades represent part of hundreds of millions of dollars in investments as Starbucks attempts to recover from several years of struggling sales performance.

I realized that while we have more photos than any generation before us, we rarely have a place where those memories actually *live*.

I wanted to give our love a home. Not a social media profile for the world to see, but a private, quiet corner of the internet just for us.

I spent the last few weeks building a custom website for her. It wasn't about the code; it was about the curation. I organized it like a timeline of our growth—from the first awkward coffee date to the late-night deep dives into our future. Each page is a soft reminder of the laughter we shared and the quiet moments that never needed a caption.

In creating this, I learned a profound lesson: Love isn't always found in the grand, expensive gestures. It’s found in the act of **choosing to remember.** It’s about taking the time to say, *""This moment mattered, and I won't let it fade.""*

The reaction from my partner was more moving than any physical gift I’ve ever bought her. It made me realize how much we all crave a space where our stories feel permanent.

Because I found this process so rewarding, I’ve decided I want to help other couples capture their ""forever"" too. If you feel your love story deserves its own dedicated space but you don't have the technical background to build it, I’d love to help. I can design, build, and deploy a custom site for you for a very modest fee to cover the effort.

When he comes here, he usually tells me a time he'll leave home. I use that time to plan what and when I'll be doing, so I can welcome him home properly, you know?

For example, if he tells me he's leaving at 4 PM, I know he'll be here around 5:30 PM, so around 4:30 PM I bake a cake, and at 5 PM I make coffee and a crepe.

The problem is that lately he's ALWAYS LATE, and everything I planned goes down the drain. Today he said he was leaving at 4 PM, it's 5:40 PM and I thought he was about to arrive. He just texted that he hasn't left yet. I get really angry about this, I know that for neurotypicals this doesn't change anything. ""Oh, he can eat the cake at 5:30 pm or 7 pm.""

1) I know a girl. We go to dinner, have a really nice evening, exchange WhatsApp messages, talk a bit, then she starts disappearing. I wait two days to give her some space and tell her I want to see her again (to which she replies that she also wants to see me). I ask her what her schedule is, she apologizes for disappearing but shows no interest in making plans. I wait five days and she doesn't text. I text her, a little pissed off and tired of not even seeing a single message from her. She apologizes and starts with a series of phrases like ""I'm so anxious,"" ""I'm not like that,"" and the like. I reply by telling her that I gave her some space, but what the fuck, a message has to arrive. As a human being, I have needs, even if they're small. It can't all be based on one person adapting to the other and the other person canceling out. She says she has to run to work, I wish her good luck, she reiterates that she didn't like the way I wrote to her, that's it, nothing since that day, but I'd say it's clearly a closed case now, what do you think?

2) I have a neighbor with whom I have a good relationship. She's divorced with two children. One evening, I text her to ask for coffee. I wanted to talk about the situation with her first girlfriend. One of the strangest evenings of my life awaits me. I find her tipsy, happy, and relaxed. A crazy sexual tension is triggered. She shows me a tattoo. I touch her entire back, running my hand over the tattoo. It was hot, and I was stone cold until the next morning. She freezes because of her neighborly relationships with my relatives. The next day, she invites me over on an excuse. She starts talking about it a lot, asking me what I thought. I'm 100% honest, but upset that talking about it had shattered the magic of coincidence. She tells me she's talked about it with her sister, that she's going out with a man, but she doesn't take it the way I do. Then she starts making conversation about her newfound freedom during this time, that her children have decided to return to their father, etc. etc. I'm extremely confused by her. 1) Was she drunk and horny after so long? 2) If question 1 is true, why bring it up again sober and tell me that she's dating someone but I'm taking it mentally? 3) Is she simply pumped up by this newfound freedom?

I'm wondering this because it's not clear to me whether it's something serious (and with the kids involved, the relationship and everything else, I'd hate to throw myself into something bigger than me and hurt her, for example I'd like to have kids of my own but she already has 2) or just a fuck between neighbors and that's it.

Some details: Spawn grain milo, gypsum, and oyster shells. Substrate is CVG with added coffee grounds. Spawn grain colonized in 3 weeks with fast rhizomorphic growth. 3 weeks from bulk to pins. Pins to full fruits took longer than my other strains, about 2 weeks for pins to grow to the size in the pictures. I opted to not casing layer this bin due to conflicting info on its benefits for PE and APE.

1qv3ls4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qv3ls4,Vintage Pen Profiles #16: WASP Addipoint (more info in post),"Yesterday we showcased a Sheaffer, and today we have a Sheaffer disguised in overalls and a flannel: the WASP Addipoint, introduced 1934. The Great Depression was a difficult time for the high end pen market, among other things. With little money to go around, people were wary of spending a lot for a new fountain pen. Thus, pen manufacturers adapted by introducing cheaper pen models. Afraid of sullying their image, Sheaffer opted to make economy line pens under a new sub-brand: WASP (aka W. A. Sheaffer Pens). They still imprinted WASP pens with “FT. MADISON IA. U.S.A.”, so any nosy pen buyer would’ve known this was a Sheaffer in disguise.

So, what makes this an affordable pen? First and foremost, the celluloid is thin. Compared to a Sheaffer Balance, the Addipoint’s celluloid feels like card stock, and I can flex the cap if I squeeze it. The gold plating on the clip was also quite thin, and mine has started wearing down. Lastly, the nib is a folded-point steel nib, meaning it has no hard tipping; the steel is simply rolled over at the tip to form the writing point. As expected, folded nibs wore down quickly, but were cheap to produce.

One cool feature of the Addipoint (and why it was called Addipoint) is that it was designed to have a replaceable nib!…well kinda. Esterbrook had released their re-new point nibs that screw in and out around the same time, and to this day the re-new point system is well loved. Instead of that very reasonable approach, Sheaffer said “to hell!” with screwing the nib in and out, why don’t you just unscrew the whole section (including the sac!) and just switch that out when you want. What? Seriously, I’ve attached a picture of what these “replaceable” points looked like at the end of the photos. I guess if you’re gonna replace the nib, might as well get a fresh sac at the same time? In any case, the system didn’t catch on and nowadays you can hardly find these replaceable nibs.

Now, despite the pen being affordable, it definitely holds its head high. These Addipoints typically feature celluloid patterns that were different than Sheaffer patterns, and this pen’s brown and gold celluloid looks like caramel being swirled into chocolate, or cream into coffee. It’s a very pretty pen. The thin celluloid makes it very light, for better or for worse. Unfortunately the original nib on mine was trashed, so I put in a spare steel #5 nib I had lying around, and it performs wonderfully. 

It’s easy to judge a pen like this for being a bit shoddy. It writes, it looks good, and it put nib to paper during tough times. Not to mention it’s now almost 90 years old! Pretty good for a cheapie if you ask me.",5,1770151334.0,fountainpens,0,0.86,False

I (23F) live with my roommate (24F) in a really small apartment (700 sq ft). Before we moved in, I told her one of my boundaries was not having a guy over all the time, because I’ve had past roommates do that and it made me feel like I had no space. She agreed.

Now she’s seeing a guy (they’re not official/not her boyfriend) and he’s here constantly. Like multiple nights a week & weekends. It makes me uncomfortable because our place is tiny and it feels like there’s always an extra person in my space who doesn’t pay rent.

It’s also started affecting shared stuff. She’ll make him coffee with the Nespresso pods I buy, cook him food with groceries we split, and do his laundry here (utilities we pay for).

I ran a Preinfusion of 4 seconds and a pause of 10 seconds without the portafilter on the Turin Legato V2.  I observed water running for the entire 14 seconds.  The water should have shut off at 4 seconds and no water should run for the next 10 seconds during the pause. Water runs at the same rate for the entirety of 4 seconds. I had a scale under the unit and a collection cup.

This is not preinfusion if water is running during the pause, the time that the preinfusion water is supposed to soak. I experimented with a variety of times for preinfusion and pause. Water was always running during pause the same as it ran during preinfusion. Something does not shut off.

I've run many many pulls curious why there is so much espresso at 16 seconds when I had the portafilter in--and there's my answer--there is no pause. It's not working if it's running water during pause function.

1qv3fea,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qv3fea/style_advice_studied_fashion_psychology_so_you/,[Style Advice] Studied fashion psychology so you don't have to: 3 date outfits that spark *real* attraction,"Too many people think attraction is just about ""being hot."" But the truth? A lot of the ""wow"" factor comes down to what your outfit *signals*. Walk into a date wearing the right thing, and you're not just stylish—you’re sending powerful subconscious cues about confidence, intention, and energy. TikTok and IG are flooded with basic girl-next-door looks or tacky pick-me vibes that scream ""try-hard."" Let’s fix that.

This guide is based on fashion psychology research, the style strategies of Louise Roe (TV host + fashion journalist), and dating expert Matthew Hussey’s Get the Guy framework. The goal is to help you show up authentically confident, spark emotional attraction, and stay unforgettable.

Here’s how to do it with just three looks—each backed by actual science and style theory.

- **The “Feminine Power” Look (Silky dress, minimal heels, and bold earrings)**  
  This combo works because it projects what psychologists call *enclothed cognition*: the idea that what you wear affects both how others perceive you and how you act. A Stanford study found that people associate silk and flowy dresses with openness and warmth. Louise Roe recommends a dress that hits the knee or mid-thigh, paired with subtle accessories that draw eyes to the face. Matthew Hussey says this kind of outfit shows high-value femininity without trying too hard.

- **The “Off-Duty Classic” Look (White tee, well-fitted jeans, blazer)**  
  This outfit wins because it balances approachability with structure. A paper in the *Journal of Fashion Marketing* found that classic casual outfits enhanced perceived authenticity and relatability. The blazer adds a sense of ambition and polish. Hussey argues this is a perfect look for coffee or daytime dates—your vibe is playful but grounded. Louise Roe would style it with loafers or clean sneakers to avoid looking stiff.

- **The “Soft Edge” Look (Leather jacket over a slip dress or midi skirt)**  
  Cognitive neuroscience research by Professor Carolyn Mair (formerly of London College of Fashion) shows that combining hard and soft textures signals emotional complexity and depth. This contrast sparks curiosity. Leather signals self-assurance, while the soft base keeps you from coming off as aggressive. Hussey calls this “unpredictable charm”—where you’re signaling a story more than just style. 

You don’t need to look like a model. You just need to *dress with intent*. Attraction is a psychological response to how someone *makes us feel*—and style is your first move.

Does this mean he likes me as a person/friend but the romantic part is off the table for now? Or is it something else? Would most ISTJs do this if they still had some interest but low bandwidth, or is it just polite friendliness?

I woke up this morning feeling like a product management superhero. Our team had been busting our butts for months on this shiny new feature, and today was the day we were pushing it live. I had my launch plan, my comms ready, and even had a celebratory coffee waiting.

Then, the universe decided to laugh in my face. Just as I was about to hit that 'deploy' button, a frantic message popped up from our QA lead. A *critical* bug had surfaced in a completely unrelated, but heavily used, existing feature. And I'm not talking about a little UI glitch; this was a data-integrity nightmare that could seriously mess with our users' profiles if left unchecked. My celebratory coffee suddenly tasted like pure dread.

My heart literally sank into my stomach. The launch, which felt so close I could almost taste it, was now hanging by a thread. The next few hours were a blur of emergency meetings, frantic Slack messages, and trying to balance the urgent fix with the impending launch. Developers were swarming like bees, QA was heroically re-testing, and I was in the middle, trying to keep stakeholders calm while simultaneously wanting to pull my hair out. Every decision felt like it had a thousand cascading consequences.

We finally got the fix out and validated, but it meant pushing our shiny new feature launch. The disappointment was real, folks. But honestly, seeing the team rally and fix a potentially user-impacting bug so quickly also filled me with a weird sense of pride. It's a rollercoaster, this PM life, and sometimes the biggest wins are just avoiding disaster.

So, fellow PMs (and anyone else who's had their day completely derailed), what's the craziest, most unexpected fire drill you've ever had to tackle at the last minute? How did you keep your sanity?",1,1770150812.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1qv3d08,https://i.redd.it/bnh7cl6eachg1.jpeg,Spotted this review NFC/QR card at acafe,"Hey folks,

I was grabbing coffee at this cute little seaside café in San Diego the other day and noticed something interesting at the counter a small card with a big QR code and an NFC icon on it. When I tapped my phone it immediately opened the cafe’s Google review page. no strange apps, no awkward asking, just tap-and-go. It was subtle, almost like it blended into the vibe of the place, but it felt way easier than having the barista ask for feedback after every drink lol.

**A bit about me:**  
I own a small artisan bakery + bistro here in San Diego. We do breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and brunch stuff, and we get tons of compliments in person but almost no reviews online. Customers love our food, then walk out the door and forget to leave feedback.

I’m thinking about something like that card for my own counter so people can leave impressions without feeling awkward or forced just a tap while they sip their latte. Seriously curious what others here use for physical feedback prompts and how you’ve integrated them with your workflow.

Any tips on how to implement something like this, what to watch out for, or even where to source them would be super helpful!",1,1770150776.0,SmallBusinessOwners,1,1.0,False

It didn’t begin with fireworks—  
just a quiet hello,  
two lives learning the shape  
of each other’s faces.

We learned the language of mornings,  
how coffee tastes better  
when shared,  
how silence can be kind  
when it’s earned.

There were ordinary battles—  
tired nights, sharp words,  
doors closed too hard—  
but even then,  
we kept choosing the same side.

We built a life out of small things:  
inside jokes,  
familiar footsteps,  
plans that stretched farther  
than the calendar could hold.

Then death changed our plans.  
The road narrowed.  
The future we packed together  
was suddenly too heavy for one.

Now the journey halted.  
One set of footprints stood still,  
the other lives in memory—  
in habits I can’t unlearn,  
in love that didn’t get an ending.

What we walked together  
still walks with me.  
Not as a destination,  
not as a promise of more—  
but as proof  
that this journey was real,  
and worth every step.

  There is a place that lives not in the noise, but in the quiet corners. Where the soul of Mumbai speaks softly.

This… is for the ones who see a story in the eyes of a street cat, not just the traffic ahead.
Whether your address is Fort, Bandra, Vashi, Belapur, Panvel, or Seawoods… if your life has a constant soundtrack of coffee machines, if cafés are your sanctuary, if you believe a purr is the purest form of love, and a moment of silence is the most precious luxury…

THE HYPER-LOCAL TRUTH

It’s in the familiar clatter of a local train at a non-rush hour.

It’s in wearing an outfit that speaks for you, without you having to say a word.

There I was. A chilly winter morn, a nice hot cup of coffee, first meeting doesn’t start until 10. Yes. Today’s the day I’m gonna undock Bert and move him home to Minmitar lowsec space where we will use him to get some fun content and eventually, in the process, most likely say goodbye to him. But Bert knows this. It is his nature. We’ve made peace with it.

Bert, you see, is my shiny new Phoenix Navy Issue. 5/5 to the tits. HAW? Please. Of course.

But he’s a little shy- enveloped in the warmth of a nice seedy space station near Jita- the only thing he’s ever known… it took some time to give Bert the courage to undock.

But none of us live forever, and Bert has become hungry.

I’ve got Phil (my cyno Rapier) all safe’d up in a system 7.9 LY away. Two people in local. Both docked.

My route is planned. It’s now or never. I should probably look outside the station to see what’s happening and what’s milling about, and I should probably hop on my main and get Bert some ECM support just in case. But for what purpose? There’s no need! Bert will be undocked and jumping through the void to a safe spot where he will immediately cloak until I light the second and final cyno in his journey.

The excitement… it’s palpable. My wife asks from the hallway how my Monday is looking, and I calmly reply that I’m about to find out. I undock Bert as the jitters set in, and quickly alt tab to Phil where I instruct him to light his cyno. By the time I alt tab back to Bert, there he is- in all his majesty- absolutely owning the vacuum of space. My heart is beating roughly 160 bpm at this point, and I right click on my capacitor and navigate- quickly- up to the jump menu.

I get there, and- the jump options are… empty. I laugh to myself- “That’s weird. Why would it be empty?” Clearly it’s lag. I try again, but still. Nothing. 

My brain starts going a trillion miles per hour. Did I not train Bert properly? Is my internet down? Am I too close to the station? Is Phil tackled?!

In a small panic I alt tab back to Phil to see what happened. Nope, Phil is there, on all fours, ready to receive Bert. The blue green iridescence of the cyno, inviting and supple, all agl-

Wait.

Why is blue green.

*Sweet tapdancing Christ.*

Quickly, I alt tab back to Bert to quickly dock back up while I unfuck things. Now mind you- at this point, although it has seemed an eternity, I’ve been undocked all of 7 seconds. 9 max.

As the alt tab completes, the screen flicks back and Bert comes into view, but I’m very confused by what I’m seeing. The station has been replaced by the animation of Bert jumping. Did Bert manage to somehow jump to Phil?

And then I realize. Somebody had just bought me a ticket and gave me a free all expenses paid trip on the Uncle Nyx boosh-express.

It is hard to describe the swirling maelstrom of emotion in my soul at this point. I am simultaneously exasperated and drooling for what I know is about to be a fight.

I am immediately pointed by uncle Nyx. Now- Bert is not fit for a solo roam. He has no grappler or web of any kind, no point. At this point I’ve gotten Phil to light the correct cyno, and made a note to not equip two kinds of cyno at the same time while trying to move billions of cold space metal. 

I’m struck with a thought- can a dread jump to a cyno while pointed? Let’s try it.

Nope. Shit. 

Ok- what are the chances of getting back to the station? As Bert tops out at around 81 m/s, I realize that’s futile. And that’s when my overview starts showing red. 

Game on.

I siege up. Let’s at least take some of these bastards down before I live up to the name of my vessel and burn up in glorious fire.

I’m inflicting a ton of pain. But the lack of point soon makes it clear that getting the kill shot will be difficult. I get three or four ships quickly into hull, but they warp off before I can make them go boom. Frustrating. But to be expected.

The pleasant thing however is the near complete and utter lack of damage I’m taking. It is absolutely exhilarating. I am barely repping my booster. And I know the ships landing on grid are about to get the most fun fight they’ve had all week, which pleases me. Because what are dreads for if not creating fun pvp content?

Worried that I would see some capitals warp in, I’m happy to note that as Uncle Nyx warps off, I’m seeing nothing larger than a battleship.

And then the four Leshaks warp in.

I immediately lock them and start trying to get one down. Mind you at this point I’ve got zero kills, and it’s about three minutes in and is what I can only describe as trying to kill a bunch of mosquitos. I’m taking barely any damage, but then the neut pressure begins and I know my time is limited. I also know once those Leshaks ramp up, things will start to hurt much more quickly.

In the back of my head I remember reading on Reddit about how four spider Vedmaks could out rep a single HAW PNI. But in the moment, I think to myself, nah- that PNI must have been shit fit.

I get the first Leshak quickly into armor. My painter has got him lit up like a Christmas tree- it’s clobbering time!

Or… is it? All the sudden, he reaches equilibrium. I stare in disbelief as volley after volley exit Bert hastily and find purchase, but nothings happening. Am I missing? Am I using the wrong type of ammo?

I try to switch to another ship and again get him into armor, but, same thing. Mind you there are also a few vedmaks on grid at this point as well.

And that’s when I realize my capacitor is starting to get dangerously low, and I realize in my fervor to take down the Leshak, I’ve completely disregarded my cap booster.

As the cap ticks down closer to zero, and then the painter fails, I know the end is in sight. My juicy shields begin to get eaten alive with no cap to power hardeners or boosters.  And eventually, I succumb- death by a thousand cuts, and a couple bigger Trigvalian gashes.

My first dread pilot fight. Despite how it started and how it went, these are the things I’ve only ever read about or watched on YouTube- or been on the other end of. That was awesome!

But as I begin to replay things in my head, I realize I didn’t have a single kill. Not one! And that leaves a slightly bitter- albeit well deserved- taste in my mouth.

So for you fellow capsules, I have three questions so as to better myself and avoid the same mistakes next time.

A) How in the name of fuck was I booshed within ten to fifteen seconds of being undocked, before even the tether could kick in? Is that bad luck? Or a combo of shitty timing and some sweaty Nyx pilot who knows or even has an alt that sells dreads in this station knowing they will eventually undock and then just waits for the boosh? Jfc.

B) are spider Vedmaks/Leshaks really that strong? I’m still in disbelief a little over the lack of kills, but mostly because of how they were able to outrep by 4-5k DPS. Amazing.

C) not that I’d ever take one of these things out solo nor that I know how susceptible they are, that could I add to a more solo capable fit? Granted I had a cloak in the fifth high slot instead of a smart bomb or neut, which doesn’t help- but a point would for sure have netted me some kills.

Thank you for reading friends. And if you were one of thr people inflicting pain, well met and thanks for the fight and the life lesson s.

(I was transporting some juicy items as well since I was using this as a transport boat while moving out to low sec.)

The air inside was thick and humid, a heady blend of lingering scents from the night before—the faint, herbal bitterness of the Ayahuasca brew that still clung to their skin and breaths like a ghostly echo, intertwined with the rich, musky aroma of sweat-soaked passion, the earthy tang of the mats beneath them, and the subtle, wild essence of the Amazon seeping in from every crevice. Outside, the vast wilderness was awakening in a symphony of natural orchestration: the deep, resonant calls of howler monkeys reverberating through the canopy like primal chants, the melodic trills of exotic birds layering the air with harmonious notes that rose and fell in waves, the gentle rustle of leaves brushing against one another in the light morning breeze, and the distant, soothing gurgle of the river carving its eternal path through the verdant landscape. Yet, within this intimate sanctuary, time felt eternally suspended, a sacred cocoon where Noah and Emma remained entwined, their naked bodies a living canvas of the profound, soul-deep connection they had forged under the brew’s hallucinogenic veil.

Noah awoke first, his 28-year-old frame shifting ever so slightly as consciousness returned, his broad, muscular chest rising and falling in perfect sync with Emma’s steady breaths. He felt the exquisite weight of her against him—her curvaceous form molded seamlessly to his, her full hips nestled snugly against his thigh, her ample breasts pressing softly into his side with each inhale. At 26, Emma was the embodiment of vibrant, sensual allure, her long auburn hair splayed across his arm like a fiery cascade caught in mid-flow, her skin still flushed and warm from the night’s transcendent passions, dotted with faint freckles that seemed to glow in the soft light. Noah’s strong arm was draped possessively over her waist, holding her close as if to anchor her in this shared reality, his semi-hard cock resting against the soft, yielding curve of her ass, a subtle, throbbing reminder of the ecstasy they had shared. He inhaled deeply, drawing in the intoxicating scent of her—sweet jasmine from the lotion she always carried in her pack, mingled with the primal, earthy essence of their lovemaking and the faint, lingering herbal trace of the Ayahuasca that danced on her skin like an invisible tattoo. A surge of overwhelming love flooded him, accompanied by vivid, almost tangible flashbacks: their bodies merging in swirling cosmic lights, every thrust and touch amplified into infinite waves of bliss, their souls intertwining like ancient vines in an eternal embrace, dissolving all boundaries between them.

Gently, reverently, he leaned in, pressing a series of tender kisses along the nape of her neck, his lips lingering on the sensitive skin just below her ear, where he could feel the subtle quickening of her pulse beneath his touch. “Good morning, Em,” he whispered, his voice low and gravelly, rich with the remnants of sleep and the depth of his emotions, his warm breath sending a delicate shiver down her spine. “My beautiful, incredible sister… waking up like this, still wrapped in your arms after last night—it’s like we’ve stepped into a dream we never want to end. I love you so much, more than I ever thought possible. Last night was… transcendent. The way we connected, body and soul—it felt like the universe was showing us we’re meant to be this way.”

Emma stirred with a soft, contented sigh, her body arching instinctively into his warmth as her green eyes fluttered open, meeting his gaze with a sleepy, radiant smile that illuminated her face like the first light of sunrise. She turned slowly in his arms, facing him fully now, her full breasts brushing against his chest in a way that sent a spark of renewed desire through them both, her nipples hardening slightly from the cool morning air mingling with the heat of his proximity. Her long auburn hair fell in wild, tousled waves around her shoulders, framing her flushed cheeks and the faint freckles that dotted her skin like stars in a twilight sky. “Good morning, Noah,” she murmured back, her voice husky and warm, laced with the same profound affection that mirrored his own, her fingers reaching up to trace the stubble along his jawline with gentle, loving strokes. She pulled him closer, their lips meeting in a slow, lingering kiss—lips parting gently at first, tongues dancing lazily in a tender exploration that tasted of lingering sleep, shared secrets, and the faint, herbal bitterness of the Ayahuasca that still danced on their breaths like a shared memory. When they finally broke apart, she nuzzled her nose against his, her hand sliding down to rest on his hip, fingers brushing teasingly close to his awakening arousal. “Last night was… beyond amazing, bro. Beyond anything I could have ever imagined or dreamed. The visions, the way our bodies and souls just… melted together, becoming one—it felt like we were always destined for this, like the stars aligned to show us our true path. I love you more than ever, Noah. You’re my everything—my protector from the bullies back home, my confidant through all the heartbreaks, and now… my lover in the deepest, most intimate way. Last night sealed it for me; we’re bound forever.”

Noah’s smile deepened, his eyes shining with emotion as his hand glided down her back to cup the curve of her ass, pulling her even tighter against him so that their bodies pressed flush, her soft breasts squishing against his firm chest, his cock stirring more insistently against her thigh in response to her touch and words. “It was incredible, Em. Feeling you around me, seeing those cosmic lights explode and knowing our love is eternal, unbreakable… I love you too, sis. More than words can express. You’re my little sister, the one I’ve always cherished and protected, and now the woman who completes me in every possible way—mind, body, and soul. Last night wasn’t just sex; it was a revelation. We’re forever, no doubt about it.” They kissed again, this time with a bit more heat building beneath the tenderness, hands roaming with lazy, affectionate exploration—his fingers teasing one of her nipples to a stiff peak, rolling it gently between his thumb and forefinger, eliciting a soft, breathy moan from her that vibrated against his lips; hers tracing the defined ridges of his abs, brushing teasingly against the base of his cock, feeling it twitch and harden under her touch. The kiss deepened, tongues entwining with a passion that threatened to reignite the flames of the night before, their bodies responding instinctively—her hips grinding lightly against him, his hand squeezing her ass cheek firmly. But they pulled back reluctantly, breaths coming a little quicker, foreheads resting together as they shared a knowing smile. “As much as I want to stay here and make love to you all day, losing ourselves again,” Noah said with a reluctant chuckle, sitting up slowly and admiring the way the light played across her naked form, highlighting the gentle swell of her breasts and the curve of her hips, “we should probably get dressed and say our goodbyes. The world’s waiting for us out there, and we’ve got so much more to explore—together.”

Emma nodded, her cheeks flushing with a mix of lingering arousal and happiness as she sat up beside him, her auburn hair tumbling wild and untamed over her shoulders like a fiery mane. “You’re right. Though it’s so tempting to just pull you back down and let the jungle hide us a little longer…” They dressed with deliberate slowness, turning the mundane act into a playful ritual—stealing heated glances, brushing fingers against bare skin as they helped each other. Emma slipped into her fitted hiking shorts first, the fabric hugging her full hips and thighs tightly, accentuating the curve of her ass as she bent slightly to retrieve her tank top from the mat, the motion making her breasts sway enticingly. Noah couldn’t resist reaching out for a quick, playful slap on her ass cheek, the sound echoing softly in the tent, earning a giggle from her as she straightened. She pulled on her tank top, the thin material clinging to her ample breasts, outlining her hardened nipples in the morning light, the hem riding up slightly to reveal a sliver of her toned stomach. Noah dressed next, pulling on his faded board shorts, which accentuated his muscular legs and the subtle bulge of his semi-arousal, the fabric stretching as he adjusted himself. He slipped into his simple t-shirt, the material taut across his broad shoulders and toned chest, highlighting the play of muscles beneath. “You look so sexy even in these trail clothes, Em,” Noah murmured appreciatively, pulling her into one last standing kiss before they zipped open the tent flap and stepped out into the world.

The tribal camp was fully alive with the rhythm of morning under the dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy. Women tended to low cooking fires, stirring large pots where plantains sizzled alongside fresh-caught fish, the savory, smoky aromas wafting through the air and making their stomachs rumble with hunger. Children darted about with infectious, joyous laughter, their bare feet pattering on the packed earth as they chased each other in impromptu games, weaving between the thatched huts with woven balls and sticks in hand. Men worked methodically, repairing sections of thatched roofs with fresh palm fronds or sharpening tools against stones with rhythmic, scraping sounds that blended harmoniously with the jungle’s background hum. The tribe leader approached them with a warm, knowing smile etched into his weathered face, his intricate tattoos—swirling patterns of vines and animals—gleaming in the light like stories etched in skin. He offered a small bundle wrapped in large banana leaves—dried herbs for protection and healing, fresh tropical fruits like juicy guavas and passionfruit for sustenance, and a woven pouch filled with clean, cool river water—as a parting gift, his gestures conveying a deep sense of blessing and farewell.

Though the language barrier remained an invisible wall, Noah and Emma expressed their gratitude through heartfelt, universal gestures: deep, respectful bows, hands clasped together in thanks, and sincere eye contact that spoke volumes. “Thank you from the depths of our hearts,” Noah said, his voice thick with genuine emotion, hoping the tone and his earnest expression transcended the words. “Your hospitality, the ceremony—it was life-changing, transformative. We’ll carry this experience with us always.” Emma nodded beside him, her eyes shining with unshed tears of appreciation and a touch of sadness at leaving. “We’re eternally grateful. You’ve given us a gift beyond measure—strength, connection, and a deeper understanding of love and ourselves.” The natives responded with nods, broad, welcoming smiles, and a few light drum beats on nearby hollow logs, the rhythmic farewell echoing through the camp like a heartbeat, a few villagers gathering to wave them off with cheers and well-wishes in their native tongue.

With their backpacks shouldered and the bundle securely tucked away, Noah and Emma set off on the narrow jungle trail leading toward the nearest town. The path was a meandering ribbon cutting through the dense foliage—thick vines hanging like emerald curtains from towering trees that reached for the sky, ferns brushing against their legs with soft, feathery touches that tickled their skin and released faint, fresh scents, the humid air thick with the heady perfume of blooming orchids, damp earth, and the occasional burst of ripening fruit from hidden groves overhead. Sunbeams pierced the canopy in golden shafts, illuminating motes of dust and tiny insects dancing in the light like living confetti. As they walked side by side, their steps syncing naturally in a comfortable rhythm, the conversation flowed easily, turning introspective amid the jungle’s enveloping symphony of bird calls, rustling leaves, chattering monkeys, and the distant river gurgles that provided a soothing backdrop.

“Noah, it’s going to be the two of us forever,” Emma said after a while, her voice steady but laced with thoughtful conviction as she slipped her hand into his, their fingers interlacing with a comforting familiarity that grounded them both. “No matter where this world tour takes us, no matter what adventures or challenges come our way—we’re in this together. Partners in every sense, bound by something deeper than anyone could understand.”

Noah squeezed her hand tightly, his thumb rubbing gentle, reassuring circles on her skin as he glanced at her, his blue eyes filled with unwavering resolve. “Absolutely, Em. Forever. You and me against the world, exploring it all—hand in hand, heart to heart. But… we have to be realistic about it. People won’t understand what we have. Society sees brother and sister being lovers as wrong, as taboo, even as something criminal in most places. It breaks my heart that we can’t shout our love from the rooftops, but we can’t let the world know our secret. When we’re around others, especially anyone who might speak English or pick up on clues, we have to pretend. We’ll act like boyfriend and girlfriend—madly in love, just a normal couple on an epic backpacking adventure, holding hands and kissing without a care.”

Emma nodded, her green eyes meeting his with a mix of determination, sadness, and a spark of defiant excitement. “I know, bro. It sucks that we have to hide something so beautiful, so pure in our hearts, but you’re right. No slips—no calling each other ‘brother’ or ‘sister’ in public, no accidental references to our childhood or family. We’ll be Noah and Emma, the passionate lovers conquering the world. But when it’s just us, like right now in this jungle? Nothing changes at all. You’re still my big brother, the one who’s always protected me from the storms of life, teased me mercilessly, and now… the one who makes me feel complete in ways no one else ever could. The one whose touch sets my soul on fire.” She leaned in closer, stealing a quick, heated kiss hidden by the overhanging foliage, her free hand resting on his chest to feel his heartbeat. “And honestly? The secrecy makes it even more exciting—the thrill of our hidden truth, the risk of almost getting caught… it turns me on even more, knowing we’re rebelling against the world.”

“Exactly,” Noah agreed with a grin, his arm slipping around her waist as they navigated a muddy patch on the trail, his hand resting possessively on her hip. “It’s our little rebellion, our secret fire. Makes every stolen moment, every whisper, that much hotter. We’ll be careful, but we’ll never let it dim what we have.”

They reached the small riverside town by midday, a charming, bustling settlement perched along the Amazon’s banks with colorful wooden houses elevated on stilts to guard against seasonal floods, dirt roads teeming with locals on motorcycles and bicycles weaving through pedestrians, and vibrant markets where vendors hawked fresh coconuts cracked open with machetes, juicy papayas glistening in the sun, handmade pottery glazed in earthy tones, and woven baskets overflowing with spices and herbs. The air was alive with the rapid chatter of Portuguese, the sizzle of street food grilling over open flames—fish skewered and charred to perfection, plantains frying in hot oil—and the distant chug of boat engines ferrying goods and people along the wide, muddy river. They boarded a crowded, rickety bus bound for the nearest city—Manaus—the vehicle packed with a diverse array of passengers: farmers carrying woven baskets overflowing with produce like vibrant red açaí berries and yellow bananas, families with children perched on laps chattering excitedly, and a handful of wide-eyed tourists like themselves clutching backpacks and cameras. Squeezed into narrow vinyl seats that cracked and creaked with age under their weight, their thighs pressed firmly together from the tight confines, they held hands discreetly under Noah’s backpack placed strategically on their laps, fingers tracing intimate patterns on each other’s palms as the bus jolted and bounced along the rutted, pothole-riddled roads. The scenery blurred by in a mesmerizing tapestry—endless stretches of lush green jungle giving way to glimpses of the mighty Amazon River sparkling under the midday sun like a vein of liquid silver snaking through the landscape, dotted with fishing boats bobbing on the current and floating markets where vendors bartered from canoes.

At the Manaus airport, a sleek, modern hub contrasting sharply with the tropical sprawl outside—complete with air-conditioned terminals, bustling crowds of travelers wheeling suitcases, and the constant hum of announcements in multiple languages—they navigated the check-in counters and security lines with ease, the cool blast of AC a welcome relief from the sticky humidity clinging to their skin. Standing before the glowing departure boards, screens flickering with an array of global destinations—flights to Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond—they pondered their next move with excited deliberation. “So, where to now?” Noah asked, his arm slung casually around her waist as they scanned the options, his fingers tracing idle circles on her hip through her tank top. “We’ve got the entire world at our fingertips. Something exotic and far-flung? Or maybe somewhere relaxing with beaches?”

Emma’s green eyes lit up with mischief as she leaned into him, her head resting comfortably on his shoulder, her auburn hair brushing his arm. “Let’s go somewhere with a free-spirited vibe, somewhere we can really let loose and embrace the adventure. Amsterdam? The canals reflecting those cute gabled houses, the bikes everywhere, the art museums full of vibrant colors… and that infamous red light district.” She glanced up at him, her voice dropping to a teasing, husky whisper that sent a shiver of anticipation down his spine, her hand sliding discreetly to squeeze his thigh. “We could find a prostitute to fuck together, Noah. Imagine it—you and me sharing her, taking turns making her moan, watching each other in the heat of the moment, whispering our secrets while she writhes between us. It’d be so hot, so adventurous. What do you say? Ready to add that to our list of firsts?”

Noah’s blue eyes darkened with immediate lust, a wicked grin spreading across his face as he pulled her closer, his hand slipping lower to the small of her back, fingers pressing firmly into her skin. “Damn, Em—you know exactly how to tempt me. The thought of us teaming up on some beautiful stranger, you watching me fuck her while I watch you make her cum… yeah, it’s hot as hell. Amsterdam it is. Let’s book the tickets right now.”

They secured their flights—a short hop on a small propeller plane to São Paulo first, then the long-haul overnight to Amsterdam. The first flight was on a cramped regional aircraft, the cabin packed so tightly with passengers that their bodies were in constant, unavoidable contact—thighs pressed firmly together, shoulders brushing with every slight shift, the heat of their skin mingling through the thin layers of clothing. The plane bounced and jolted through pockets of turbulence, each dip and rise amplifying the friction between them, turning the ride into an unintentional tease. Under the thin veil of a shared blanket draped across their laps, Noah’s hand slipped discreetly between Emma’s thighs, his fingers rubbing slow, teasing circles over the seam of her hiking shorts, tracing the outline of her heat through the fabric, feeling her grow warmer and wetter with each pass. “Feel that bounce, Em?” he whispered hotly in her ear, his breath warm against her neck, sending goosebumps racing across her skin. “It’s like the plane’s helping me touch you… getting you all worked up right here in public.” Emma bit her lip to stifle a soft moan, her own hand sliding under the blanket to palm his growing bulge, stroking him firmly through his board shorts, feeling him harden and twitch under her touch. “Mmm, yes—rub my pussy while we fly, Noah. God, you’re so hard already… I love feeling you like this, knowing no one suspects.” They teased each other throughout the short flight, building a simmering tension without daring to release it, their breaths quickening with every jolt, the discreet risk of being caught adding an electric edge to the anticipation.

The long-haul flight to Amsterdam was an overnight journey on a larger jet, the cabin dimmed for sleep with soft blue lighting, passengers reclining under blankets as the plane soared smoothly over the vast Atlantic, the hum of engines a constant, lulling backdrop. Hours into the flight, as the tension from the day’s travel and their teasing built to an unbearable peak, Emma leaned over, her lips brushing Noah’s ear in the darkness. “Bathroom—now. I need you inside me, Noah. Can’t wait any longer.” They waited for a quiet moment when the flight attendants were occupied and most passengers dozed, then slipped away one at a time to the tiny lavatory at the back of the plane. Locking the door behind them, the confined space—barely room to turn around, with a small sink, mirror, and toilet—heightened the urgency and intimacy. Clothes were yanked aside in a frenzy—Noah dropping his shorts to his ankles, Emma hiking up her tank top to expose her breasts and pulling her shorts and panties to one side. He lifted her leg to hook over his hip, pressing her back against the sink as he thrust into her slick, waiting heat with deep, urgent strokes, the plane’s subtle vibrations adding an extra layer of sensation to each movement. “Fuck, Em—so tight and wet for me,” he groaned quietly, his hand clamping over her mouth to muffle her gasps, his other gripping her ass for leverage. “Quickie with my sister on a plane… so risky, so fucking hot.” She wrapped her legs around him tighter, her nails digging into his shoulders through his shirt. “Harder, Noah—fuck me fast, make me cum before someone knocks. Fill your sis right here.” They moved frantically but controlled, bodies slapping softly against each other, the mirror fogging from their heated breaths. They climaxed together in hushed, shuddering ecstasy—her pussy clenching around him in rhythmic waves, milking his cock as he filled her with hot, pulsing spurts of cum. They cleaned up hurriedly with tissues, adjusting clothes and sharing a breathless kiss before slipping back to their seats with flushed faces, hearts racing, and shared, secretive smiles of satisfaction.

Later that night, as the cabin remained shrouded in darkness and quiet, with only the occasional snore or rustle from sleeping passengers, Noah awoke to an exquisite, unexpected sensation—warm, wet heat enveloping his cock under the blanket. Emma had shifted down discreetly in her seat, her head bobbing slowly and rhythmically beneath the cover, sucking him with expert, silent precision, her tongue swirling around the sensitive head while her hand stroked the base with firm, twisting pulls. The risk made it all the more thrilling; the plane was full of oblivious strangers, flight attendants patrolling occasionally. Noah’s hand tangled gently in her auburn hair under the blanket, guiding her lightly as he whispered hoarsely, “Em… oh fuck, your mouth feels amazing. Suck your brother’s cock quietly—take it all.” She looked up at him with mischievous green eyes gleaming in the dim cabin light, taking him deeper into her throat without a sound, her cheeks hollowing as she worked him with fervent devotion, her free hand cupping his balls and tugging gently to heighten the pleasure. The buildup was intense, the secrecy amplifying every sensation; he came quietly, his hips bucking faintly under the blanket as thick ropes of cum spurted into her mouth, filling it with his warm release. She swallowed every drop greedily, her throat working around him to take it all, then licked him clean with slow, teasing laps of her tongue before emerging carefully, wiping her lips with the back of her hand and flashing a sly, satisfied wink. “Couldn’t resist tasting you again, Noah. You were so hard in your sleep… sleep well now?”

They landed in Amsterdam to a crisp, invigorating European air that was a stark, refreshing contrast to the Amazon’s humid embrace, the city unfolding like a living postcard: narrow canals reflecting the historic gabled houses under overcast skies that threatened light rain, bicycles whizzing by with cheerful bell rings along cobblestone paths, the scent of fresh stroopwafels—warm, caramel-filled waffles—and strong, aromatic coffee wafting from quaint cafés lining the streets. They wandered the sights hand in hand, blending in as a loving couple—the poignant, somber history of the Anne Frank House, where they held each other tightly amid the exhibits, reflecting on hidden lives and secrets; the vibrant, swirling colors of the Van Gogh Museum, where Emma leaned into Noah’s side, whispering how the artist’s passionate strokes reminded her of their own intense connection. The city’s free-spirited energy mirrored their own sense of liberation, and they felt alive, unburdened by the world’s judgments in this place of tolerance.

At a cozy coffee house in the picturesque Jordaan district, with its exposed brick walls, wooden tables scattered with board games, and a laid-back crowd of locals and tourists, they bought pre-rolled joints of potent Dutch cannabis from the menu, the herbal aroma filling the air as they puffed in the designated smoking area at the back. The smoke curled lazily from their lips, the high settling in like a warm, fuzzy blanket—relaxing tense muscles from the long flight, heightening their senses with a giggly euphoria, colors seeming brighter, touches more electric, and their laughter echoing freely. “This stuff is strong,” Emma laughed, her eyes glassy and sparkling as she passed the joint to Noah, exhaling a plume of smoke that danced in the air. “Makes me even hornier for our little plan tonight.

# What You Need to Know About Methylene Blue Supplements

>TikTok loves them. Doctors say they’re dangerous.

>By [Korin Miller](https://www.menshealth.com/author/219867/korin-miller/)Published: Oct 21, 2025 9:39 AM EDT  
**What Is Methylene Blue?**

>**IT’S A BLUE-TINTED** synthetic dye. “It is FDA-approved for methemoglobinemia—a rare blood disorder—and is given in the hospital,” says [Christina Inteso,](https://www.fdu.edu/profiles/christina_inteso93/) PharmD, a clinical pharmacist at Corewell Health.  
While it was originally created as a textile dye, methylene blue has been used in medicine for more than 100 years as a treatment for conditions ranging from gonorrhea to [malaria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27576224/), according to [Kelly Johnson-Arbor](https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md), MD, a toxicologist at MedStar Health. You’ll also find methylene blue used in [aquarium cleaning products](https://www.chewy.com/kordon-methylene-blue-general-disease/dp/169674?utm_id=303013933&msclkid=e0cb616817771ab6513c099f9e4e8d84).

>But people aren’t tapping into methylene blue supplements to dye their clothes or clean their fish tanks. “Recently, people have become more interested in using it for a variety of off-label uses such as slowing the aging process, improving memory, improving mood and focus, and preventing cancer,” Inteso says.

>The raw form can potentially contain contaminants, says [Jamie Alan](https://phmtox.msu.edu/people/alanjami), PhD, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University. “The supplements, in theory, should be made according to good manufacturing practices and should not contain contaminants. However, because supplements are not regulated, there is no guarantee that they will be free from contaminants,” she says.

# What Is Methylene Blue Used For?

>**AGAIN, METHYLENE BLUE** is only FDA approved to treat methemoglobinemia. But it’s also used in the hospital for a range of things.

>“In hospital settings, methylene blue is also used to identify tissues during surgical procedures, improve cardiac function in patients with severe shock, and treat side effects of the chemotherapy drug ifosfamide,” say Dr. Johnson-Arbor.

>Methylene blue has been [investigated](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/12/3379) to see if it could enhance cognition, reverse the aging process, and even treat neurodegenerative diseases like [Alzheimer’s disease](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a60309635/what-you-need-to-know-about-early-alzheimers-disease/), but research hasn’t turned up much so far.

# What’s True (And Not) About Methylene Blue Supplements

>**THERE ARE SOME** really big health claims surrounding methylene blue, but doctors say they’re overblown. “There are claims that it can boost cognitive function and slow aging,” Alan says. “There is not enough data at this point to support that claim.” She says that methylene blue is “unlikely to provide benefit to the vast majority of people, based on the current data available.”

>Inteso agrees. “There is insufficient reliable evidence to support any of the off-label uses,” she says.  
There is a reason that some people think methylene blue can help with a host of ailments, though. Because of its chemical makeup, methylene blue may help with the transfer of electrons to enhance the production of ATP (energy) in cells, Dr. Johnson-Arbor says.

>“Methylene blue also has antioxidant activity, which means that it may also help protect cells against oxidative damage,” she says. (Oxidative damage is [linked](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/oxidative-stress) with the aging process and cancer, among other things.) Since dysfunction in the mitochondria (the powerhouse of cells) is linked with the aging process in humans, “some scientists believe that optimizing mitochondrial function through methylene blue supplementation may help prevent aging-related conditions or even slow the aging process,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says.

>But again, this is all *theoretical*. “Although methylene blue sounds promising as an anti-aging intervention, there are few scientific studies affirming its effectiveness as a longevity booster in humans, and the exact dose, duration of treatment, and optimal route of administration for methylene blue as an anti-aging intervention have not been defined.” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says.

# Who Should Take Methylene Blue?

>**UNLESS YOU HAVE** methemoglobinemia or are undergoing a hospital procedure where using methylene blue is indicated, doctors say it’s best to steer clear.

>“People should avoid using methylene blue supplements until further research has been conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of these products,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says.

# What Are the Side Effects of Methylene Blue?

>There are some significant side effects that can come with using methylene blue, according to Dr. Johnson-Arbor. She lists these off as more minor potential side effects:

>**Skin discoloration**

>**Dizziness**

>**Nausea**

>**Urine discoloration**

>But methylene blue also may cause serious complications. *“Methylene blue can actually cause methemoglobinemia, the rare blood disorder that it is used to treat,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says. “Because methylene blue affects levels of serotonin in the brain, people who use methylene blue are at risk of developing a potentially life-threatening condition called ‘serotonin syndrome.’”*

>Methylene blue can also have drug interactions, including interactions with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac, and Zoloft, Alan says. *“You should not take methylene blue if you are on these medications,” she adds.*

# Is Methylene Blue Safe?

>**NO, PROBABLY NOT.** “Since we don’t have well-designed clinical trials to support its use as a supplement, I wouldn’t suggest using it,” Inteso says.

>Dr. Johnson-Arbor agrees. “At this time, there are no FDA-approved methylene blue supplements that are proven to promote longevity or prevent aging-related diseases in humans,” she says. “Due to concern for adverse events, drug interactions, *and even death*, methylene blue should only be administered under careful medical supervision in a hospital setting.”

1qv3695,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qv3695/my_house_is_haunted_by_a_bitch_ass_ghost_that/,My House Is Haunted By a Bitch Ass Ghost That Loves Dragon Ball Z (February Contest Submission),"This story has been remastered slightly to fit the feb contest submission theme

My name is Masie Cobb. My hair is brown and my eyes are gray. I have one hundred and forty three freckles on my nose and my cheeks and eight of them are on the tops of my lips. I am also the most unlikable, miserable sack of shit you will ever meet in your life, and yes, my house really is haunted by a bitch ass ghost that loves Dragon Ball Z. 

It wasn't always this way. Until a few years ago I was actually rather popular. I would go to the movies with my friends and we would laugh and talk in hushed tones about who was pretty and who was mean and who put on too much makeup too incorrectly. I was even favored by boys my age every now and then. They would try to make me laugh and pretend to like the music of every band that I ever wore on my shirt.

I was happy then. I showered. I was kind. 

And now there is dirt under my chipped fingernails. My lips are chapped and I let them crack and bleed, and when someone looks at or talks to me it is only because they absolutely have to do it. I haven't said a nice thing to anyone in two years, just as no one has said a nice thing to me. I am well and truly hated, and I am unrelentingly alone.

I'll tell you what happened. I *am* ashamed of it, but shame is my constant nosy companion, squeezing its way rudely into every human interaction I have, so I hardly care if I spill some of it all over my keyboard for the whole internet to see.

Ready?

Two years ago I took a brainmelting amount of LSD and ended up well and truly naked in a chucky cheese ball pit, doing unspeakable things to myself for everyone to see. 

You can laugh. It's a joke alright. But it's not a joke that I am playing on you, dear reader. It's a joke that the universe played on me, and it isnt all that fucking funny, is it?

Now everyone thinks I'm a… you know. 

I don't even want to say it, the thought of it is sickening to me. And I'm not. I feel like I have to say that I'm not because everyone in my fuckass shitty town knows me and thinks that I am and I can't leave.

 I am so alone. I am hated, so I spend my days hating back. I am a bitch to everyone I meet just for the small fraction of security that I get from being the first of two inevitable aggressors in any given conversation. I don't hold doors for old women. I don't say thank you, I don't tip, and If you have eaten at the Mcdonalds my town, you have eaten my spit.

That's why I was more annoyed than anything when I found out my house was actually haunted. Because if ghosts are real, then heaven and hell are real too, right? You could probably guess that I'm not one of those heaven girls. Maybe I could have wormed my way in there before my little incident, but now I'm sure there's a special place for me in the inferno. 

Listen, I know what you're thinking, what you wish you could tell me; “Masie! The christian God is very forgiving so why don't you just change your ways and be a sweet, nice girl so that you can go to heaven when you die?” You're probably thinking something like that, right?

No.

No way.

You couldn't understand the betrayal I feel. *Everyone* knows me and *everyone* treats me like trash. I won't be nice to them just to get into some fruity ass, self righteous, gated community in the clouds full of people who treat me like garbage. I'm going to treat everyone just how they treat me, and if that lifestyle drags me down to hell, then I'll go, kicking and screaming and spitting in big macs all the while. 

And yes the bitch ass ghost is one of those christian ghosts. I know because crosses drive him fucking nuts. Took me forever to figure that out though.

You see, after that unspeakable incident at chucky cheese, my decrepit father was so repulsed by me that he refused to live with me all together. He had some money stashed away from a life insurance policy on my mom and used it to buy me a ramshackle house on the other side of town. No doubt he would have sent me farther away if he could find a different place for so cheap, but the house was (and is) falling apart. How it has heat and electricity in its state is a marvel. There are entire human sized holes connecting the top floor to the bottom and absurd splatters of blood still on the floral wall paper. Which brings me to the other reason why this house was so cheap.  It was on one of those, “an entire family got brutally axe murdered here” discounts. 

They were called the Stevens. A picture of the four of them still hangs up in the living room simply because I feel like it looks kind of cool, and Im too lazy and miserable to be fucked putting up other decorations. Anyways, the story goes that one night, Mr Stevens gambled away all of his family's money and was so ashamed of it all that he decided to kill them with an axe when he went home and then shoot himself in the head for good measure. Complete pussy if you ask me. He should have just lived with it. You don't see me axe murdering my entire family just because I messed up. That type of thing is just immature to be honest with you.

 Judging from the picture on the wall, they were a nice family. It's one of those blindingly caucasian photos taken on some beach in the vineyard. Four blondies with massive, obnoxious smiles, lips peeling back from their white teeth to show off their giant gums. A little boy and a little girl and a dog and of course their dog was a golden retriever and of course they got him to look at the camera somehow. A family so perfect that it's almost obvious that they would axe murder each other. The universe craves balance, I think.

One of them is still in my fucking house.

It took me a while to notice it. When I first moved in things would raddle, doors would slam, and the microwave would turn on for no reason, but I assumed that was just the house settling or whatever. The weird thing was that stuff like this would only ever happen when I was upstairs. Say I was upstairs in my bed. I would undeniably hear the microwave turn on, or the tv, and sprint down stairs to check it out, only for it to be off like normal when I got down there. Can you imagine how frustrating this was? Imagine *you're* upstairs in *your* bed and you swear up and down that you hear *your* tv turn on, so you run downstairs to check it and it's not. You would think you're going insane. I thought I was going insane. I thought so for a while. It seemed like the only logical next step in my life. I became a public outcast and everyone hated me, and then I began to spend all my time alone in an axe murderer's house that was falling apart. At some point I thought that becoming well and truly insane seemed like it fit logically in the downward spiral of my loser ass existence, so It wasn't long before I made peace with going nuts. Like I said, it seemed natural.

 But after my bearded dragon committed suicide I knew something was up.

I loved that thing. I remember I got him at Petco when he was just a little baby. I named him Hammy and I'm not ashamed to admit that I thought about him constantly throughout the day. I fed him lettuce and grasshoppers and the last tiny little drop of love that still floated around in my black heart, I gave to him. He was the only thing in the entire world that loved my company, that craved my touch. I would take him out of his tank and lay him on my chest and pet him and share popcorn with him while I watched romcoms and I swear he liked it.

A few times a week I would wake up in the middle of the night, scared with no real rationality, that something might have happened to him. I would stumble down stairs to check on him and adjust his heat lamp or give him a snack. More than once when I did this I would find him levitating in his tank, only for him to resume his relationship with gravity the moment I saw him. As you can imagine, I thought this was just a normal part of going insane. He seemed completely fine whenever this happened, and I liked to believe Hammy was too mature to believe in childish things like ghosts so I didn't ask him about it.

And then one day I got home from work and he was dead on the floor, with a little blood trail leading from his tank to the TV remote, where he lay dead in a poignant pool of himself. I cried all night. Loud and ugly I cried. I screamed, I bit the skin on my hand to release the pressure of it all until I tasted my own blood then I went to my kitchen and threw plates on the floor until I got too tired to stand. 

In my bed, with the lights off, I held Hammy’s limp body close to my chest and pet his head, and in the corner of my room, where the darkest shadows converged and blended together, the silhouette of a boy looked down at me.

 I looked back.

I was scared. Even If I was going insane, it's scary to see the silhouette of a shadowman in a busted ass murder house.

“Hello?” I asked softly. 

At that my bedroom door flew open and the boyish shadow slipped out into the hallway and slammed the door hard behind him.

The door had slammed. 

I saw it.

This wasn't the vague sound of the TV playing from downstairs or the absurd image of hammy floating on the teetering edge for my sub par vision. That door really slammed itself shut, My heart was still beating hard, offended by the sound of it.

Maybe my house really was haunted.

And if my house was haunted, whoever haunted it was fucking pussy. Only doing haunted shit when it thought I wasn't looking, Picking up *my* bearded dragon and putting him down right when I got there, making me think I'm insane.

What a bitch ass ghost. What was he scared of? Hes the fucking ghost. I'm just a girl, and he’s got the nerve to secretly haunt all my shit when I'm not looking, not even scaring me like he's supposed to, and then he decides to go and murder my bearded dragon?

Oh dear reader, whoever you are. I cannot explain to you everything that I felt that night, only that I sat in my bed and stewed in it all until the sun came up, and when it did, I kicked on my shoes and walked right out of the door with no coffee or anything, I didn't even put down Hammy as I went. Instead, I placed him gingerly in my hoodie pocket. I wasn't going to leave the body of my only worldly companion alone with that bitch ass ghost.

Some time later I pulled into Micheals craft store and got my hands on glue, double sided tape, and a bunch of popsicle sticks. The jowly lady at the cash register recognised me as I put my things down. I waited to see if she had the nuts to say anything, she did.

“Pervert.” she muttered softly as she looked down to finish scanning the things that I bought. I could tell she had been psyching herself up to say it.

“Thats nice, why dont you go fuck yourself?”

“Uh!” she gasped, gelatinous jowls flopping about as she jerked her head back in surprise.

“That will be twenty five ninety nine, would you like to round up one cent to charity?”

“No.”

\*\*\*

Some time later, I pulled back into my house, parked haphazardly in the driveway and stalked through the rain into my house, that was mine, and absolutely not a ghost’s if I had anything to say about it. I went up to my room, sat on my bed, threw my thin blanket over myself so that no ghosts could see what I was doing, and got to work. A few hours later I had fifty or so crosses made from popsicle sticks. I laid Hammy’s little body gently down on my bed as I stood up and began sticking those little crosses on all of the walls in my room, slowly making my way through all of the rooms upstairs and then down. 

At first, the ghost acted like nothing was happening. But as I got downstairs, things started to go haywire. Lights flickered on and off, chairs fell down, and the curtains shook harder with every new cross I stuck to the walls. The more I put up, the more everything began to bug the fuck out. If I put enough crosses up in a room, the poltergeist would move into the next room, like I had forced it out. When I made it into the kitchen, the gas stove turned on, and broken shards of porcelain dishes flew at me from the ground where I had shattered them the night before. Not hard enough to kill me mind you, but a few cut my arms and my forehead.

It really was a bitch ass ghost.

It wasn't long before I began shouting.

“How about that? You bitch ass ghost. Im got gonna stop putting these up until you get the fuck out of my house and leave me alone.”

Soon enough, I had a cross in every room but the bathroom, and three crosses left in my hand. The bathroom door had slammed closed and the light was flickering on and off from the crack in the door. I met some resistance at the door like someone was holding it shut. So I put my crosses and tape in my pockets, wrapped both hands around the door knob, put one foot up on the wall, and with my whole body I ripped the door open easily. When I looked in the bathroom mirror, I saw why it was so easy. Standing behind my reflection, crying, was a little boy.

The boy in the family portrait. He looked the same as he did on that beach, except for a massive gaping wound in his left temple. I could see a sliver his pulsating brain. like a ball of masticated fruit gushers.

“Please stop.”

“You killed my bearded dragon.”

He was sobbing, but he kept looking at me. I guess he was sort of brave for that. He didn't look older than nine or ten.

“I know. I thought… I'm so sorry I thought that I could… I'm really so sorry, I didn't mean for him to die.”

“You thought what?”

As I said it, I waved my handful of popsicle stick crosses behind me, and in the mirror I saw him cower and shrink as they passed by him.”

“I thought that If I possessed him and made him use the tv remote, you would just think that maybe he wanted to watch tv sometimes.” he said through disgusting wet sobs.

“That doesn't make sense.”

“I know, I'm sorry, okay? I loved Hammy, just like you.”

“You killed him though.”

This made him cry even harder. His face was soaking wet with it.

“I know, I'm sorry. I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself.”

“Why didn't you just turn on the tv yourself?” I asked the little ghost in the mirror.

“B-because I thought tha-that you-you-you would exorcize me if you knew I was-s here.” 

Snot was leaking from his nose now. For a while I listened to the sounds of him cry mix with the rainstorm outside.

The silence became too much for him before it became too much for me and so he continued to let his ghostly heart bubble and froth over me through his wet little sobs.

“The truth is, I don't wanna d-die until I f-finish watching Dragonball.”

I was shocked. “Dragonball?” 

“Y-yeah. I love Vegeta so much. He's so powerful and I love it so much when he shoots his big power blast.” He was crying even harder now. “I love Vegeta so damn much. I wish I was more like him and not so scared of everything. I hate myself.”

“I-I have crunchyroll.”

He looked up at me and mopped up his tears with a bloody sweater sleeve.

“What's crunchyroll?”

\*\*\*

Some time later, when I had taken down all the crosses from my house and thrown them outside, and Hammy was buried lovingly in the dirt outside my window with a little popsicle stick headstone, I put on my pajamas and sat on the couch. I could still hear the rain battering my flimsy wooden house as I crawled under a blanket and put on episode 86 of Dragon Ball Z. Colors and flashes barfed out of my screen as I watched stupidly. After a few episodes I felt a pressure on my shoulder, which tumbled slowly into my lap. I heard soft snoring coming from that empty void between my thighs and my chin.

Nobody had touched me on purpose for two years. I had forgotten how warm people are. How your body tingles when someone breathes on you.

 My bottom lip quivered as tears rolled down my chin and landed in mid air, on that nothing that snored in my lap.",2,1770150362.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,3,0.75,False

**Recap**: ANOTHER HORRIFIC BAD BEAT!!! This one still haunts me from last week! And ultimately made me want to quit for the past few days on running POTD! I did warn you that I was 0-5 when I change my POTD last minute! This wasn't last minute POTD change tho, I had ample amount of time to look for another POTD, but it's been such bad luck for me when I am force to change my POTD on the same day.

Joel Embiid had 7 Rebounds in the 1st quarter and just 1 rebound in the 2nd half! Got hooked so bad. And to add insult to injury I cashed out a lay that would have cover all my losses on this day! So yea.. taking the break from running POTD was the right move despite that I was 2-1 on the past 3 POTDs.

**Matchup:** Gotta keep going for lucrative value wagers since now I am below 20 units now. Won't be featuring my best bets for a while, so if this is not your cup of tea, come back in a couple weeks (hopefully my units won't be down bad). Today I like Luka Doncic to record a Trip-Dub against the Nets. **Ask yourself which offensive stat do you think Luka would have the most problem of accumulating double digit (not counting steals, blocks and turnovers)? Definitely not points or assists, it's rebounds, but Luka is in a very favorable matchup against the Nets because the Nets are the fewest rebounding team. Not only that, but Luka is the highest rebounding PG in the league (8.0 rpg).**

**Luka also had a trip-dub last time he faced this Nets team (22 Pts, 12 Asts, 12 Rebs on 3/10/25) and Luka recently recorded a trip-dub which was a few days ago against the Wizards (37 Pts, 13 Asts, 11 Rebs, recorded trip dub at halftime).** He easily could have gotten 2 more Asts on his last game against the Knicks if it wasn't a blowout. This could potentially also be a blowout, but I just think that Luka stacks the boxscore and make this a blowout himself by recording a trip dub like the Wizards blowout game.

**The Play & Prediction :** I definitely would be giving you PK odds POTD, but my units are down bad, so I'm going to swing for the fences wit these lucrative plus money. If you don't like it, then don't bet on it. You can always just wager Luka 8+ Rebounds at PK price (-115), but for 0.5U on Luka to record a Trip-Dub. Luka scores 11 Pts, 10 Rebs and 14 Asts.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude. If you like to express your appreciation for these POTD writeup/analysis, wagers, and recommendations, here are several ways how you can.

I co-manage a cafe that was the original tenant at a previously unused site outside of town. Since we opened, the owner (who owns the land) has rented space to a burger truck and a pizza place on the same lot. Here is the issue:

Even though we established the site, the seating area, and the restrooms, the burger place is being treated as the ""main"" location by Google. People sit in our terrace, drink our coffee, and use our restrooms, but then leave a 5-star review for the burger truck, reffering to the whole site as ""the burger place"" mentioning how great the ""seating and coffee"" are.

That said, the burger truck is buying the reviews for Google Maps & followers on social media, and offering discounts for 5-star ratings, therefore the algorithm seems to favor them.

They've become the dominant pin on the maps, and Google marks everyone sitting on OUR terrace as their customers. Their profile shows ""Busier than usual"" while ours looks dead, even when our cafe is packed and they have no line.

The owner of my cafe also owns the land and collects huge rent from the burger place, and the pizza place. He doesn’t care about the Google Maps stats because he’s getting paid regardless, but as someone passionate about this brand, it’s soul-crushing to see our hard work credited to some food-truck. 

How can I ""mark our territory"" digitally so Google’s location pings recognize the terrace as part of the cafe, and not the burger truck?",1,1770150200.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

It would be hilarious and amazing watching them try to actually solve the murder and go full detective mode while the rest of the cast just creates chaos around them. Need to see this happen. 

Oh and to add a fun little thing if Amanda plays as Sarah Christ, Angela as Detective where's my coffee, and Courtney as a culinary crime detective, Shayne as the chosen, and etc.",4,1770150190.0,smosh,4,0.6,False
