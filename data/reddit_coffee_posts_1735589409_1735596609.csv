Hey everyone.

So I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I‚Äôm married and living a life most would be envious of.

But I‚Äôm also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it‚Äôs exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they‚Äôre decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I‚Äôm a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don‚Äôt have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I lol forward to talking to.

Is that you?",1,1735595968.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1hpyjf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hpyjf6/my_dad_decided_to_get_swastikas_on_his_hands/,My dad decided to get swastikas on his hands along with many other attention seeking tattoos when I was a kid.,"Both parents were chaotic alcoholics and my mother was both an alcoholic/on and off user. My mother tried her best to hide the ugly from us but she was scared to leave my father because she‚Äôd always say she can‚Äôt afford to leave him, we would be homeless.

He came home shitfaced one day with a massive blacked out swatstika on his hand. no gang affiliation, just a broken suburban home, no cults, nothing. He never had friends besides guys at work and he never do anything besides work and drink. 

A few months later he got a 2nd one done on his other hand‚Ä¶few months after that, he decided to get the bottom of his earlobes done, small swastickas on each earlobe. He ended up cutting the bottom of both ears with a razor blade when he was shitfaced again after my mother begging and pleading him to stop with the tattoos. He wouldn‚Äôt stop, it never made sense where it came from. The final blow was getting 666 in massive numbers tattooed across his neck. If he was in a gang or went to prison and was part of something I would understand

This sparked a massive rage in 14 year old
me but I couldn‚Äôt do anything, a year later kids at school found out. I‚Äôd shut down almost every girl and every group of friends from coming over due to the massive embarrassment. My few friends that knew about it and thought it was funny were my only friends, which I clinged onto because they feel normal. Going to my grandmothers for holidays was insanely awkward because everyone would say something about it and after a few years they just accepted it. Even as a kid everyone said to run away but I felt like I had to save everyone and I can‚Äôt desert them because they also relied on me once I gained financial responsibility 

My older brother(14 years older) said to move out as soon as possible because of how crazy things got over the years, I‚Äôd have many of these conversations with him but still had to make a down payment on every home we got
Kicked out of(total of 25 homes( and I paid $3-4k everytime.

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd move out at 18? Right? No. The constant guilt trip and mind games from both
parents left me in a trap where I felt like having my own place was impossible and if I left, no one would have a home so I worked incredibly hard to keep up with my mothers spending on stupid consumer shit and her addiction.

They both stopped drinking when I was 21 when a family member had a child. My father became 100% sober, still is to this day but has never said sorry, anytime I try to open up to him about that stuff in the past he brushes it off. My mother passed away from an OD a few years ago and sadly it was a huge relief because she was incredibly sick from lupus/COPD as well but a huge crush to my soul because she understood my pain but never knew how to point me in the right direction of understanding the past. She didn‚Äôt get back into smoking crack until my father/sister mentally abused her and kicked her out of the house. Which eventually lead to her OD.

At 30 years old, I‚Äôm still so angry at him but I hold onto the bright side of him that can be so insanely caring, devoted and loving before I was a teenager and helping me out with developing a hard work ethic in my early 20s.

It‚Äôs taken me 13 years to finally man up and stop living in this self pitty bullshit. I‚Äôve had therapists, I‚Äôve had long talks with very close friends and out of all the words that were said all it took was 1 line. 

‚ÄúYou spend all the money you make because you felt like you never deserve it, you dive head first into hobby‚Äôs and anything that can distract you because you‚Äôre hiding the pain of your past‚Äù

I‚Äôm officially moving out of the most dysfunctional household that I‚Äôve personally seen, I‚Äôve looked myself In the mirror and realized nothing will change unless I do. My father charges me the same amount of money an apartment costs to rent a room($1500) because my sibling controls his finances he only knows how to work, turn on a microwave and take a shower twice a week. He makes $150k working 70-80 hours a week, thinks he‚Äôs poor because my sibling spends all of it on fancy coffees, teas, absorbent amounts of designer clothes and anything that‚Äôs within the spending budget. 

She‚Äôs never held a job longer than 2 months, stay at home mother and plays along with my dad because he supports her funds 100% the second something goes wrong she threatens to take the kids away from him. Only cares about his grandchildren at this point in his life so that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs living for, which I understand the caring part.

They‚Äôve lived on the edge and fallen off financially my entire life, I can‚Äôt change that. I never will be able to. After all the mental breakdowns, the wounded bird syndrome, I officially don‚Äôt care anymore. I don‚Äôt feel bad for anyone in my household, I‚Äôve tried and exhausted all of my resources a 1000 times more than any human should put up with. 

It‚Äôs time to start my own life, bury the past, take everything I‚Äôve learned all of these years and build something positive about it. I know this rant is much longer than I wanted it to be and I could go on with insane stories like him attempting murder on my mother/attempted arson on our house but I‚Äôll save that for my next post when I‚Äôm ready for it.

Thank you for listening, this isn‚Äôt a sob story or a pitty party. This post was meant for me to finally bury the hatchet and open up to the world.

Despite knowing I shouldn‚Äôt push these things onto her as it‚Äôs unfair it still is in my mind.

I‚Äôve known her for 5 years + now and somehow we keep being drawn to each other. We spoke for a while in a romantic way, in which I was the first person she had sex with, before moving away to University where she was in the room above me by complete coincidence. We got together after a few months of us both messing about with other people and had about a year and a half relationship. 

Things became rocky when I was accepted to study abroad for a year. The final 6 months of our relationship was generally good, issues cropped up as time went on and I think she subconsciously pulled away emotionally to protect herself as she knew I was moving away. There was times that she would cause issues over nothing which wasn‚Äôt good for me and this pushed me away over time. I split up with her before I moved away as I didn‚Äôt want to take this into a new lifestyle. I wasn‚Äôt really bothered about other women I just didn‚Äôt see it to be healthy for me especially in what would‚Äôve became a long-distance scenario as we‚Äôre from Europe. 

We went over a year with no contact with each other whatsoever until I bumped into her in the street about a month after returning to my city. I spoke to her and we grabbed a coffee. She was in a new relationship at this point. She apologised to me and said in hindsight she needed me to split up with her to grow in herself. That she needed the lessons from that to be able to move forwards and grow as a person, she felt shame from her actions but wouldn‚Äôt change them. She had strong father issues which affected our relationship as she would push these issues onto me, having somewhat of an independent woman mentality. She seems to have genuinely taken the time to reflect on herself and grow as a person. I was extremely surprised. Not long after that she ended her relationship and contacted me. We‚Äôve been seeing each other for a couple months since and to be totally honest I‚Äôve really enjoyed our time together.

We were both loyal during our time together although I caught her in a few lies involving other people that had happened prior to our relationship, she took responsibility and apologised for these. I decided to move on from them as it was before we were together. Since I‚Äôve seen her again, she has told me while we were together she didn‚Äôt physically cheat but did consistently flirt with people when she was in clubs which was quite consistent, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this. I caught her in a lie virtually the same as the type she‚Äôd tell me while we were together in an attempt to create an ‚Äúinnocent image‚Äù of her in my mind rather than be truthful and let me take it for what it is. She apologised for this but it‚Äôs broken my trust and now I‚Äôm struggling to get back to where I was about the situation. 

For further context,  I‚Äôm no saint I‚Äôve been with 18 women since I first had sex at 15. I‚Äôve had two long relationships and fallen into casual sexual habits over periods outside of that. Since we split I moved abroad and was with 7 people over the year and half I lived abroad, 4 consistent partners over months and 3 ONS. She told me she was with 5 men and 2 women over this time, 2 consistent men and 2 consistent women with 3 ONS.

1hpy2xp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpy2xp,Legit Pharm Legit Pre,"# Legit Pharm Legit Pre

### Background
I‚Äôm a bit late on this one.  Coming in with a review just when everyone‚Äôs forgotten about Legit and moved on to Kill Switch.  I had to run this one five times over the past couple of months to fully make up my mind about it.   I took Kill Switch about four days ago and Thermal Spark about a week ago, so stim tolerance is up there but nothing crazy.  Time to finish up this review and get on to the next!

Lot# 5362W5G
Exp 04/27

### Label (5/5)
The stim package in this one is very nicely dosed.  The centerpiece is the 150mg of DMHA and 75mg of geranium extract, which we hope translates to high quality DMAA.  A similar DMHA to DMAA ratio is the horsepower behind legendary pre workouts like Crack Gold, Dark Energy and Dexter Halloween.  Caffeine, eria jarensis and alpha yohimbine are also present at moderate doses.  On first impression I would expect big energy, euphoria, urgency, endurance and strength.  We also have Noopept synergizing with the stim package, which should give extreme tunnel vision levels of focus.  Rounding this pre out are respectable doses of pump ingredients which should help with increased blood flow and endurance.

I really like the tub design on this one.  Definitely gives off some Dark Labs (RIP to the king) vibes with the skull motifs.

### Cost (3/5)
I picked up the tub I‚Äôm reviewing today from Ruesco for $62 shipped back in July.  Currently the only place to find these in stock is at Cross the Limits.  International shipping will be high, but if you bundle in multiple items into one order it should be manageable.  Using my Ruesco price this comes out to $2.5 ‚Äúper the go.‚Äù  Which is about average.

### Taste/Mixability (4/5)
Surprisingly good.  I was expecting something like sour apple candy.  This instead tastes like watered down apple juice.  Very nice and easy to drink with no chemical flavors or unpleasant after taste.  Mixability is great as well, with no residue left over.

### Effects (3/5)
No noticeable beta tingles.  About thirty minutes in some nice mood elevation starts to build along with a gentle increase in heart rate.  Urgency and tunnel vision set in shorty after and I‚Äôm ready to hit the weights.

Today is a volume pause squat workout.  Felt really good during warmups and went straight into work sets, pausing only for a hard slap from the smelling salts.  I superset in back and biceps accessories during pause squats.  Energy and endurance was good, strength output was good as well.  The mood elevation, urgency and focus persisted throughout the workout.  Pumps were solid though nothing crazy.

All in all a good workout.  Nothing crazy and nothing I couldn‚Äôt get from a non-illicit heavy hitter like El Jefe or Hypermax‚Äôd, minus the tunnel vision from the Noopept.  In fact I feel like I get better energy and strength from your average alpha yo bomb.

The big negative for me on Legit Pre is a nasty crash.  I find it hard to push through the rest of the day without an extra couple of cups of coffee or a nap about six hours in.  Wildfire goes a lot harder for me in the energy, strength and euphoria categories with a similar crash.  I won‚Äôt even try to compare this one to Crack Purple or Dark Energy because it doesn‚Äôt get anywhere in the same ballpark.

### Overall (3/5)
At this point it should be obvious that this one doesn‚Äôt have DMAA in it, or anything close.  Which is a shame because these companies absolutely know what expectations they‚Äôre setting when they put Geranium Extract on the label.

What I get from Legit is a good but low dosed DMHA pre with Noopept.  Dropping Geranium extract from the label and pushing the DMHA up to at least 200mg would have make this a top tier DMHA hitter.  

Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt enjoy this one as much as everyone else seems to.  I would recommend getting Crack Purple from Cross the Limits instead.  Other pres I would recommend over this one include just about any other version of Crack, Juggernaut Irate, Dexter Halloween or Big Bang.",3,1735594309.0,Preworkoutsupplements,1,0.8,False

1hpxyir,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndrewDitch/comments/1hpxyir/my_thoughts_on_andrew_ditch_as_an_audhd_caretaker/,"My Thoughts On Andrew Ditch, As An AuDHD** Caretaker. ","Sorry for the novel- TL:DR list at the bottom. 

**- Confirmed ADHD, working on Autism diagnosis but everyone else in my family has it and I share almost all the diagnostic traits of my parents, more will be explained later in the post. Also my apologies- I know I talk a lot about myself and my experiences in comparison, that‚Äôs how I connect with others and try and show people ‚Äúhey! I‚Äôve gone through this thing too? So you aren‚Äôt alone/ I know about this topic‚Äù. I come from a medical background family, and I promise I‚Äôve done a lot of actual research on Autism; I‚Äôve suspected I‚Äôve had it for like 5 years now so I promise you I‚Äôm not making this up- I just felt like that was needed because of who I‚Äôm talking about.

I‚Äôve been working as a caretaker for the elderly for almost the last year, freelancing to take care of a family friend who is still independent, but a fall risk. I‚Äôm more of a housekeeper and friend who helps people bathe sometimes. Caretaking, while not what I want to do forever- is something I enjoy and take pride in. I have a lot more time than a regular care aid to interact, get to know, and even relax and play board games with my patient. It‚Äôs a very important job and it‚Äôs a job that is meant to be both respectful and respected; of course though there are people of all ages like Andy, determined to disrespect those who work in care, or traumatize them. 
I want to state before I begin my rant: 
If I had Andy or someone like him as a patient, I‚Äôd quit in a heartbeat- money and career be damned. I‚Äôd drop my clipboard and walk my ass out of there faster than a tornado. No money is worth that- and there‚Äôs especially not enough money in The American Healthcare System that can pay those nurses and staff the salaries they deserve for what they have had to deal with. Mad respect for anyone who has ever had to deal with Andy. 

On top of being a caretaker, I‚Äôm diagnosed ADHD and working on an Autism diagnosis- though both my parents and my younger brother are diagnosed, my parents assumed I was just introverted and since they have very narrow attention- unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get a lot of it. So while they were concerned for my little brother who was diagnosed, I was crap outta luck until after I aged out of public availability for a diagnosis. For some reason- which makes me even angrier at the resources Andy is exploiting: there are no public doctors who do adult autism assessments in Canada, which means I‚Äôll have to shell out anywhere from $500-$7000 for a diagnosis; an assessment that Andy has gotten for basically free multiple times- and been proven to not be.    Not to mention that Autism is largely genetic, and is more likely to be passed from the father‚Äôs side. If Andy was Autistic, there would most likely be other people in his family with similar issues or other neurological and/or physical disorders associated. Of course there are outliers, but you don‚Äôt see those often; usually if someone is autistic and their family isn‚Äôt, a family member or parent may be undiagnosed. I myself have multiple family members who have or had the same mental and physical traits as my parents, both Grandfathers included in that. 

Andy is a public menace. There are other words I could use- and I feel like ‚ÄòPublic Menace‚Äô is the understatement of the year- but if I say something harsher, I probably won‚Äôt be able to contain myself. 

First, the elder abuse, the threatening, and pretty much blackmailing of his parents. My heart physically breaks for Thomas and Janet. Frankly if I had the means to do so, I‚Äôd get on a plane and go physically go help them myself. His parents I believe are both over 60, and thus are protected people under USA law- Andy should have been sent to prison for attempted M back with the coffee maker and for the diffuser- not to mention all the threats he‚Äôs made to his mother. I believe in absolute that Andy‚Äôs attempts on her are part of her ailing health. Frankly the fact he‚Äôs been so protected from consequences irks me when his parents are elderly, disabled, and he‚Äôs assaulted them and tried to kill them multiple times, along with poisoning the food at his old job. That is knowingly causing harm and he should be punished for such.
I did hear someone say they were Trump Supporters and I just gotta say as an Openly Queer Woman: I don‚Äôt care about that. They are everyday people and they haven‚Äôt done anything to deserve all the attempts on their lives made by their son. Election cycle is over, USA got the orange guy who went bankrupt a lot- and in this time of political uncertainty we should all be helping or at least bringing awareness to those in need- they aren‚Äôt millionaires, they are just normal elderly people trying to do best for themselves while dealing with a horrible middle aged manchild.

Secondly, the ‚Äúspeech impediment‚Äù. Throughout when Andy talks to his parents, his voice changes from babyish, slurred, and rounding his words with w,u, or r sounds,  to normal speech- no rounding of words, to straight up seriously threatening and demanding. I get the range, but as someone who is suspected autistic with a small speech impediment, usually the words I have trouble with are regardless of tone, pronouncing the same words incorrectly consistently and it‚Äôs the same for my diagnosed autistic friends. For example- my consistent issues with pronouncing stuff are usually with ‚ÄòS‚Äô or ‚ÄúTh‚Äù sounds, they sometimes come out sounding like an ‚Äúf‚Äù sound unless I really focus on pronunciation, my diagnosed friend has a hard time pronouncing ‚ÄúT‚Äù sounds and pronounces most of them like ‚ÄúTh‚Äù sounds. Speech impediments are apparently a diagnostic criteria for ASD, which until today I didn‚Äôt know so I‚Äôm not gonna say for sure until I do more research. I just thought my mouth was bad at speaking some words.
While we all know Andy Is a Fayyyyyyyyyykkkkkkkeeeeeee, dude consistently shows that his voice and speech impediments are especially fake. He shows his real voice when he‚Äôs threatening his father. He is able to talk normally- maybe he just does this because he knows it part of the criteria. Too bad he‚Äôs a horrible actor. 

Thirdly, the caretakers and nurses this troglodyte has probably traumatized. Bodily fluids from semen to shit is a normal thing, obviously- and while gross, it‚Äôs manageable when the people ACTUALLY need the help. I understand wholeheartedly there are people of all ages with incontinence issues. According to a study by Pub Med- roughly 82% of autistic adults deal with some sort of incontinence during their lifetime, and around 64% of Autistic people have tummy issues like IBS. Incontinence for the autistic is usually due to the fact it‚Äôs very hard to recognize the body‚Äôs que for waste expulsion. You may just not feel the need until you‚Äôre about to burst, however; we know that there‚Äôs not 82% of autistic people wearing diapers. There are autistic people who wear diapers because of their incontinence or because the pressure on their body and a incontinence safety net feels comforting and there‚Äôs no need for judgement; working in a retirement home, you meet a lot of people who use them. But if Andy needed them I wouldn‚Äôt be writing about him. From Body Cam footage- it‚Äôs obvious he does this on purpose, like pissing on those documents he had with him in either the ambulance or cop car.  not hard to do if you force yourself. There are elderly people who do this too- usually less for sexual gratification (unless you‚Äôre in a place with a criminal ward, then that reason becomes more common) and more of a last ditch (no pun intended) attempt to keep the careaid in the room to help them feel less lonely.

Fourthly, the conditions of the Ditch family home concerns me, I know those are old videos since Andy hasn‚Äôt been back in a while- but no wonder why his parents were having issues with moving, breathing, etc! And while they struggle, that THING just sits, complains, mocks, and HURTS THEM. That makes me believe that Andrew Ditch is truly evil and psychopathic. It had me physically crying at the thought of someone doing this to the elderly, especially to their own parents. Anyone who does this to anyone is just plain evil- especially to people who can‚Äôt defend themselves. I genuinely can‚Äôt fathom why people would want to hurt others, and Andy is one of those people who completely fucking baffles me, and the fact he could do this again to his innocent parents both drives me both crazy and into a depression. 

Fifthly, Andy is obviously not right in the head, but we know that‚Äôs because of schizoaffective instead of Autism and probably from being flattened riding to work as Ronald McDonald. I‚Äôd also be interested to see how narcissistic he is. He needs help- but not the help he thinks he does. He can‚Äôt even fake autism believably. He‚Äôs a horrible actor and an even worse person. He‚Äôs like weaponized incompetence personified. 

Conclusion: Andy‚Äôs parents are the real ones who need a caretaker to help them around the house. At their age they should be sitting comfortably and resting themselves to get better instead of doing all the labour. Janet should be able to spend her last days in peace, and I‚Äôm not just worried for Janet, I also worry for Tom- my uncle was the main provider to his wife when she was unable to care for herself, and he passed before her from the exhaustion, as he had little to no help. That was incredibly stressful on someone who was in their early 80‚Äôs, and I don‚Äôt even know how old Tom is, but I know he‚Äôs not a young man anymore, he shouldn‚Äôt be the main full time caretaker for both himself and his wife- it will put his own mental and physical health in jeopardy and it probably already has. I‚Äôm glad Andy is at least gone from that house- as that would only make more stress for his parents. 
I also want everyone and Andy to know: most if not all caretakers don‚Äôt and will not wipe for you if you can do it yourself.  We are not your slaves to change you, Andy. You‚Äôre obviously toilet trained, go poop by yourself- you‚Äôre a big boy‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs almost twice my age. 

TLDR:
- I‚Äôm ADHD & Suspected Autistic & a Caretaker for the  Elderly. I have a medical family background, I know how to do medical research.
- Andy gets free assessments; while here in Canada, that‚Äôs not a possibility for adults suspected to be autistic. I‚Äôll have to shell out $500-$7K. He‚Äôs been proven to not be autistic several times and is still begging for this expensive assessment. How does this guy get numerous assessments when I can‚Äôt even get one?
- I‚Äôm very worried for Tom and Janet and Andy should be in prison for multiple attempted murders. 
- Tom and Janet are over 60, thus a protected ‚Äúat risk‚Äù class of people, so Andy should have been charged with all he‚Äôs done to them.
- Andy‚Äôs attempts on Janet have probably furthered her health deteriorating.
- His Speech Impediment is Fayyyyke and he‚Äôs probably doing it because apparently (just learnt so idk) speech impediments are a diagnostic trait in Autism. 
- Caring for those with incontinence issues is easy WHEN THE PEOPLE REALLY NEED THE HELP. Andy does not and has never needed that help. 
- 82% of autistic people deal with incontinence issues and 64% deal with stuff like IBS, but even so- very few wear diapers unless it‚Äôs actually very needed. Andy can and has forcefully expelled waste just to be a dick. The Elderly do it too, he‚Äôs not the only one.
- The conditions in The Ditch Family home seen in Andy‚Äôs videos are concerning.
- Tom being the main caretaker for both him and his wife is unhealthy, and I‚Äôm very concerned for his mental and physical well-being. If he keeps it up, he could die from the exhaustion. (This can and has happened with the elderly who are the primary caretakers for their partner) 
- Andy is Weaponized Incompetence as a person
- TOM AND JANET ARE THE REAL ONES WHO NEED CARETAKERS",4,1735593992.0,AndrewDitch,6,0.83,False

This is a story told to me by a old friend. Buddy. I met him while taking an Advance Photography class years ago. He's gone now. Rest in peace my friend.

Buddy was a WW2 vet,an infantrymen, two purple hearts. Caught a piece of shrapnel in the right arm and got his left but cheek creased as he crawled in to a shell hole. He made it through to the end of the war. Then he went to Hollywood to make it big.

That didn't happen. He tried being a stunt man, he did that but didn't get much work so he tried being cowboy extra because he had his own outfits/costumes his grandfather had left him (two steamer trunks of chaps, hats, boots, vests, a gun belt or two and assorted clothing and a collection of spurs and an odd assortment of bloomers he had no expiation for.) He worked as a assistant gaffer, roustabout, scenery mover, builder, painter animal trainer, horses mostly. Sometimes he never did the same thing twice for weeks at a time.

One thing he told me was he never did any war movies and there were a lot made in the late forties. He said the thought of it caused him to remember to many things.

He got a lot of work as an extra and back ground. He said he never got a single line in any of the moves he was in nor even a quick close up. Buddy had a Boston accent that could cut wood, he couldn't do a cowboy drawl to save his life.

Anyway he was drunk at the time and told me this story. He said days later that he had no memory of having said it when I remarked to him about it. He stated he had never told anyone else before because he believed it was a hallucination.

This is what he told me, as much as I remember. This is from his point of view.

Take five ~~~~ I stumbled and would have fell on my face if not for a ruff calloused hand catching my arm. ‚ÄúEasy there...‚Äù a voice said. ‚ÄúCop a squat.‚Äù I allowed my self to be guided in to a seated position. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù the voice said A canteen cup was pressed in to my cold and numb hands. I felt the warmth and I leaned forward over the cup and inhaled the warm aroma.

No sound.

~~~ Directed thought... Coffee? Flashes of memory.... Tea? Time had no meaning.... Soup? Hopes, dreams... A few ZZZ's? Unanswered questions...

Flashes of bright white light.

This is how Buddy describe it, like a collage of sight and sounds.



(I wonder if he has had a stroke or seizure)



I woke warm and rested but with no idea how long I slept I was seated on a rock, there was no tent, no fire ,no coffee no one with 30 feet of me....

Take five ‚Ä¶. I shuttered in shock not cold. I sat on the rock for the five minutes.

~~~

Two hours later as we moving along a trail and I was on point. Out of nowhere the ruff calloused hand reached out and grabbed my arm and in the same voice as before whispered ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù

I froze in place.

Everything became razor sharp in my sight, I rubberneck around I was alone! I looked around and saw the rest of the squad was ten to fifteen feet behind me. I held my hand out palm up to have them stay there and checked my surroundings once again and slowly in-front of me I was able see a trip wire. Then ten feet further up the trail I saw another wire. I retraced my steps back to my squid and told the Sgt.

We backed off down the trail they had come up retracing their steps for safety. They still had to try getting up the hill. They tried three other trails but they were all booby trapped and mined. After reporting in.

Battalion HQ pulled his platoon back and sent them on a different mission. It turned out that the area was so heavy mined and booby trapped that later it was bypassed. Some time later the trails were shelled and the a mine cleaning tank was run through the area.

Buddy offered no further elaboration of the story and I could tell that it was an uncomfortable subject for him so I never pressed him on it. The last time I saw him he and I had a beer at the neighborhood drink me up it was 1978 or 79 I was home on leave. He always had a smile and a kind word for everyone and a bit of sage advice now and then.

‚ÄúCheck your pockets and watch you back.‚Äù Was what he always said. What he meant was never forget your keys, your pocket knife, lighter, matches (he always said carry both) cigs and your wallet and of course your Pro. Kit. 8-)",1,1735593851.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

I was just driving on Mineral Point and the bus in front of me took a left turn onto Whitney Way at a pretty good speed, and although the front part of the slinky bus seemed perfectly fine, the back of the slinky part actually tilted during the turn at what I would call a pretty significant angle -- enough to the point where someone holding a open top cup of coffee might've had some splash onto their hand

I don't know if this is an isolated incident or whether that's pretty normal but has anyone who is ever ridden in the back end of the slinky bus comment on whether it has a significant tilt going around corners?

It doesn't matter to me, and I'm sure it's been deemed as safe, but I thought it was kind of interesting -- almost as if it was about to go up on two wheels.

I just made an account in fact. I have lived a very fulfilled loving life which was mostly created by my mother who did everything for everyone else. She was the most compassionate, giving, loving person most people had ever met. She was diagnosed with  copd almost a decade ago (plug for not smoking or vaping) and it was eventually reveresed diagnosis but she did often wheeze and had trouble breathing. We had been to the Dr.s the ER you name it, they would give her some oxygen and send her on her way. NO ONE knew it was life threateningly serious. I often urged her to go back and see new Dr.s but like we all do... I got busy and wrapped up with life.  I have three amazing kids 17M, 13M, 9F  who my mom lived for. She was the kind of person who would go to the store (she loved shopping) and always pick things up for us and the kids and leave them on our beds. Due to unforeseen circumstances my parents and I ended up living together which was supposed to be a short time, but covid, inflation, and life all happened and it ended up being 6 years together. I didn't love living there it was a house we got together and it was too small and cluttered for all of us... but I did. On 12/19 I moved into my new house. My fianc√© and I have been together 6 years and finally built a house after 7 months of waiting. I was so excited and we moved in and she came over and helped me build my daughters canopy bed. She ended up leaving after because she said she wasn't breathing well. Something she had said 100 times before over the last several years. She rests and uses her inhalers and is fine. We had an amazing Christmas Eve with everyone together she looked so cute in her light up sweater and her pig tails and her smile lit the room. She was an infectious person. Christmas came. We do Christmas Eve with my parents and then Christmas Day with just our kids so I didn't even get to see her on Christmas. I text her and I called her like I always do 100 times a day sometimes. She was my best friend.  I have reran through all of our messages and all the cute links she sent me every day most I responded to, but others I feel horrible for not liking them or acknowleding them. The memories hurt. All the things she bought me I am cherishing and crying. I wake up crying I go to bed crying and I am not a cryer. I hyperventilate at times and I'm angry that other people got to live long lives and someone as selfless and amazing as her only made it to 59. So young and we had so much to do. She won't get to watch my babies finish growing up which were her whole world, or see them graduate, or get married. My kids looked at her as a second mom so they are hurting. My 9 year old was sad but is easily distracted and when she's happy and others are happy I feel upset because she will never get to experience anything again. We would get eachother coffees at Dutch bro all the time and mess with eachother when we got one for ourselves but not eachother. I can't even drink there now. I don't want to enjoy anything because she can't enjoy anything. I know it's ridiculous... but I can't help. If anyone has any advice or is going through something similar please let me know... im not a religious person. It's not that I'm atheist or anything I feel like there is more to us than the body. I just don't really know either way if heaven or hell is real or anything I don't discredit it because I just don't know. I wish I did it would make me feel better... but then I can't understand how such horrible people are here but she isn't... I feel like she can't be just gone forever and nothingness. I hope with all my heart. I miss her so much it hurts. My dad was married to her for 46 years. I hurt for him but im not strong enough to be there for him right now dealing with my own pain.

I (24M) am living with my girlfriend (23F), who is a teacher, while I‚Äôm back in school pursuing a new career. We‚Äôve been dating for almost four years, and I‚Äôm planning on proposing in the next year or two.

The issue is travel. She really wants to go to Norway this summer (since we both have summers off), and while I understand how exciting that might be for her, I‚Äôm having a hard time with it. Her idea of a vacation is city-hopping, exploring restaurants, and enjoying coffee shops (basically the classic Instagram European vacation if that makes sense), while mine is minimalist camping and etc. 

On top of that, I genuinely don‚Äôt enjoy traveling, in the traditional sense. I‚Äôve been out of the country five times, and it‚Äôs just not my thing. Between the hassle, cost and lack of fulfillment, I just don't feel the same way others do about it. 

I‚Äôm also an extremely frugal person - saving for a house and trying to be financially secure - so the idea of spending $6,000+ on a 10-day trip is stressing me out. While I‚Äôm not financially strained, she comes from a wealthy family and has never had to worry about finances. Her parents still pay for her car and several other things, which is just not how I was raised. She also have been to Guatemala twice and goes to Greece/Europe every other year with her family - so she is not entirely unfamiliar with travel either. 

She‚Äôs been putting pressure on me to plan this trip, even though I don‚Äôt really want to go. She rarely has the energy to help with planning, so I‚Äôm stuck trying to figure out something I‚Äôm not invested in. On top of that, she refuses to compromise on where to go, it has to be Norway, specifically these remote islands 500 miles away from Oslo. 

I love her and want her to be happy, but this situation is making me feel stuck. I‚Äôm worried this difference in travel preferences and financial priorities might become a bigger issue in the future.

Has anyone else faced this kind of problem? How do you handle being in a relationship with such different ideas about money, vacations, and priorities?

Converse sneakers have a reputation for being trendy, but how do they feel on your feet? Many wearers report that they need a short break-in period to achieve maximum comfort. Here‚Äôs what to expect:

- **Wearability:** Converse sneakers can be worn with various outfits, from casual jeans to sporty shorts. This versatility leads to more wear, so comfort plays a significant role.

The Evolution of Converse: A Look at its Impact on Fashion and Culture
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The story of Converse is as dynamic as the shoes it produces. From its humble beginnings in 1908 as a rubber shoe company, it has metamorphosed into a cultural icon that now spans generations. This transformation has not only influenced fashion but has also played a significant role in shaping youth culture and personal expression.

In the early days, Converse primarily focused on producing sports shoes, particularly those designed for basketball. The launch of the Chuck Taylor All-Star in 1917 marked a turning point. Initially created as a basketball shoe, the All-Star gained popularity, thanks to the endorsement of basketball player Chuck Taylor. This shoe became more than athletic footwear; it became a symbol of sport and lifestyle. Would you believe that by the 1960s, it was the go-to choice for basketball players across America? The classic design has remained virtually unchanged over the decades, reinforcing its timeless appeal.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-converse  
  
As the decades rolled on, Converse ventured beyond the basketball court. The 1960s brought about counterculture movements, and the All-Star emerged as a canvas for self-expression. Young people began customizing their Converse shoes with paint, patches, and unique laces, showcasing their individuality. This trend paralleled the rise of rock and punk music, further cementing the brand's place in fashion and culture. Bands like The Ramones and The Sex Pistols sported Converse footwear, making them synonymous with rebellion and youth culture.

Another pivotal moment for Converse happened in the 1980s and 1990s when it experienced a revival among hip-hop artists. Bold fashion choices emerged, and the All-Star was often paired with baggy jeans and oversized graphic tees. The shoe became a staple in urban fashion, pushing Converse into the limelight once again. These shifts illustrated a fascinating interplay between music, fashion, and cultural trends, as Converse firmly established itself in multiple spheres of influence.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-converse  
  
**Key Influences on Fashion and Culture:**

- **Sporting Legacy:** The shoes maintained their roots in sports, bridging high performance with street style. Basketball teams continued wearing them, adding to their legacy.
- **Customization and Individuality:** The movement surrounding customizing shoes allowed wearers to make bold fashion statements, linking Converse to personal identity.
- **Music Integration:** The association with rock, punk, and hip-hop solidified its position as a fashionable choice, particularly amongst artists, fans, and cultural movements.
- **Gender Neutrality:** Converse shoes appealed to all genders, breaking down barriers and promoting inclusivity in fashion.

The 2000s saw Converse positioning itself for a broader audience, collaborating with high fashion designers and artists. Partnerships with brands and personalities like Comme des Gar√ßons and Missoni brought high-end flair to a classic sneaker. These collaborations made Converse appealing to a wider demographic, from fashionistas to everyday sneaker lovers. Today, the Converse All-Star is recognized not just as a sneaker but as a fashion statement, embraced by people of all ages.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/product-review-converse  
  
Furthermore, Converse's commitment to sustainability reflects contemporary values and trends. As fashion evolves, consumers increasingly seek brands that align with their ethical beliefs. Converse has responded by implementing eco-friendly practices and offering products made from sustainable materials. This shift not only enhances the brand's relevance but also connects with a generation that prioritizes environmental consciousness.

The impact of Converse on fashion and culture is undeniable. It holds a unique position, bridging past and present, influencing generations through sport, music, and style. The brand continues to evolve while retaining the essence of what made it a staple in wardrobes worldwide: simplicity, style, and a spirit of rebellion.

Meeting up with her at random locations for spontaneous sex...

Talking on the phone for hours about nothing.

I grew.. I learned

All her lies..

I do the vast bulk of our household gift-buying because I'm good at it and enjoy finding lovely gifts. No complaints about this; my husband (42M) and I have a good division of labor.


This most recent Christmas was the same. I spent a ton of time and effort on everyone in my husband's family (FIL, MIL, BIL & partner, SIL & partner, nephew).


Christmas day arrived and I was so excited for everyone to get their gifts and participate in two games (which are done yearly and expected/requested by nephew/stepson).


It was awful. My SIL and her partner noticeably ignored me (SIL and husband have a rocky relationship but are cordial with each other; I've never been snubbed by her before). They took all of their gifts from us home and said they'd open them later.


The only gift that I personally received from anyone was some K-cups from BIL and his partner. I don't own a coffee maker that uses those. While this was a sweet and heartfelt gift (they both have a cognitive disability and don't understand that I can't use them), it actually made me feel worse about the lack of other gifts.


So, I'm done. I'm not doing this again. It's not about no gifts, it's about putting in a ton of effort for people who put zero effort into me. I'm incredibly easy to shop for (one of the best things I got last year was canned food that I could put in a little free pantry of my choosing - I was overjoyed and that's so easy to replicate).


Next year I'm spending my Christmas budget supporting organizations that are important to me. BIL, his partner, and 12yo nephew will each get a gift. Nobody else out of this family group (we do our own thing with husband and stepson).


My question is: Do I make this known beforehand, or do I just politely decline the invitation from my FIL/MIL to come over for Christmas? How should I handle questions? I want to take a stand and set a boundary, but firmly and quietly - and in a way that doesn't make me look like I'm throwing a retaliatory tantrum.",20,1735591627.0,AskONLYWomenOver30,18,1.0,False

The sun was about to set, the glimpse of light struggling to pass though the autumn leaves within the trees. A chilly breeze touched my face while my camera lens were trying to capture the twilight light, such beauty, such melancholy, dare i say: perfection. The trees were making the perfect canvas, bordering the edges of my pictures. In the distance you were able to see the city, with his soft warm light starting to appear at the windows, the sky was not crystal clear, some lost clouds where hovering over the buildings. I find it so fascinating, every single light in those building showed the presence of a soul, a life that I have no clue about, their problems, their obstacles, their love stories, their tears, all resides in that one tiny box.

Maybe a dog is waiting so eager for their human to come home and to love them, maybe a young mother is hugging her new born child, thinking about what she should do next, and how to give the world to the little soul in her arms. Maybe there is a child studying hard for an exam... all of these happening right in front of your eyes.    

There is something about autumn, the atmosphere, the deep thoughts from within our conscious that is coming to the surface only in this time of the year. Some of us would prefer to be in a castel, in the top of a mountain, with a simple white dress and a hot tea in their hands, looking into the flames of a fireplace and just inhaling the strong cold air around. Dreaming about life, and how many secrets reside in every human that is struggling to survive in this world we call ""home"".

While my mind was wondering far and wide, my camera noticed a group of people, down the stairs that I ve managed so fearsome to climb in order to catch ""the perfect"" golden hour photo. These people, they were having fun, laughing, enjoying a hot cup of coffee from the famous coffee shop from our city. The group was made out of 4 people, a girl, a pretty small and cute one, her hair was covering a bit of her face, her long coat was really not matching the little hand that were barely visible under those sleeves. There was a boy, he was really trying too hard to impress the little ladybug, as i ve already nicknamed the cute girl sitting next to him, perhaps his haircut was a huge no for her as it was for me, considering that she was not looking at him at all. The next boy, was a bit of a ""fuck boy"", isn t it interesting how us, as humas we find some characteristics and we catalogue someone in a stereotype based on only the first impression? Perhaps that guy was even the most romantic man alive, but in my opinion, I would stay as far away as possible from him. Maybe my opinion was wrong, maybe it was right, but the way the girl was looking at him, trying to hide her glance and the soft smile whenever he was smiling, told me that the situation might be more complicated than i ve anticipated.

The last guy, was standing with his back at me, his black hair was the color of the night sky, his black coat blending almost perfectly with his hair. Couldn t tell if he was indeed as tall as i tought or not, due to the perspective I was in, when you are above the world, everything seems smaller, and the feeling that you have, like you were able to see into the future, to see and feel everything at the same time. 

As I was trying to zoom in into this unknown boy in front of me, a cold breeze made itself felt, my hair was getting a bit messy. My appearance never bothered me, as I never truly cared about my looks. Something my mother wouldn t be so proud of, she was always trying her best to make me look like a true woman, so feminine, so full of grace and beauty. I was trying to picture myself in the eyes of others, and the results were always somewhat disappointing, something about myself always made me feel like I was missing something, but I was never able to put my finger on it. The reason why I ve loved autumn so much is that it reminded about myself, so perfectly imperfect. 

The cold breeze reached the people down stairs as well, the ladybug was shaking a little bit, trying to make herself warm with her own arms, her blonde hair was pushed slowly by the breeze, her blue eyes closing slowly in an attempt to avoid the cold. Romeo, as i ve nicked named the try harding guy next to her, put his arms around her in an attempt to keep her warm, but, unfortunately, she was so repelled by his act that she stood up from her place, everyone was laughing, and I ve found myself giggling as well. 

Mystery guy started laughing as well, and he turned his head to his left, giving me a chance to see his face for the first time. Without further consideration I pressed the button on my camera to catch that moment. My heart skipped a beat as I was just admiring the face of the stranger in front of me, his jawline was the first thing that caught my attention, almost perfectly sculptured, with a dimple on his cheek, maybe all the girls were at his feet. I kept on pressing the button as he kept on laughing with his friends; the pictures were good, but something was missing again, the endless story of my life. As I let out a sight, he suddenly looked in my direction, and I knew he was looking at me. I pointed towards the camera that was covering my face and smiled behind the cold  device. He smiled at me, looking almost over his shoulder. I pressed the button again, and again, to make sure that I got the right picture I wanted. I let down the camera, and stared to look at what I ve managed to capture, having butterflies in my stomach for an unknown reason to me.

His face was perfect, as perfect as one can be, his black hair in the wind, his dark eyes looking into my lens, something was sad about those eyes, I didn't know what was it, but I felt like he was in some kind of pain, even tho he was smiling to me. His lips, almost red due to the cold, not too big, not too small, his dimples that were melting so beautifully into his cheeks, his neck that was more than sure worked out a little bit, he was all in all giving a calm vide, a warm one. I liked it. 

I ve had my fair share with men, always ending the same, one of us in tears. I was always in love with the idea of love, the romance was a part of my core, but, whoever said that romance is dead, was indeed right. Every men that I knew was expecting something trivial, something that doesn t require too much stress or plans. They didn t understood the beauty of it, the feeling that you have within yourself when you are doing something like that, the thrill, the hunt dare I even say. The purity in giving away a flower to a girl, simply admiring her for who she is, not for who you want her to be... I am a dying breed. Unsavable, hopeless, stubborn me. 

The guys like him are never satisfied, they know they look good and so they are taking advantage; taking you out, suggesting something indecent, and you, as a woman, in your desire to keep him, to be forever in love with the beautiful man next to you, you would go till the end of the world to meet his expectations, just to realize after some time that you will never be good enough for him, that he got what he wanted from you and now the hunt begins again for him. 

The rule applies in both ways, don t get me wrong, there are girls that do the same thing, breaking guys hearts on a daily basis, taking advantage of their money, the attention and all other things. That s why in the life we have, we never know who to trust, and more important we are afraid to love. 

Life was never easy, but it used to be more simple, and I am craving that every single day. 

A hand pushed my camera away from me, a soft hand, with a simple ring on the middle finger. 

"" Are you going to show me the results as well, paparazzi?"" he asked me in a soft, jokey way. His voice was like a melody, a full on rhapsody; I was a little shocked, he was so calm, so confident and yet a little nervous. 

I looked him in the eyes and smiled "" I am going to get good money over this masterpiece""

And so, I ve met him in the park...                  ",1,1735591386.0,TheHiddenMuse,0,1.0,False

1hpww5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hpww5z/evolution_lies_in_collective_godhood/,Evolution Lies in Collective Godhood,"It was a normal day at the office. We all had clocked in a couple hours ago, on our 3rd cup of lukewarm coffee watching plasma. It was bad enough the sterile white lights of this dreary liminal office felt as though they were burning my retinas every time I dared to look up. The higher ups had become obsessed with observing the plasma around this one planet in a solar system all by itself 10 million light years away. We of course had an image to watch the planet but since plasma is the only way to ‚Äúhear‚Äù anything in space, it was mainly that we were obliged to stare at it. To their credit, the planet did look interesting. We had a pretty clear picture of the planet and it looked like a fungi octopus thing. The planet had these bio luminescent plates that emitted lights all the way to the Andromeda galaxy.¬† It had these tentacles that appeared to crack through some of the plates and wave around.¬†

‚ÄúDo you think it's alive?‚Äù¬†

My eyes darted over to meet Ursas. Her eyes were a deep green and she seemed oddly worried. Her face was quivering, her small nose twitching, her freckles shifting with every micro movement of her face.



‚ÄúI mean I don‚Äôt think planets can be alive, they're made of minerals or gas and to my knowledge those don‚Äôt come alive.‚Äù



Ursas eyes darted down to her lap, and back up to me.¬†



‚ÄúStella, come over here for a second. I have to show you what I found.‚Äù¬†



I had never heard her so scared. I was shocked. She, like all of us, loves space and the unknowns of our universe. We worked through all of those years of school after all. We've come across some weird cosmic stuff before, calls for help from light years ago, abandoned outposts on distant planets, you get the idea. So her being scared of something cosmic was a shock.¬† She quickly pulled up some files from a folder she had hidden.¬†



‚ÄúYou know how a couple days ago after holiday we all got put on plasma watch?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúWell I decided to come in because I had nothing better to do and I wanted to check on the rover that was tasked with investigating the outpost from millions of years ago.‚Äù



She took a deep breath and pulled up these near faded pages that the rover captured that contained alien text. She started to pull up transcriptions almost frantically and I had to say something.¬†



‚ÄúYou do know that these won't help us right? They didn't leave behind anything we don't already have and they aren't even here anymore. We would have received something from them by now.‚Äù



‚ÄúJust read‚Äù



She spoke softly and with a worried tone, almost as if people were watching.¬†



The translation was a set of instructions on how to make a planet come to life. How it was the next step in evolution. Collective godhood. I planted my hand on Ursas shoulder feeling her shuddering.¬†



‚ÄúUrsa, please don't tell me that you think this planet is magically going to come to life.‚Äù



‚ÄúStella it already is. The moon orbiting it has to be its child. Why do you think after the holidays we were tasked with focusing on the plasma around the moon and planet? It's to see if we can pick up any semblance of sound around it.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúUrsa-‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúPlease believe me, we have to tell the others, what if it can come to us and destroy us? We have to prepare. What if‚Ä¶ What if they succeeded and these world leaders want to try and replicate this? We all would be beholden to something not right with nature and the order of things.‚Äù¬†



Tears started swelling in her eyes.¬†



‚ÄúLook, what we are watching happened in the past, if they wanted to destroy us they already would have. And there's no way world leaders would take a gamble on evolution.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThe texts say that after bringing life to the planet it is to swallow all surrounding planets and lay an egg for a new one. What if that moon is the egg? What if it really is the next stage of evolution? What if that's why the universe is so old but we are so new? What if-‚Äù



‚ÄúYou sound nuts! There's no way that these aliens from years and years ago tried to bring their planet to life to evolve. Please, let this go.‚Äù



Her eyes were like daggers, and each tear hurt my very soul.¬†



‚ÄúIm sorry, I didn't mean-‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúIt's okay.‚Äù



She slinked into her chair and closed the files. She started watching the plasma again. As did I.



The next day was the same. Lukewarm coffee, the liminal office sucking the soul out of me, and Ursa looking up at the higher ups office with a sense of fear.¬†



‚ÄúHey Stella, do you wanna come over to my place after work? I need to show you something I found.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy not here?‚Äù



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching.‚Äù



I didn't want to put up a fight. I felt bad for Ursa. We had started this job at the same time and quickly became friends. Best friends. We were a fun contrast, she always was a little chipper, her ginger hair and green eyes and my jet black hair and deep blue eyes.¬†



After work, we got into our respective vehicles and I followed Ursa to her house. She unlocked the door and motioned me to come inside and locked the door behind me. Her house was cozy, with dark green walls and subtle warm lighting illuminating earthly accessories but also space nerd decorations. For someone I've had such deep conversations about the cosmos with I didn't expect her to be so earthy, so to break the soul draining silence that had been between us all day:



‚ÄúWow, I didn't expect you to have so much earthly stuff. It's so green and warm. My house is all cold and blue.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell as much as I love space, Earth is my home after all. I fell in love with this planet before space.‚Äù



She looked solemn. Her eyes were glossy and her hair was loosening from her clip and obscuring her face.¬†



‚ÄúFollow me, my office is right over here.‚Äù¬†



I followed her and as we neared the office I felt scared. Each step felt like I was walking towards doom. As if as soon as I entered the room there would be two of me. One who would look out at the cosmos with horror, and one with the same naive love for space.¬†



We entered the office and it was a complete shift from the rest of the house. It was all dark with deep blue accents. The lights were dim and the whole office felt just plain eerie. Like I stepped into a whole separate realm. Ursa immediately went to her computer and pulled up the plasma from work. I remained silent as I felt my breath becoming harder to gather. It felt like I was breathing through a cloth stretched over my face.¬†



‚ÄúAlright put these headphones on.‚Äù¬†



I knelt down beside her and took the headphones. I pushed my hair behind my ears and put the headphones on.¬†



It was breathing.



The planet was breathing. It sounded like a low drawn out Gjallarhorn. It reverberated around my brain and it moved me to tears. Each exhale lasted 20 seconds and each 20 seconds rattled my bones.¬†



‚ÄúStella, it's breathing. It's actually alive.‚Äù



She grabbed me by the shoulders holding back tears.¬†



‚ÄúAnd that's not all. The moon is growing its own tentacles. Its suckers are sticking to the crest and unsticking. It's going to hatch soon.‚Äù¬†



She got up and started pacing.¬†



‚ÄúWe have to tell people, we have to bring awareness so if anyone tries to make us into that thing we can stop it. We can‚Äôt become that. That's‚Ä¶ unholy.‚Äù¬†¬†



I immediately agreed. I didn't want to become that. Where do we as individuals go? All our culture, architecture, millions of years of our evolution gone with us pouring into some cosmic experiment to become a man made God.¬†¬†



We spent hours putting the recordings onto forums, even some images we could get of the planet and its moon to¬† try and hopefully get this exposed and known. Sending things to news stations and newspapers but no one would take the story. We did this for at least 3 months. Eventually me and Ursa got called into the office and sat down and shown all the stuff we were posting. They said if we post anything else we would never be seen again. To not interfere with humanity's future. That this will push us past our last filter.¬†



We were defeated. Even our own colleagues wouldn't listen to us because they stopped actually watching the plasma after 3 days. They went to watching other planets and trying to reach back further and further in time. Me and Ursa had to live with this cursed knowledge for months.¬†

Two days ago, the moon finally hatched. It started cracking. Tentacles started sprawling out. The moon cried out . Mutters engulfed the office and Ursa started bawling.¬†



The newborn planet shed its shell and was bio-luminescent like its parent. The other planet benign to unfurl and reveal its true form. It roared, outstretching to the bounds of the solar system it resided in. It had a body that seemed much like our own, but every appendage was tentacles and what should have been eyes,mouth, nose, and ears were all suckers. Its plates were now dissolving into a liquid that would rise up and immediately freeze, revealing more tentacles sprawling everywhere. The two let out a screech and the end of the parents tentacle formed into a hand and miraculously spawned a black hole and the two entered and the black hole immediately disappeared.¬† We were all dumbfounded by what we saw.¬†



‚ÄúAttention!‚Äù



We all turned our heads to the higher ups who had finally come down from their office. The big boss stomped forward to the railing and bellowed out:



‚ÄúWhat we just witnessed was the birth of a new stage of evolution.‚Äù



He immediately looked over to me and Ursa and said:¬†



‚ÄúYou are to tell no one. If you tell anyone outside of this room, you will be executed.‚Äù¬†



Me and her froze up and stopped breathing.¬†



‚ÄúWe, for now, are safe as what just occurred was 10 million years ago. There's been no activity in our proximity but we will continue monitoring further reaches of our known universe. Don't be afraid. We are going to break past our last filter.‚Äù



Me and Ursa finally started breathing again and our coworkers all stared at us muttering to each other. I wasn't going to sit around for the rest of my shift in this liminal hell. I got up, took Ursas hand, got our bags and drove home. Ursa now was completely drained of all tears. She looked as though she had looked death in the eyes and shook its hand.¬†



We sat down on my couch and sunk. The house was cold but I didn't feel like getting up and turning on the heat so me and Ursa warmed each other up. She wrapped around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder and I rested my head on hers.¬†



‚ÄúWhat do we do Stella? They‚Äôre gonna make us become that‚Ä¶ thing sooner or later.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing we can do. We can try and post one more thing and hope that people rebel and we can continue living as we are. Following this ritual to fuse us all into the planet and bring it to life so we can become a collective God. Sacrificing the whole human race for an abomination of a step of evolution.‚Äù



We sat and watched movies, read books, watched TV, and listened to music, trying to enjoy life before I made this post and risk our lives. Enjoying all these forms of human expression one last time just incase they really did execute us.¬†



And now I am writing this post. My last hope. Please, when they start trying to round us up, fight back. Show love to your loved ones and organize defense measures. We can't lose what makes us human to become God.¬†

For context, I am a 34F with decades of chronic pain experience. I was raised in a domestic violence environment where I was perpetually beaten, starved, humiliated, and SA‚Äôed for over two decades. In my early 20s, I ran away, built a career for myself working in tech, and haven‚Äôt looked back. It has not been easy. I‚Äôve had no family, no financial support (apart from what I earn for myself), and no caretaking resources. I live with a degenerative neck and spine injury, autoimmune diseases, muscular dystrophy, nerve pain, and physical deformities resultant of decades of battery and malnutrition.

We all live with our own version of physical and emotional pain. While the physical pain is debilitating on its own, emotional pain can emerge as an even more sinister hidden threat. It erodes our self-worth, diminishes our will to go on, and strips away our sense of peace. I believe that we owe it to ourselves to care for our emotional pain, just as we do with our physical pain. I'll explain how.

**Before I begin, please note:**¬†this post is not a cure for depression. That takes time and treatment. What it can offer, however, is help and support to achieve a better quality of life and gain a greater sense of control. Not everything on this list will pertain to every individual. Always consult your doctor when it comes to making any medical decisions.

**1. Design a routine**

Routines make life feel normal and productive. Sometimes, living in chronic pain forces us to forfeit our routine to adapt to care needs. As a result, days start to feel longer, our minds start to wander, and our overall sense of purpose begins to fade. Introducing a new routine can be a critical step in restoring a bit of normalcy. The key is to design one that fits into your needs and limitations.

To ensure that your routine is successful, avoid launching the entire thing, all at once. Doing so sets you up for failure because sweeping changes don‚Äôt happen overnight. Instead, it‚Äôs best to start small and gradually build up over time. For example, you might start out doing red light therapy for just 5 minutes each morning and build up to 20 minutes over several weeks. Gradual changes allow you to make new habits stick.

If it helps, consider using a routine-building app or even a free Google Calendar that comes with every gmail account to design your routine. Below is a sample routine that could be reached slowly after several weeks to months:

1. Wake up
2. Coffee + red light therapy
3. Light stretches while watching the news or podcast
4. Personal hygiene(brush hair, clean skin, etc.)
5. Breakfast
6. Help out your family members or caretakers (make calls, handle bills, do little things that they need)
7. Learn or practice a new skill (learn to cook, learn a language, learn to draw, etc.)
8. Light stretches or a walk
9. Lunch
10. Reach out to friends
11. Dinner
12. Wind-down
13. Bed

In reference to red light therapy listed above, if you aren't familiar, I'd definitely suggesting reading into it. I was skeptical at first, but there is solid researching supporting its use in treating depression, fatigue, anxiety, and even inflammation. I use a Joovv red light unit every morning.

**2. Consider trying talk therapy**

Having a therapist who gets you can be life-changing. While some of us may have friends and family in our lives who we can turn to, we can only expect so much from them by way of emotional support. A therapist fills in that gap ‚Äî their entire job is to help you identify and work toward your emotional goals, whatever they may be.

For those interested in giving talk therapy a try, I previously wrote up a list of¬†[low-cost and free therapy resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1h4l4tp/how_to_care_for_your_mental_health_and_have_your/).

**3. Practice gratitude**

With so much physical and emotional pain tormenting us 24/7, it can be easy to focus on the darkness in our lives. That darkness exists and is valid, but there can be some light, too.

Practicing gratitude allows us to recognize the good and feel less weighed down by the bad. For example, you may have a family to take care of you, a place to live, a warm, cozy bed, nourishing meals, access to medical care, etc.¬†

Consider making a list of the things you‚Äôre grateful for or using a gratitude app to keep track of the positive things in your life. Over time, you may notice a mental shift where everyday stressors feel a little less upsetting.

**4. Optimize your physical space**

It's extremely hard to feel emotionally ok when your physical space is uncomfortable. I start to feel anxious as soon as my room gets the least bit messy. A clean and de-cluttered physical space can be so vital to one's mental health, but it can also be challenging to maintain when living with chronic pain.

A few strategies you can try include:

* Practicing minimalism to declutter possessions
* Having a family member, friend, or hired cleaning person help out
* Cleaning things up in small, manageable bits (can fit into a daily routine)

**5. Be kind to your physical appearance and hygiene**

Looking and feeling put together can have a dramatic effect on mood. We've all felt the difference in how we interact with others when we feel gross vs. when we feel clean and polished. I find that it helps to keep my hair washed as much as possible and wear clothes that are loose and comfy, but look nice and make me feel put together. I'm able to wash my hair every other day by leaning over the tub or sink and flipping my head over. This avoids having to wash my entire body at one time.

In addition, I keep my body fresh and clean every day, even though I'm barely ever able to shower. I do this using skin-grade hypochlorous spray ‚Äî it works by killing bacteria on the skin to eliminate sweat and odors. Hypochlorous is a gentle, yet powerful solution that far outperforms baby wipes in supporting cleanliness. It's frequently recommended by dermatologists. For more info, check out my writeup on [what hypochlorous is and where to find it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1g7mkn4/how_to_get_clean_without_a_shower/).

**6. Grow relationships and do things for others**

Chronic illness can strip us of our humanity in the sense that we don't get the opportunity to make meaningful contributions into our relationships. Every aspect of our lives start to revolve around our treatment and care, leaving little space for us to branch out and offer care and support to others. Eventually, we end up becoming chronic ""recipients,"" if you will. Over time, that can wear down our sense of self, even leading to a crisis of identity as being a ""pain care recipient"" becomes our primary role.

Find things that you can do for the people you care about (within your limitations). That might mean being there to offer advice, painting them a picture, knitting them a blanket, watching a movie together

**7. Up your supplement game**

Taking supplements can help to improve pain symptoms, reduce inflammation and support calmness. Check with your doctor before adding any supplements to your regimen to ensure that they don‚Äôt interact with your medications.

As an example, here are the supplements I currently take and what I take them for:

|Supplement Name|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
||
|R-alpha lipoic acid|Suppressing nerve pain, supporting blood sugar, enhancing cognition; R-ALA is considered to be more bioavailable than regular ALA. I take the Jarrow supplement. I consider them trustworthy since the pharmacies I used to work in would regularly order from them.|
|Acetyl l-carnitine|Enhancing cognition, fighting brain fog, boosting metabolism; I take Jarrow for this one too.|
|CoQ10|Reducing inflammation, suppressing nerve pain, supporting blood sugar, enhancing metabolism; I like the Doctor's Best one.|
|Nicotinamide Riboside / NMN|I previously¬†[wrote up a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1drq8cv/found_a_supplement_that_may_be_helping_my_nerve/) about using this supplement for nerve pain; I like Basis and Signal by Elysium Health.|
|Fish oil|Reduce inflammation, improve heart health, enhance cognition and memory|
|Multivitamin|Avoid deficiencies like low vitamin D and iron|
|Hyaluronic acid|Reduce inflammation and cushion joints, supports glowing skin as well; I like Jarrow|
|Docusate|Avoid getting constipated. Works alongside a laxative or Rx therapy to ""soften things up,"" so that those therapies can work better. I take 250-500 mg/day.|
|Probiotic|Support digestion and blood sugar; I like Glucose Control by Pendulum|
|Collagen|Reduce joint pain and inflammation|

**8. If lifestyle adjustments aren‚Äôt helping enough, consider researching medical options**

Sometimes, even the most meaningful lifestyle changes aren't helpful enough to work through depression. In that case, consider talking to a doctor.¬†[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1h4l4tp/how_to_care_for_your_mental_health_and_have_your/)¬†lists online services that provide low-cost medical mental health evaluations and medication management. A few of the most common depression treatments include:

**Modafinil / Armodafinil**¬†\- This option is a personal favorite of mine because it can be safely combined with other medications (i.e. opioids). Modafinil and armodafinil are mild stimulants that up-regulate dopamine to reduce chronic fatigue while enhancing mood and cognition. Either of them may be a viable option for those avoiding SSRIs/SNRIs.

**SNRIs**¬†\- These medications play a dual role in both blocking pain signals from reaching the brain and treating different types of depression. The most commonly prescribed is Cymbalta (duloxetine). More recently, Savella (milnacipran) has emerged and is more commonly associated with weight loss compared to others that can sometimes cause weight gain. Effexor (venlafaxine) and Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) are also commonly prescribed SNRIs.

**SSRIs**¬†\- Common examples include Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Celexa (citalopram). these are what most people think of as typical antidepressants.

**Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**¬†\- Common examples include amitriptyline and nortriptyline. These medications are used to treat chronic nerve pain as well as depression.

(Please not that this is not an exhaustive list of all antidepressant therapies. Talk with your doctor if you're interested in exploring options.)

**9. Consider trying out part-time remote work (if able)**

Earning money feels good. It can offer a greater sense of control over our lives and more discretionary income to spend on things we want and need. For many of us, this may be a long-term goal to work our way up to. For some of us, it's simply not an option (and that's ok). Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like advice finding a remote job. I transitioned to remote work 8 years ago and have accumulated over 12 years experience working in the software space. To me, my job is a good distraction from pain and helps me stick to a routine. It has also allowed me to meet a lot of new friends, grow a career path, and find a renewed sense of purpose.

I hope that these ideas have been informative and helpful. Please bear in mind that some things on this list represent my personal experience and may not be relevant to everyone who reads this. For medical advice, always reach out to your doctor.

So I put together a list of some of my favorite places to eat that are walkable from Metro rail stations (max ~15 min walk). If a station or neighborhood has more than one of a certain type of food, I tried to limit it to my favorite. Stores with locations at multiple stations are listed for each station, but only described in their first appearance.

These are only the places that I've been to, which is not a comprehensive coverage of the entire system. My list is also biased towards Asian food since that's what I like to eat most, but I'd love to hear new recommendations! 

**A Line**

Lake

‚Ä¢ El Metate (Mexican) - extremely generous portions and tasty!

‚Ä¢ Aikan Sushi & Ramen (Japanese) - their weekday all you can eat is an incredible deal for the price and quality of food

Memorial Park
‚Ä¢ Bodegon No. 69 (Peruvian) - lots of unique dishes and flavors, love their ceviche

‚Ä¢ Salt & Straw (ice cream) - one of my favorite ice cream joints, has some truly original flavors (also at Little Tokyo/Arts Dist and Culver City)

‚Ä¢ Sunright (boba) - one of my favorite boba places, much higher tea to milk ratio if you like your boba to have a stronger tea flavor (also at Little Tokyo and Expo/Sepulveda)

‚Ä¢ Noodle Street (Chinese) - a good fix for the kinds of noodles you'd find in Chinese hole-in-the-walls

Fillmore

‚Ä¢ Howlin' Rays (Nashville fried chicken) - the best in LA (also at Chinatown)

South Pasadena

‚Ä¢ TeaMorrow (boba) - the T-Rex holding a boba cup logo that they have is so cute! Plus I love their snacks, like popcorn chicken

Highland Park

‚Ä¢ Rosty Peruvian Food (Peruvian) - best Peruvian food I've had in LA, have tried some very excitingly unique flavors. Some highlights like their Chinese-Peruvian dishes like arroz chaufa

‚Ä¢ Mendocino Farms - wouldn't usually have put a chain sandwich shop on this list but their stuff is consistently good and they have some unique flavors (also at Bunker Hill and Culver City)

Chinatown

‚Ä¢ Steep LA (American Chinese fusion) - Teahouse with great vibes and really nice small plates like the lu rou fan and Sichuan pepper popcorn, but they are known for their tea+spirits mixes

‚Ä¢ Pho Saigon Republic (Vietnamese) - sadly the only pho place good enough+transit accessible enough to make this list

‚Ä¢ LaSorted's Pizzeria (pizza) - I actually like their wings more

‚Ä¢ Lasita (Filipino) - must try their rotisserie chicken

‚Ä¢ Qin West (Chinese) - Chinese street food, recommend liangpi and beef noodles

‚Ä¢ Amboy (Burgers)

1hpws1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1hpws1q/mild_tennitus/,Mild Tennitus,"Hello everyone,


I joined r/tinnitus to learn more about tinnitus and hear the success stories of others.

I've had mild tinnitus since 2021. I believe it is caused by acid reflux but I just do not know. I only have it in my left ear. I am fortunate that my tinnitus is only mild and does not hamper me in social situations or from enjoying life at all.

Although it's mild and has remained mild for years, it still makes me anxious that it may get worse. 

Here are some of the things I am doing to try and improve my, possibly acid reflux cuased tinnitus, if that is even possible:


- Stating today I am cutting out coffee

- Taking Vitamin D, as I was told I have a deficiency years ago

- Wearing a mouthguard when I sleep as I clench my jaw when I sleep

- Continuing to avoid taking Pepto Bismal


In the past my tinnitus got louder for a short time. I believe this was related to diet and possibly me taking Pepto Bismal frequently. 


Today I am trying to focus on all that I am grateful for in my life as it makes my tinnitus feel like less of an issue.

I woke in my flat, gasping for air, my heart racing like it would tear out of my chest. The world was quiet again, but the silence felt wrong - heavy, like the moments before a storm.

The watch was still in my hand, its casing warm against my palm, and I realized I‚Äôd dropped to the floor. The creatures were gone, but I knew better than to think they had left me alone.

They were always there now, just out of sight, waiting for their moment.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

Instead, I sat at the kitchen table, the watch in front of me, and thought about everything that had happened. The old man‚Äôs words echoed in my mind: ‚ÄúWind it wisely.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt listened. I‚Äôd treated the watch like a toy, a shortcut to fix my mistakes and make my life easier. But the creatures - the Timekeepers, as I began to think of them - were proof that nothing came without a cost.

They were bound to the watch somehow, drawn to it every time I rewound time. And each time, they became stronger, more real.

They weren‚Äôt going to stop. Not until they had me.

The next day, I tried to get rid of the watch.

I threw it in the Thames first, watching the silver casing disappear beneath the murky water. For a moment, I felt a flicker of relief, like I‚Äôd finally freed myself from its grip.

But when I got back to my flat, the watch was on the coffee table, exactly where I‚Äôd left it.

I tried smashing it with a hammer, but the metal didn‚Äôt even dent. I tried setting it on fire, but the flames left it untouched. No matter what I did, the watch wouldn‚Äôt be destroyed - and I couldn‚Äôt escape it.

By the end of the day, I was exhausted, my mind fraying at the edges. The creatures had started appearing more frequently, their whispers filling the flat even when I wasn‚Äôt using the watch. I could feel them watching me, their burning eyes just out of sight.

I was running out of time.

The dreams became worse, darker.

I saw myself surrounded by the creatures, their skeletal hands gripping my arms and legs, pulling me into the shadows. Their laughter echoed in my ears, mocking me, as their glowing eyes burned brighter.

I woke up screaming more than once, drenched in sweat and trembling.

I had to find a way to stop this.

Desperation drove me back to Camden Market.

It was raining, the streets slick with water and glistening under the faint glow of the streetlights. I hurried through the market, my coat pulled tight against the cold, searching for the old man‚Äôs stall.

But it wasn‚Äôt there.

I wandered for hours, calling out for him, ignoring the strange looks from the other vendors. My voice grew hoarse, my legs aching, but I didn‚Äôt stop.

Finally, I collapsed onto a bench, the rain soaking through my clothes. The watch was still in my pocket, its weight a constant reminder of my failure.

I closed my eyes, letting the rain wash over me, and whispered, ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù

The answer came that night.

I was sitting in the dark, staring at the watch, when I felt it.

The air grew cold, and the whispers began, low and guttural, filling the room. The shadows lengthened, stretching across the walls, and I knew they were here.

The creatures emerged slowly, their gaunt forms flickering in and out of existence. There were four of them now, their glowing eyes locked onto me.

I stood, my back pressed against the wall, clutching the watch like a lifeline.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I shouted.

The largest of the creatures stepped forward, its head tilting in that unnatural, jerky motion. Its whispers grew louder, more distinct, until I could finally make out the words.

‚ÄúTime‚Ä¶ is ours.‚Äù

I shook my head, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou took‚Ä¶ what is not yours,‚Äù it hissed. Its voice was like nails on a chalkboard, grating and sharp. ‚ÄúThe Timekeeper‚Äôs Watch belongs to us. You‚Ä¶ are the thief.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was!‚Äù

The creature‚Äôs laughter filled the room, joined by the others. Their voices overlapped, creating a cacophony that made my head throb.

‚ÄúYou cannot undo what has been done,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúBut you can choose‚Ä¶ how it ends.‚Äù

I realized then what I had to do.

The watch wasn‚Äôt just a tool - it was a tether, binding me to the Timekeepers. As long as I held onto it, they would never leave me alone.

But giving it back wasn‚Äôt enough.

I had to break the cycle.

I stood in the middle of my flat, the watch in one hand and a lighter in the other. The Timekeepers surrounded me, their forms flickering like shadows in a firelight.

They didn‚Äôt try to stop me. They just watched, their glowing eyes unblinking.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you take me,‚Äù I said, my voice steady despite the fear clawing at my chest.

The largest of the creatures stepped forward, its voice a low rumble. ‚ÄúBurn it‚Ä¶ and you burn with it.‚Äù

I hesitated.

The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. I understood what it was telling me: destroying the watch would cost me my life.

But I didn‚Äôt have a choice.

I flipped open the lighter, the flame dancing in the darkness, and held it to the watch.

The silver casing caught fire instantly, the flames burning bright and blue. Heat seared my hand, but I didn‚Äôt let go.

The Timekeepers howled, their voices rising in a deafening crescendo. The walls shook, the air crackled with energy, and the room was bathed in an unnatural light.

And then‚Ä¶

Darkness.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in Camden Market.

The rain had stopped, and the streets were empty. I looked down at my hands, expecting to see the watch, but it was gone.

The whispers were gone, too.

For the first time in weeks, the air felt still, the weight lifted from my chest.

I didn‚Äôt know if I was alive or dead, if this was real or some limbo I‚Äôd been cast into. But I felt‚Ä¶ free.

The Timekeeper‚Äôs Watch was no more.

And neither was I.

1hpwq6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1hpwq6j/what_jobscareer_opportunities_should_i_look_into/,What jobs/career opportunities should I look into after leaving my job of 4 years? ,"Hey all..  I am 29(M) and left the job I was at for the past 4 years back in August.  I was the director of a music school of about 400 students, with a staff of 70-80 teachers. I did the hiring, management, training, and development of the teachers who taught for us, as well as the signing up of new students, managing teachers' schedules, managing family accounts, and coordinating events for staff as well as recitals for the students each year. After I learned the ins and outs of the job the first year and a half or so, I experienced a slow decline in my general interest, motivation, and performance with the job.  I found that I was as good as anybody when it came to the sales aspect of what I did (signing up new students for music lessons) but the ongoing management, training, and diagnosing of any issues with the teachers on my staff was exhausting and it always seemed that no matter what I did, I couldn't do what needed to be done to promote good student retention in my market.  After 4 years and declining school numbers, I felt like a hamster on a wheel who was always preoccupied with anxiety and stress about my job. Looking back, the fact that I worked fully remote, had considerable upside in earning potential, and could make my own schedule kept me there much longer than I should have stayed.

It has now been 4 months since I left that job and I am realizing how burnt out, overwhelmed, and lost I still feel. When I think about what I want to do next, it is really hard for me to conceptualize what I want.  For context, I graduated from college with a Bachelor's in Finance in 2017 and decided pretty quickly that I wasn't interested in doing anything in finance so I waited tables, contacted in music (I play the drums), got my real estate license and dabbled in that for a couple of years before I got the job I just left. I feel as though that job exposed a lot of ADHD tendencies that were largely masked for me in high school and college.  I was always an excellent test taker who pulled good grades out but the lack of structure, consistency, and tendency to delay in making decisions really ate me alive the past 4 years.  I know I learned a lot despite my decision to step away and I have always had a great work ethic but my self confidence has plummeted and I get very overwhelmed when I try to look up jobs online and figure out my next move.  In the meantime, I have been working as a barista and bartender for corporate events and I really enjoy it but I am needing something with a little more structure and consistency. I do love food, cooking, hospitality, coffee, sales (if it is something that interests me or I can get behind).  I have dreams of running a coffee shop, restaurant, or bar where I can serve people and create an environment that is really enjoyable to be in but I don't think I am in the headspace or stage of life where I can do something entrepreneurial for now.

I know the next job I take doesn't have to be THE job or even involve something I'm passionate about but some perspective and insight into what opportunities are out there would be really helpful and greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1,1735590757.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

The shadows and whispers were unnerving, but I convinced myself they weren‚Äôt real. Stress, exhaustion, maybe even guilt - it could all explain the strange sensations. But that didn‚Äôt stop me from using the watch.

At first, it was small things: fixing a mistake in an email, erasing an awkward encounter, or undoing a burnt meal. Each rewind came with that familiar lurch, the twisting of reality, and the disorienting rush of sound and color.

But the more I used the watch, the more I began to notice‚Ä¶ changes.

It was a Thursday afternoon when I first saw one of them clearly.

I had just rewound time after spilling coffee all over my desk. The moment I reset, I felt it - a weight in the room, oppressive and suffocating. The air grew cold, and the faint rustling sound that had haunted me for days became louder, more distinct.

I turned slowly, my heart hammering in my chest.

Standing in the doorway of my kitchen was a figure.

It was impossibly tall, its head nearly brushing the ceiling, with limbs that were too long and too thin. Its skin was ashen, stretched tight over jagged bones, and its eyes‚Ä¶ God, its eyes. They glowed like embers, flickering faintly in the dim light.

It didn‚Äôt move. It just stood there, staring at me with those burning eyes.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My mind screamed at me to run, but my body refused to move. The thing tilted its head, its movements jerky and unnatural, as if it wasn‚Äôt used to being in this world.

And then it stepped forward.

The floor creaked under its weight, and I swear I heard a faint whisper - words I couldn‚Äôt understand, but that filled me with a deep, primal terror.

I fumbled for the watch, my hands trembling. My fingers found the winding knob, and I twisted it desperately.

The world shifted.

When I opened my eyes, I was back at my desk. The coffee cup was upright, its contents undisturbed. The oppressive weight was gone, and the air felt normal again.

But I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I could feel it, lingering just out of sight. The whispering was fainter now, but it hadn‚Äôt disappeared entirely.

That was the first time I understood the cost of the watch.

The creatures became more frequent after that.

They didn‚Äôt always appear immediately after I rewound time, but they were never far away. Sometimes, I would catch a glimpse of them in the corner of my vision - a flicker of movement, a shadow that shouldn‚Äôt exist. Other times, I would hear them: the faint rustling, the low whispers that seemed to echo in my mind.

And they were getting closer.

One night, I woke to the sound of breathing. It was deep and ragged, coming from somewhere in the room. I bolted upright, my heart pounding, and reached for the lamp on my bedside table.

The light flickered on, and I saw it.

The creature was crouched in the corner of my bedroom, its long limbs folded awkwardly, its glowing eyes fixed on me.

I grabbed the watch, winding it without hesitation.

The room dissolved into a blur, and when I returned, it was empty. But I could still feel its presence, like a cold hand pressed against my back.

The more I used the watch, the stronger they became.

They were no longer content to linger in the shadows. They started to interact with the world - knocking over objects, scratching faint marks into the walls, leaving behind a faint, acrid smell.

One evening, I rewound time to avoid a fight with a friend. When I returned, I found claw marks raked across my living room wall, deep grooves that hadn‚Äôt been there before.

The whispers grew louder, too. They weren‚Äôt just faint murmurs anymore - they were words, harsh and guttural, spoken in a language I couldn‚Äôt understand. But I didn‚Äôt need to understand to know they were directed at me.

I tried to stop using the watch, but it wasn‚Äôt that simple. It had become an addiction, a crutch I couldn‚Äôt let go of. Every time I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt use it again, something would happen - a mistake, an accident, a regret - and I would wind the knob without thinking.

And every time I did, the creatures grew bolder.

I began to notice other changes, too - changes in myself.

My reflection in the mirror didn‚Äôt look right. My skin was pale, almost translucent, and there were dark circles under my eyes that didn‚Äôt go away no matter how much I slept. My hands trembled constantly, and I felt a gnawing anxiety that never left me.

And then there were the dreams.

I dreamed of the creatures every night, their glowing eyes watching me from the darkness. In the dreams, they spoke to me, their guttural voices echoing in my mind. I never understood the words, but the meaning was clear: they were waiting.

Waiting for what, I didn‚Äôt know.

One day, I decided to test the limits of the watch.

I wanted to know if there was a way to use it without drawing the creatures‚Äô attention. I planned carefully, making sure I had everything I needed.

At exactly 10:00 AM, I wound the watch.

The world shifted, and I found myself back at 10:00 PM the previous night. For a moment, everything seemed normal. The air was calm, the room quiet.

But then I heard it.

A low growl, deep and menacing, echoed through the flat.

I turned slowly, and my blood ran cold.

The creature was there, standing in the corner, its burning eyes fixed on me. But this time, it wasn‚Äôt alone.

Two more figures stood behind it, their gaunt forms blending into the shadows. Their eyes glowed the same fiery orange, and their whispers filled the room, overlapping and chaotic.

I backed away, my hand clutching the watch. The whispers grew louder, and I realized they weren‚Äôt just speaking - they were laughing.

With shaking hands, I wound the watch again.

The creatures lunged.

I wanted to say something but of course I looked like a man so I didn't want to confuse him.

1hpwpa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomBadge/comments/1hpwpa2/the_timekeepers_watch_chapter_two_the_first_rewind/,The Timekeeper‚Äôs Watch - Chapter Two: The First Rewind,"
Back in my flat, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the watch. It sat on the coffee table where I‚Äôd placed it, catching the dim glow of the lamp. The silver casing was dull, its surface scratched and worn, but it seemed alive somehow - waiting.

I poured myself a cup of tea, then sat on the sofa, staring at it. The old man‚Äôs words echoed in my mind.

‚ÄúIt gives you time. Wind it, and you‚Äôll find yourself twelve hours in the past.‚Äù

It was ridiculous, of course. Time travel? Impossible. And yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd seen something in the old man‚Äôs eyes - a quiet certainty that unsettled me.

I picked up the watch. It was heavier than it looked, its cold metal pressing into my palm. The winding knob protruded slightly, like a dare.

What harm could it do?

My thumb hovered over the knob. A part of me felt foolish - like a child believing in magic. But curiosity gnawed at me, stronger than my doubts.

I twisted the knob.

The mechanism clicked, the sound sharp and clear, like the snap of a lock opening.

And then the world shifted.

It wasn‚Äôt like anything I‚Äôd ever experienced. It was as though reality had folded in on itself, a blur of colors and sounds rushing past me. My stomach churned, my head spun, and for a moment, I thought I might black out.

When the sensation stopped, I was standing in the middle of Camden Market.

The smell of roasted chestnuts and damp pavement hit me like a wave, sharp and real. The sound of vendors shouting their wares filled the air. I looked around, my heart pounding.

It was exactly as it had been earlier that day.

I fumbled for my phone, my hands shaking, and checked the time. It was 11:03 AM - the same time I‚Äôd been in the market twelve hours ago.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt possible,‚Äù I whispered.

But it was.

I retraced my steps, weaving through the bustling crowd, and found myself drawn to the corner where the old man‚Äôs stall had been. My breath caught in my throat.

There I was.

I stood frozen, watching myself approach the stall. It was surreal, like seeing a reflection in a mirror that didn‚Äôt belong to me. My other self handed over the forty pounds and took the watch, the transaction playing out exactly as I remembered.

The old man didn‚Äôt glance in my direction. It was as if I didn‚Äôt exist.

As I watched my past self leave, the world shifted again.

The sensation was just as disorienting as before - a blur of motion, a lurch in my stomach - and then I was back in my flat.

My tea sat on the coffee table, still warm. My phone was where I‚Äôd left it, the same screen open. But something felt‚Ä¶ different. The air seemed heavier, thicker somehow.

I looked down at the watch in my hand. It felt warm now, humming faintly, as if it had absorbed something. I set it down, staring at it like it might move on its own.

The next day, I tested it again.

I burned my breakfast, swearing under my breath as smoke filled the kitchen. The eggs were ruined, the toast blackened. Frustrated, I grabbed the watch and wound it.

The same sensation hit me - a rush of sound and color, the twist of reality folding in on itself. When it stopped, I was standing in my kitchen, the smell of burning gone. The eggs and toast were whole again, untouched.

I stared at the stove, the watch still clutched in my hand. Slowly, I cracked the eggs into the pan and watched them sizzle. Perfect.

It worked. It actually worked.

At first, I thought I‚Äôd struck gold.

The watch became my secret weapon, a way to fix mistakes and avoid consequences. Oversleeping? A quick wind, and I‚Äôd wake up on time. Awkward conversation? Rewind, and I could say the right thing. I felt invincible, like I had a cheat code for life.

But then‚Ä¶ things started to change.

The first time it happened, I was in the middle of my kitchen. I‚Äôd just rewound time after dropping a plate, the crash erased as if it had never happened. I bent down to pick up the plate, feeling smug, when I noticed something.

A shadow moved across the wall.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat.

It wasn‚Äôt the shadow of a person - too tall, too thin. It seemed to stretch unnaturally, flickering like a candle flame. I turned around, but there was nothing there.

‚ÄúJust my imagination,‚Äù I muttered, shaking my head.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

Over the next few days, the shadows appeared more often. Always in the corner of my vision, fleeting and insubstantial. At first, I tried to ignore them, telling myself it was just stress. Reliving time wasn‚Äôt natural - maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.

Then came the sounds.

Soft rustling noises, like fabric brushing against fabric. Sometimes a faint whisper, just on the edge of hearing. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but they made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

I told myself it was nothing. I wanted to believe it was nothing. But deep down, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right.

The watch was doing something to me.

1hpwlk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1hpwlk4/question_regarding_water_policy/,Question regarding water policy.,"Preemptive TLDR. I was told that due to a ‚Äúloosely enforced policy‚Äù I would have to pay $2.49 for each cup of water.

Long time Dutch Bros customer, first time complainer. Location Idaho.

I typically purchase the same thing everyday. 
- 1x small iced half caff americano
- 1x large black tea
- 1x small raspberry lemonade cut with soda
- 1x kid sized lemonade 
- 4x waters

Typical after tip I‚Äôm about $15-17 per visit.

Today I changed my usual order of four drinks and four waters to just one small iced half caff americano and the four waters and was informed that since I was only getting one paid drink, I could get one water free with my coffee. If I wanted more than one water I would have to pay full price for it. When I asked what they cost the associate informed me that they would be at the bottle water price of $2.49 a cup. When I asked when this started, since I have never experienced it before the associate informed me it is a ‚Äúloosely enforced policy‚Äù to only give a single water per drink, and that they were sorry but that‚Äôs just how it is.

I was definitely thrown off, but just paid for my coffee, my single water and drove away.

So here‚Äôs the question. Has any one else experienced or heard of this policy? Like‚Ä¶ is this a real thing? If so can DB not just charge a cup fee? If this is a real thing, then that equates to about $10 for less than a gallon of water.

I am driving back home to Calgary, Alberta, from Jan 1st to Jan 04. Google has given me these two options for possible routes home. I have a 2009 AWD Acura RDX and wonder if there are some good sights/restaurants/nature along the way. Especially at this time of year, should I floor it and head straight home?

I am moving, so I have some hiking gear but not my usual deep winter outfit. I also typically make as few pit stops as possible, but I find the Midwest states, or whatever you call them, to be gorgeous.   
  
Hikes  
I grew up near Banff, Alberta, so I would say 12-mile hikes with 3000ft of elevation are fine for me. I have already been to Bryce Canyon and Zion in the summer. Is it worth checking out in the winter? The Oregon Route might give me a chance to check out Sequioa and Yosemite but are they any good in the winter?

Food  
I will eat anything, but I usually default to Mediterranean, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese. I also love a good burger.

On a side note, I am not a big shopping kind of guy, but I hear the outlet malls around Vegas have unbelievable prices for good name brands. Is that true?",1,1735590178.0,roadtrip,0,1.0,False

so anyway, about me? I am 26, living in the UK but hopeful to move one day. I work for a very popular company that I cannot say the name of, but you'll have heard of them before. My primary passion in life has always been my work and I feel like it's time that shifted to someone else, so that's why I am here! maybe you'll be the lucky person! What am I looking for you ask? I have no idea, friends, lovers, haters, who knows. I'm a terrible flirt so apologies in advance.

I am an avid reader, my bookcase is full of books i've yet to read and a lot of I have read and cannot come to terms with giving away. If I am not reading I will likely be sat under a blanket somewhere in my house playing video games. As with most people on Reddit, I am indeed a huge nerd. I love to code & paint too! I am really just spraying my thoughts onto this right now, there is only so much you can say about yourself without writing a life story.

As for other things I like to do:

Stumble into things, I am very clumsy. Drink an ungodly amount of coffee, listen to music far too loud on my headphones, order too much food for myself and regret it later, pretend like I understand politics, suck at boardgames and sing karaoke.

1hpwglu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1hpwglu/excellence_el_carmen_review/,Excellence El Carmen Review,"I read a ton of reviews prior to our trip and the bad ones really stressed me out after I had booked, so thought I'd share my mostly positive review!

Stayed 4 nights, December 25-29

***Rooms:*** 7.5/10. It's true that the rooms are showing their age. General wear and tear and generally need a deep clean, but the surfaces, bed, and towels were clean with no issues. Bed was a little firm but fine. I was worried about dampness but had no issue (building 8B) and AC was great. The only annoyance with the room that impacted our trip was that you could hear the nighttime performances and they were LOUD. My husband and I are not night owls so it was annoying to hear until 11pm, but the resort goes completely quiet after that so it wasn't a huge deal. If you plan to attend all of the shows or are a heavy sleeper (I am not) this probably won't be an issue for others.

***Food***: Maybe 8/10? I was very pleasantly surprised based on prior reviews and had been really worried about getting sick. We had the **Kitchen Table** (buffet) every morning and stuck to basic foods - veggie omelets, toast, fruits with peels, etc.  Would grab lunch from the food trucks or the pizzas they'd pass out - decent, nothing to write home about. Ate dinner at **Basmati** and thought it was good! Husband had one bad bite of chicken but no issue. **Lobster House** \- some items were great (crab cakes, pasta) and some lukewarm and underwhelming (lobster bisque, salmon and roasted veggies). **Sports bar** \- cheese sticks, chicken fingers, bar food all fine. **Hibachi at Spice** \- this was probably our best meal as it was obviously freshly cooked and hot. Loved the fried rice and veggies! Need a reservation. **Aroma** \- Found a coffee drink I liked and stuck with that (iced coffee with almond milk, their menu drinks were too sweet/artificial tasting). Ice cream was very sweet and not that good, but had some other grab and go desserts if you want something sweet after dinner. I have a sensitive stomach and had honestly no issues. Stick to hot food that's made to order, nothing raw or rare, no salads or fruits without peels, bottled water, and you should be fine. I'm wondering if people who get sick are drinking a lot, reacting to too much sun, eating foods they generally never eat, or eating raw/rare food that's upsetting their stomachs. I was STRESSED and packed a small drugstore of meds but never needed any!

***Drinks***: 6/10. My husband doesn't really drink so I didn't drink a ton, but the drinks were not great so I didn't feel like I was missing out. Mixed drinks/cocktails were very sweet and felt like they had almost no alcohol. We rented a beach cabana one day and it came with a bottle of sparkling wine that was not good. Best drinks I had were well-poured gin & tonics at the sports bar, but I honestly did not feel like I was drinking alcohol at any point. 

***Service***: 5/10. Most servers' energy felt a bit lackluster or like they didn't want to be there, which is fine, but didn't feel super hospitable. Little things felt needlessly complicated, like confirming our cabana reservation or getting another blanket for the room. Best service was at hibachi and on the day we rented a cabana. Otherwise it was quite slow and/or awkward. 

  
***General notes:*** 

* If you aren't Excellence Club, rent a beach cabana for a day! Was amazing to be right by the ocean and came with a reflexology massage. Think it was $90 for the day - did not get an itemized receipt at checkout though, which I do not like, so I could be slightly off. 
* We weren't Excellence Club and didn't miss it other than wanting to use the little beds by the beach to stay out of the sun (hence the cabana rental).  Not sure it would have been worth it for that alone, though. 
* Spa - had a pretty good experience here, enjoyed the hydrotherapy and they put a really cute decoration of our names in our couple's massage room. Probably not worth the price but we were happy to treat ourselves.
* Bring bug spray! We sat outside playing cards one evening and I got eaten alive. 
* On that note, bring anything you think you might need - gift shop was not that well-stocked (no Benadryl, for example, which I wanted for my itchy bug bites) and very expensive. You need tons of sunscreen, and you may need advil, immodium, benadryl, pepto, anything else you may want. Was glad to have packed towel clips, a sunshirt, multiple books, a card game, a white noise machine, and a bag of Damprid for the room. Did not bring tumblers and metal straws and wished I had.

Would we return? Maybe! I've been to other AIs in Puerto Vallarta and Cancun and found this one comparable. We discussed going back with my family for Christmas one year or maybe a friend group. I'd be open to EEC if the price was right and if I found a better flight itinerary (our travel days sucked) but would also be open to trying somewhere else. 

To conclude - I was really worried beforehand and had an overall positive experience. Take reviews with a grain of salt, be mindful of what you're eating, pack to prepare for any issues, and you'll be fine! ",5,1735590074.0,PuntaCana,0,1.0,False

Basically, I've seen posts flying around for some time (and have contributed some comments myself), expressing frustrations about the Lucanis/Rook romance. And I wanted to offer some positivity on the subject.

**(Important note: I will be using screenshots to showcase the majority of dialogue in this post, thanks to character limits. I hope they show up properly!)**

I understand the complaints! I was upset and baffled on my first playthrough, to the point that I nearly gave up on the Lucanis romance altogether. But I stuck it out and ended the game feeling surprisingly content with my decision! However, it wasn't until my second playthrough, where I romanced Lucanis again, that I really fell in love with him and gained an appreciation for what his romance actually gives us. Of course I wish for more content, and I'm still baffled by some of the decisions that were made, but I thought I‚Äôd take a moment to shine a light on his romance and give it a deeper dive. Because I think once you *really* look into what's there, it feels a lot stronger and more romantic than initial impressions.¬†

So, I hope this rambling post might offer a different perspective to anyone who might be feeling really down about his romance. And if not, then I hope it's at least a place of celebration for those who love Lucanis and his route. Because I truly feel Lucanis/Rook is a special pairing (and far stronger than Lucanis/Neve) and it sucks to see it be viewed so negatively.¬†This post is in no way meant to be dismissive of issues or negative feelings; I just wanted to be positive (for a change lmao) about something I really like.

Am I delusional? Or downright coping? Possibly. ü§° But I‚Äôm genuine in my feelings!

First note: I feel like Rook is canonically dogged and determined no matter their origin or personality. *‚ÄúTends to think in straight lines""* from Varric could be seen as a sign of recklessness and determination. And Spite is (was?) a spirit of determination. Now, I'm not saying Neve, a detective, isn't determined. She is. But she's much more calm and collected, getting stuck on questions and answers, while Rook is all about action. Rook doesn't give up. **So** **It would make sense that Spite isn't only interested in Rook because they're the leader, but also because Rook's nature seems very similar to Spite's when he was purely Determination. It's** ***also*** **worth noting that Lucanis himself is determined, so... there's a common thread here that naturally connects them.**

Second note: can I also mention that *Rook* is a form of crow? So, really... *Antivan Crow Rook and Lucanis are soulmates.* I SAID WHAT I SAID LMAO

Third note: I won't quote the first meeting between Rook and Lucanis because there's obviously nothing romantic about it. However, I did want to shout the scene out because it‚Äôs one of my favorites. I love how they connect so easily right off the bat!

So, with that preamble out of the way, let‚Äôs start looking at some important moments and dialogue.

**In the beginning of Act 1,** Lucanis seems receptive to Rook's flirtations, just as he is with Neve. Because at this point, it doesn't mean anything. It's fun, flirty banter. The first heart option you can choose (iirc) isn't even flirtatious‚Äìit's Rook worrying about Lucanis, which he easily brushes off because he DOES NOT want anyone knowing how bad it really is for him.

I remember Rook also flirting by calling him a courageous man, and while he initially tries to wave it away by saying he's just stubborn, he still seems genuinely pleased with Rook's compliment and takes it to heart.

**The first legitimate instance of flirting, imo, is the Cafe Scene.** I've seen many people say that Rook and Lucanis don't really have chemistry, but I disagree! (The following dialogue is with my Crow Rook.)

https://preview.redd.it/6gn3xuyqn1ae1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=439ebded82351140336536af701f00c8070d1fbc

Rook is very obviously flirting here, compared to some of the prior heart options, which felt more like concern or admiration. *This is blatant.* And Lucanis seems not only *receptive*, but like he's toeing the line of flirting back! He didn't have to ask how Rook would describe first kisses, he could've changed the subject. But he leans into it. Also, the way he chuckled when My Rook said she needed a refresher was... something üëÄ. Chemistry is already present. As is immediate support! It's a great establishing scene for them and their future blooming romance.

And then there's his strange reaction to Teia ""flirting"" with Rook when arriving to help with funeral preparations.

>R: If there's anything I can do, just say the word.

>T: You're alwas such a dear. You certainly didn't learn that from Viago.

>L: Teia, don't flirt with my... colleague.

>T: Jealous? Fine. To business, then.

Hello?? What's *that* about? It feels even more telling when Rook is a Crow because Rook is part of Viago's house and is friends with Teia to begin with. So they have their own bond that doesn't involve Lucanis. Yet, Lucanis doesn't like Teia ""flirting"" with his ""colleague,"" while he has no problem ""flirting"" with Neve. Is he simply being hypocritical? *Or is there a purposeful divide in how he sees flirtation?*

But these Act 1 moments are a nice foundation for the future. Sadly, it takes a very long time to actually go anywhere.

**The issues begin after you make the choice to save Minrathous or Treviso, imo.** Obviously you have to pick Treviso if you want to romance him, which I personally have no problem with. (Although, I *do* think an exception should have been made for a Shadow Dragon Rook. Lucanis would've likely been more understanding of SD Rook choosing to save their home, and should have been Hardened but open to romance in that specific instance. But I digress.) Lucanis makes it clear he doesn't have much in life; his family and his city are immensely important to him. Rook and Lucanis simply can't have the same kind of bond if you pick Minrathous as they do when you pick Treviso. I get it. *But even when you DO save Treviso, there seems to be a noticeable shift in his behavior.*

I think having this big dilemma, where both cities are under attack and one *will* get destroyed/blighted, is the first time Lucanis realizes just how bad this whole situation is. Before that, he talked about how he was looking forward to stabbing a god or two in the back. He just wanted to work. Like he didn't fully appreciate the gravity of what he was getting involved in. But now shit is real. Look how panicked he gets later at Weisshaupt. He wasn't as ready for this as he thought, but he HAS to help; he owes Rook, for one, and he also won't refuse Caterina's contract. So when you save Treviso over Minrathous, Lucanis is eternally grateful *and comes to see Rook as someone he can rely on above all others,* but that doesn't make everything okay. He CLEARLY feels guilty about what Neve is going through. He advocated for saving his city at the cost of hers and Rook choosing Treviso (which is also my Crow Rook's home) means that Neve's home got the worst of it‚Äì*of course* Lucanis feels like shit and wants to make it up to her. I'm not saying the interest he has in Neve at this point is driven solely by guilt, but I think it plays a role.

The aftermath of these cities getting attacked is when Lucanis seems to block Rook's flirting/interest, despite previously being receptive to it. While this entire post is going to focus on Rook/Luanis, because that's all I care about, there are a few things with Neve I have to address.

**I think the shift in his behavior is because Lucanis has already formed a bond with Rook and he becomes afraid of it going beyond that once he's gotten a reality check.** *Whereas with Neve, it's not really serious* (not saying it wouldn't get serious, it's just a different dynamic to what he has and will have with Rook). There's no pressure with Neve. It's black and white. With Rook, it's muddled and colored in all sorts of different shades. Rook can flirt with Lucanis several times after the city choice but is routinely ignored. To me, this is because it isn't *just* flirty banter anymore; the things Rook says when ""flirting"" are more personal and meaningful, so it's obviously going in a direction Lucanis sees as a bad idea. Rook makes it clear they have an interest in Lucanis, and Lucanis doesn't respond because that would only encourage Rook's interest (and his own). He can't let that happen. *Why?*

There are multiple lines where he indicates, in some form, that he doesn't believe he's good enough for Rook. he doesn't know what Rook sees in him‚Äìa problem he doesn't seem to have when pursuing Neve. I think this goes to show how different the relationships are, **and how different Lucanis himself perceives them to be.**

Lucanis/Neve might have more flirty dialogue than Lucanis/Rook, but I personally see the relationships as opposites of each other. The Neve/Lucanis stuff feels far more surface-level to me. It's physical attraction and uncomplicated interactions mixed with trauma bonding. He can hide the worst parts of himself, he can exist as he is, in his doom, because Neve is in the same boat. She's already naturally cynical and is much less likely to pry when he claims to be fine. They exist on the same level. It's simple. Relaxed. Clear.

On the other hand, Rook/Lucanis feels a lot deeper from the jump. Lucanis sees some of himself in Rook, of course‚Äìespecially if Rook is also a Crow, and I already mentioned the shared thread of determination‚Äìbut Lucanis also views Rook as someone *on a different level*. Hence why he doesn't think he's good enough. They have an almost instinctual bond that only grows stronger after saving Treviso, even as Lucanis pulls away from Rook's affection. Their interactions are easy, yet far more complex. There's nothing simple about Rook's heart dialogue options. I struggle to even call it flirting sometimes because it‚Äôs hardly ever casual. **There's something about Rook that Lucanis holds in high esteem. That he views as** ***more,*** **all while trying to make it** ***less***\*\*.\*\* Lucanis trusts and connects with Rook more than anyone else; Romanced Lucanis doesn't simply *exist as he is* with Rook. He seeks to better himself. To be good enough for Rook, who is his light in the darkness. The potential of something more with Rook isn't relaxed, clear, or simple; it's intense, blinding, and confusing.

I'm not trying to imply Neve would be a fling, but honestly... if Rook doesn't get with Lucanis, I don't see anything with him and Neve lasting very long. That‚Äôs my personal opinion. It seems like their relationship would eventually fizzle out. Neve is tied to Dock Town, Lucanis is tied to Treviso. I think they would put other responsibilities above each other. Whereas with Rook, even one who isn't a Crow, I genuinely think they'd both be *determined* to make it work. Based on how their romance plays out and how devoted they are to each other in the end, this really seems like a lifelong commitment.

And I think Rook/Lucanis is quite romantic. It doesn't just *happen*. It's a push-and-pull situation. He runs from his feelings for Rook‚Äìnot toward them, like with Neve‚Äìbecause he's *afraid* of those feelings and what they mean. They indicate a future he can't even bring himself to dream of. It's not a simple 'let's see where this goes' deal with Rook. And I think he gets a sense of that early on and that's why he closes himself off once shit hits the fan. He's a broken mess of a man, an abomination, who happens to be dealing with a *lot* all at once. There isn't room for fun, aimless flirting with Rook *when Rook's flirting is often far deeper than that.*

His romance reads much better on a second playthrough.

**So the start of Act 2 is when you really begin to see the aftermath of the Minrathous/Treviso situation.**

https://preview.redd.it/xo4of3lxn1ae1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fa3de5b65d11569fa8e9432720ea58f35ac35a0

Lucanis doesn't want concern from Rook. He wants anger. He's punishing himself and doesn't know how to face Rook's soft understanding because he doesn't think he deserves it.¬†

This is the beginning of what his romance in Act 2 is like. The push-and-pull. He's hard on himself, but Rook is there for him consistently, making it clear they care for him and that he's more than what he can offer. *And that scares him.*

There are about 3 scenes after this where Rook can choose heart options, but Lucanis ignores Rook‚Äôs advances. One of these exchanges (the most important of the 3) starts like this:

>R: You're awake.

>L: Yes. I've been trying to figure out what to say to you. And... there aren't words enough to apologize. I never wanted you to see me like that.

>R: And yet, I'm still here.

>L: We need to talk about Illario.

Anytime Rook expresses concern or interest, Lucanis swerves, Which is incredibly frustrating and, on a first playthrough, makes it seem like you're pushing for something that isn't there. But based on later dialogue, he's doing this deliberately. *He doesn't want Rook to want him, because he doesn't want to want Rook.* He's constantly fighting against Spite, who can be violent when he doesn't get his way. What if Rook did something Spite didn't like? Lucanis might not be able to stop him from lashing out. He doesn't want to put the people he cares for in danger‚Äìand that very much includes Rook. (Not saying he doesn't care about Neve, *but Spite doesn't seem to have much interest where that's concerned, so it's less dangerous. Less of a gamble.*)

**Some of the moments I previously mentioned don't have much in the way of romance on their own since Lucanis doesn't take the bait, but they definitely contribute and build to one of his best romantic scenes in the game:** ***the ""almost kiss.""***

https://preview.redd.it/mtxbbkw1o1ae1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=611a42478b009cdb9bb5cb310de1a8260726d030

https://preview.redd.it/j3zrehb4o1ae1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c87f62403bf679307fa37cdb7e2f789e9911b8

This single scene is PACKED with content and it‚Äôs a big reason I continued pursuing Lucanis on that first run.¬†

Spite thinks Rook can *make* Lucanis do things because Lucanis always listens to Rook. Spite isn't desperate to talk to Neve; he doesn't think Neve will be able to get through to Lucanis. No, it's Rook. And not just because Rook is the leader, but because Rook and Lucanis have formed a special bond from the beginning that's only gotten stronger. Lucanis TRUSTS Rook, but he doesn't want to be a burden. Spite has no such qualms.¬†

And then you have Lucanis acknowledging that Rook does, in fact, get to him. Rook's care, affection, and concern always manages to break though his *""perfectly gathered clouds of doom.""* Which means:

1. He is aware of what Rook feels for him. And it impacts him more than he lets on.
2. He purposefully punishes himself by hiding in these ""clouds of doom"" and is fondly exasperated that Rook is basically a beacon of light who cuts through it all.¬†
3. He's admitting that Rook ""deserves better than to deal with my mess,"" which seems to indicate that he's thought about something brewing between the two of them and that he's been purposefully blocking it from progressing.

As we later learn during Inner Demons, he doesn't have much hope for the future. He views himself as a monster who should've stayed locked away, and as a failure who couldn't do the one thing he‚Äôs a master of. Rook doesn't see him as a monster OR as a tool. He's just Lucanis, someone Rook truly cares for. And Rook is telling Lucanis he's more than his struggles, while also explicitly indicating attraction to him, which causes Lucanis to finally break and very clearly *flirt back*.The way he swaggers over to Rook and leans against the wall, the way he gazes at Rook, the sound of his voice... And yet, Lucanis STILL tries to warn Rook away by outright saying this is a ""bad idea."" And once again, Rook doesn't care. Lucanis feels that pull to Rook and, in a moment of weakness, nearly gives in. **They almost kiss!** Then Lucanis gets cold feet and backs away. üíÄ

It's also important to note that this scene happens if you choose the dialogue option that states you are indicating *romantic interest* in Lucanis. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsimple flirting‚Äù anymore. He lets a piece of his own feelings out, as well. So all he can do is run away, and stumble over himself the next time Rook sees him. (*""Rook, if I could--I want--forgive me. I am not certain what I wish to say.""*)

**The next big thing is Inn+er Demons. This quest is** ***so*** **important. There's a ton to unpack.**

It starts with Teia and Viago informing Lucanis and Rook that Caterina's ring has been found, which means she's still alive and Illario has her locked away. Both Teia and Viago want Lucanis to make a decision about what to do, but he becomes so overwhelmed in the moment that he shuts down and locks himself away, giving Spite room to take over.¬†

>S: Help us.

>R: How? What do you need?

>S: He'll listen. He always listens to you. Come.

Again, Spite is very aware of how Lucanis views Rook at this point. Regardless of his own interest, he trusts Rook enough to reach out because Lucanis does. He knows and has stated previously that if Lucanis will listen to anyone, it's *Rook*‚Äìhis soft spot.

I‚Äôll skip some dialogue with Spite to get to the good part:

>R: Nobody's here.

>S: Of course not. Rook can't be here.

>R: Me? Why not?

>**S: You open doors. You don't close them.**

That... is REALLY interesting. I'm still trying to understand it fully, but right now, I‚Äôm viewing this line in a more romantic, less literal light.

* Rook gives Lucanis opportunity and hope. Rook doesn't close doors in his face, Rook opens them and keeps each entrance accessible. Lucanis can find a path forward with Rook's help, which is why he refuses it. Life is much easier when you're stuck and hiding away. Taking a chance on something, *trying* to live a life you don't even understand, is much harder. And scarier. Look at what he said earlier, about Rook breaking through his perfectly gathered clouds of doom. Now Rook is opening doors. So Rook is his sunlight. Rook is his key. However you look at it, Rook is incredibly important to him. That means a lot platonically, but it's also a major component in his romance.¬†

**Let's look at the ""locks"" in his mind-prison.**

Lucanis's idea of Caterina could represent *failure*. He believes she'd be disappointed with his return. She wanted her grandson back, not a demon. His version of Caterina questions whether or not Rook wants to ""release a demon."" That's all Lucanis sees himself as now. This lock takes the form of Caterina rejecting him because he believes he failed her.

Then there's his version of Harding, who seems to represent *danger*. She didn't trust him at the start because he‚Äôs an abomination. Lucanis doesn't trust Spite either, but he also doesn't trust himself.

https://preview.redd.it/mdjqrq38o1ae1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=5afb02d98faf97835cef244e192a36c51232cb6a

He's in pain. He doubts himself. He thinks he's a monster that can't be trusted, but Rook refuses to accept this view and challenges it, forcing Lucanis to find a way forward.¬†

Now, I won't lie: Neve manifesting in his mind-prison really pissed me off at first. But upon further reflection, I REALLY don't see how Neve being here is a positive thing? This place is hell for Lucanis. A nightmare. It's a prison of his own making, modeled after the one he was held in and experimented on. It's a punishment. And he only feels safe here because it's stagnant. He doesn't have to think about the future. He doesn't have to make decisions. He can just exist and wallow.

https://preview.redd.it/a2x948rao1ae1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=673271f3cf62503f34d092a836ca4eb989968cc4

This moment is relatively short, so it's harder to read, but I think Neve represents *guilt.* They commiserate because if it wasn't Neve getting screwed over, it would have been Lucanis. So Lucanis, who clearly feels guilty about Minrathous, relates to Neve, and she becomes *guilt* within his mind-prison.

He‚Äôs punishing himself and hiding from reality *because he feels guilty*\--over what he is now, what he can and cannot do, what he will not allow himself to face, what he will not allow himself to feel.¬†

It might seem like salt in the wound, having Neve so deep in his mind and not Rook, but I don't think so. **This manifestation of Neve is representing something NEGATIVE about himself, same as Caterina and Harding before, and Illario after. Rook not having a place in his prison** ***is a good thing.*** **Rook doesn‚Äôt represent a source of negativity for Lucanis; Rook** ***breaks through*** **the negativity.**

ALSO!!! It's during the Neve portion where you find a note that's very interesting. And I choose to view it in a romantic light because I can, so I will!

>***I didn't want you to see that. Again. (I am not this. I cannot be this.)***

Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I think it's rather important. ***This note directly references what he told Rook during the moment prior to when Rook can express romantic interest in him, which then leads to the big ""almost kiss"" scene.*** It expresses shame about Rook seeing him lose control, and yet the additional thought of *""I am not this. I cannot be this""* is actually one of the few times Lucanis shows a glimmer of *hope* for his future. *And it's on a note that references dialogue he said to Rook before a romantic moment*\--so, it's reasonable to believe his *hope* is tied to Rook.

**I'm just saying that Rook not being there as a natural part of his prison, but rather as an interloper brought in by Spite to help, shows how positively Lucanis views Rook. Plus, the note in Neve's area being a direct nod to Rook, while also showing a desire to be** ***more*** **than the demon, is very telling imo.**

Anyway, Illario is next and he has some interesting nuggets about Rook being *‚Äútoo good to be wasting your time in a place like this‚Äù* and how Rook‚Äôs got *‚Äúmuch more important things to worry about‚Äù* than Lucanis. Through Illario, this piece of Lucanis also talks about how turning Lucanis loose would only *‚Äúcause more grief‚Äù* and he also goes into how Caterina had 5 children and 8 grandchildren, with only Illario and Lucanis currently alive. House Dellamorte lost everything during the last war of succession‚ÄìLucanis is clearly afraid to lose what little he has left.

To me, Illario represents *grief.* This piece of Lucanis is trying one last time to convince Rook to leave him alone. Who he is now should stay locked away; releasing him will only cause problems\*.\* It's like he's mourning who he used to be by locking his current self away. But Rook is always going to have an answer to counter his worries and doubts. He doesn't know what Rook sees in him, as it's something he cannot see in himself, but Rook is able to get through to him.

Then you reach Lucanis and this moment is definitely a turning point for the romance. Here‚Äôs a big chunk. (I chose for Lucanis to focus on saving Caterina.)

https://preview.redd.it/figs5hdeo1ae1.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b58ae2bbea537a9229a51b734128c3f5d4bb410

https://preview.redd.it/zsfhlifgo1ae1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3fabc49ec5515fc1290e941a4139a2a8cadea56

Lucanis is initially frustrated that Rook has seen the mess of his mind, that Rook can read him like a book. He tries to fight it at first, but *gives in again*. Through Rook, Lucanis is able to see a hopeful future. He's able to stop fighting Spite and actually connect with him, because that's the only way forward. He CAN live as an abomination. It won't be easy, but it's not hopeless, and he can see that because *Rook never gives up on him.* Rook is his guiding light.¬†

He also just casually drops the *""You should go. It's better I stay here than risk losing you""* line. As if it's not a big deal! **He trusts and relies on Rook, because Rook has seen the worst of him and still refuses to turn away. Rook helped him find the hope he desperately needed. His walls finally crumble and he realizes he doesn't have to hide. He can take a chance with Rook in a meaningful way now, and finds himself ready to do so following the relief of Inner Demons.** Lucanis *does* want Rook as much as Rook wants him, he's just stuck and afraid. Once Lucanis and Spite become truly allied, Lucanis's whole mindset changes.

**After this, you can commit to Lucanis.** He's stopped fighting against Spite, deciding to work *with* him, making life much easier and *safer.* The connection he's had with Rook, the spark that's been slowly growing, is no longer something he fears, but rather something *he can let himself want*, something he's ready to explore.

Unfortunately, the lock-in scene is pretty lame. I'll always complain about it because this moment could have been *so* good. And it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ disappointing. But the more I analyze it, the more I can understand what they were attempting to convey (I think). I can't excuse the lack of actual romance here, but the dialogue is still important.

(I chose a sweet drink for My Rook.)

https://preview.redd.it/lqq997nio1ae1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ece938eca3774609cbfa52dce0fd55888d1a087

I'll admit, the first time I saw this scene‚Ä¶ I was pissed. This is supposed to be them committing to each other, but the only reason we know that is because the game‚Äìnot Lucanis or Rook‚Äìtells us. I was also turned off by him saying there's enough for everyone. Let me have one thing! And there's no kiss! Truly, I think if they just slapped a kissing animation at the end of the scene, it would help a LOT.

Initially, it seems like Lucanis is casual and noncommittal *But I think he's just‚Ä¶ really awkward.* He likely doesn't know *how* to go about starting an *actual* relationship with Rook, or how to navigate his feelings yet because he's spent nearly the whole time he's had those feelings trying to fight them off.¬†

Why would he mention the dessert pairing well with Rook's favorite drink if it was inconsequential? I doubt Rook would have even realized anything if he hadn't pointed it out. **But the gesture IS INDEED for Rook, and he just doesn't know how to handle being directly called out on it.** While I initially took him saying *""there's enough for everyone""* as something negative, *I now see it as him trying to downplay his own gesture, likely because he's embarrassed.* It's rather sweet. I just wish they did a better job of showing what that gesture leads to. (Bioware, I am once again begging you to patch in a kiss here.üôè)

The most important part is that, while he shies away from directly admitting he made dessert for Rook, he *does* indirectly admit it when he says ""Yes, I did"" to Rook's claim that he didn't have to do anything special. He doesn‚Äôt think the gesture is ‚Äúenough‚Äù for Rook, but it is indeed *special*.

So yes, the lock-in scene is pretty disappointing, *and yet‚Ä¶ it kind of reads like Lucanis planned this big romantic thing and then flubbed it because he got awkward in the face of Rook directly confronting him about it.* Which is cute. But it needed MORE. If not a kiss, then at least a mention of where they stand. Like maybe Lucanis could express relief at Rook's positive reaction because he thought he was too late or that Rook might no longer be interested. Something along those lines.¬†

**Before moving on, let's pause for a minute** so I can mention some cute banter I witnessed with my Crow Rook and Lucanis, courtesy of Emmrich.

https://preview.redd.it/6bycqloko1ae1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=998e763449a62185914111af2fcf30f266759f32

I even got banter with Lucanis and Neve at the Lighthouse regarding his relationship with Rook, where Neve talks about how Lucanis *does* know how to smile and can do it more than once. And when he asks what the point of her observation is, she responds that Rook is good for him. He laughs and says he‚Äôs figured that out.

He also has a few sweet lines at the Lighthouse when you approach him at random times after locking-in:

https://preview.redd.it/q7x3gvbmo1ae1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea5ba87e05a4026a30ff02822267de35815af8c

To ME, he seems very smitten with Rook and also incredibly devoted.

**But back to the main content.**

After Lucanis defeats Illario and becomes First Talon, there‚Äôs another dropped ball when he wants to leave early with Rook... only to end up back at the Lighthouse, by himself, drinking coffee. Huh??? The devs couldn't have Rook sitting next to him, at least? smh. But the dialogue has a few references to his feelings for Rook.

https://preview.redd.it/yf2t7kboo1ae1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=966ae078613b566c3bdbee57b12206c58cfe0401

He's being more open here about his feelings for Rook, though still holding back; he's not fully *there* yet, but it feels meaningful when he drops these little gems of sincerity. He expresses several times that Rook is important to him, he doesn't want to lose Rook, he wants to stay with Rook and be by their side (ie *""When you are ready to end this, Spite and I will be at your side.""*).

**Then you get to the Cafe Scene 2.0.** As soon as the initial cutscene started, I noticed that Lucanis was smiling. He really *is* happy just being around Rook!

>L: Rook. Have a moment?

>R: What is it?

>L: You were there to witness my new deal with Spite. You should come with us to see it paid in full.

>R: Interesting...

>**L: A spare moment with you is an added benefit.**

>R: Well, I can't say no to that.

>L: When you're ready.

First of all I want to say that I really like the Cafe Scene 2.0! It's definitely a nice payoff for Lucanis and Spite, and Lucanis wanting Rook there with them while they relax is very sweet. But the ending is so weird?? Honestly, it's awkward to the point of hilarity, so I can't complain too much because it's also kind of charming. I just don't get why they did what they did.¬†

The dialogue itself is mostly a resolution to the Lucanis and Spite situation. I‚Äôll just post a snippet from the end:

https://preview.redd.it/n865o4mqo1ae1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c50bf1515f099ab63be15eec980b66cf94e5d48

Why they decided to have Lucanis stand next to Rook, WITHOUT TOUCHING, for like 10 seconds, I‚Äôll never know. They just stare at each other‚Äìwhich I'll take because their expressions are adorable and *they're basically gazing lovingly into each other's eyes*. Why not have him put a hand on Rook‚Äôs shoulder/face, at least? I'll write it off as Lucanis *trying* but still being *awkward* in this new relationship. But come on. A little effort goes a long way.

And I‚Äôll admit that I initially had a negative reaction to the line: *‚ÄúWhatever this is, I'll take it.""* Because it sounded really dismissive. But with more thought, it seems like he just... doesn't know how to define what they are. So, it's possible he doesn't want to get too ahead and make assumptions. Lucanis never really pictured a future for himself while in the Ossuary. (And even before that, most of his life was determined *for* him, so who knows how many dreams he actually had.) His thoughts ended at escaping the prison and getting revenge. Of course, part of his deal with Spite was to get free and ""live,"" but given how he goes about daily life prior to Inner Demons, I don't believe he truly imagined what that *meant.*

*""Whatever this is, I'll take it""* isn't downplaying their relationship like I originally perceived it to be, but rather *it's an expression of Lucanis wanting Rook in whatever way Rook offers/allows.* He‚Äôs more at ease and hopeful after Inner Demons, so his feelings for Rook outweigh his fears and hesitancy.

**Act 3 and ""the point of no return"" is when things once again shift in the relationship. And it's fantastic.**

When Elgar'nan moves the moon and their timeline shifts, Lucanis is the one to say they can't wait to make their move, but he's also very aware of how dangerous this situation is. He's *with* Rook now. So he's very agitated and concerned about the danger they‚Äôre walking into, and he's honest with Rook about it.

https://preview.redd.it/hv6vwv2to1ae1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6c720350a7a6554fcd5771a502aa66f130f15ce

üò≥I remember seeing someone say Lucanis's love language is ‚Äòacts of service‚Äô because he'll kill anything for you and cook you dinner after lmao. And I‚Äôm here for it!

Just‚Ä¶ thinking he cares more for Neve than a Romanced Rook is crazy to me. I don't see it! If this man is with Rook, *he is with Rook.* Again, he‚Äôs entirely devoted and smitten‚Äìand it warms my heart! I can't say exactly *when* he falls in love with Rook‚Äìalthough, that would be a really fun discussion!--but once you know that's how he feels and you go back to look at interactions like this, it‚Äôs pretty clear.

Also cute:

>L: You're cutting this awfully close, Rook.

>R: Everything will be alright. I've got you, don't I?

>L: You do.

**The whole confrontation with Ghilan'nain is perfect when you're romancing Lucanis.** Rook frees Lucanis last, is grabbed by Ghilan'nain and suspended in the air. Lucanis tries to act but is held back. They're both struggling. Then Harding (who I always choose, RIP to my girl) takes the shot and keeps fighting even after she's gravely injured, allowing Lucanis to strike the killing blow. Lucanis and Rook are together, right there as Ghilan'nain diesand Lucanis rushes over to check on Rook. It‚Äôs a nice layer in his romance.

**But the REAL dessert here is the post-Fade-prison romance scene.** An absolute *chef's kiss* of a moment. I like how it starts with Lucanis lingering to check on Rook after a team meeting.

>L: Rook. Are you alright?

>R: We've still got work to do. I can collapse when this is over.

>L: We can contact our allies, Rook. **You should rest, after all you've been through... I'll come by your room soon. To see how you're doing.**

Finally, someone's looking out for Rook's wellbeing! It's such a little thing, but very much needed. I appreciate not always having to be the one who takes initiative.

Rook's been through hell by now. Hearing Lucanis's voice when he walked in was probably so soothing. His *expressions* in this scene are INCREDIBLE. They tell a whole story on their own. And the dialogue is just as good.

https://preview.redd.it/krhklznwo1ae1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ca42a1b2511a47fdf2827a0f66fed69ffde3a3

https://preview.redd.it/h7ke1fxyo1ae1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=34bbbe92c411ff2cfc5d58216e5af767bc372d76

https://preview.redd.it/p4lzil82p1ae1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=90d6da68f0f3f6c55d534852e410b8ec881f2a20

This entire scene is beautiful, intimate, loving, special, *sweet*. The way Lucanis *looks* at Rook, *talks* to Rook, *comforts* Rook‚ÄìI‚Äôm in shambles. You can see the LOVE in his eyes. He thought Rook was gone for good and is amazed and grateful to have Rook *back*. He‚Äôs so full of adoration that my heart absolutely melts during this 3min moment.

Sure, part of me is pissed because there's no way this is their first kiss. He even has a journal entry after the lock-in that says: ""*If I have lost an hour this night, it is only to Rook. But lost is wrong. It is an hour found. An hour more clear than any other.""* The fact that we don't get to WITNESS their actual first kiss is honestly a crime. BUT! I do love that Lucanis makes the first move here. *He* comes to Rook, *he* listens and comforts Rook, *he* initiates their kisses and more.

Also, can we talk about the fact that he *kneels* in front of Rook? When Caterina told Illario to get up because *Dellamorte‚Äôs don‚Äôt kneel?* And yet there Lucanis is, showing his deference and devotion and reverence by kneeling in front of Rook!

One thing I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve touched on is Lucanis‚Äôs reluctance to sleep, since that‚Äôs when he‚Äôs most vulnerable to Spite taking over. He mentions several times that he stays awake to avoid losing control, but in *this* scene his reluctance to sleep has nothing to do with Spite; *he wants to stay awake so he can spend as much time with Rook as possible.*

Lucanis takes the lead and offers a little bubble of comfort for Rook, where it's just the two of them *being* together. It's truly a peek into what a future together could be like.

When you check in with him before starting the next mission, you get a brief mention of his feelings too. Here‚Äôs a snippet:

>R: You sound a bit like...

>L: Spite? Perhaps. ***I thought I'd lost you, Rook. All I had left was the fight.***

>**R: I'm here. For you.**

>**L: Then that is all I need.**

Lucanis and Rook are always just so sweet and supportive with each other.¬†

**Onto the finale.**¬†

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that thanks to Rook, Lucanis and Spite bonded to the point of *refusing Solas‚Äôs offer of safely separating them*‚Äìbecause they‚Äôre Big Mad about what he did to Rook!

**But then we get the final moment with Lucanis,** right before heading out to face Elgar'nan, where he gives Rook a speech. Lucanis is *done* hiding. It's a very heartwarming transformation.

https://preview.redd.it/1logbk95p1ae1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=427b612b53d1f246a1ce5d703bc062b5c7ff0695

He's confident in their chances and determined to see the mission through; he‚Äôs also protective and angry over what's happened, *especially* with what Solas did to Rook. He lays out his grievances, but leaves it at Rook's feet to decide how to handle it. And that alone shows how much belief and trust they have in each other.

*""More than I've ever told you""* just hits me so hard because it's been such a winding, confusing, beautiful journey with him. He knows he hasn't said everything he should‚Äôve said, hasn't done everything he should‚Äôve done, but Rook is still there, still with him, and *now* is the time to confess what's on his heart and mind. **Instead of running from his feelings because they could end in tragedy and grief, instead of ignoring them because he thinks they mean more than what he deserves or will be able to keep, Lucanis finally embraces those feelings and shares them openly with Rook.** Him saying his heart beats for Rook has me *weak.*

Not only is the speech a lovely sentiment, but it's incredibly important in understanding his route!. Once I heard those lines, my perspective of everything that came before really shifted. It tells us that he's wanted Rook for some time, his heart has *been* Rook's, but fear was holding him back. Because he *knew* it wasn't just simple flirting with Rook. He *knew* it wouldn't be some uncomplicated relationship they'd come out of just fine when it eventually fizzled out. No. There was something deeper there very early on and he tried to block it off. Because he was overwhelmed by Rook's affection, because he was scared of his own heart, because he didn't think he was good enough, because Spite was a dangerous wildcard with an immediate interest in Rook (that, to me, mirrored his own), because the idea of living a happy life as an abomination seemed impossible.

He'll kill gods over and over and over, just to be able to sleep in Rook's arms at the end of the day. He‚Äôs looking forward to that now, rather than avoiding it. And then Lucanis just fully and casually drops the *I love you* like it‚Äôs nothing. Because it‚Äôs not a secret, just something he's finally putting into words.

I believe the actual last bit of dialogue from Lucanis is: *""I'll be by your side. Through anything. Now let's finish this.""*

I really wish they would have given us a proper epilogue slide for Rook‚Äôs romance, though. I wanted to see something about Lucanis and My Crow Rook going back to Treviso together to start a new chapter with each other and the Crows!¬†

OKAY. I'm done now, I swear!

**To those still reading this, thank you.** If you're upset or frustrated with the Lucanis romance, I hope seeing it laid out like this might help you perceive it differently and enjoy it more! If not, I understand. *If you already love Lucanis and his romance, and simply stuck around to relive some of its sweetness, thanks for that too!* Feel free to leave your own thoughts/interpretations here.

**So, that's that on that.** Hopefully this terribly long semi-coherent post has made someone happy. üñê",22,1735589796.0,dragonage,1,0.81,False

1hpw7ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCanada/comments/1hpw7ve/whats_up_with_yalls_retirees/,What‚Äôs up with y‚Äôall‚Äôs retirees?,"Hello, (regretfully) Floridian here.

Just experienced my first rude Canadian snowbird of the season. I‚Äôm a brewer and was having some chips and doing some lab work when an old lady, I guess she saw me through the big windows, barged in all huffy and asked when they were going to be seated in the taproom. I get a good view of the parking lot so I noticed Ontario plates (odd because Quebec snowbirds tend to be the grumpiest IME). They‚Äôd only been inside maybe thirty seconds and the bartender was grabbing change from the safe to refill the register. I had a mouthful of chips so I just pointed to the ‚Äúseat yourself‚Äù sign and once I was done chewing told them they couldn‚Äôt be on the production floor, coinciding with the bartender returning and getting an earful.

Mostly wondering if there‚Äôs some sort of phenomenon where Canadians store up all their pettiness and vitriol until upon retirement they cease the politeness act because every Canadian I‚Äôve known under retirement age has been great to talk to.

Other experiences that stand out from past seasons:

- starting in snowbird season salt and pepper shakers, spices, etc. available only upon request at my first job in high school (pizzeria) because the old Canadians would steal them and take them to the Publix next door for the no questions asked cash back return since they sold the same brand

-similar start time the coffee shops start pulling their sugar and cartons of half and half behind the counter because snowbirds will walk in and just dump the basket of sweeteners in their purse and nab the half and half

-in college my gf‚Äôs dad was a big realtor in Naples, he set us up with a sweet condo for the week around new years once. I swear we were one of maybe a handful of occupants without Canadian plates in the whole building and had multiple irate retired Canadian sounding couples asking what we were doing there and following us to our door until I unlocked it, flipped them off, and wished them goodnight.

So what gives? Our boomers are also pretty shitty but the Canadian ones that come here for the winter turn it up to 11.
