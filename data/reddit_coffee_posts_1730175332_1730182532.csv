Hello Reddit, 

I want to preface with 3 things before I get into it: 

* I’m new to this subreddit, so I apologize if I do not know any common acronyms or social norms that are normal here. I’m sure I’ll catch on quickly! 
* This post may be **long**. Apologies for the novel. 
* I am open to any feedback. I don’t have a preference of interpretation as I don’t have much knowledge in it. Any guidance or insight is welcome! 



Now! To get into it: 

I had this dream probably 5 or 6 years ago. I still think about it from time to time only because I felt a bit haunted by it. It wasn’t a nightmare, I didn’t feel afraid, but maybe a bit unsettled might be the best word to describe the sensation. When I woke up in the morning after having this dream I felt energized. I felt like I'd had 13 cups of coffee after sleeping for a week straight and like I could go fight God. I was excited, awake, and my brain was spinning with information overload – and yet I had no idea what I’d been presented with. For context I am a white American AFAB (NB) and I would have been in my mid-twenties when this happened.

The dream itself was in first person POV. The setting happened to be a shopping mall. It wasn’t one I was familiar with but in its essence had the feeling of a combination of multiple I had grown up visiting over time. It was well lit, not falling apart, there were other people around but none I recognized. General NPC’s just on their routes through the mall. It was all very green and beige, daytime, light coming through the windows. Pleasant start, very normal. 

I was at a coffee shop, bakery café of sorts, I had placed an order for a normal coffee drink I usually take and was waiting near the counter for it. In general just looking around and waiting and when my name was called both myself and another woman approached the counter. She was smaller than me, quite petite, probably of Hispanic origin of some kind. She had long dark hair, quite curly, and large dark eyes. We both looked at the drink and there was a realization that we had both ordered the same thing and had the same name. I let her have the first drink and she smiled at me, said thank you, and walked away. 

I did not wait for another drink, not sure why, but instead I started wandering out of the store and through the walkways of the mall. I looked at the stores, though I don’t recall any of their names now. It was at this point that a feeling of being followed started to settle upon me. Looking over my shoulder I saw a man in a black cloak and a large mask. 

This mask is pretty unique, it’s *almost* like an old plague-doctor mask, but not quite. Instead of having the flat part at the brow and then a beak – it was just a big curve from top to tip. It was a crescent shape quite large, it started from the face and at the tip of it ended right near his chest. It was a white mask, with red stripes from the eyes down the side of the curve of the ‘beak’ of the crescent. I tried to find a photo reference but I couldn’t find anything quite the same. 

This masked-figure was standing there in the middle of the walkway staring me down, and it was unsettling, but I didn’t quite feel afraid? I didn’t feel like prey. It was just more strange than anything. 

I kept walking through the mall, turning a curve and I saw a novelty shop and wandered inside. There was no one else inside, and there was no music playing, the only thing I could hear was the slight bubbling of water. This store had a strange collection of a lot of things, from televisions showing nature scenes, to little desktop waterfalls that you can plug in, to figurines. I distinctly remember stopping to look at a metal tiger. It was a dark chrome, it looked like it was prowling, maybe a little larger than a loaf of bread and I wanted it badly. I wandered through the shop a bit more and I started seeing the masked man in reflections of things, but not physically anywhere around me. 

When I got to the front of the store to inquire about the tiger, a woman poked her head out from a back room and waved me towards her. I ended up in the back room of this shop. It was dimly lit, mainly with candles, it smelled very earthy, maybe like incense but not quite like any of the kinds that I’ve smelled before. There was a mirror on the side of the wall and when I looked at it I saw myself and a masked figure behind me, but still I did not feel afraid, he was simply there, a shadow, and was with me as I approached this woman. 

The woman was elderly, a little bit round, small, and Asian. She was wearing a dress covered in gold flowers and it was a combination of red and blues. Her dark/gray hair was tied up in a tight bun and she seemed to be a bit hunched over. She smiled at me and waved me towards her closer and did not speak a word to me at all. Simply beckoned for my hands, which I gave, and she took these red braided ropes she had next to her on a wooden side table. With these ropes, which were… maybe two? Feet long, she began to gently drape them over my hands and tie them around them. Not too tightly, not enough to hurt or be uncomfortable, they were just bound nicely. 

Once a few ropes had been wrapped around, I remember her saying something quietly, but I cannot remember the words. Unfortunately I did not write them down. I don’t believe the words were for me. She patted my hands, I looked up and saw the masked figure in the reflection of a mirror, and that’s where my memory ends. 



It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, more like I encountered some very interesting characters. I’m not sure why it sticks with me the way it does. I’m happy to attempt to give more context if things are needed! Being that this was so long ago, some of the details may be lost, but I will try my best. 

Again, sorry for the novel, but I’m looking forward to hearing what reddit may have for me! 

Have a great week everyone! Sweet dreams ♥

1st total T test done in May - 600 
2nd comprehensive T test done in Oct - 320

I slept real bad the previous night of the 2nd test, I wasn’t even asked to fast for the second one surprisingly, had a coffee in the morning and the levels were terribly low around 320 and even free T was low. 

The doc offered T to me, but I am wondering do I really need it? Of course I would love to see more muscle (I am kinda skinny fat) and lose belly fat. However, my dilema is that the second result could be due to all the garbage sleep and stress levels I had the night before. I don’t understand how can it suddenly drop by 300 in 3 moths. 

If I do take it, then my natural factory shuts down and what if I kill it if it’s actually not that bad to a lifelong TRT situation?

I'm currently looking at Neo Flex 2024 or Picopresso but open to other options. Based on my reading so far, Neo flex is kinder to grind size and has scope for manual adjustments (integrated pressure gauge and all) which might be fun to play with. On the flipside, Pico is more portable, not that I intend to travel with either.

**Location:** based in India but can get it carried from the US (one time - won't be able to get accessories though). Pico is available locally but not the 2024 neo flex

**Budget** (with currency): $100-$150 for the espresso maker + accessories. Another $100-$150 for the grinder. For espresso, I've shortlisted Neo flex and Picopresso so far. For the Grinder, looking at Kingrinder K6. Open to suggestions but guess I can't go wrong with it.

**Drink types:** with milk with 2 parts coffee 1 part milk. I currently have plunger for frothing. Not looking to change that.

**Drink frequency:** Mostly 1 shot in the morning. Sometimes 2 back to back shots (if my father is around)

**Space:** Ideal would be to be able to tuck the coffee maker in the corner

**Manual vs. electric:** Fine with manual for now; understand the budget might not be enough for a good electric machine, but I saw a casabrews machine with good reviews on Amazon US",1,1730182298.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I'm looking for a coffee machine that grinds and extracts coffee well but im not sure were to start looking.

Since I’m currently living with my parents and already have a few other appliances, I need something on the smaller side.

1genwrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1genwrs/homecoming/,Homecoming ,"The afternoon sun cast a warm golden hue over the small, neatly arranged living room, where Clara sat cross-legged on the soft, oversized couch. Pillows were arranged just so, and a thick stack of letters, the ink slightly faded from countless readings, rested on the coffee table. Each envelope bore her husband’s familiar handwriting, his jokes, dreams, and love spilling onto the pages as if he were right there beside her. Today was supposed to be a celebration; a month from now, Nathan would walk through that door, which she’d lined with twinkling fairy lights. But now, instead of a countdown to joy, Clara had found herself entangled in despair.

The morning news had brought shocking reports from the war zone, the familiar face of the anchor speaking of ambushes and losses as Clara felt her breath catch in her throat. Missing in action. The words echoed in her mind like an unwanted refrain, drowning out the laughter of the children playing in the distance. A month felt like an eternity. The updates trickled in, each one worse than the last, until the day came when the phone rang with an urgency that made her heart plummet.

He was alive, but the relief was miniature against the gravity of the words that followed—critical condition after an ambush. She clutched her phone tightly as if it could somehow bridge the distance between them. 


Clara set the phone down, her hands trembling as reality settled in, heavy and suffocating. She glanced around the room, desperate for something familiar, something that might feel comforting. The floral patterned curtains flapped gently in the breeze; the scent of the lavender she had planted last summer wafted in, filling the void with earthy sweetness. Yet, even the flowers seemed to mock her—their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the gray creeping into her spirit. 

She pushed herself up from the couch and paced, her heart racing. Each tick of the clock was like a countdown to an uncertainty she couldn’t fathom. A month had seemed so short, a blink away, but now it was unbearable—a chasm filled with doubt. Would he still be the same Nathan she had clung to in her dreams? Would he still smile that radiant smile that had captured her heart?

Time blurred as the days crawled forward. The phone rang only to deliver more earth-shattering news. Clara felt the walls closing in when she heard the words, “He’s been flown back stateside.” One step closer, she thought, but the sinking feeling in her chest grew heavier.

When the call finally came from the hospital, Clara felt as if the world had tilted on its axis. “Clara, it’s bad,” the voice on the other end had said, quaking with sympathy. “You need to prepare yourself. It’s… he’s…” Her heart shattered like glass, scattered into a million sharp pieces, impossible to piece back together. “He’s paralyzed. Completely.”

She dropped to her knees, the hardwood floor cool against her feverish skin. The walls of their home, once filled with laughter and the promise of their future, now felt like a tomb—every item a reminder of the life they’d planned. Photographs of birthdays celebrated, weekend hikes, the last vacation together played in her mind like a haunting reel. How many of those moments were still within reach? Would their dreams of traveling to Italy, the sound of waves crashing against sunlit beaches, ever be realized?

The day arrived when she would finally see him. Hospital room lights flickered as Clara stood outside the door, the steel thresholds a barrier that held her back. She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the tidal wave of emotions threatening to engulf her. Pushing the door open, she was met with sterile walls and the rhythmic beeping of machines. 

Nathan lay in the bed, tubes and wires, a shadow of the man she had known. The blanket was pulled up to his chest, but she could see the stillness where his legs used to be, and her heart ached for the life he’d once lived. His face was drawn, his expression eerily calm as he slept, the sunken hollows of his cheeks a painful reminder of what he had endured. 

Clara stepped closer, each footfall echoing in her ears like a declaration of love against the backdrop of anguish. She reached out her trembling fingers, brushing the back of his hand, the warmth of his skin igniting a flicker of hope in her chest. “Nathan,” she whispered, her voice breaking. 

Slowly, he opened his eyes, the warmth of his brown gaze locking onto hers. In that moment, time paused, and the world faded away, leaving just the two of them—the love that had weathered the storm, now tested in ways they had never imagined.

“Clara,” he rasped, that sweet familiarity lacing his voice like a balm for her wounds. “I’m so sorry.” 

The sadness mingled with the urgency of their moment as she struggled to answer. “You don’t need to be. We’ll get through this together,” she replied, squeezing his hand tight enough to send a jolt of reassurance across the chasm that now defined their lives. 

As tears streamed down her face, she leaned forward, resting her forehead against his, feeling the warmth of his thoughts wrap around her like a promise. Together, they would face the fearsome mountain ahead, navigating uncharted territory hand in hand. Clara knew that the road would be challenging, but in this moment, she realized that the bond they shared was irreplaceable—stronger, perhaps, than it had ever been. They would find a new way to define love, to redefine life—and she would not let go.",1,1730182039.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

1gensrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/1gensrm/yosteria/,Yosteria,"I failed to get photos of my visit to this place because I'm an idiot, but after a suggestion from the folks at Noble Creature, family and I decided to check out Yosteria down in Smoky Hollow - an old Youngstown house turned into a winery/pizzeria. 

Unbeknownst to me at the time going in, Yosteria is owned by Frank Tuscano and Alex Zordich, with Zordich alleging that family lived in the neighborhood back in the day.  Frank Tuscano rings some giant, heavy, loud alarm bells for me, though.  If I had known this going in, I'd not have ordered any food in the first place.

See, Frank used to be partner in Pressed Coffee Bar on Lincoln.  Frank had a vision where he wanted to open a cafe, but Frank never worked a day in his life.  Through the grace of whatever God blessed that building (mainly the other investor), Pressed did well and is still alive today.  Frank has since, however, divested from that business.  

I worked with Frank back in the day, at this very location.  One of my sunbright-glaring memories about working here is how we stored our food.  Our dry goods were stored in the basement.  You know what else was stored in the basement?

A large family of very giant, fat rats.  

I once went down to get some ketchup packets, only to find the open box to be full of rat shit and chewed packets.  The owner's response?  ""Throw them in the sink with the sanitizer, it's what we do at Subway.""

Okay, fine.  I know that many kitchens cut incredible corners for the sake of a profit.  I should have reported this to the health department, but I didn't, because I needed the job.

Fast forward to this weekend.  We show up to try dinner at this place, empty at 4pm.  We're told we have to sit outside in the cold because we don't have a reservation.  I get it, expected.  I'm tasked with turning on the propane heaters myself.

We order pizza - a quattro formaggio (four cheese white pizza) and a rossa, basically a margharita.  Both pizzas' crusts are bone white, not a hint that they even touched an oven, save for the fact that the cheese on the pizzas were actually melted and somewhat warm.  The sauce was good on the red pizza, its only saving grace.  The 'basil' on the rossa pizza was probably half of a single leaf, chiffonaded, dried, sprinkled on top of the cheese.

---

I went to Noble Creature some time ago, and ran into Amil Dinsio - the famous mobster bank robber from Youngstown featured in Crime Town - tried to steal Nixon's money - and the man shared some of his pizza with me because I knew who he was.  Noble Creature was using Yosteria dough to make their own pizzas, and it was probably some of the BEST goddamn pizza I'd had in the area in a while.  Whoever runs the kitchen at Noble Creature deserves bright recognition.

We went to Yosteria because we were told their pizza was great, and their dough was the dough they used when they were making pizza, which was special/seasonal.  

In the end, the pizza was disgusting.  Once I saw Frank Tuscano poke his head out of the back door, it all made sense to me.  The man is a hack who thinks he's a culinary godsend to the area, but has probably never actually been to a real pizzeria.  Beware, $15 pizzas these are VERY much not.  Go to Avalon, or literally anywhere else, instead.

edit: and another memory of Frank, standing behind the cafe bar nursing his cup of coffee with a look on his face like he's about to be hit by a car, while we had literally a line out the door.  Dude had the audacity to tell me one day that he is 'the hardest-working small business owner in Youngstown,' after which point I told him to go fuck himself and went home.

Here's a rundown of them and the questions I have for each of them for us to discuss below.

1.) The Fyang-JM-Jas Fiasco: A coffee date was organized for Fyang and JM, and their actions during said date caused a lot of backlash towards the two. Jas' name got involved here due to JM remaining unclear with how he feels towards either of the two ladies.
Question: Does this coffee date implicate something more for Fyang and JM, or is it just both their families being unnaturally nosey?

2.) The Poser Accounts Issue: Some of the Gen 11 Housemates like Kai and Kolette had fake accounts posing as them, with a hefty amount of followers, doing and saying questionable things. Thankfully, it appears this issue has probably been resolved already.
Question: What measures can be taken to prevent poser accounts from rising?

3.) The Jarren-Therese Situation: There have been posts here and on other social media platforms expressing worry about the interactions of the two being very scarce, plus neither of them following the other (specifically on IG, where people mostly follow the housemates).
Question: Does this situation tell us that their friendship is currently unsteady, or are certain people merely overthinking because they can't really read the two?

For spring/summer I believe citrus, honey, and floral notes might work well for me.

When I go to a coffeeshop, it’s typically because I want to “rent” the real estate to work for an hour or two. I pay the rent (aka the hang out fee) by purchasing coffee and a snack. If I’m there for more than a couple of hours, I make another purchase to pay another hang out fee. As such, I immediately scout for a table or seat at the bar when I arrive (no more than a two-top if it’s just me) and then step in line to order. I don’t like to mull around a busy shop like a buzzard waiting for someone to leave. 

My friend thinks it’s rude and unacceptable to claim a table and then order. He insists that one must wait in line, order, THEN look for a place to sit after the purchase is made. He feels like it’s cutting in line to go ahead and set down a backpack or whatever at a table before ordering. To him, paying for something is required before picking a seat. 

What’s your opinion on the issue? Is it wrong to set down your belongings and then order?

**💙 What I Love:**

• **Sound Quality:** These glasses have **4 amazing speakers** that blow laptop or phone speakers out of the water. They even have a bit of bass, making the audio experience fantastic.

• **Simple Display:** It’s not a fully-fledged OS or a VR setup—just a **simple display** that mirrors your phone or laptop. This makes it super handy for work continuity.

• **Battery-Free:** No need for separate batteries or chargers (unlike VR headsets), which is a win in my book.

• **Lightweight:** Weighing just **79 grams**, it feels just like a regular pair of glasses.

• **Clear View:** I can see things beneath the glasses—perfect for checking my phone, laptop, or even eating without needing to remove them. This is a **major advantage** over bulkier VRs like Vision Pro or Meta Quest.

**⚠️ Downsides:**

• **One Big Screen:** It doesn’t support multi-monitors well. But to be fair, **multi-monitor setups** in AR/VR still feel clunky across the board.

*Note:* I’ve heard **Immersed Visor** might be better for multi-monitor setups, though I haven’t tried it yet.

**📊 How It Compares to Others:**

• **Lighter than Vision Pro:** At **79 grams** compared to Vision Pro’s \~1lb. No sweating issues or heavy feeling!

• **More Practical:** Since I can see my surroundings, it’s safer—less chance of bumping into stuff.

• **Sound and Display Quality:** Outshines other AR glasses like **Viture and XREAL Air 2 Pro** with its **crisper image, better sound**, and ease of use.

• **Everyday Use:** These feel like **sunglasses**, making them ideal for planes, coffee shops, or commutes. No awkward VR goggles vibe.

**🎯 Practical Use:**

I honestly think **Rayneo Air 2s** beats the likes of Vision Pro and Meta Quest when it comes to portability and convenience. I wish I had discovered it earlier—watching movies or YouTube on a plane is now a game-changer!

**💸 Price and Deal Alert:**

Right now, **Amazon** has it listed for **$349** (with a $50 coupon bringing it down to **$399**). I even saw it dip to **$319** briefly, which felt like a steal!

**🛑 Bottom Line:**

If you’re looking for a lightweight, no-frills solution to enjoy media or mirror your devices on the go, these **Rayneo Air 2s glasses** are worth it. Great alternative to bulky VR setups for **travel on planes**.

Feel free to ask any questions or for specific comparisons with other AR/VR products!

I have gone to all my doctors and we can’t seem to figure anything out. I have tried cutting out coffee. I’ve tried cutting out tomatoes, onions, etc. I’ve tried cutting out Cheese. The dieting doesn’t seem to help. I also try to sit up for a few hours after I eat instead of immediately laying down. I have taken almost all the medicines for the issue. Nothing seems to help, except Tums, but it’s only short lasting. I’m still gonna continue working with my doctors but I would like to delve into some prayer and ritual for some support & help. The GERD is so bad that I can’t breathe properly sometimes so I use a rescue inhaler, my chest hurts to the point where I feel like I’m having a heart attack, and I’ve been constantly hiccuping since December. I can feel the acid traveling up to the back of my throat at night as I try to sleep, making my throat dry, soar and burning like the rest of my body. I was thinking of Apollo because he is the God of medicine, but I was wondering if you all had any other suggestions? 

Also pray for my Dad if you can, we have to go to an appointment far away because something is wrong with his eyes. 


Thank you. Sorry for the long rant as well. ",1,1730179478.0,Hellenism,0,1.0,False

1gen9lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/1gen9lc/how_to_deal_with_our_problem_player/,How to deal with our problem player?,"Tldr: we need a nice way of asking a player to leave the group

Long version:

We’ve been playing D&D 3.5 as a group for 5 years now, and we are at the end of our tether with “Silent Bob” our problem player. 

Bob makes no effort to learn the rules or read the manuals, he only watches YouTube videos which are mainly based on 5e. Despite our group having 3 players who started playing much, much, later than Bob, they’ve all made the effort to learn the game basics and how to roll their characters, Bob is still our least knowledgeable player. 

Bob keeps trying to roll evil characters despite being told explicitly not to by our 3 DMs. Bob can’t roleplay. I can’t stress this enough. He will sit in silence for 80% of the sessions, only speaking when he absolutely has to. 

When Bob does speak in character - it often comes with a cringey accent, one of which was quite racist and made us all very uncomfortable. 

Bob always wants his characters to be the biggest and hardest hitting, but because he doesn’t understand the classes (because he won’t read the manual even after 5 years of playing), and outright refuses to ask for help, his characters are always poorly built. 

We house rule to reroll 1s, and if you’ve rolled your stats poorly, to reroll until you get a decent spread - Bob always chooses not to do this which led to a recent fighter character of his only having 1 hp more than the very squishy bard - at level 12. 

Bob refuses to take certain feats, like quickdraw, but insists on always taking die hard. 

Bob has more than 10 character sheets in our graveyard because he is an idiot who always directly defies the advice of the DM and other players. Like being explicitly told NOT to directly engage with a Mummy Lord, doing so anyway, and then sulking when his character got mummy rot. 

During our last session our camp was attacked by bandits and when he was told, “you have the chance to perform a quick action before we roll initiative, what do you do?” He asked to make a knowledge dungeon roll to see if he knew why they were attacking. 

Bob does stuff that makes us uncomfortable when not at the table, like bringing beer to the game, then when he was asked not to do that, he brought ‘non-alcoholic’ beer despite being told it was a trigger for our teenage player who lives with an alcoholic parent and the smell of it upsets them. He purposely always leaves the toilet seat up, despite being repeatedly told not to because we have a visually impaired player who that makes things incredibly difficult for. 

Bob always brings a big carrier bag full of food that he never offers to share, which wouldn’t be as much of an issue if he didn’t always consume 4/5 pieces of fruit every session that makes him take a massive (and smelly) poop at the end that renders the toilet unusable even to the player who was born without a sense of smell. For example, Hh’ll eat an entire punnet of cherries to himself, spit all the pips into a coffee mug and not empty it, or leave 3 entire orange peels next to the person who has a citrus peel allergy. 

We honestly don’t know what he gets from coming to the games, he barely contributes, and we have tried everything. We tried guiding him through character creation, we tried rolling his character for him, we tried giving his character a pre-written backstory for him to build from, nothing seems to get him to engage with the game. 

One adventure he was told that the quest would be a bounty party of level 10 players, and climb and swim would be essential he only put enough ranks in each to offset his armour check penalty - which is a rule we barely ever enforce. Then he sulked when his character drowned. 

He was thrown a bone by the DM in one campaign where his character was killed in battle on the penultimate session so they granted him a resurrection rather than making a new character. So as the other characters were burying him, all he had to do was speak - he didn’t speak. He let himself be buried and then stood up, and nearly got killed again by another character who was like “Zombie, kill it!” - and he STILL didn’t speak. 

He meta games a lot, and gets called on it, and sometimes through his utter stupidity forces other players to meta just so they don’t kill his character. For example, performing an evil act in front of a paladin who didn’t want to derail the DMs game so they kept holding off for the sake of keeping the peace. 

He’ll make stupid decisions in game like getting in the way of spells that the casters have declared to put himself in the firing line, or deciding his barbarian was going to take cover behind the cleric, or putting literally nothing in the inventory of a newly rolled, high level character, so that the other characters have to provide food and health potions for him. 

He is on the spectrum but all but 2 of our group is on the spectrum, we have been putting off asking him to leave for a long time because we know he has no other friends or social groups. We don’t want to actually tell him he’s going to have to leave but we have no idea what else to do with him. 

There might not be a nice way of dealing with the situation but we are just at a loss. ",0,1730179337.0,DungeonsAndDragons,7,0.14,False

1gen50i,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gen50i/phycological_effects_of_coffee_withdrawal_are/,Phycological effects of coffee withdrawal are worst.  ,"Hi Reddit I have been increasing my coffee intake for a few years now up until recently where I had around 6-7 shots of dark espresso (in lattes) every day. I realized it’s just horrible for my body and completely unsustainable and I have to stop. I planned to just get to a spot where I have 1-2 coffees per day first and work from there over a longer period of time. 

Over the past about a week, I actually was able to cut down to 1 coffee per day- I had major headaches at first and LOTS of body aches but I pushed through and I’m very proud of myself for that. However, in the past week I also began feeling really down and honestly hopeless. I thought this was just an effect of things happening in my life but I’m typically able to overlook these things and be very optimistic. It was then that I realized it was my cutting down on coffee that made me feel so down. 

Coffee is genuinely so hard to quit not just because of the headaches but it literally makes it seem like everything in your life is going downhill which you can’t easily point to coffee at first like you could other symptoms like irritability, headaches, sleep changes. 

I’m trying to keep a positive attitude about cutting down so I can eventually quit but it feels so hard as I just have this underlying sense of hopelessness that is really hard to separate from my actual emotions and the actual severity of things in my life. ",3,1730178828.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I need help. I 35f have been the sole stable working parent in our home for about 4 years. My husband 43m stayed home with our 1yr old daughter after covid cause I could not be a stay at home mom any longer. No shade, everyone fights their own battles, I had just done it for many years and wanted something different. My husband volunteered. FF to last month. I, working 3 jobs, took my sick father to the mayo clinic and got some pretty devastating news. I spoke with my husband and we decided I would quit my main 40hr a week job to take care of my dad while still maintaining my other 2 jobs and he would get one himself to help supplement what I was giving up. I guess it is relevant to say my main job was a head chef at the largest resturant in our (small) city feeding over 300 ppl daily, my second job was a chef at the local senior center and my 3rd job was being the main caretaker of my father. I was getting up at 5am to start my day, and ending it around 10pm. 7 days a week for the past 3 months solid.

Now, for the past 2 weeks, I get up at 6am and the days are a lot more chill with down time in the afternoon for a possible nap! My father has gained weight, his mobility has dramatically improved, he always greets me with the biggest smile and is so proud that he makes it to the kitchen to make us coffee! He is the best and i am so thankful to be able to devote more to getting his affairs in order. 

Now here is the issue and I don't know if I'm being to sensitive. Since my husband has worked 1 whole week at his new job, his attitude has changed. Suddenly he is joking that he is ""the one who went to work today"" and ""it must be nice to sit at home"" or ""just run around for my dad"". He is demanding and hurrassing me for me to do my ""nightly wifely duties"" even when I clearly am not in the mood and if I don't, I have to listen to the dreaded ""you don't love me"" pitch. It's frankly a massive turn off. He has not helped clean 1 single time since he got his job. He doesnt help with the kids, he hasnt cooked once. No, I'm wrong, he did do laundry last Sunday. He constantly makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. And I wanna snap and say ""mf with my 2 other jobs I still bring in more money per month than you do with your 9 to 5!"" My father has railroad retirement after 47 years and pays me very well for helping him. I don't say that,  even though I want to, i dont. I'm feeling very withdrawn and resentful. I tried to say this to him but he just dismisses it and leaves the room or tells me I'm being bitchy. 

I'm hurt. I feel like this is a time where I need his support and comfort, to be an active participant in this relationship. I NEVER threw in his face I was working and he wasn't. I never intentionally belittled him. I feel used and walked on and unappreciated. What do I do? How do we get past this? Am I taking this to personally?  Am I in the wrong here?

1gemxcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1gemxcl/has_anyone_figured_out_how_to_comfortably_eat_at/,"Has anyone figured out how to comfortably eat at a dining table, or do we all just sit on the couch? or is it JUST me??","I get incredibly antsy and straight up uncomfortable sitting at the table to eat. Partially due to my back issues which have escalated in the past year from chronic-but-mild, to pain in the 4-7 range after basic tasks like bending over a laundry basket to look for socks 🙃 it's always been hard for me to sit in a normal chair because I have kyphosis, so my posture is naturally shrimp-like and most chairs are very upright, which pushes me forward uncomfortably.

But the other issue is that I get antsy because idk what to do with my legs. I always prefer my legs up close to me. I've read it could be a propioception thing with autistics, or it could be due to bloodflow, it seems common in people with POTS though I am 80% sure I don't have POTS. But it drives me crazy, my knees and ankles will begin to ache from sitting all scrunched up, so I will stretch on the couch to get relief, and not even paying attention to myself, my legs find their way back up to me. I simply cannot sit with my legs just stretched out like a normal person. I'm speculating on hEDS but don't have insurance ATM so can't investigate it. But I also am just very short, so unfortunately in most seating arrangements my toes can touch the floor, but not my whole foot, which is uncomfortable so I HAVE to pull my feet up or prop them uncomfortably on a part of the chair to avoid half-dangling.

So, my current eating arrangement: Sitting on the couch, cross-legged, with my feet tucked under me (and I often have to literally grab my feet and position them particularly so that they don't hurt or go numb), while I eat over a very high TV tray. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, of course. I've even tried to become more mindful of my own needs whether or not I'm in public, so if I'm seated at a booth in a restaurant I will pull my legs up rather than sit uncomfortably. 

The ""problem"" is simply that, my husband and I are buying a house. We will, maybe, get a dining table. I'd like to, at least for when we have guests. In the past, at our rental place, the typical arrangement would be to have our guests sit on the floor around our coffee table and eat there. Not something anyone minded when our guests were all autistic friends who like floor sitting, but since we'll finally have a house that can accomodate more than a small group, I'd actually like to start having in-laws and family over, in which case, they would probably be frustrated to be sat on the floor or at the couch to eat.

All this to say, how do you make it comfortable?? I've looked at a lot of dining sets online and they all look very uncomfortable. I think one of my biggest complaints is that most dining chairs have just enough room for your butt, not your legs. There's the option of cross-legged chairs, but they can be kind of expensive, so I wasn't sure if there was like, a comfortable alternative that is suitable for a dining area? Realistically any chair that I would find comfortable would be a lounge chair far too large to have at the table. I guess an option would be to get a normal dining set and buy a special chair for my particular needs, but it feels selfish to let everyone else sit in uncomfortable chairs. Maybe I'm better off getting a kotatsu and making everyone sit on the floor under the guise of ""it's japanese, it's *fancy* floor sitting.""

What are your eating arrangements with guests?? Our closing date is less than two weeks, and while it'll probably be awhile before we can host a housewarming party, I'd like to get an idea of what kind of setup we want.",11,1730178003.0,AutisticAdults,2,1.0,False

I tried nofap before, but failed and relapsed every f\*\*\*\* time, it was TOO hard for me so I stopped trying again.  
  
BUT, this time, I started the other way around, with NO PLAN, instead of starting with nofap (and with no intention of trying nofap again) I started without too much planning this way:

First I started reading books everyday, some days a lot if I'm on the mood, some days a few chapters, some days a few pages, but E V E R Y D A Y.

some weeks later I started doing mindfulness, 10, 15 or 20 minutes of meditation in the mornings with youtube meditation music and in a few weeks I was doing this EVERYDAY.  
  
a few weeks later I added moderated exercise to my routine. This time I started with some basics instead of trying to force myself to do a lot, why ? because for me at least when I started with too much within a few weeks I abandoned it because it was too hard for me to make it an habit, so I started SLOW so I'm sure that I have no excuse to do it everyday. (I was already reading and meditating everyday)

After a few weeks doing all of this I discovered that I still have TOO MUCH anxiety and problems to sleep and rest well, the culprit ? coffee, I was trapped in the cycle of can't sleep in night drink a LOT of coffee in the day, can't sleep in night, drink a LOT of coffee ... being tired all day, with no energy, STRESSED and with LOTS of anxiety ... so I replaced coffee with one cup of green tea in the morning, and water or natural lemonade for the rest of the day and that improved my qol a lot.

And suddenly a few months later I discovered that I was fapping a couple times per week or less without trying or thinking about it, it just happened, so I remembered nofap and thought, well, why not ?   
  
I'm just 2 weeks with no PMO, but I feel like playing in easy mode, like going over leveled to a boss fight in an rpg xD

Maybe going slow, but firmly, and in reverse order is easier. The other times I started with nofap tried to read, and meditate, and exercise, all at the same time and being horny all day and stressed I always exploded, relapsed, and abandoned everything because it was too hard.

  
right now I'm feeling like i'm entering in the flatline, I'm depressed, with bad mood, but I'm doing ok, not terrible and not feeling like I'm fighting PMO, just doing other stuff.

  
So maybe this approach could help you, don't know, we all are different, but who knows ...",3,1730177874.0,NoFap,1,1.0,False

I feel like a failure. I make mistakes at work and get scolded even though I try my best and the reasons got the scolding seem weird to me (such as the way I take notes needing time to think before accepting a travel-related assignment or giving the phone number (not personal) to a customer the driver was supposed to pick up (I spoke to customer service before giving the number and that same nner appears when you make a reservation for transfers). 

I don't feel OK at this job-I feel like a stupid failure and my nods often hints that I don't think. So according to her and the work reddit, I do suck. I quit my last to jobs before the 1 year mark due to health issues and getting stalked(which I still haven't recovered from and am now very weary of men ). 

My friends are almost always busy and in the city I left due to being scared of the stalking, so we can't see each other. 

My family's situation is starting to have more impact on me now as an adult (parents divorced). 

So in general I kinda struggle with loneliness (sometimes, I like my alone time, but damn it'd be nice to grab a coffee with a friend), feeling like an unaccomplished failure in my professional life, nostalgia, paranoia and constantly being stressed etc.

 I try not to take thing too personally, but to no avail. I don't have anyone to share these thing with.( I vent a bit to my mother, when she's at home, but nothing too personal and she sometimes says that's its due to me not wanting to study when I had to apply for universities. I wanted to go into acting, but got too scared of the exams and went for advertising). 

Therapists are expensive and I'm embarrassed about sharing something so personal with a stranger face to face.

I live in a city with a metro of around 100k, where, unfortunately, there’s no really good bakery. There is one speciality coffee shop, and it seems to do ok. A lot of folks here make decent money, and the cost of living is low, but the number one complaint is about needing to drive to nearby cities just to find good food. I think a high-end croissant shop could do really well here.

Here's where I'm at: I’m a home cook/baker who (probably) has more money than sense and I'm in the dangerous position to be able to afford to start a bakery (on a budget). I’ve got big ideas for the concept, recipes, and marketing, and I’m prepared to cover the initial costs. But there’s a catch—I only have about 5-6 hours a day to dedicate to this. Ideally, I'd find a partner to take a significant share of the profit and handle the early morning baking, and maybe even the actual process of making the laminating the dough, etc, and making the fillings. I think ideally that I would be the person who handles the business, marketing, menu, etc, while also working in the kitchen during afternoons to come up with the flavors of the week, making fillings, etc. I don't need need to maximize personal profit, so I could actually afford to pay an employee a very good wage -- I'm more in this for the long-term growth, so I would be happy to pay them very well (though I wouldn't want to give up much, if any, equity).

Of course, I'd need an espresso machine to offer coffee too. But is the only way to go about this to go big? I’d prefer to keep it small—have a streamlined menu with just a few items each week: 2 filled croissants, 2 filled cruffins, a plain croissant, pain au chocolat, and maybe a Danish now and then. Maybe a savory pastry. I’m not looking to run a full-scale bakery with bread or dozens of items.

Another idea I had was to make all the items in one location and maybe open a few small coffee stands around the city, so more people could get the pastries without the need for a large, single-location bakery. I don't really want to deal with running around and cleaning tables, but that may be an expectation in this area, I don't know. 

Would love your thoughts. Is it feasible to keep it small and focused? Or is there a way to balance profitability without going all in on a big space with lots of seating? Any advice on what could work (or what to avoid) would be great! Am I delulu?",0,1730177665.0,cafe,2,0.5,False

Recently, I found her on Hinge, and asked her if she wanted to go out for coffee or dinner sometime. She was very up front about her life being super busy and she was “in no place for dating” rn. Which obviously is fine. Initially we were still set up to meet bc she was still down to go get coffee but she ended up canceling the day of, which was a bummer, but still, I wanted to be respectful. 

Even more recently we started working on a show together. She’s still busy as hell lmao.

But just bc she doesn’t have time to date doesn’t mean you can’t flirt, it’s not that black and white.” He also said “you gotta stop shooting yourself in the foot”

I would love to get to know her better, but my friend is right, I usually see things like this as black and white, and I really want to be respectful of her and what she wants. Can I still flirt with her like he suggested, and if so how do I do it without coming off pushy?

I'm 26 years old and my boyfriend also has the same age as me. I just moved out a few months ago this year. I'm a full-time online ESL teacher and I have some private students too. While my boyfriend doesn't have a job because he was not able to graduate highschool. He tried applying for jobs, but it's either it's too far for him, the salary is low, or the companies just plainly don't reach out. He also blames his mom. Because if it wasn't for her using his tuition fee for a failed business, he would probably be a graduate now and have savings.  

A lot has happened between the both of us. I pay for EVERYTHING including the rent, the electric bill, the water bill, the internet bill, the foods, and so on. Even our commute sometimes. 

He would sometimes pay for some snacks whenever his friend asks some help in this game in which you can earn lots of money if you invest most especially lots of money. 

I have been having financially troubles ever since due to a low income salary and two days off. I have also been adjusting more hours just to survive. 

We've had fights back and forth most especially about money troubles. He said that he cooks and he cleans, and that is also tiring for him. He also helps me to fix things at home such as some appliances or furnitures. He says that I don't appreciate it.

We have never been on a date. But we do have sex. It has been an issue as well because we haven't had sex since probably last month. I would always reject because I feel forced and I feel exhausted from work. I don't get why I need to give him a reward for it. 

He is also complaining sometimes every time we fight that I don't buy him what he wants such as food or surprises. I did. But only very rarely as I learned my lesson living with him for months now. 

Yes, his parents has a home and he also has siblings. When he needs to go back home for a while due to some holidays or ocassions, he goes back home but he sometimes asks his mother or sibling for help in regards to his commute. 

The reason why I stayed with him is because I thought that there would be a change. Our anniversary is this year, December. I gave him an ultimatum that if nothing changes, we can break up. 

He wanted to start a kimchi business after how many attempts and convincing. Now it's just stuck in the fridge and instead of selling it to people, he decides to sell it all to his sister instead. 

There were some harsh words coming from the both of us sometimes that may lead to emotional abuse. He also attempted to pack his bag and leave, but he doesn't. He always says that he's just trying to scare me. He attempted to hurt me (also me) whenever we had fights before or whenever I wanted to leave my place for a while, but nothing serious. 

I don't know what to do and I'm lost. I'm also supporting my two dogs and their needs. I also have my mother who I tend to treat out with food and coffee. She'e a senior and she's a housewife who also depends on my dad. My dad offers to help out financially sometimes to me, and he also supports me by buying me presents such as things I need at home. He's living in another country, by the way.

I’m thinking of reporting them but don’t know if there’s even a way for anyone to investigate just because of how the place is run and who it’s run by. But there’s a lot of questionable things going on. But even if u find this wrong I’m worried if it isn’t something provable I’ll lose my job and I have a toddler with a feeding tube and it’s hard enough for me to find help with her just to go to work two days a week. But anyway, the people in any type of management or just above the regular care takers are either family or really close friends. So they don’t listen to complaints on those people and if they find out you’re complaining they either push you til you quit or they make it seem like you’re doing something wrong when you’re not. It’s impossible to tell everything going on but I’ll name a few when I first started working there a girl working in the same house on a different shift was telling me the house manager steals clients things for example she said a keurig came in the mail for one of the 2 clients in the apartment (this ones family left him a lot of money after passing) she said it was shiny teal blue and she set it up in the kitchen (they have the house manager working as one of us doing basically cna care on a shift. So the house manager comes in after this girl gets off. She said the next day when she came in it was gone and there was a janky less nice black one. And she asked the house manager what happened to the pretty one and the house manager told her that was a plastic covering that peels off. But she was the one who opened the box and it was not and even the one on the box was teal. (Also the house manager is the assistant to the boss’s best friend; and the assistant to the boss is his girlfriend) it’s a lot I know. The more I worked I started thinking she was stealing myself. His mom sends him expensive coffee k-cups a huge box every month. I work 3rd shift weekends 12 hours 7-7 . So I make his breakfast he has problems swallowing number one number 2 I’ve never seen him drink coffee neither has anyone else over talked to. Well house manager works 3p-11 during week. He is done during the week 7-3 so she says he drinks coffee all the time moral of the story the boxes are gone way before a month and she’s the only one always talking about how he loves coffee never seen him have one. He had a swifter it’s randomly gone. Now here comes what weird to me they say he has 6 figures but he has raggedy shoes (he has a disability that concerns bad bones needs a walker pretty much non verbal) he has just t shirts many with holes. Barely any clothes that match he’s almost 60 he has no toys for people with his disability just torn up cards he plays with every day he lives in a roach infested apartment just saw a mouse too they say it’s because the apartment why not move him to a house? Doesn’t have to be a mansion but a house that won’t be infested and can be treated? It might not seem like a lot but they have to spend so much of his $ for their records in a certain time frame not sure how much either are. But my thing is what are they spending it on? If he was my family member I think having a nice wardrobe and shoes for comfort things he enjoys wouldn’t take too much considering it’s obviously not going anywhere he does have a nice ass air fryer like what good does that do him? But it gets worse imo. They complain that we use too many gloves and that we shouldn’t care about using gloves when toileting him? They told us not to use paper towels for cleaning? And the fridge is empty half the time. They tell us we can give him oatmeal for breakfast right now he has not even eggs last month they didn’t have milk or even bottled water for probably 2-4 weeks. They claim they don’t buy anymore groceries when out bc the other client will eat it? There are solutions to that get him a mini fridge with a lock not deprive him of nurturing food. They both run out of meds frequently and it takes weeks for them to fill them when they do. I’ll try to shorten this up the other client is related to the bosses gf who is the assistant manager. She told the other weekend girl we have to start writing incident reports every time he has one no matter how small bc the state is trying to take away his benefits because they don’t think he needs them. Mind you he wants to live with his mom, he does have psych meds THAT HE RUNS OUT OF AND DOESNT GET REFILLED FOR WEEKS. so that contributes to him not getting better and he has a lot more behavior incidents when this happens. But I’ll quickly list more last night the assistant manager came at 11 and was eating their food and took a whole package of hot dogs even though she has a sign I watched her write and stick on the fridge that says staff should not eat the clients food no exceptions. The only house manager is the one I talked about before and it’s for my 2 clients. None of the other clients have one but I’m wondering if the state thinks they do and someone is getting paid that money somehow. The nonverbal one had codeine syrup when he was sick there was  a line drawn with sharpie on the bottle but the liquid kept getting lower and lower and now the bottle isn’t even in his medicine drawer anymore and I never saw anyone mark in the med chart that it was given so there’s that . She complains about too many washer pods being used but doesn’t ask us where’s the codeine? lol am I crazy or does this stuff need to be reported? Also the boss and assistant manager are breaking up and I was told(this is hearsay) that she called him and on speaker phone asked was he fing other employees in the clients houses and the boss said to her “you mean like we used to?” And I believe that for real. Also the assistant occasionally smells like weed so yeah I feel like there scheming going on but I don’t know if they would ever be able to prove it even if I report it because I’m pretty sure people wouldn’t talk bc they also know it wouldn’t be proved and we would get fired and it would still continue the way it is.

We're both gamers so we got on good terms pretty quickly. I'm not shy but I like to keep to my self and focus on my work for the most part. I am also respected by everyone and yet also pretty popular I guess you can say.  Never really hang out because we're both full time.

About 2 months later I see this other girl get hired. Started noticing her looking at me a lot from across the room but we never talked until about a month went by. Seemed kind of shy when I said something in passing to burn the time. Didn't say much of anything. Time goes by and notice she only seemed to get shy around me.

Then one day I was joking around with the guy mentioned above and was teasing him about copying my playlist. I see out of the corner of my eye her bent forward grabbing her sides and bursts out laughing. Makes me chuckle but I brush it off, I tend to get along with people easily.

She starts coming around me more often asking about my music. Start noticing her looking at me more when she thinks I can't see her. Until eventually we kind of chat one day when she's helping me and talk about games. I don't remember how we got to the topic but she asked me if I was seeing anyone.

I said "" I'm looking but I'm not asking anyone out because.."" She cuts me off.

Her "" You want effort?""

Me a little surprised ""..Yes, exactly.""

I also explained why because last year I had the misfortune to date a narcissistic borderline and explained my hatred for cheaters, and my no exceptions boundaries. I asked her if she was seeing anyone and she mentions a boyfriend of 4 yrs. I kind of shrug it off as her being curious and friendly and we talk about Baldur's Gate 3 and tease her about her romance choice making her smile and blush.

Then seemingly out of no where she always at my side when she's free, taking little opportunities to ""accidently"" brush against me. Then again one day I'm joking around with the guy I mentioned above about something about me. When I revealed this info about my self I didn't notice her behind me and I hear her literally shouts in disbelief, I turn around and she's leaning forward slack jawed in awe. Made me smile honestly.

About a day or two later and I ask her something work related and she just turns and stairs deeply into my eyes. I'm no stranger to dating and woman so I know what that look means, but I begrudgingly admit I also got lost in her eyes. I snap back into reality after about a 7 second mental hiatus and remind my self I don't want a woman who cheats. So I just give her space.

A few days later she told me that her and the guy I mentioned above are siblings kind of shocked me. Hair color aside they don't look alike. And later that day also over heard her complaining to him that her boyfriends was ""stalking"" her every move.

Which leads to now. She really going out of her way to asking me if I need help with anything, asking me if I wanted her to do anything, buying me coffee simply because I wanted one, and even flat out held the back side of my hand for a good 10 seconds. Her brother seems to know she's interested but also seems cool with it.

I am interested but I refuse to do ANYTHING unless she's single. But I'm also getting flash backs from my narc ex abuse. So I feel like I may not be thinking clearly, over thinking, or just reacting from my past trauma. Also I don't hook up, I think it's very gross. I've mentioned this to multiple people including her brother.

Should I just continue to do nothing as I have been?

The Bravo one seems to easily remove a bunch of kinds of stains that the others do not even touch. Things like coffee and red wine come out fine. If there is a metal serving tray on the counter, or even aluminum foil, it will leave behind gray streaks that won't come out with anything but the Bravo.

But here is a new puzzling stain: https://imgur.com/a/ysEjlCf

I am not even sure what it is. I think it may just be left behind from a rubber foot of something that was on the counter, like a tire burning rubber for a poor analogy.

I’ll try to keep this brief but I gotta give some context. I went to theatre college with this girl for a couple years until I dropped out my second year. (Not my proudest moment lmao) We don’t really know each other super well, but we’re like one degree apart with a bunch of mutual friends and we even worked at the same store for a while. So we’re reasonably familiar and friendly with each other. 

Recently, I found her on Hinge, and asked her if she wanted to go out for coffee or dinner sometime. She was very up front about her life being super busy and she was “in no place for dating” rn. Which obviously is fine. Initially we were still set up to meet bc she was still down to go get coffee but she ended up canceling the day of, which was a bummer, but still, I wanted to be respectful. 

Even more recently we started working on a show together. She’s still busy as hell lmao. But I expressed to my best friend how I wished she wasn’t as busy so I would feel like I had a shot, and basically what he said to me was “ofc she doesn’t have time for you, you guys don’t really know each other. But just bc she doesn’t have time to date doesn’t mean you can’t flirt, it’s not that black and white.” He also said “you gotta stop shooting yourself in the foot”

I would love to get to know her better, but my friend is right, I usually see things like this as black and white, and I really want to be respectful of her and what she wants. Can I still flirt with her like he suggested, and if so how do I do it without coming off pushy? 

TLDR: There’s this girl I like and am only kinda familiar with, but she says she’s too busy to date. Can I flirt with her/get to know her better without coming off pushy or disrespectful? If so how? ",0,1730176500.0,AskMen,2,0.5,False

1gemf57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gemf57/is_there_still_hope/,Is There Still Hope? ,"Hi! I'm 26 years old and my boyfriend also has the same age as me. I just moved out a few months ago this year. I'm a full-time online ESL teacher and I have some private students too. While my boyfriend doesn't have a job because he was not able to graduate highschool. He tried applying for jobs, but it's either it's too far for him, the salary is low, or the companies just plainly don't reach out. He also blames his mom. Because if it wasn't for her using his tuition fee for a failed business, he would probably be a graduate now and have savings.  

A lot has happened between the both of us. I pay for EVERYTHING including the rent, the electric bill, the water bill, the internet bill, the foods, and so on. Even our commute sometimes. 

He would sometimes pay for some snacks whenever his friend asks some help in this game in which you can earn lots of money if you invest most especially lots of money. 

I have been having financially troubles ever since due to a low income salary and two days off. I have also been adjusting more hours just to survive. 

We've had fights back and forth most especially about money troubles. He said that he cooks and he cleans, and that is also tiring for him. He also helps me to fix things at home such as some appliances or furnitures. He says that I don't appreciate it.

We have never been on a date. But we do have sex. It has been an issue as well because we haven't had sex since probably last month. I would always reject because I feel forced and I feel exhausted from work. I don't get why I need to give him a reward for it. 

He is also complaining sometimes every time we fight that I don't buy him what he wants such as food or surprises. I did. But only very rarely as I learned my lesson living with him for months now. 

Yes, his parents has a home and he also has siblings. When he needs to go back home for a while due to some holidays or ocassions, he goes back home but he sometimes asks his mother or sibling for help in regards to his commute. 

The reason why I stayed with him is because I thought that there would be a change. Our anniversary is this year, December. I gave him an ultimatum that if nothing changes, we can break up. 

He wanted to start a kimchi business after how many attempts and convincing. Now it's just stuck in the fridge and instead of selling it to people, he decides to sell it all to his sister instead. 

There were some harsh words coming from the both of us sometimes that may lead to emotional abuse. He also attempted to pack his bag and leave, but he doesn't. He always says that he's just trying to scare me. He attempted to hurt me (also me) whenever we had fights before or whenever I wanted to leave my place for a while, but nothing serious. 

I don't know what to do and I'm lost. I'm also supporting my two dogs and their needs. I also have my mother who I tend to treat out with food and coffee. She'e a senior and she's a housewife who also depends on my dad. My dad offers to help out financially sometimes to me, and he also supports me by buying me presents such as things I need at home. He's living in another country, by the way.

Community support is the lifeblood of our fight, and we’re grateful to have businesses across our region standing with us. Whether it’s a post on social media, a hot cup of coffee, a stack of firewood, or an offer of temporary work, your contributions help us to hold the line for as long as it takes. We couldn't make the difference we are making without the community having our back.

Although this is just a partial list of the businesses that have gone above and beyond for our members, we need to thank you for all you have done to support our fight.

It seems as if we have gotten a load of firewood from every corner of the state, and believe me, it is appreciated, especially on cold nights and colder mornings. Your support ensures our members stay warm, and we couldn't do it without the wood dropped off at the various halls.

Local businesses have gone the extra mile for our members. Round Table Pizza in Lynnwood and Puyallup keeps spirits up with their yummy, generous pizza donations. Seattle Strike HQ has been the bearer of crates of produce from Artemis Farms in Woodinville and Goblin Farm in Woodinville. Just last week, IAM 751 members were gifted nearly 1200 pounds of grapes. Jersey Mike’s Subs have kept our people fed in Frederickson and CaveMan Kitchen in Kent made sure that no one walked the line hungry in Renton. SPEEA members show up weekly with items like sandwiches and water to every strike line, and the owner of Snohomish Vape and Brew makes sure to tell our story on social media to all who will listen.

And to those offering work - The New Mexicans Restaurant in Everett, Trophy Lake Golf Course in Port Orchard, Stoneway Roofing, and Secoma Lanes in Federal Way - you’re not just providing a paycheck; you’re offering stability to our members so they can continue this fight.

This isn’t just our fight - this is every worker's fight, and every community those workers call home will benefit in the end. All workers and their families deserve dignity and respect for what they do to make the places we live better for everyone. Thank you for standing with us in solidarity and for taking on this fight!

1gembaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gembaz/better_films_by_alice_thompson/,'Better Films' by Alice Thompson,"My brother has always had a dream of being a great filmmaker.

For as long as I can remember it’s been his obsession. He got a video camera for his eighth birthday and would literally film everything with it, even the most mundane things. He would have us do ‘interviews’ for the camera, make little movies for himself. I thought it was cute at first, I really did. I would always help him with whatever little ‘project’ he was doing this time.

As time went on though something started to change. I can’t really say what made him the way he was but he became increasingly arrogant, increasingly difficult. Our parents definitely spoiled him. Spent a small fortune making sure he got the education he needed to pursue his dream of becoming a director, paid for any of the expensive equipment he needed for making and editing his own little movies, helped pay the salaries of any crew or actors he hired for the little short films he produced.

Maybe it was that which made him become so arrogant and mean spirited. But increasingly he became that worst kind of cliché…the ‘artist’ obsessed with their ‘vision’ and treating everyone in their lives like crap, the self-centered, petulant child in an adult's body. I’d like to say that I called him out on any of this but the sad fact is that I went right along with him on it.

It started in his teens. Verbal abuse and the occasional slap any time that I didn’t do something right or quickly enough for his liking. I should have stood up to him, told him to get lost. But I found myself totally under his thumb, unable to say no or simply get him out of my life. To be honest, looking back, I can see just how unhealthy the whole thing was.

Now before you go getting the wrong idea there was never anything incestuous here. My brother was just a bully, a little tyrant who enjoyed bossing people around and I basically became his personal servant. He would belittle me and everything I thought, said or tried to do. Any time I tried to build myself up, he’d tear me down and make me feel like I couldn’t accomplish anything on my own, couldn’t even survive out there without him.

I should have known better I suppose but it had started from when we were so young that honestly a part of me came to genuinely believe the things he said. A part of me was too scared of trying to make it out there in the big wide world by myself that I put up with my brother's constant bullying and taunting and increasingly shrill, angry demands because I was scared of being alone, being cut off from the only family I had left.

Our parents had passed away by this point and we had no contact with the rest of the family. Without my brother I’d be all by myself…his overbearing presence in my life had prevented me from making any real friends and the thought of trying to build a life for myself BY myself was one that just terrified me.

So I did as I was told.

He would say ‘Joan, get me coffee’ and I’d drive all the way across town to the one Starbucks he liked to get him coffee. He’d say he needed extras and I’d devote weeks of my life to arranging and carrying out interviews. He’d demand some expensive piece of equipment and I’d spend however much it cost to get it.

That was my life now. My brother's P.A/maid.

The subject of my brother's short films and mini-documentaries had become increasingly dark and surreal over the years. He would create short, strange and frightening little pieces designed only to unsettle and scare. Or sometimes just ones that were so bizarre, so utterly devoid of plot, logic or reason that it was impossible to tell what, if anything, he was trying to achieve or convey with them.

His documentaries were much the same. He would either film about gang crime, serial killers and rapes or else create disjointed scenes. He once filmed a dog, starving and injured on the street for several hours. Just filming it struggling to move, to breathe. Just filmed the thing's pain. Some nights when I went down to get a glass of water I would see him sat there in the lounge, in the dark, watching these movies he made. Just staring at the screen.

And then one day he told me about what his newest film was to be about.

It turned out that he’d begun to hear stories of an urban legend in the film industry. It wasn’t something that was widely talked about or acknowledged and the people who DID talk about it always seemed to do so with a certain nervousness and paranoia, as if afraid that even mentioning it was dangerous.

It was called Better Films.

Supposedly it was a studio or individual who made incredibly strange movies. None of those we talked to who would admit to having watched a Better Films production would go into any detail about what was on the tapes (And the films were ONLY available on VHS from what we could uncover) but all of them seemed to be incredibly disturbed by what they had seen.

One had gone so far as to remove anything from their home that could play video or audio.

A guy who ran a small DVD and video store told us that he’d met with some representatives of Better Films just once, a pair of men dressed in red suits. He’d described them as looking like they’d been ‘Mutilated’ and claimed that one had been missing an eye and an ear while another was minus a hand and his nose. The scarring around these wounds looked ugly and raw.

They’d given him a business card which had nothing on it except for the logo (A cartoonish, childlike drawing of a frowning face) and the tagline ‘Making Better Films for a Better Audience’ along with a website address where they claimed he could purchase their titles for his store if he wished to help ‘Support independent art’.

He’d checked it out, expecting some kind of artsy foreign stuff in black and white. He had instead found a site full of strange and confusing clips that left him scratching his head and that provided no clear way to order ANYTHING. He said the whole web page appeared to be in Japanese.

And yet a week later a black bin bag was on the front step of his shop and inside were several tapes, all with the Better Films logo on their labels. We asked him if he still had the tapes and my brother in particular was very insistent that we get to watch them. The man refused and my brother offered him increasingly large sums of money to buy or borrow one of the tapes. Finally, the man just held up a finger to my brother's lips, before speaking.

“Now you listen to me and listen good, boy. I’ve seen your type. I know the look you got in your eye right now. I get a lot of weirdos in here, browsing the adult section, asking if I’ve got anything ‘Stronger’.

""I know what you’re after. I know what you’re thinking. So I’m gonna tell you this and then you’re gonna leave my store.

""What’s on those tapes ain’t no illegal little thrill for some gore hound trying to find himself a real life snuff movie.

""What’s on those tapes isn’t anything like what you’re imagining.

""What’s on those tapes is WORSE.

""And I ain’t selling or renting them to no one…especially not some half-wit little pervert with more money than sense.”

My brother stormed out in a rage with me following close behind. As I left the store owner called out to me. I turned to see him looking at me, with an expression of genuine concern on his face now.

“You want my advice, you stay away from him, Miss. Things he’s looking into, you don’t want nothing to do with.”

I suppose I should have taken his advice. But by this point I doubt there was anything that could convince me to abandon my brother, so great was the hold he had over me. And so I continued to assist him as he dug deeper and deeper into the mystery of Better Films.

We managed to piece a few things together. The earliest encounter anyone seemed to have had with their work seemed to be in the mid-sixties. One person we spoke to claimed that he’d known someone who’d been in a movie for them in the mid-seventies, a porn star who’d been hired right off the set of a film he’d been doing and had gone missing for almost seven months. He’d come back with a lot of cash and a hell of a lot of bad dreams.

Another said that the company went back even further, that there’d been something called Better Productions back before there’d even been silent films. Said her mother had told her stories that she’d heard from her grandmother who’d heard them from her grandmother. Some spooky bogeyman stuff about some performer named Elizabeth Walker.

We even found someone who claimed to have grown up watching a TV show Better Films had made. Sunshine Street, she said it had been called and she went on and on about how strange it had been and how she’d always remembered that logo…it was the first thing that had come to mind when she’d heard the name. She said it always used to creep her out, the way the frown would curve into a smile at the end of each episode. The animation looked eerie, that was how she described it.

And then my brother came home one day with a woman. A woman who he claimed was a producer who worked at Better Films.

I was dumbfounded. For all the work we had put into this I hadn’t expected us to get anywhere. To be honest I was pretty much convinced the whole thing was just some ghost story, that if there ever had been a ‘Better Films’ there was nothing more to it than some low budget production company that had made a few creepy little flicks and then folded up. All the weirdness around it, all the little hints and dark suggestions we’d gotten about there being something more sinister about the whole thing, I’d put that down to just people making stuff up.

Or at the very least, people having heard various stories about Better Films from unreliable sources and then passing them along.

But here was someone who claimed to work for the company, in the flesh.

She introduced herself as Ms Kismet. Her hair was a bright red, almost certainly dyed. I can’t believe that any hair could be naturally as bright as hers looked. She dressed in a red suit and like the men our ‘friend’ at the video store had described, she looked as though someone had gone out of their way to mutilate her body.

One eye was missing, as was an ear and her nose. Three fingers were missing from her right hand as well. I tried hard not to stare but all of these looked like they had been done so crudely, so violently that it made me wince.

She and my brother spoke at length for some time. I was not allowed to listen in or take part in whatever they were talking about but after a while they stepped out of the lounge and my brother asked to speak with me alone for a moment.

He told me that he had convinced the woman to let him actually come to the filming of one of Better Films movies and to meet with the director responsible for their work. To actually interview people who worked at the highest levels of this production company and get the real story about what it was they did.

However to secure this he’d had to offer the woman a form of ‘Payment’ he said. And that payment was her getting to spend a night with me, where I would do anything she wished.

I could have slapped him.

I wanted to hit him. Instead I just yelled, told him that this was too much. That I wasn’t going to have him selling me like his personal property, like a slave. He shrugged, seeming not to care about my anger, my hurt.

“It’s not that big of a deal. You like women, right? You’ll probably enjoy it. And she’s promised that you won’t be hurt in any way.”

His tone was cold, emotionless. It was clear that he couldn’t care less whether I’d be hurt or not, couldn’t care less what this person he knew nothing about and had only just met wanted to do with me. That he didn’t give a damn about my wellbeing or my safety, that I was just another tool for him to use to make his damn movies.

“Oh well that makes it perfectly okay then! And while you were selling me off to this total stranger did it occur to you to ask what I thought about it? To ask for my consent, my opinion on whether or not I want to have to spend a night with some woman who for all we know makes a hobby out of making snuff movies?”

He stared at me for a few moments, his expression totally unreadable. And then, slowly, he spoke.

“If you don’t like it then of course I can’t force you to do it. You can say no. You can refuse.

""Just like I can refuse to let you continue to live here with me. Just like I can refuse to support you financially anymore.

""But don’t worry. I’m sure there are plenty of job opportunities for ugly, witless, talentless little things who barely made it through high school with no real skills or likable qualities.

""I’m sure the local burger joint is just desperate for someone to mop their floors and clean out their grease traps.

""And who knows? Maybe after a year or two you’ll be able to afford a place that barely has any roaches or rodents scurrying about in it. It’s not like anyone will be able to stand you long enough to come visit so really it won’t matter what it looks like.

""You’ll be the only one living out your sad, lonely life in it.”

I felt like I would cry. I wanted to tell him he was wrong, to go to hell. I wanted to storm out and never see or talk to him again. But part of me kept telling me that he was right, that I was everything he said I was. A loser, an idiot without any skills or good qualities about me. A stupid, pathetic child who wouldn’t survive without him.

I felt like garbage, like dirt. I felt the way he had always made me feel, for as long as I could remember now. And meekly I just mumbled that I would do it, that I would agree to spending a night with Ms Kismet.

We met at a motel, a sleazy looking place on the edge of town. She had sorted out a room for the night and told me to come alone, with one of my brother's cameras. I was terrified, more and more as I walked to the room she had told me to come to, terrified of what she might do to me, of what could happen. If she killed me my brother would probably help her hide the body.

I knocked and I heard her familiar voice tell me to enter. The room was pitch black as I stepped in, almost impossible to see. I could make out Ms Kismet, sat in a chair beside the bed. There was a knife on the table beside her. I have never felt more scared, more utterly frightened for my life than I did in that moment.

“Sit on the bed. And start filming,” she said. My legs shaking, I somehow managed to make myself walk over to it and do as she asked, sitting down and swinging the camera up to film her. I began to ask what she wanted me to do, what she wanted me to film. She just told me to keep the camera rolling and not stop until she instructed me to. Nothing else.

She whistled loudly and from the bathroom a dog came limping out. It looked like it hadn’t been fed in days, thin and unhealthy looking. As I watched, Ms Kismet picked up the knife from the table…and began to slice lines into her hand.

My jaw dropped. As I watched, as I filmed, she cut deeply into her own flesh, blood beginning to pour from the wound. She lowered her hand to within reach of the starving animal and allowed the dog to lap at the blood now trickling from the fresh cut. After a while she would withdraw her hand and repeat the process, cutting into her hand and then her arm, slicing deep wounds into her skin and letting the dog drink her blood.

I felt ill. Worse was the look on her face as she did it, that rictus grin that never changed, never left her. She kept that horrible forced smile on her face no matter how much or how deeply she cut herself, looking like something out of a nightmare. Sat there in the dark, smiling that awful smile.

Finally she put the knife down and reached into the drawer of the table it had lain upon. She withdrew a pair of scissors and, as I watched, placed the little finger of her right hand in-between them. Slowly, she closed the blades around that digit.

Do you know what it sounds like, the crunch of bone as a finger is severed by a pair of scissors? I do now. I could feel the vomit rising in my throat as she slowly cut off that finger, the grin still fixed to her face as she cut through flesh and bone. It fell to the floor, the dog pouncing on it. And finally she told me I could stop filming.

I was shaking, feeling ill, feeling worse than I had expected to feel. I didn’t know what this was or why she had asked me to do this and I didn’t want to know.

And then suddenly her arm shot out, grabbing me by the leg, her faces inches from mine. The grin was gone now, replaced by a look of pure terror, of the worst kind of fear I had ever seen on another person's face. Her eye darted side to side, her body shook. I could feel the blood from her fresh injuries soaking into my clothes.

“HELP ME!”

The words were desperate, spoken as if it actually caused her pain to say them, coming out as a broken and pathetic whimper.

“For the love of god…please…she’s going to kill us all. Don’t you understand? She’s going to kill us all.

""She’s…”

And then she stopped, her words cutting off. A little squeak of pain came from her as if someone had grabbed her by the throat.

And I realised we weren’t alone in that room.

Stood in the dark, in one corner of the room was another woman. She was dressed in a tuxedo, with a featureless white latex mask over her face. There were no eye holes in the mask and yet somehow, as she stood there motionless in the dark, I felt that she was looking at us. That she could see us, could see me. That she was studying me intently, watching me very closely indeed.

I felt more afraid than ever before. That motionless woman in the white mask, stood silently in the blackness made my heart pound, made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I had to get out of this room. I stood up, turned and ran. I ran out of the room, down the stairs, out into the parking lot. I didn’t even bother to get into my car, I just ran out into the street and away from that motel.

Away from Ms Kismet.

Away from the woman in the white mask.

It was the next day that Ms Kismet showed up at my brother's home. She was all smiles once again and thanked me for my time. My brother had asked no questions about what had happened, most likely because he couldn’t care less. And he was happy to hear that Ms Kismet would now arrange for him a meeting with their director, at the set of the current production they were working on right now.

Kismet made it quite clear that this invitation was for my brother only, which suited him just fine. He told me to stay at the house and work on editing the footage we’d put together so far and said he’d be back as soon as possible with the interviews with the director and actors involved in Better Films newest movie. He was beaming, clearly happy that he’d gotten his way. That now he would get to finish his movie with actual footage of what Better Films did.

As much as I hated him, in a way I wanted to tell him not to go. In a way I was actually scared for him, worried about what might happen. He was a bastard but he was my brother. But I kept my mouth shut and let him go off with Ms Kismet, waiting for his return.

And I waited.

And waited.

After it had been several hours I started to worry.

When he hadn’t returned at the days end I called the police. They told me that I had to wait a few days to file a missing persons report and told me not to worry, that most of the time people showed up long before that time had passed.

My brother didn’t. And so I went to the cops and I told them about him and about what he’d been working on and about Ms Kismet. I described her to them and told them about Better Films which they reacted to sceptically…I can’t say I blame them. I told them about the woman in the white mask and they looked at me like I was crazy or making it up.

Again, I really can’t hold that against them. The whole thing was so bizarre and unsettling that I don’t know that I would have believed it if someone told me about it. They told me they would look into it and said they would be in touch with any developments in the case, anything they managed to turn up. They told me not to worry about my brother, that they were certain he would turn up.

The longer I waited without news, the less I worried though. The less I cared about him at all. Finally free of his bullying, his endless taunts and insults I found myself becoming more confident, more assured. I began to go out. I began to talk to people, to actually start to make friends. I even met a girl at a little bar not far from my brother’s house who I began to see as more than friends.

I started sorting out job interviews. I started feeling good about myself, looking in the mirror and not feeling like crap for once. I felt happy, actually happy for the first time in a very long time indeed. I felt like I had worth and value and that I could make it on my own.

A package came a few months ago. It had no stamp, no address and nothing written on it. Just a brown package, left on the doorstep of my brother’s place. I opened it up to find a video cassette inside, with a label on it that simply read ‘We make documentaries too’

I was worried now. Nervous and yet curious at the same time, not wanting to know what was on the tape and needing to know at the same time. I walked over to the television and slid the tape into the old VCR my brother still owned that I had never bothered to throw out since he had gone missing. It began to play.

It was footage of us. Footage of us going around to talk to people about Better Films. Footage of us going into the video store where we’d met the man who claimed to have seen some of Better Films movies, footage of us going to the homes of those people we’d interviewed about this, footage of us walking down the street going to and from places.

On several occasions it zoomed in on my brother, whoever was behind the camera seeming to be focused on him. I stared at it, a chill running through me. How long had they been filming us for? How long had they been following us, watching our every move? How long had they known about us before Ms Kismet had met with my brother?

The tape went to static for a few moments and I thought it was over. I was wrong. Red light spilled out of the screen as the picture returned, bringing with it an agonised chorus of screams and howls of agony. On the screen was my brother.

He was suspended by what looked like metal hooks, rusty metal hooks, his body hanging from them in a veritable maze of razor wire. The wire wound around his body, cutting into his flesh, seeming to move like metal snakes. Whoever was manipulating the wire was off screen but the effects were very clear. He was missing a hand, a leg and his ears, his mouth open wide.

Screams were all around. The source of them was not visible but I could hear what sounded like dozens of voices all screaming with him, all howling and shrieking in pain. His eyes were wide and terrified, his body jerking and twitching as he screamed the same words over and over again, the same two words.

“HELP ME!”

I stood there, staring at the scene for a moment. My brother trapped somewhere, in what appeared to be a private hell on earth. Having god knows what else done to him by these people for reasons I would probably never know. I walked over to the set. I turned off the tape. I unplugged the VCR and the TV.

And, knowing that I would never mention this tape to anyone I knew, I whispered a few words to myself.

“No I won’t, brother.”

I burned the tape.

To this day my brother has never been found.",1,1730175667.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1gem9s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1gem9s2/delonghi_eletta_whistling_noise/,DeLonghi Eletta Whistling Noise,"I just purchased a new DeLonghi Eletta Explore, which replaced my first generation Dinamica.  For the first couple of weeks, it worked perfectly and produced many excellent coffee drinks.

The other night I was making a Long coffee, as I do every night, and was greeted by a loud whistling sound, which lasted only a couple of seconds.  I didn’t think much of it, but the next day, while preparing a Latté for my wife, I was once again greeted by the same sound, only this time it didn’t stop.  The milk cycle went without a hitch, but when it started to produce the espresso shot, it once again made a very loud whistling sound, (starts 18 seconds into the video). 

I flushed the system as you would to clear an air lock, but it made no difference. I found that any espresso drink produced this sound, but it did not happen if I just made hot water, which produces a lower pressure This leads me to believe there might be an internal leak, or a problem with the pump.

I’m curious if anyone out there has experienced a similar problem and how you resolved it.  If I can’t correct it, my dealer has agreed to replace the machine, but I want to make sure it’s not something simple that I’m overlooking, before I do.

I started to struggle a bit with making connections in here. I am just looking for a buddy or buddies to go out for a beer and chill, party, mingle, or do whatever, basically see where the night takes us. I don't mind some popular tourist places and red lights; I mean, why not? Nice company, pretty girls, relatively cheap beer, and a laid-back atmosphere. I am not into posh clubs, but I can be convinced otherwise :D. I am not into weed but it doesn't bother me at all, whatever makes you happy.

Is anyone in a similar situation and wants to connect over a beer, coffee, or grab some lunch together? 

I am just a regular dude from EU, can talk about anything, no judging, totally open-minded, always curious, and generally having a positive mindset.

1gem86q,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gem86q/8700_in_debt_not_helpless_but_where_do_i_start/,$8700 in debt - not helpless but where do I start?,"Hi - Sorry this is so long. I tried to include as much information as possible. I’m new to Reddit but, I really hope this is as helpful as I think it will be! 

A little background- 
I’m 31 and, unfortunately, have only started panicking about money over the last year or so. I live alone for the first time and one of my dogs is getting old so that’s where the panic is stemming from. 
I grew up in a religion/household where you should live simply and thinking about your financial future is pretty pointless… money and material things won’t matter after Armageddon, right? 
Financial advice was not a topic at home. But, my mom talks about debt like “ehh you’ll always owe money to someone anyways”. My dad told me letting small debts go into collections isn’t a big deal. He also never paid his child support in full or on time lol. 

I wouldn’t say I’ve been terrible with money but, I know I can get to a point where I’m able to start an emergency fund for the first time and have a little financial freedom! I’m lucky to be getting a rent discount because of my job, I’m on the companies free health insurance plan, I only drive if I absolutely have to because I wfh, and I get free internet. 

Money breakdown-
I’m roughly $8700 in debt. About $6000 of this is because of Vet bills and my own old medical bills.
Monthly income: $2600 *commission is anywhere from $200-$500
Rent: $1275 
Utilities: $220
Groceries/necessities: $300
Car insurance: $85
Phone: $80
Pets: $225
Therapy: $100
IRS taxes: $25 
Netflix: $18
Card(s) payments: $480 
Total $2808

So… I literally make JUST enough. Pretty frustrating but I’m aware things could be so much worse.
As you can imagine, life happens and some months my paychecks come too late after a bill is due and I have to make a late payment. Rent is always paid first, in full, on time, and there is a feature I just activated to report rent toward to credit score. My score has taken some hits due to late payments this year and is somewhere between 610-660 (Rocket Money and Credit Karma have different scores?). 

Steps I’ve taken-
For starters… I have had serious talks with my friends, family, and my boyfriend to please be mindful and not invite me to eat out, trips, concerts, etc. I’m laying low for a while!

I have started selling more valuable items that I honestly have no use for if I’m in a pinch. Trying really hard to stop relying on the Earnin app to spot me every month. 

Hoping to sell my car very soon! Don’t worry I own it. 
I have been putting in major time and work detailing it on my own… honestly super proud of myself and I enjoy it! I think I have spent a total of $80 on tools and cleaning supplies. Everywhere I was quoted for professional detailing was $300-$600 which I completely understand since I’ve been detailing myself haha 
It’s a 2014 Corolla and I hope to sell it privately for no less than $9000… I just don’t want to get my hopes up and have this be my safety blanket so I’m trying not to be in the mind set of “when I sell my car I’ll be able to___”.

No more nail appointments.
No more lashes.
Haven’t been tattooed since March.
Coffee and eating out is  TREAT. I’m almost too good at eating everything I have before I go grocery shopping. 

So… what would you do if you were me? Debt consolidation? A personal loan? Credit Karma tells me to open a new credit card…?

In a perfect world, pay increases at work get approved for next year and my car sells quickly and for enough to pay off debt. But, we’ll see how it goes! And, at some point, the plan is for my boyfriend move in but, he needs to fulfill his current lease. I just don’t want to be naive and count of maybe plans! 

Thank you in advance! Truly any advice is helpful!
