1pg987y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pg987y,Another Enagic Flex Fail: Team Rise Up's 2.8 Milly in Commissions,"TeamRiseUp members are bragging about doing **$2.8M in commissions** this year.  


**LET’S MATH, SHALL WE? (\*insert a sip of tea and a hot-sip-wince)**

YouTuber *thisismallory* estimated around **400 reps** on this team. TeamRiseUp’s own page claims **“500+ Health-Conscious Entrepreneurs.”** Hard to know how many of those are actual Enagic distributors vs. Coffee-Enema ButtholeBaristas or whatever other side schemes they’ve folded in — but let’s be generous and use the **lower number: 400**.

**$2.8M ÷ 400 = $7,000 salary per person per year.**  
 And because MLMs funnel money straight upward, (duh), the **median** income is almost certainly just a few *hundred* dollars **after** expenses.

To pay every rep even the **2025 U.S. poverty line ($15,650/yr)**, that $2.8M pool could only support **178 people**.

So either:

* They have **400–500 reps** and virtually **no one makes a living wage**, or  
* They have **178 reps** and they **lied about their team size**.  

Pick one. . . <3 HUN.

And how much of that $2.8M commish is just reps **buying their own machines**, their funnels, their quotas, and “earning” commissions off themselves? Be sure to subtract that. The Trifecta/Quad Strategy — where you’re buying your own crap so you can pretend you’re making money — isn’t entrepreneurship. It’s **self-cannibalizing revenue**, the MLM equivalent of eating your own arm to stay alive.

If Enagic were a movie, it would be **127 Hours. Or legit something with Gremlins.**

They mock “traditional jobs” for funneling money to the top 1%…  
while building a **mini-1%** of their own, where a handful get rich and hundreds work as unpaid marketers who can’t even scrape a living wage.

The difference?

**Real companies** are legally required to pay their workers a living wage.  

**Enagic isn’t.** And they’re *so very* proud of that.

""But I SEE YOU MAMA! DROP ME A DM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE!""

Hope you’re all easing into the week with a clear head and a full cup of coffee. Precious metals have been putting on quite a show lately — gold flirting with new highs, silver waking up with real momentum, and the global outlook doing what it does best: keeping everyone on their toes. Between central banks stacking metal like it’s going out of style, supply tightening, and geopolitical “surprises” popping up like holiday lights, the long-term trend still feels strong and steady.

If you ask me, these are the moments where stacking smart — especially below spot — puts you ahead of the curve. Nothing wrong with staying prepared while the world sorts itself out.

We were lucky enough to get everyone together again this year.  The Opera House has replaced their seating, a very enjoyable surprise.  

Since one of us has limited mobility we decided to try the restaurant on the lower level, Prelude. The menu is limited, but we enjoyed cocktails and coffee and the whole group tried the buffet.  Even our celiac member had very nice choices.  Salads were very good, as was the salmon and beef.  The desserts were also appreciated, although the opera cake was a modified version of what we expected.

I currently have three different types of coffee beans and flavours, all medium–light roast, but I can only taste acidity. All three beans taste slightly acidic with no sweetness, sour etc. and only very small different to each other. Can you guys help me adjust my recipe?

My current equipment:

Timemore C3 ESP hand grinder (slightly fine grind)

Hario V60 Switch (and V60 Neo)

My current method is based on James Hoffmann’s iced pour-over recipe:

90g of ice

15g of coffee

150ml of hot water

And 3 drops of 20% saline water

I pour 150ml of hot water and pour coffee in, lightly stir, let it run until 3:30, then flip the switch.

All three beans are medium–light roast, roasted on 20/11/2025.

I would also love to have hot coffee pour over recipe. It would be extremely nice if you guys can share a recipe. Thank you very much.

Started my PhD this semester. Of course it’s *now*, after taking a year off to address the autistic burnout, that my ADHD actually starts to affect my academic performance. Been barely keeping my head above water, this one class is actually the worst class I’ve ever taken in my life, so it amplifies my ADHD. I don’t procrastinate as much as in undergrad, I start my assignments pretty much as soon as im done with the previous one but it takes me so so long after sitting down at my desk to actually start my work and even then I can rarely sustain focus. I used to be a huge procrastinator but able to use my anxiety to hyperfocus at the last minute, but I’m not getting that anxiety boost anymore. And the problems themselves are often a half-day commitment (I’m in a physics program). I’ve submitted half my assignments for this one class late, my graders are very forgiving thankfully. If I want to keep up, I need to be working 8-10 hour days, but I physically can’t. I tried for a while, didn’t get great sleep, and it made me sick for 2 weeks (like a minor cold but it was annoying). I’ve tried every ADHD hack under the sun, I’ve consumed enough coffee per day to kill a small horse, I have screen time limits on all my socials. Regardless assignments and grading have snowballed and now it’s biting me in the ass. I have been grinding as much as I can this week and I’m getting sick again. I need meds but I’ve had no time this semester to actually find and go to a psychiatrist. In 2 days I will be able to coast into my last final. It will be over soon, and I don’t think any class will be this bad again. But it really, really sucks and feels impossible right now. And I don’t know if I can do it.

1pg8rg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1pg8rg7/godslayer_22_af1/,Godslayer - 22: AF-1,"Victor’s ship descended through the clouds, toward a vast ocean, stretching on toward a distant horizon. The sun shone brightly, illuminating sparse patches of green. Countless islands forming a rocky archipelago. A few native birds soared closer to the water, an unidentified species that nobody would ever care to categorize, nesting amongst stone cliffs. 

Vi looked out at the waters with a quiet awe. She had seen oceans before, but the majestic beauty of this place could not be ignored. 

The door to the cockpit opened and Jean wandered in, leaning against the back of Victor’s seat as he piloted the ship. She yawned and took a sip of her coffee.

   “Looks like we made it,” She noted.

   “So we did. You’ll need to give us some direction from here though.” Victor said.

“Yeah, yeah… I know. Just lemme just orient myself,” She said, looking down at the control panel. “If memory serves me right, you’re gonna want to head west by about 4000 kilometers. There’s a deeper section of the ocean over there, and another cluster of islands just past it. You’re looking for one of those. It’ll be one of the bigger ones. There’s a sinkhole dead in the center. It’s hard to miss.”

Victor nodded and turned the ship west.

   “Vi, how’s the atmosphere?” He asked.

   “Breathable.” She replied, “Ideal for life. No signs of terraforming though. This almost seems natural.”

   “Perfect abode for a God,” Jean said before turning to leave the cockpit. She noticed Freya sitting at the table in the common area, her head buried in her hands. It looked like she’d fallen asleep while working on her droneblade. Jean didn’t bother waking her yet. They still had some time before they were due to reach the sinkhole.

Noah sluggishly appeared from the hallway, his hair a little messy from his attempt at sleep. 

   “I see the land outside the porthole,” He said with a yawn. “Are we there?”

   “Well, well, good morning sunshine,” Jean said. “Coffee?”

She nodded toward the machine, and Noah went over to get himself a cup. He looked over at Freya, but didn’t wake her yet. Mason and Cedar came next, the latter looking as though she hadn’t slept at all. Her movements were slow and heavy. There was a faraway look in her eye. Jean watched them quietly and once they got their coffee, she went to put on a fresh pot.

Luna came out next. She gave a cursory *‘Mornin’* before heading for the kitchen to cook something, and make sure everyone was fed. The sound of the ship coming to life drew out Cassandra, and soon just about every seat at the table was filled.

The ship continued onwards, toward a distant landmass… one with a massive sinkhole set in the center, just as Jean had said. Victor could see a faint mist rising over the water, its color a faded pink. He studied it, already knowing what it meant. 

The ship drew closer to the island, circling over the massive sinkhole as it came in for a landing. As they passed over it, Victor peered down into the abyss. The sinkhole ran deep… so deep he could not see the bottom. 

   “Let’s take her down,” Victor said and Vi nodded, helping him bring the ship down for a landing a short distance away from the sinkhole.

The ship came down gently and Victor disabled the engines. Then he and Vi both got up to join the others in the common area.

   “We’ve made landfall,” he said, pausing as Luna fixed him a plate. Scrambled eggs and sausage. He took it and found a seat at the table, leaving a space for Vi open beside him. 

His attention shifted to Jean.

   “I don’t suppose you know where we go from here?”

   “Vaguely,” Jean replied. “There’s a stairwell leading down into the sinkhole… all in all the layout isn’t too dissimilar from the Tower on Pragaras, you’re just going down this time. Then once you reach the bottom, there’s a cavern. Beyond that I can’t help you. I’ve actually never gone inside before. The topographical scans I had back on my old ship mapped out some of the cave systems in this area. I was planning on stowing some product down there, but I never got around to it. Still, that could have been useful… if my ship wasn’t officially scrap.” Her eyes shifted over toward Mason, quiet and accusing. He shifted uneasily in his seat. 

   “Do you remember anything from the scans?” Noah asked.

   “Maybe. I remember that the scans said it ran deep. They weren’t able to map it all out fully and they extended out beneath the ocean.”

   “Could they be flooded?” Vi asked as she sat down. “If they are, it might be better to use the shuttle.”

   “Normally I’d say you’re right, but it’s way too tight for a shuttle down there,” Jean said. “My scans showed no signs of flooding at the time… but I haven’t been here in a while, so who knows if that’s still accurate. I don’t suppose you have any rebreathers or environment suits?”

   “A couple,” Victor said. “This ship was designed and stocked for light exploration. Although if there’s a risk we’ll need to swim, we should know what else might be down there. What do you know about the local fauna?”

   “Typically aquatic or avian. I’ve never seen anything too big in the water, but I’m not gonna tell you it doesn’t exist. And before you ask, the water is drinkable. I never detected any pathogens in it.” 

   “That’s comforting,” Noah said. “I mean, it sounds reasonably safe, so long as we’re careful, right?” 

   “Reasonably,” Victor agreed.

   “Alright then, so who’s going down there?” Luna asked.

   “I am.” 

Freya still remained slumped over, but moved slowly, lifting her head up off the table. She still looked exhausted, but she was clearly awake.

   “Oh hey, she’s awake,” Luna said. 

   “I’ve been awake for a while,” Freya replied.

   “You hungry?”

Freya didn’t respond and Luna took that silence to mean: *‘Yes. Please load me up with eggs and breakfast sausage!’*

   “Anyone else is welcome to come with me,” Freya said. 

   “We’re going with you,” Mason said. Beside him, Cedar gave a single nod. Neither of them stated their motivations, but Freya suspected it was to ensure she didn’t try to kill this God. 

   “You can count me in too,” Luna said as she set a plate down in front of her. Freya stared down at it, pushing the food around with her fork. 

   “And me!” Cassandra added.

   “No,” Mason said, seemingly beating Victor to the punch. Cassandra looked over at both of them, her expression almost a little indignant.

   “Why not? Don’t tell me it’s dangerous. Jean just said it was safe, and you’re all going to be armed!”

   “Reasonably safe,” Jean corrected. “I also said I don’t know exactly what’s down there.”

   “I’ll be fine,” Cassandra said, before glaring a hole through Mason, silently demanding him to relent. He glared right back at her before finally he sighed.

“Fine…” He said, “You can come with us. But you stay close! Got it?”

   “Yes! Yes, of course!” Cassandra said.

Victor’s brow furrowed in disapproval, but he said nothing. 

   “I’ll be going as well,” Noah said, and this time Victor did say something.

   “With all due respect, I need someone here,” he said. “Tetra and I can fly the ship, but if Skye shows up, I’ll need people to man the guns. Vi can only do so much.”

   “I’ll stay with you,” Jean offered. “Not to give the wrong impression, but I’d rather not go down there. I’m not a big fan of caves. Besides, if Vasilios comes, I can probably help out more up here than down there.”

Victor gave a nod.

   “Then that’s settled. Those of you going down should make your preparations. We’ll keep a local comm channel open and power down the ship otherwise. If Vasilios shows up, it might allow us to evade them at least for a little while.”

   “We’re going underground, that could mess with the comms signal,” Luna noted. 

   “We should be fine,” Victor said. “If we’re not, we’ll just throw Noah down the hole.”

   “Hey! Why me?” Noah asked, and Victor chuckled. 

   “It’ll be fine,” He assured them.

He hoped he wasn’t wrong…



\*\*\*



The ramp of the Dom Pérignon extended, and those who’d elected to descend into the sinkhole stepped out. Mason and Cassandra were first, with Cedar a few steps behind. Freya and Luna followed them. 

As she stepped out onto solid ground, Luna looked up, studying this foreign world around them. She could hear the calls of distant birds and the sound of running water. This place felt so peaceful… and yet there was something in the air here. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it. A subtle feeling of being watched.

She adjusted the backpack she wore. She, Freya and Mason were carrying the environmental suits in case they needed them, although she hoped they wouldn’t.

As they approached the sinkhole, she sucked on her teeth nervously, before looking around and drawing closer to Mason, almost as if to protect him.

   “I’ve never been off of Pragaras before…” Cedar said. “I’ve never seen this much water before.”

   “It’s a big galaxy,” Mason said. “Every planet's so different… it’s kinda beautiful, actually.”

   “Yeah,” she replied. “It is…”

She thought about Willow. She wondered what she would have said about this place. Lingering near them, Luna cracked a gentle smile.

“You two make a cute little couple,” she said. 

Cedar blushed and looked over at her, unsure how to respond to that. Mason just chuckled.

Freya picked up the pace, moving ahead of the rest of them toward the edge of the sinkhole. The massive chasm lay before them, mist rising from its depths. Narrow waterfalls snaked their way down through the rocks, plummeting into the depths below. Cedar paused at the sight of it, taking in the view. Cassandra stopped beside her and for a moment they stood, almost dumbstruck by the natural beauty before them.

Freya stared down into the chasm, scanning the rocks for the stairway Jean had mentioned. It did not take her long to find it. It was hard to see amongst the rocks, just a small line of chiseled stones… but it was there.

Wordlesly she gestured for the others to follow her and led them down into the mist. The rock was slippery, so each step needed to be slow and measured. She placed a hand against the wall of the sinkhole to steady herself as they moved ever lower.

   “Careful,” Mason said softly as he descended behind Cassandra. “Watch your step.”

   “I’ve got it!” She assured him. “Don’t worry about me. I’m built sturdy!”

He didn’t look convinced. 

The comms crackled to life.

   *“This is Noah. Just doing a quick comms check. Do you read me?”*

   “Loud and clear,” Freya said. “We’ve started our descent.”

   *“Great. I’ll check in every few minutes, just to make sure we don’t lose contact.”*

   “I thought Victor said we wouldn’t,” Luna asked. 

   *“Better to be sure,”* Victor replied. *“Stay safe down there.”*

   “That’s the plan,” Mason said, before the line went quiet.

Luna looked down toward the bottom of the sinkhole. She could feel the vertigo setting in and pulled back.

   “Hell of a long way down…” she murmured. 

“There’s usually pools of water at the bottom!” Cassandra offered, “So you’d probably survive.”

“From this height? That water would hit like concrete,” Freya said. “Even if you did survive, if there was any kind of current or undertow, it’d be likely to drag you down and who knows how deep these can go…”

Cassandra had no reply to that, and lingered close as they went into the darkness, following the spiraling staircase down. As the sunlight began to fade, there was little more than the sound of flowing water, occasionally broken up by Noah’s periodic check-ins to ensure that comms were still functioning.            

The sinkhole seemed to go on forever. The rock only grew wetter beneath their feet, leaving those who descended clinging to the walls to ensure they did not fall. As the darkness closed in around them, Cedar drew her sword and ignited the flame on it as a makeshift torch. The light reflected off of the glistening rock, although the mist soon became another problem entirely, obscuring their vision the deeper they went until they could barely see the person in front of them.

Still, they kept moving… and at some point, after hours of descent, they found it.

   “Here…” Freya said, before looking back into the white void behind her. “There’s an opening right here!”

Cassandra descended through the mist, followed by Mason and Cedar. 

   “This is it?” Mason asked. He squinted to look at the cavern before them. It was narrow, but they’d be able to fit through.

   “The stairs don’t continue past here…” Cassandra noted. “This has to be it.”

Luna emerged from the mist, and joined them in the cavern.

   “Only one way to find out,” She said. “Who’s going first?”

Cedar stepped forward, her sword held aloft in her hand to lead them into the dark. As the others followed her, Cassandra looked down at her Tac Band.

   “Noah, we’ve reached the bottom. Do you still read us?” She asked.

   *“I read you, although the signal’s getting a little weak,”* Noah replied.  His voice was marred by some static.

Cassandra frowned. 

   “We’ll keep doing the check-ins,” Freya said. “Just to keep an eye on things.”

   *“Agreed. I’ll try you again shortly. Hey, how deep is the water down there?”*

Freya looked over at Luna, who picked up a rock, and tossed it into the mist of the sinkhole. They heard a splash. The two of them traded a look before Freya spoke.

   “No idea. We can’t see a thing,” she confirmed. 

   *“Right… so no diving, then…”* Noah sighed.  

   “Afraid not.” Freya said, cracking a ghost of a smile before she and Luna followed the others into the cavern.             

It was deathly silent inside. There was no noise but the echo of dripping water. The cavern seemed to go on forever, a single long tunnel filled with blinding mist. The deeper they went, the thicker it got, until there was nothing more but the faint, flickering glow of Cedar’s sword to indicate where he was.

   “This mist is freezing…” Cassandra said. “We should’ve brought extra layers…”

   “They say the Sorrowful One is the Goddess of death,” Cedar said softly. “With that in mind, I suppose a temple like this is fitting. A descent into the underworld.”

   “I thought the Hive was a death Goddess?” Luna asked.

   “Kinda,” Cedar said. “The Hive was more about entropy and natural decay. Life ends. New life is born. The end of one cycle and the beginning of the next. The Sorrow is more about spiritual death. The transition of the soul into the afterlife… although in general, she’s usually seen as maintaining order. Death is just part of that order.”

   “What about the other two?” Mason asked.

   “The Endless Sea is a Creation Goddess,” Cedar said. “She’s sort of like the inverse of the Hive. And The Great Bird… I’m really not sure. She was seen as the inverse of the Sorrow, but that’s all I can remember.”

   “Like a Chaos Goddess?” Mason asked.

   “Sort of, but not quite. It was more like-”

A scream from Cassandra interrupted them.

   *“Someone just grabbed my leg!”*

Cedar turned, her blade at the ready.

   “Are you okay?” Mason asked.

   “I… I’m fine but I felt a hand! I know it was a hand! I felt the fingers!” Cassandra insisted. 

Cedar moved closer to her, lowering her sword down to the ground… she expected to see some sort of plant or maybe an insect… but no… it wasn’t either of those things.

Instead she saw fingers. Pale. Reaching… but still.

   “Oh Gods…” she said softly. She looked around. It was hard to see through the mist, but she could see other shapes on the ground around them. Prone figures… faces twisted in agony.

Corpses.

   “Soldiers…” Freya said, eyes narrowing. She could see a Falcon Corporation logo on their uniforms. 

   “They’ve been dead for some time,” Luna said. 

   “Okay but why? What… what did this?” Cassandra asked.

Nobody answered… but they all felt it. The air around them had changed. It had grown colder.

Something was watching them.

Something had been watching them for some time. 

   ***“The Great Bird was a patron of the Void…”*** A low voice said. It was cold, feminine yet detached. ***“She was its warden… if indeed such a place could have a warden. Yet she was not content with her place there… and so we permitted her a modest presence here. An Avatar so she could enjoy the Creation she kept safe… an Avatar you killed.”***

Freya’s entire body grew tense. From the corner of her eye, she saw a shape moving through the mist. Pink eyes shone in the darkness, coldly fixated on her.

   ***“Have you come here to kill me too?”*** The Sorrow asked.

   “N-no…” Cassandra stammerd. “No, please… we aren’t here to fight. We… we seek an audience!”     

   ***“Yet you come bearing weapons… and you come with Her. The killer of my sisters.”***

The flame on Cedar’s sword flickered out. 

   “What are you doing? Turn that back on!” Luna hissed.   
“We’re blind without it!”

   “I’m trying… it won’t come back!” Cedar said. “It’s the mist… I can’t…”

   “Please,” Cassandra said, speaking over them. “We are here to talk. Something horrible is going to happen and we are here to try and stop it. But we can’t do it alone.”

   ***“So you come here to beg for help?”*** The Sorrow asked. ***“And you brought her… why? To threaten me? To talk? Did you think I would accept her, as if her hands were not stained by the blood of my sisters… my precious, foolish sisters. Either you are a fool or you take me for one. Leave this place. We have nothing to discuss.”***

   “Right now, this is bigger than me and you,” Freya said. “The Universe itself is at risk. These people want to protect it. The least you can do is hear them out!”

A low growl echoed through the mist, bestial and angry.

   ***“If your kind wishes to continue with their endeavor to unmake all of creation, I am under no obligation to stop them. Creation is a gift. What you do with it is up to you. Save it? Destroy it? That is your decision.”***

   “These people are here because they’ve decided to save it!” Freya snapped. “You’re really going to turn them away?”

   ***“Why should I involve myself in the affairs of your kind? You yourself have done more harm to the fabric of reality than anyone else.”***

   “And now I’m here,” Freya said. “Trying to help them!”

The Sorrow remained silent for a moment, studying her from the shadows. Finally, it let out a huff.

   ***“Very well… I will wait up ahead and we will talk.”***

The mist around them seemed to shimmer, glowing with a faint pinkish light. Up ahead, they could see a bigger source of light… a chamber at the end of the tunnel.

Cassandra breathed a weak sigh of relief, before looking straight ahead. The hallway was still lined with bodies, countless dead, strewn across the floor. Her relief faded quickly the moment she saw the unspoken threat.	

The five of them hesitated for a moment longer before they continued forward toward the chamber of the Sorrow.

1pg8n41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pg8n41/dating_advice_from_an_older_man_part_2/,Dating Advice From an Older Man part 2.,"Here’s a link to my previous post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/s/s3gllyPoy3

In my first post we focused on you.  Now let’s look at your digs.

Big picture, don’t be a slob.

You need a laundry basket.  Dirty clothes go in the laundry basket, not on the floor.  Wet towels, wash cloths and work out clothes are hung up to dry before going in the laundry basket. 

When the laundry basket is full, you do laundry.  It’s a good idea to separate whites from other colors.  If your laundry basket isn’t full, but starting to smell, you need to do laundry.

After doing laundry, you need to fold your laundry and put it away.  Pants and shirts can be placed on hangers and hung up.  

If your shirts and pants are wrinkled, you should iron them.  You’ll need an ironing board and iron for this.  Don’t worry about starch. Just get the wrinkles out.

Now let’s talk about your bed.  You want nice cotton sheets, 300 to 800 thread count.  These feel nice on the skin.  Not your skin, her skin, understand?  

But she’s not going to approach your bed with a 10 foot pole if your sheets aren’t clean.  If your sheets are so grungy you could lean them against the wall like a sheet of plywood, you’re not gonna get some sweet loving.  If your pillow case looks like you’ve been wiping greasy plates with it, her hair isn’t touching your pillow.  So you need to wash your sheets every 2 weeks or so.  If you have old, grimy sheets, go buy a new set.  Or better yet buy 2 sets.  You put one set on while washing the other.  Get solid colors.

Now you need a bed spread to cover those sheets.  Get something that looks nice, and warm, and comfortable.  I like a cotton quilt personally.  Go with a paisley pattern or geometric shapes.  Avoid boring solid colors or stripes.

Make your bed every morning.  This doesn’t take very long.  Also it’s a good idea to keep a throw on the bed.  Chicks are always cold and like to snuggle up, but don’t want to get under the covers.  

Speaking of beds, you want a bed. A mattress on the floor isn’t a bed.  It’s that simple.  

Your kitchen is next.  After every meal, wash your dishes.  Then dry them (or let them dry) and put them away.  Clean off your stove top and counter top.  Clean out your fridge once a week.  Take out the trash when it’s full.

Don’t leave trash all over the place.  Trash goes in the trash can.  

Now to the bathroom.  Clean the mirror often, with windex.  Wipe the counter top down every day after you finish getting ready. Wipe the faucet handles down as well.  Have a trash can in the bathroom.  Empty it when it’s full.  

The toilet is important.  This is where a lot of guys mess up.  Lift the seat to pee.  If you don’t and get pee on the seat, get a wad of toilet paper and wipe it off.  If you did raise the seat and get pee on the rim, again wipe it off.  Your goal here is if you bring a girl back to your place, and she needs to use the bathroom, she doesn’t see a year’s worth of dried pee covered in pubic hairs.  

You also don’t want her to see skid marks in the toilet bowl.  So have a brush next to your toilet, and use it often.  

The above is basic maintenance.  You still need to spend an hour every month really cleaning your bathroom.  Clean and scrub the shower, sink and toilet bowl.  Mop the floor.  Wash the floor mats (you have those right?)

You need to vacuum once or twice a month.  Weekly if you have pets.  It never hurts to move furniture and vacuum under it.

Dust all surfaces monthly: coffee table, night stand, TV stand, side table etc.  Any flat surface that collects dust.

Get a few house plants.  Pothos, spider plants, mother-in-law’s tongue, peace lily and cast iron plants are all bachelor proof.

Get some art work or pictures to hang on the wall.  Posters of chicks in bikinis don’t count.  

Get some basic furniture:  chest of drawers, couch, table and chairs, some lamps.  

Overall your bachelor pad needs to be cleaner than a barn, but doesn’t need to look like Martha Stewart is your roommate.  ",2,1765079627.0,dating_advice,1,0.75,False

I'm 7+1 and time has been dragging since I found out. I'm not terribly nauseated but a lot of food sounds extremely unappealing. Yet I'm also way hungrier than normal, and all I can stomach is fruit or carb-heavy foods. I had gestational diabetes last pregnancy so every time I eat carbs I feel panicky and sick about making GD more likely again this time- but I literally cannot stomach the stuff I'm ""supposed"" to eat and if I DON'T eat often enough, I feel unwell. I also wasn't this hungry last time so I'm anxious about how much weight I'll gain if I magically don't end up with GD. And I can't stomach coffee, which was my favorite thing I looked forward to every day.

I also strength trained twice a week and walked most days pre-pregnancy, and I need to keep it up to help prevent GD/for my general health - but thinking about exercising makes me feel vaguely nauseated? It's the weirdest thing.

And I'm emetophobic (phobic of vomiting) so even the vaguest nausea makes me anxious. I'm taking b6 + unisom at night and I'm not sure I really need anything stronger. I'm on mental health meds and starting therapy next week, but I just don't know how I'm supposed to go 8 more months feeling like a shell of a person?? I HATE feeling unwell or ""off"" and even the idea of waiting for the second trimester sucks - that's still over a month away and is when I'll probably be diagnosed with GD.

I'm just not having a good time and I'm not sure how to make it better. I don't like admitting this but I often feel like this was a mistake and I've destroyed my own life and am ruining my daughter's, too, since we're having to cancel a lot of future plans due to my likely having GD/eventually having a newborn.

I go to this one gym and since the winter has been upon us, I go way more frequently. I saw this guy there one night, and normally I keep my head down at the gym. I go after work everyday and it’s definitely not my social space.  I like to go in there and go home.  So I went to the store one night after and saw a guy that I saw there at the store. At self checkout he approached me and asked if I was just at the gym. We had a brief introduction and he said oh I’m sure I’ll see you there again.  
Come to find some days later. He is there as am I.  We say hi and talk and get to know each other a bit. Next couple days talk some more.  He eventually asks me for my number saying we should go for coffee.  Now I work in customer service and am very good with people and definitely bubbly when talking to people.  I may have laughed or smiled at him to much? I feel like when you’re a nice female a lot of guys don’t expect this. I gave him my number and said ok sure.  He texted me and with his name a winky face. I kinda immediately knew that he was interested in a different way then I am. I’m not really looking for anything and while I think I should put myself out there,  just dont wanna waste his time.  He asked me the other day if I wanted to do something and we made plans. The other day he asked me if I was getting “fit for our date”. To which I looked at him and said “is that what this is?” And laughed uncomfortably.   We exchanged goodbyes and it was fine and friendly then the next day he asks me what time works etc and tells me he will pick me up.  
I am really not wanting to go and he texted me asking where he should get me. I don’t want to go on this “date” on my day off and I also just don’t wanna feel like I did myself a disservice in not going.

*until my arms can bend a bow of bronze.""*  
\-2 Samuel 22:35

David is best remembered as a great warrior.

When he reminisced on the days of his youth...

No doubt...

It was his awesome exploits on the battlefield that probably came to mind.

Verse 35 references one of those times.

David is giving credit to the Lord for showing him how to fight a Holy War.

And how he was given supernatural strength to handle weapons as no other man could.

We're given an interesting metaphor of David bending a bow made out of steel as opposed to wood.

A bow crafted out of metal packs so much more power than a wooden one.

Thus, when unleashed, the impact of its arrows is far deadlier.

However, few warriors in David's day possessed the skill to handle such an intimidating weapon.

This reminds me of another formidable weapon that believers have access to...

I'm talking about prayer.

Yes, prayer is one of the strongest weapons in the world.

Yet few believers know how to wield it properly.

Why is prayer so powerful?

It is a direct connection to the source of power provided by the Almighty.

The Gentiles have the weak wooden bows they use to pray to their pagan gods.

An Israelite, however, possesses a formidable steel bow that in his hands is directed by the Lord of Hosts.

That's why there is no match for a true prayer warrior....

One who is trained up and really knows how to pray.

Compare this to the average believer, whose faith is little more than Sunday socializing with kids and coffee.

A person who doesn’t really know God because he ignores Scripture *(I mean ONLY the ""Old"" Testament, homies),* is like a wooden bow.

He is weak and ineffective.

His arrows miss most of the time...

And when they hit... 

They barely make a mark.

Ya feel me?

Let those who have ears to hear, listen.

1pg874m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/1pg874m/does_therapy_work/,does therapy work?,"(Inspired by someone else’s post... I realized that I was about to yap excessively in the comments, so I’m making my own post instead.)

I’ve pretty much sworn off therapy, but I also still often “crave” it in a way. I’m a little anti-therapy in some ways, but I do believe it is very useful for many people. 

My last therapist decided to treat me for social anxiety despite telling me I met the criteria for AvPD, and then basically didn’t believe a single thing I said about how I feel. Eventually threatened to terminate because I wasn’t “working hard enough”. (I was working very hard to even go to class and work; I just wasn’t at a point where “invite one coworker out for coffee this week 😃” was something I could do.)

I’ve seen a handful of therapists before and some have been a little helpful about, like, academic stress or whatever but I’ve given up hope with regard to my AvPD. I don’t know if it’s accidental masking or something, but literally nobody ever takes me seriously. I tell them exactly how badly I feel about myself and how I struggle in day to day life and they still decide I am maybe just a little depressed (well, ‘mildly’ bipolar) and anxious. Every time I’ve tried to be honest with a therapist they just project onto me whatever they’ve already decided they feel like treating.

I don’t know what it is about me that makes them all assume I’m an easy patient, and treat me as such. It’s all CBT-adjacent platitudes and advice (“use scented lotion to cure your agoraphobia” is one of my favs), even when they claimed to be able/willing to use other modalities. I have no reason to believe this would be any different with anyone else.

But even so, I sometimes find myself fantasizing about being in therapy in various contexts. Usually as a “character” of sorts (I’m a heavy maladaptive daydreamer) but occasionally as my real self. Generally if I start to think about it I realize it’s just a desire to have someone to talk to relatively openly. There are things I wouldn’t tell a therapist, but there are a lot more things I wouldn’t tell my mom. (I’m not at all emotionally close with anyone else, and at this point I don’t even desire to make friends or find romantic/intimate partners.) I hate the “therapeutic relationship”. I don’t want a therapist who pretends they’re my buddy when the relationship is purely transactional. (I believe it’s transparently insincere to both claim that the emotional support is real and loving *and* that it is strictly one-sided. Just admit that it’s a fake relationship. Whatever. You can’t possibly care that much about somebody who you’ll never speak to again if they stop paying, or, for that matter, who you can drop contact with if they are in a crisis you feel is above your pay grade.)

There’s not a shortage of therapists where I live, but they’re all the kind that claims to be proficient in 20 different modalities and in practice does CBT. Plus my current insurance sucks and I’d be effectively paying out of pocket. Financially, I don’t want to pay 150 an hour and take time off work to see a dozen people who will all treat me like a lazy child in hopes of finding “the right fit”. Emotionally, I can’t handle meeting that many strangers for the first time.

That one therapist turned out to be right about me. I don’t want to get better, especially not in the sense of forming relationships. The problem is that I *told* her this, over and over. My lack of relationships isn’t what I care about. In a way I wish I was someone who wanted them, but I don’t, and haven’t for a long time. Maybe I’m sliding into schizoid-ness. I wish I was either suicidal enough to go through with it, or just able to live with myself and find some motivation to get into a stable job of some kind. I don’t want any career in particular, I don’t really *want* to do anything at all, but I need to be able to function well enough to support myself until I either (hopefully) die young by chance or somehow find the balls to do it myself. Therapists don’t/didn’t help with this goal because they refuse to believe me when I explain it. I guess it doesn’t fit into their idea of what a mildly depressed and anxious person would be concerned about.

But yeah. I don’t have a good reason to be in therapy because I would just be there because I lowkey like to talk about myself and my psychology. (As you can see.) So I guess I don’t *need* therapy. But sometimes I really really want to talk about myself! I journal a lot, but that isn’t always enough. I wish I wasn’t so averse to AI chatbots because that would probably be the ideal solution… but like, also I want a real person to listen to me. And care about me. But that’s not what a therapist does, I believe in general (for the most part) and especially not for me. My repeated experience has been that they simply do not care. I don’t want to have it reaffirmed yet again that I’m not worth listening to or taking seriously or believing. I mean, I know I’m not. Clearly. If it happens enough times you have to start to believe it. But when the people who are supposed to break you of that idea just reinforce it again and again… man. Idk.


Sorry about all the parentheses. I like parentheticals ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Also btw I promise I’m not (hypo)manic or anything, just scattered and messy in the regular everyday way.",1,1765078226.0,AvPD,0,1.0,False
1pg86un,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShilajitBenefits/comments/1pg86un/shilajit_benefits_for_women/,Shilajit Benefits for Women,"**Shilajit Benefits for Women: Why More Women Are Turning to This Ancient Mineral Resin**

Most people associate Shilajit with men’s vitality — but that’s only half the story.  
Women have been using Shilajit in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine for centuries, even though the conversation online tends to focus on male benefits.

Recently, more women (especially 35–65) have started exploring Shilajit for energy, hormonal balance, skin health, and long-term wellness — and many are surprised by how different it feels from typical supplements.

Here’s a breakdown of why Shilajit is becoming a secret wellness tool for women:

**1. Natural Support for Hormonal Balance**

Modern stress, poor sleep, nutrient-depleted food, and perimenopause can all disrupt women’s hormonal rhythm.

Shilajit contains bioavailable minerals + fulvic acid, which help support:

* Balanced energy throughout the day
* Mood stability
* Better sleep-wake cycles
* Reduced “afternoon crash” fatigue

Women often describe it as feeling “more steady and grounded” instead of stimulated.

**2. Promotes Healthy Iron & Mineral Levels**

Many women experience low mineral levels due to diet, stress, and monthly cycles.  
Shilajit naturally contains:

* Iron
* Magnesium
* Potassium
* Zinc
* Trace minerals your body rarely gets from modern food

Because these minerals are ionic (pre-chelated by nature), they’re absorbed much more efficiently than typical mineral supplements.

**3. Enhances Skin, Hair & Cellular Repair**

Shilajit is loaded with antioxidants, fulvic acid, and micronutrients that support:

* Brighter, more hydrated skin
* Healthy collagen formation
* Reduced oxidative stress
* Stronger hair and nails

Many women notice improved skin glow after consistent use — likely due to better nutrient absorption and mitochondrial support.

**4. Supports Bone & Joint Health (Especially 40+)**

As women age, mineral loss accelerates.  
Shilajit provides essential minerals and compounds that support:

* Bone strength
* Joint mobility
* Reduced stiffness
* Post-workout recovery

It’s especially helpful for women who feel more joint sensitivity as they enter their 40s and beyond.

**5. Natural Energy Without Stimulants**

Instead of caffeine-like spikes or crashes, Shilajit works by improving mitochondrial function — your body’s natural energy engines.

Users often report:

* Clear, calm mental energy
* Better focus
* Less dependence on coffee
* Reduced brain fog

This makes it a popular morning ritual or pre-workout support.

**6. Gut Health & Nutrient Absorption**

Fulvic acid may help:

* Improve nutrient transport
* Support gut lining health
* Reduce bloating and sluggish digestion
* Many women say they notice a difference in digestion after a few weeks.

**7. Perimenopause & Post-Menopause Support**

While Shilajit is NOT a hormone replacement, it supports the systems that influence hormonal wellness:

* Adrenals
* Thyroid
* Energy metabolism
* Mineral balance

Women in their 40s–60s often report feeling “more themselves” — with better stability, energy, and clarity.

**How to Choose the Right Shilajit (Very Important)**

Because Shilajit has become trendy, a lot of what’s sold online is:

* Synthetic (lab-made fulvic acid + fillers)
* Burned/heat-dried (loses nutrients)
* Contaminated with heavy metals
* Diluted with gums, molasses, or asphalt

Real Shilajit should be:

* A soft resin (not a powder)
* Lab-tested for metals
* Dark brown/black with a gold or reddish sheen
* Able to melt between your fingers
* Slightly earthy, not chemical-smelling
* Sourced from Himalayan regions like Gilgit-Baltistan

If you're exploring Shilajit for the first time, quality is everything — **it determines whether you actually feel the long-term benefits or just a synthetic energy high.**",1,1765078201.0,ShilajitBenefits,0,1.0,False
1pg86h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pg86h9/aio_gf_and_mom_rude_at_charity_event/,“AIO” GF and mom rude at charity event.,"I went to a charity event with my girlfriend, her mom and daughter. 
A family friend of mine runs a local charity and I like helping them out when I can. 
So It was a breakfast event $10 a person. We get there we sit down they give us coffee and juice. She said the food might be awhile they didn’t expect so many people. To which I didn’t care about. $10 for a good cause I’ll take the coffee and I’ll leave after a couple hours of some nice mingling and interaction with people.
After about 30 minutes my gf and her mom are audibly saying in a loud tone voice “Wow 30 minutes to get food?” It’s amazing how slow they’re being. 
They got to a point where they were flagging down a volunteer complaining about the wait time.
So it really was not that long. I’d say 45 to an hour, but It’s a charity event and people are sacrificing their Saturday for FREE they’re not in the service industry. 
So they complained again at the 45 minute mark hinting for a refund. The food came out a couple minutes later. They’re bringing it to the table and they both say out loud “Oh man finally!” Now the food came with bacon and I knew that and I’m not a bacon guy I ended up giving it to my girlfriend’s daughter she loves the stuff. 
So while this is happening without my knowledge of it. My gf and her mom tried flagging down my family friend for sausage. 
I immediately told them “Do not flag her down” sure enough they didn’t listen they said to to me “We paid for it we expect service” turns out they didn’t even offer it! It said so on the flyer! 
After we finished up and they left. I went back inside and apologized to my family friend for their actions.
I’m so fucking disgusted with my girlfriend and her mom at this point. I can’t get over the way they treated and acted towards these volunteers at a charitable event. 
It’s absolutely disgusting and I cannot think less of them both now. 
This behavior was just mind blowing and a colossal red flag to me. 
Am I overreacting wanting to break it off with her with and just cutting ties? 

TLDR. Gf and her mom were disgusting humans at a charitable event and I’m considering breaking it off.

I mean we are getting into relationship then we must be our bestfriends and if we talk and share daily with opposite gender friend then they are the one we should be dating.

Like I do have close male friend but we know our limits we call sometime and talk about life and work and we meet sometimes for coffee and all.

But the guy I was dating felt am insecure! Like are my boundaries justifiable or they are silly? 
Anyone who feels same?

1pg85ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1pg85ru/just_a_lovely_trip_to_the_grocery_store/,Just a lovely trip to the grocery store," Long and especially pointless recap of my grocery store trip today:

I usually avoid grocery shopping on the weekends because it can be extra busy, and unfortunately more full of rude people and aggressive drivers in the parking lot. But, I needed more milk for dinner and coffee in the morning; so I decided to go to the actual grocery store to get the “fancy” organic milk that I like instead of just going to the convenience store half a mile away. 


It was a promising start, I got to park in the section I like AND didn’t have to walk across the whole store to get a cart. While I was setting my purse and reusable bags in the cart, I decided I was enough out of the way to switch my prescription shades to my regular glasses… but a guy came up from behind me to grab a cart (they were loose, not all linked together) and actually said  “excuse me, I just need a cart” and maneuvered the cart out around me with a polite smile on his face. 


While I was in the store everyone I made eye contact with smiled back at me! Nobody was blocking the aisles, nobody was upset when we had little “traffic jams” around the blind turn end cap displays. I saw my favorite “fancy milk” on display but the cartons were too far back/ high for me to get to. I waited around for an employee, but didn’t see anyone nearby. 


So I went to the bakery department next to the dairy case. The bakery worker was helping a man pick up his custom decorated cakes and some candles. The customer was all smiles, and even though I didn’t actually see the cakes, it seems they were well appreciated. The bakery clerk smiled at me and said “I’ll be with you in just a moment.” I smiled back and just gave her a thumbs up as to not distract her from the ongoing transaction. 

When she was done with the transaction I explained that I didn’t actually need bakery help, but maybe she could page someone to help me at the dairy case. I told her I could see the milk I wanted, but just couldn’t reach it. Since there were no other customers waiting for a bakery clerk she said she would help me right then! I pointed out the milk I wanted and she got into the dairy walk-in and pushed them all to the front. I told her that she was awesome and thanked her many times! She expressed that she was also annoyed with how the milk doesn’t slide forward like it should lol 

Then I got to the checkout lines. I got in the express line, but it wasn’t moving especially fast. The cashier was just being very attentive to the customers. She made sure everything was bagged well, explained to folks that the money order processing was done at the customer service desk, and helped the (literally tiny) elderly woman (who I had already exchanged smiles with twice at least!) with her coupon that wouldn’t work without the barcode- but she could still get the sales price with her rewards number, and that the cashier would make sure it worked regardless. 

And an older man (late 70s or early 80s based on our chat) behind me in line complemented my multi color hair. I thanked him, and we had such a nice chat! No creepy vibes at all! He had really gorgeous bright white hair down to his shoulders, and I joked that he had the “perfect blank canvas for creative color” which he liked a lot, and we talked about his life through a hair perspective- strict dad not wanting to pay for hair cuts and using some awful hand trimmers, his joining the navy, and then working in corporate at a time when 3 piece suits were required. He’s growing his hair out in celebration of being cancer free! Never got his name, but he’s awesome too; and I hope his health stays strong. 

Then when I was actually paying, the cashier asked for my birthday since I was buying beer. When I told her my birth year was 1989 she said “Wow! Good for you! You look so much younger!” The gentleman I was chatting with commented “ah, the end of the Cold War.” I did a silly half bow and said “You’re welcome.” And we all shared a giggle. Then the young guy bagging my groceries (moved from the other line to help out the slower line) got his frayed vest stuck on the bag holder prongs while coming around to my cart, and I joked with him a little too about needing a new hem and not to get stuck in a bad spot. 

It was just such great vibes all around. And I know it wasn’t me just being in a good mood, because I was not looking forward to weekend shopping at all and tried to approach the whole thing as neutral at best. But I’ve been in such a good mood since I got home! It was really nice to be out in the community and actually feel like a community. 

Epilogue: Another sweet older lady talked to me on my way back from taking my cart back inside. She was using a cane and parked in a handicap space. But the space is in a kind of weird corner, so there’s a lot more room on one side and can feel like a car isn’t forward enough. She was also all smiles, and I assured her that it was just “funky geometry” and she had parked perfectly fine. She seemed grateful for the reassurance. ",6,1765078108.0,BenignExistence,4,1.0,False

I'm a 37 non-binary anxiety-ridden mess of a human and I am a primary caregiver to my (MAGA) elderly father who is currently having a slew of health issues (my mother died in 2002 and he never remarried). He has 10 cats that all have various health issues of their own that I have to administer medications to every 12 hours on top of his care. I had my own business that failed and closed earlier this year leaving me not only unemployed, but also crushed, empty, and now completely void of any human contact other than my father's doctor's, my father who can be unbelievably combative and argumentative at the drop of a hat, the veterinarian, and my younger brother who I only see for maybe 15 minutes a day when he's not working. On top of that, my girlfriend left me 2 weeks ago after us being together for 2 years (and friends for 5 years prior to us becoming a couple) because I'm not ""present"" enough...I have no friends apart from my 11 year old dog that has terminal cancer and MY 3 cats that are all over the age of 10...and I'm just...well, I'm a mess. 

I'm irrationally angry about the smallest inconveniences while simultaneously so lonely and depressed that I disassociate my way through every single moment of every single day. THC, Reddit, coffee, tea, and cigarettes are the only highlights for me anymore.

I look at my life and...I'm lost on why I keep going. I'm 37 years old and I have no idea how my life improves from here...I'm literally surrounded by talk of death day in and day out and I've become the cliche of the art school graduate flunkie who lives in her father's basement...I wish it were as simple as ""get a job and get out"" but I can't afford care for my father regardless and I can't just leave him alone either...I'm just...stuck, lonely, bitter, and SO depressed that my life is so void of anything that brings me joy. Hobbies now feel shallow, my art feels flat, and the world feels utterly colorless.

I'm just so...empty.

Caregiver fatigue is real and just SO DAMN LONELY.

Guess I'm just hoping there's someone else out there who has had to pause their life too to care for a sick parent and have seen the other side...I just am struggling with feeling like I'm wasting my life and simultaneously not caring that I am because it's pointless.

Como comentei, estou organizando a agenda para manter a constância semanal aqui no sub.

Uma pessoa me perguntou por que eu não solto um review por dia, já que tenho acesso a tantos cafés. A resposta é técnica: **respeito ao grão e a vocês.** Embora eu tente trazer o texto final de forma enxuta e direta, o bastidor é longo. Para cada review postado, realizo uma série de extrações variando temperatura, moagem e água. O objetivo é *validar* o sensorial descrito na embalagem e encontrar o ponto doce real, para não postar apenas ""achismos"" e/ou ctrl + c + ctrl + v do rótulo.

Dito isso, a bancada está cheia. Já tenho **dois reviews em fase final de produção** que sobem ainda esta semana.

Enquanto isso, deixo aqui o *spoiler* do que está na fila de espera (descansando ou em fase de testes) e que vai aparecer por aqui em breve:

# 🌍 Os Gringos (Pesos Pesados)

**1. Prodigal (Scott Rao)**

* **Café:** Abraham Armijos.
* **Expectativa:** A torra do Rao é famosa por ser extremamente clara, mas desenvolvida (sem gosto de cereal). A curiosidade aqui é ver como essa solubilidade se comporta na prática.
* **Spoiler**: Que café do cara\*\*\* meus amigos e que variedade interessante!

**2. Square Mile (James Hoffmann)**

* **A Seleção:**
   * *El Urraco*
   * *Anarquia Pacamara* (Expectativa alta nesse varietal)
   * *Aricha Adorsi*
   * *Mensur Aba Hika*
* **Expectativa:** É a torrefação referência de Londres. Quero testar se o ""padrão Hoffmann"" sustenta o *hype* ou se é mais marca do que xícara.

**3. September Coffee (Kyle Rowsell)**

* **Café:** Lollipop.
* **Expectativa:** O nome sugere doçura extrema e artificial (no bom sentido). Ansioso para ver se entrega essa ""pirulito"" todo no sensorial.
* **Spoiler**: Produto da familia Bermudez, logo...

**4. Clifton Coffee Roasters**

* **Cafés:**
   * *East Timor Eratoi* (Origem exótica! Timor Leste não aparece todo dia).
   * *+ 2 rótulos* (Falha humana: esqueci de registrar no *Beanconqueror* na correria, atualizo o nome no review oficial 😅).

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

**5. Mameluca**

* **Café:** Kit Misterioso (3 cafés).
* **Expectativa:** Já provei e sei quais são. Farei uma dinâmica com amigos fazendo teste cego pra ver se acerto qual é qual. A Mameluca costuma ter uma curadoria afiada, então o desafio vai ser interessante.

**6. Astral**

* **Café:** ~~Não posso contar~~
* **Expectativa:** Altíssima, descrição sensorial diferenciada.

**7. Do Coado Ao Espresso**

* **Cafés:** da compra coletiva (Não serão todos, mas queria)
* **Expecativas: Torrefação do ano, não preciso dizer mais nada, preciso?**

A fila é grande e o fígado tem limite de cafeína (brincadeira, não tem). Qual dessas torrefações vocês têm mais curiosidade de ver um *deep dive* técnico?

I’m a 27f and I had my first blood draw for a lipid test done a few weeks ago and I’d like some feedback. All of my cholesterol was within healthy ranges, but my TG came back at 349. I was stumped at first because I had no knowledge of what this meant, but then I discovered that I was supposed to refrain from eating in the hours before the test. In the parking lot before heading in to the waiting room, I literally drank a sugar-loaded coffee drink (basically a milkshake, sickeningly sweet) and a sausage and white cheddar ciabatta breakfast sandwich that was super greasy. Definitely more rich than I’d typically eat but I was on the move this day and didn’t eat until o picked this up at about 2pm.  This was about an hour and 15 minutes before I had my blood drawn. I’ve since learned that this may have skewed my test results significantly and I’m just trying to confirm whether or not that sounds like the case. My doctor saw the result and initially recommended a statin (I was like um wtf) and I then when I told her that I had eaten that before the test, she said it could easily be a fluke and we’ll do a properly fasted test at my next appointment. Anyway, I’ve been eating an extremely strict diet since because it definitely triggered some health-ocd, even though I know it’s almost definitely not accurate. I’ve seen some folks say they’ve had similar things happen but I’m just worried 🫠 to add, I concluded this might be the case from research but also due to the fact that my glucose had spiked about 60 points (still within healthy range) - presumably due to the drink.

* The speed controller for the fan mounts cleanly to the top of the cabinet

* There is a backdraft mounted to the window insert so that cold air doesn't come into the house between roasts

1pg7y3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1pg7y3k/nespressos_welcome_gift_promo_is_a_scam_terrible/,Nespresso’s “Welcome Gift” promo is a scam + terrible customer service (chat log inside),"I just had one of the worst customer service experiences with Nespresso, and wanted to warn anyone else confused about their so-called “Welcome Gift” promo.

**TL;DR:**  
It took me **over 30 minutes** to reach a human. When I finally got one, they **didn’t answer my question**, kept repeating irrelevant info about some machine-bundle promotion I never signed up for, and then **hung up on me**. The whole “welcome gift after 2 orders” thing feels like a scam.

# What actually happened

I saw a Nespresso promotion called **“Nespresso Signature Welcome Gift.”**  
It clearly says:

>

I placed 2 orders.

No welcome gift. No email. Nothing.

So I contacted their chat. Here’s how it went:

# Chat Timeline 

**Me:** Hi, I placed 2 orders but haven’t received my welcome gift.

**Bot:** Please rephrase.  
**Me:** Talk to an agent.  
**Bot:** Your place in queue: 46… 36… 29… 22… 12… 2.  
(About 30 minutes waiting.)

**Agent:** Can I have your name/email/phone?  
I provide it.

**Me:** I placed 2 orders but didn’t get my welcome gift.  
**Agent:** Which welcome gift?  
**Me:** The one the website says you get after ordering twice.

**Agent:** That’s part of our *three-step Welcome Journey*. You get:  
– $10 off with your machine  
– Insert in the box for a second offer  
– Insert for a third offer, etc.

**Me:** I never bought a machine from you. The promo simply said “receive welcome gifts after 1st and 2nd coffee order.” It didn’t say anything about machine purchase or needing special codes.

**Agent:** Please send a screenshot.  
(I send the text.)

**Agent:** Which gifts are included in that promotion?  
**Me:** It didn’t specify—just said “welcome gift.” Isn’t that what I’m asking you?

Agent repeats the machine promo **again**, word-for-word.

**Me:** I don’t understand. The promo didn’t mention needing a machine.

**Agent:** Please call us at 800-562-1465.  
(Does not answer the actual question.)

**Me:** You didn’t answer my question.

**Agent:** *Thank you for contacting Nespresso. Have a lovely day!*  
**→ Chat ends. They disconnected.**

# Why I think this promo is misleading

* The promo **literally says** you get a welcome gift after your 1st and 2nd *coffee* orders.
* Nowhere does it say you must buy a machine, use codes, or find inserts in the box.
* Their agent refused to answer a simple question (“Where is my welcome gift?”), and instead pushed some unrelated *machine bundle* program.
* When I pointed out the mismatch, she just **ended the chat**.

If this isn’t a bait-and-switch, it’s very close.

If anyone else has gone through this or actually received these so-called “welcome gifts,” I’d love to hear what you were told. Right now it feels like a total scam.

So I built Gitffy - a life metrics dashboard that reads from a markdown file in your private GitHub repo.

How it works:

\- You maintain a [life.md](http://life.md) file in a private repo with daily entries

\- Connect Gitffy to your GitHub (via GitHub App)

\- It parses the markdown and shows charts, trends, and insights

\- Auto-syncs when you push changes - no manual uploads

Example entry format:

\## 2024-12-07

\- mood: 8

\- sleep: 7.5

\- exercise: running

\- coffee: 2

\- productivity: 7

Features:

\- Multiple chart types (line, bar, radar, etc.)

\- Dark/light mode

\- AI-powered insights (optional, uses Gemini)

\- Timeline and day-detail views

\- Your data stays in YOUR repo

Why GitHub?

\- Version history for free

\- Private repos = your data stays private

\- Edit from anywhere (phone, VS Code, etc.)

\- No vendor lock-in - it's just markdown

So I sent him a text first thing in the morning and apologize for being last-minute but I explained the situation. He leaves me on read for 20 minutes and I see him typing and stopping off and on. He calls me later and ask how I’m doing. And after I say I’m not feeling the best but hopefully I will soon. He says I hope you feel well too, but I gotta admit. I’m pretty pissed right now. 

He also explained how he felt like I was being a little bit distant, which was the truth because I was consumed by holiday festivities that I haven’t been as responsive to text and calls. After clearing the air, he starts laughing and saying “you actually should’ve seen the text that I was writing. I was going crazy. But then I thought I probably needed to calm down. Just get a coffee. And when I read your text, I thought oh of course this bitch.” But he was laughing at the end each time. I didn’t know how to take it so I laughed back a little bit awkwardly.

Basically I'm looking for general thoughts, prose, pacing, what your first impressions of Calden are.

For context, this is probably going to end up being Chapter 3 or 4 in my novel, so readers will have a little bit of context as to some of the proper nouns. Basically there is a civil war that just kicked off between Commonwealth of Rosalia and the Dominion of Eldaria. Eldaria, Draymont, and Gaspardine are essentially states in the Dominion of Eldaria. Nostrov is an empire that the then unifed Commonwealth of Rosalia had fought a few years prior.

  
\*\*\*

Brigadier Calden Rhyne sat atop horse overlooking the hastily assembled collection of farm boys and village folk that was to be his grand command in the newly formed Army of Eldaria. Puffing the cigar held in his white gloved hand, he inspected his troops.

Three thousand in the brigade, evenly divided into three regiments—two from the Realm of Eldaria, one from Calden’s home in Draymont.

“Well TJ,” he said to the Gaspardine captain serving as the entirety of his staff. “They certainly don’t look like soldiers.” Calden removed the cigar from his mouth and spat.

The young captain—he had to be no more than twenty-five—replied, “I’m sure you’ll whip them into shape soon enough.” He scratched his chin, the only part of his face that *wasn’t* covered by his thick black beard. “Although it certainly would help their cause if you try not to burn the supplies we’re after. Hardee coughed, and then added, “Sir.”

He was right, of course. The farm-boy soldiers—if you could call them that—wore mostly homespun butternut uniforms. Scant few had hats, and some just wore plain farm clothes. Cal shook his head and chuckled in dismay when he noticed that more than just a few didn’t even have shoes.

They were armed with any and all weapons they could scrounge—from antiquated muskets from the Nostrovian War, to long barreled deer hunting rifles, to shotguns. A few lads even seemed to be armed with old flintlocks stolen from their grandfathers’ attics, for what little good they’d do.

But there was something about his motley crew of men—a spark in the eye, and eagerness to fight for their rights. Some of it, Calden knew from his own experience, was the naivety being young, but he could feel their fighting spirit.

Most of the officers, on the other hand, looked the part but didn’t inspire the same level of confidence in Calden. Sons of wealthy aristocrats and planters, they wore elaborate dyed orange uniforms, complete with gilded sabers, bleached white gloves, and brand-new flat top, wide brimmed hats. Somehow, they were able to procure their uniforms—more like costumes, Calden mused—at a moment’s notice while he was still clad in the hunter green uniform of the Rosalia, the land he betrayed.

“For those I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting,” he said, taking off his hat in a mock bow. “I’m Brigadier Calden Rhyne.”

“General Romark, our esteemed leader, has ordered us to advance a few miles over yonder,” Cal said, pointing to the east. “There we will find ourselves a Rosalian supply depot.” He took another puff of his cigar. “We’ll be relieving those poor souls of their wares.”

“A couple hours from now you’ll be equipped like real soldiers, not boys playin’ make believe.” Cheers and whoops bellowed from the assembled men.

“Is it true you’re a Wielder, General?” A boy from the ranks called out, clearly lacking any semblance of military discipline.

A crooked smile grew on Calden’s face. *This will be fun.*

“Well boy—you’re about to find out.”

\*\*\*

Calden rode at the head of his charging infantry, green flames of his Wielding flaring on the fingertips of his free hand. As they surged forward, he shot small green flames at enemies, engulfing any poor bastard in a deadly s embrace. Sorcerous fire mixed with the smoke of musket shot, casting an eerie glow lingering on the battlefield.

It wasn’t fair really. It was hard enough for disciplined infantry to stand against a Wielder in their midst; he had learned that firsthand years ago in Nostrovia. But the untrained men in his way—no different than the men charging behind him, save for their equipment—never stood a chance.

In less than thirty minutes of fighting, the Commonwealth troops broke and ran. Cal urged his mount forward, fire still flinging form his fingers, taking men in the back and sending them with a jolt to the ground, never to rise again.

Calden felt it then—the darkness returning with a sharp punch like a musket ball in the stomach. Caught off guard, he lurched in the saddle, his hands gripping the reins with all their might being the only thing stopping him from falling.

He regained himself, the strange feeling inside pulling him forward, urging him on. It did not speak to him in words, but he knew instinctively what it wanted—to kill more. Every foe felled fueled him further, more than any of his starstone vials could do. He rode on, giving in to the calling.

Three foolish brave men stood as he galloped forward, lowering their muskets to take aim. Balls of flame bounding between fingertips coalesced into a scythe-like shape. Calden swung it as he surged forward, ethereal weapon cleanly relieving three heads from their bodies.

Soon, there were no more targets for Calden’s sorcery. He let the last of his starstone fueled magic peter out, slowing his mount to a trot. His victorious men swarmed about and through the abandoned supply depot, helping themselves to muskets, munitions, and clothes.

Some few enterprising men had stumbled upon stores of coffee and fresh bacon, and were handing them out with childhood glee. A few more had found some whiskey and after taking large gulps, passed around the bottles like men about a campfire.

Calden dismounted and turning away from the all-too-easily won spoils of the supply depot and back to the carnage laid bare behind him. The small green masses of Commonwealth dead spotted the clearing behind him like the stout green shrubs in the deserts of Nostrov from wars prior. An occasional Dominion body laid unmoving, although there were far fewer. *Thank the gods for that, at least*.

A trail of blood caught his eye. Following the red path led him to a Commonwealth soldier, pulling himself inch by inch away from the carnage. Calden watched for a moment as the crawling slowed and then stopped, body falling defeated in a puff of dirt and dust.

Calden approached curiously. The boy—not much older than his son Holden—lay on his side, clutching at seeping entrails, desperately trying to put them back where they belong. As he came closer, the wisps of green smoke could be seen rising from his wound. Calden had done this himself.

The boy noticed him then, with those glassy, distant eyes that always came shortly before death. “Why?” the boy spat out weakly as blood leaked from corner of his mouth. “You…were one of us once.”

Cal clenched his clammy hands, forcing down the bile rising from his belly, his eyes struggling to meet the gaze of the human face his powers had all but snuffed the life out from.

“I’m sorry, son,” he muttered. No other words came to him. He knelt down beside him on one knee.

The young soldier struggled with one hand to reach into his coat pocket, pulling out a letter. The leaking blood from his mouth became a gurgle now; he didn’t have long left. He held out the letter, stained from the blood and guts on his hands. Cal watched as it flapped lazily in the breeze, like autumns leaves drifting from trees. “For…mother. At least see to it she gets it.”

Calden looked at the nearly dead man and blinked. He slowly reached for the letter, taking it from his pallid hands. “I’ll do what I can, boy.” He placed his hand on the downed man’s chest as the life left his eyes. “I’ll tell her you fought bravely.”

Pressing his two fingers to his victim’s lifeless eyes, he softly closed them. Rising, he stuffed the letter into his breast pocket and began to head back to the supplies the Rosalian soldier died to defend. With that, the sorcery—and the darkness along with it—only then fully left his body.

Captain Hardee approached not long after, a mix of awe and horror on his soot-stained face. “Well done, sir. That was…well it certainly was something else,” he spit out between ragged breaths.

A pained smile formed across Calden’s face. “Thanks, TJ,” he said pointing out towards the treasure in front of them. “Give ‘em a few minutes to enjoy themselves, then get the colonels to start reining them in a bit. There needs to be *some* order, you know.”

“Will do, sir.”

Calden nodded, gesturing with his eyes for Hardee to get to it. Hardee saluted quickly and ran off. Once he was safely out of sight, Calden walked behind a nearby oak tree, the refuge the dead soldier had been headed towards. Removing his blood stained gloves, he wiped the sweat from his brow. He leaned against the tree, trying to catch his breath and slow his pounding heart.

That battle, however, Calden did not win. He slumped forward, hands on his knees and emptied the contents of his stomach.",1,1765076624.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

1pg7cyw,https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSfoqt7V4/,Help me find this novel please,"

I'd been dating a rich boy for a year. He never made me feel small for being broke. When I scored some crazy group deal takeout, he'd grin and say, babe, you're a genius. 

When I caught a limited-time sale on a dress, he'd go, damn, that's impressive. When my crappy studio started leaking and I patched the ceiling myself, he kissed my forehead and called me independent. Then on Black Friday, I borrowed his Amazon account to snag a pair of $9.99 canvas sneakers. 

Right as I checked out, the app popped up a little banner. On this day, last year, it was a pair of Chanel heels, size 5, marked as a gift for his ex. The note he'd left on that order said, my baby girl's feet shouldn't have to hurt in cheap shoes. 

The second I saw that order, my thumb moved on its own. I opened it. They were gorgeous, sleek black stilettos, all glossy leather and red soles. 

I could picture the woman who'd wear them. Flawless legs, perfect posture, the kind of competence that walks into a room and owns it. The high I'd felt from winning the flash sale sneakers disappeared like smoke.

My chest tightened. I started scrolling through his old orders. They were all from two years ago, back when Ethan was still with his ex. 

Joe Malone perfume, a Louis Vuitton bag, a Tiffany necklace. I didn't even need pictures to see her. She was the type who'd fit right into some downtown Manhattan cocktail party. 

Perfume on her pulse points, Chanel on her shoulders, lipstick that never smudged. You didn't need a diary to see how hard Ethan had loved her. You could see it in the tracking numbers. 

My chest felt heavy. I backed out of the app. I told myself, that's all in the past. 

A good current girlfriend doesn't interrogate her boyfriend about his ex. A mature woman doesn't get jealous over things that are already over. At least that's what I tried to chant to myself. 

But the unease didn't leave. My thumb drifted to the notes app. I meant to close it. 

And froze. There was a file named, her. I knew I shouldn't open something that private. 

I knew. I opened it anyway. And yeah, a tiny part of me was hoping, what if her is me? I knew it wasn't by the first line. 

She loves spicy food. Strike one. I can't handle heat. 

She's picky. Won't touch cilantro, scallions, or garlic. Not me. 

I grew up eating whatever was cheap and filling. She loves rainy days and walking barefoot on hardwood floors. She loves cats. 

She's impossible to coax out of a mood when she's mad. But when she smiles, her eyes light up. On her period, her stomach cramps like hell. 

But she still eats ice cream. Then the last line. You always make my heart ache. 

I never want you to struggle. Every letter screamed Chloe Sinclair. Ethan's ex. 

The one before me. My fingers clenched so hard around the phone my knuckles went white. I could feel the color drain from my face. 

The shower cut off. Water stopped pounding tile. The sound yanked me out of my spiral. 

I slammed the screen dark. Shoved the phone away. And rearranged my face. 

Ethan walked out of the bathroom shirtless. Towel in his hand. Water rolled down over his pale, solid chest. 

Slid over the line of his abs. He popped the fridge open. Grabbed a cold beer. 

Cracked it one-handed. Took a long pull. Then walked over to me. 

He caught my expression and smiled. What's up? You didn't get them? I did. I said. 

He grinned wider. Reached out to pinch my cheek and dropped onto the couch beside me. That's my girl. 

Only 500 pairs in the whole country and you still snatched one? On any other night I would have been stupidly proud. But the image of those Chanel heels flickered through my mind. My mouth moved before my brain could stop it. 

Ethan, aren't you embarrassed by me? He blinked. Beer halfway to his lips. Then set the cam down slowly. 

Why the hell would I be embarrassed? Because I'm always chasing discounts. Hunting coupons. Buying the cheapest crap.

His expression sharpened. Serious. That's not embarrassing. 

That's called being smart with money. My buddies are jealous as hell I've got a girlfriend who actually knows how to stretch a dollar. My heart sank another inch. 

All the grinding and hustling I'd done just to survive. The way I stitched leaks, patched things, made every penny scream. In his eyes, it was just, she's good at managing money. 

She's thrifty. He didn't hurt for me. He didn't see how hard it was.

I wasn't Chloe. He'd never not let her struggle. The mask slipped off my face. 

I stood up. He caught my wrist. Where are you going? Not staying over? I just remembered I've got an early shift at one of my side jobs tomorrow. 

I'm tired. I should go home. His expression didn't change. 

He just picked up his phone. I'll drive you. It's fine. 

I'll grab an uber. Go to bed early. Text me when you're home. 

Yeah. His fingers loosened. Down on the sidewalk, waiting for the car. 

I glanced up and saw his bedroom lights go dark. It hit me, suddenly, brutally clear. Maybe Ethan didn't actually care about me that much. 

Maybe I wanted a fight. Maybe I wanted proof. Maybe both. 

The next day, I sent him a link to a pair of YSL heels and typed, what do you think of these? He texted back, they're pretty, but not really you. I think sneakers suit you better. Except in that note on his phone, he'd written, it doesn't matter if it suits you. 

If you like it, you should have it. I didn't respond. Didn't want to. 

After that, I just, went quiet. I stopped texting him first. Thing is, Ethan was never the kind of guy who came chasing when I went quiet. 

So when I stopped, the conversation simply, died. Monday he'd texted me a good morning smiling face with smiling eyes. I'd seen it. 

Put the phone face down, and never replied. He didn't follow up. On day five of this weird cold war I'd started with myself. 

I turned my phone off and focused on watching for the bus. The sky chose that exact moment to open up. It didn't just drizzle, it dumped. 

My mood, already in the toilet, went straight to the sewer. Rain slapped against the street, exploded in little white blooms on the asphalt. And suddenly I remembered the first time I'd met Ethan Blake. 

It was raining then, too. I was working the night shift at a 7-11 knockoff, dead on my feet and counting down the minutes. He burst through the door soaked to the skin, dark hair plastered to his forehead, hoodie dripping all over the cheap tile. 

He bought an umbrella. I poured him a cup of hot water from the breakroom kettle. He gave me a polite, thanks, like I'd handed him a miracle. 

That was the first time I really looked at him. He was stupidly handsome. After that, it was a slow, easy slide. 

He came by the store more often, by coincidence. We swapped numbers. Started texting. 

He picked me up after shifts a few times. Took me to late-night diners. Walked me to the subway. 

Then one night, under another stupid rainstorm, he stood outside my building with a massive bouquet of red roses. I remember thinking, this is a prank. Rich boys don't actually date broke girls out of K-cup coffee and instant noodles.

He was younger than me, from money. I was a broke woman from a single mom family, two jobs deep. It made zero sense. 

But his eyes were shining when he said, Nat, let me take care of you. Maybe it was the way he said my name. Maybe it was the way my heart slammed against my ribs. 

I said yes. After we got together, Ethan surprised me. He was calmer than guys his age. 

Steady, soft-spoken. And for a spoiled rich kid, he never once made fun of where I came from. If anything, every time I stretched a dollar, he praised me for it. 

My coworkers envied me. Sis, you hit the jackpot. Rich and gentle? That's husband material. 

At first, I thought so too. But the longer we dated, the more something felt... off. He never really got angry in front of me. 

Never raised his voice. Never argued. Whatever I wanted, he agreed. 

There was no impatience, no irritation, no real friction. On paper, it was perfect. In my gut, it felt wrong. 

I used to think I was just being dramatic. Until that night with his notes app. Because that's when I realized, for all his perfection, I couldn't feel his love. 

My life had never been pretty. Single mom. Dad gone before middle school. 

Right after I graduated college, mom got seriously sick. My kid sister was still in high school. So I never got to be one of those girls who could afford to float. 

From freshman year on, I juggled multiple part-time jobs. After graduation, I once worked three jobs a day just to keep us afloat. Dating wasn't on the table. 

Ethan was the exception. For the first time, I let myself believe I could be loved and But the joke was on me. Because I couldn't actually relax around him. 

I didn't dare show him how hard things really were. My apartment was a cramped, soggy shoebox and a shitty walk-up. When it leaked, I bought sealant and patched the ceiling myself. 

When the light blew, I changed the fixture. Every day I squeezed into rush-hour buses and trains, wearing $9.99 sneakers and $5 t-shirts that faded after three washes. Food? Discounted pre-packed salads after 8 PM. 

Marked-down meat at the end of the day. Half-off sandwiches from the convenience store floor display. Sometimes I'd treat myself to an expensive meal once a month, which meant a Groupon for a cheap set menu at some chain restaurant. 

I never thought of it as suffering. It was just life. Then I met Ethan, and suddenly there was a comparison. 

I finally understood that line. Love is the ache that says, I can't stand to see you struggle. I knew I was being a little irrational. 

To be fair, I'd never told Ethan how bad it actually was. Never asked him for anything. But was I really that invisible to him? Did he not see the faded shirts? The worn-out sneakers? The dark circles under my eyes? He'd once written, If you sit quietly next to me while I work I feel guilty. 

Like you're bored. And one tiny frown will hurt my heart. He'd written that. 

For Chloe. Would he ever let her hustle three jobs and patch a leaking ceiling alone? Would he watch her live in a sketchy neighborhood because it was cheaper? Would he let her walk home alone in the dark? Of course he wouldn't. But me? For me, you're so independent. 

Was praise. On the third rainy night, I finally admitted it to myself. Ethan didn't love me like that. 

I honestly thought our silent war would drag on until we just, fizzled out. Break up by ghosting. But that evening, when I walked out of my office, Ethan was leaning against his black Mercedes at the curb. 

He'd dressed up, dark shirt, tailored coat, hair pushed back, a bouquet of flowers in his hands, and a easy smile on his face. The kind of picture every girl walking by did a double take at. I felt, nothing, no flutter, just the weight in my chest. 

I walked over anyway. Some things deserve to be said out loud. He slipped his fingers through mine like nothing was wrong. 

Happy birthday, Nat. An entire week of radio silence. He added, I figured you were buried in work. 

Didn't want to bug you. But I'm not letting your birthday go by without seeing you. The word breakup lodged in my throat.

I mean, how petty would it sound? Dumping him on my birthday because he hadn't loved me the same way he loved his ex years ago? He brought me back to his penthouse and cooked dinner himself. Then he dramatically pulled a cake from the fridge like he'd planned out the perfect surprise. Make a wish, he insisted.

My preferred area is usually closer to Playa 88 because that's my favourite beach and it's (relatively) quiet. The closest I've stayed to the highway before was on 35th in Zazil Ha, and I didn't mind how long it took me to get to the beach since I would just take a bike down fifth after walking, but I'm wondering if this is a bit too out of the way on foot (I'm not a fan of the busy central beaches, Playa 72 is the closest to this location I would go hang out). 

I know Playa is just loud in general but there are definitely better areas than others for some peace, so wondering if this pinned\^ area is noisy. 

I'm also solo female, and wondering about the general safety above the highway there? I've never stayed near Benito Juarez. I'll be grocery shopping and cooking at the air bnb so restaurants and things aren't a big priority (more of a nice to have)

I have to book last minute so my options are limited, it will be a longer term stay, and there are a couple other options closer to 5th closer to nicte ha, but the quality of the rental is a lot better here -

Any information you could give me to help make me a snappy decision would be greatly apprectiated! Thank you

1pg7710,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pg7710/2_years_ago/,2 years ago...,"Mom passed 4 months ago and the holidays approaching brings with me an extre layer of grief. The intensity of my grief has hightened this month just as I thought I was getting better.

Mom always loved the going ons around Christmas and for many years would go on solo outings to this place or that place mostly to window shop or look at the decorations. As a guy who didn't like shopping or long strolls around malls, i never felt much inclination to go. I always encouraged her to go, she was retired and i felt she was entitled to do whatever she liked. It never occured to me those were lost opportunities to make memories with her when she reached out to invite me. Those were my regrets.

Roughly 2 years ago in December 2023, about half a year before she complained about pain on her right breast and nine months before her cancer diagnosis, she asked and I agreed to accompany her for a special christmas train ride to the city where upon arrival we split up; she went around the city and the harbor looking at all the christmas displays, had some scones and coffee for lunch, while I went to catch a movie. We met up again after a couple of hours for the train the trip home. It was all things said another uneventful day in the life. Something i've never done, that she wanted to do that I thankfully agreed to do with her. Looking back, knowing what i know now, i would have cancelled the movie and went to lunch with her instead and do the window shopping and christmas stuff. Another regret.

This year, I went on the same train ride again. I felt like it was a trip I needed to make to honor her memory.

That day in 2023, I took some pictures of us waiting on the train platform, of her sitting in the train looking up at me as I had to stand due to how crowded the train that day was and i found those pictures that were mundane memories filed into my google photos heartbreaking to revisit this year. I couldn't help it but i scrolled through them again this morning, looking at her on the train platform on my phone, and looking up to see an empty space where she would have stood.

Looking from photos from that day 2 years ago, i could only feel sadness, pain and sorrow. There's a sense of quiet pride, and perhaps appreciation in the photo i took of  her looking up at me on the train in that fleeting photo 2 years ago. This is something i've only recently noticed.

That’s cheaper than Duracell or Energizer, but only if you ignore the fact that these are alkaline cells, not lithium. In other words, you’re getting the cheapest chemistry money can buy, and the shelf life claim of 10 years is only true if you store them in a cool, dry place and never let them freeze or overheat. The reviews are mostly positive, but then again, most people don’t test batteries beyond seeing if they work. Amazon’s own brand is made in China, and the specs are what you’d expect for the price. If you need a lot of AAA batteries for low-drain devices like TV remotes, these will do the job, but for anything that needs reliable power for more than a few weeks, you might want to consider spending a bit more for lithium cells. The 10-year shelf life claim is a bit of a gamble, as alkaline batteries can leak if left in a device for too long, and these are no exception. The packaging is a frustration-free cardboard box, which is good for the environment but won’t protect the batteries from a drop or crush in transit as well as the plastic blister packs Duracell uses. All that said, if you just want to stock up on cheap AAA batteries and don’t mind the risk of them being half-dead on arrival or going flat before you get to use them, this is a way to do it for less than the price of a couple of cups of coffee. Just don’t expect them to last like the marketing claims unless you use them right away in something like a wall clock that only needs replacing every few years.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.  
5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:  
- Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan  
- Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee  
- Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.
  
That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  
I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:  
- Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)  
- 23–46  
- Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever  
- Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)  
- Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:  
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

My relative is very unclean and needs my help getting their home ready to sell. When I first started helping, it was sooooooo bad, even non ocd people wouldn’t go inside. It would’ve been fine if they kept up the cleaning…. Every time I go back to clean, it’s the same if not worse.. I cannot take it anymore.

They found out they had a contagious lung infection the day I was supposed to come over to clean and didn’t tell me until they opened the door coughing saying I could still clean... then they didn’t disinfect a single thing once they felt better, until I said something.

You know, I’m also going to vent about the rats. They have a baddddd rodent problem and they do nothinggggg about it. Nothingggggg. I don’t feel safe eating a single thing from that household because I’ve seen the rat pee on the cutting boards and the rat poo in the coffee cups. I know nothing is washed prior to use. Nastyyyyyyy.  

I love my relative but cmonnnnnn. It’s been a year now, and I’m the only one cleaning a house I don’t even live in while they continuously make more messes. I’ve sought help for them but they’re an adult, gov can’t do much at all.

So I wanted to vent about the mess because thinking about it makes me want to scream and I can’t stop thinking about it. Im tired of internally panicking every time I’m there, and sometimes just leaving because I’m crashing out over it. Thank you for your time lmao ",2,1765074879.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

1pg6zv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepdisorders/comments/1pg6zv7/help_i_cant_stop_sleeping/,"Help, I can’t stop sleeping","Hi, this will probably be a long post and I am going to apologize for that now. 
I am a 19 year old female currently in my 3rd year of college. For as long as I can remember, I have had issues with fatigue. As far back as kindergarten, I remember feeling sad that I no longer had nap time like I did in Pre-K. All through middle school and high school I slept through classes and took naps after school. 
This had always been attributed to laziness by my parents, and then eventually depression in my early teenage years. However, all other variables in my life have changed in some way but this has not. Caffeine has never helped (only makes me shaky), I can drink coffee and other things late at night and fall asleep perfectly fine. I switched antidepressants to Wellbutrin about 9 months ago, and during a checkup the doctors were surprised that I took it before bed with no issues.
 I fall asleep anywhere, anytime. I can get 10 hours of sleep at night, wake up at noon, take a nap from 2-6pm, and go to bed perfectly fine at 10pm. No matter how much sleep I get I never feel rested, I am always sleepy, and always feel like I have no energy. I have tried keeping myself from taking naps during the day but it doesn’t help. I fall asleep without trying or realizing it. I fall asleep taking notes in class, words turning into ink stains or incomprehensible scribbles. I fall asleep having conversations over the phone, and end up mumbling gibberish before something snaps me out of it. I’ve fallen asleep at sporting events, driving, standing in line, and nothing seems to help. I snooze my alarm in the morning and fall back asleep and have an entire dream in the 10 minutes before it goes off again. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022 and was on strattera (non stimulant) until 4 months ago when I switched to Adderall XR 20mg. For the first month it was amazing, I no longer felt like I was going to fall asleep and like I could actually do stuff during the day. However, that started to fade and then was prescribed 10mg IR Adderall to take for afternoon slump. Again, this helped, but it has started seeming ineffective now. Last week, I took one of my IRs and intended to nap for an hour while it kicked in, and then get up and do homework. This was 5pm, I didn’t wake up until the next day at 11am. I have taken these later in the evening than recently several times, but it never seems to give me the boost I need, and I’m able to fall asleep like normal.

I am just so frustrated, i finally had a breakthrough after years of dealing with this, and now it’s not working anymore. I have lost jobs, friends, and missed out of so many opportunities because I simply cannot stay awake. I am so tired (no pun intended) of dealing with this, and anytime I bring it up to doctors it’s always linked back to depression or that I just need to make sure I have a good sleep schedule bla bla bla. I am not lazy, I graduated at 16 in the top 6% of my high school class, was captain of the dance team, and did many other activities. I am in college 2 states away from my family by myself, handling a difficult major and a laboratory job. I eat relatively healthy and worked out 3-4 times a week (I got pneumonia 2 months ago which put a halt to that but I’m trying to get back to it). I am 19 years old, I shouldn’t be staying home from evening events because I’m exhausted, I want to be able to actually spend time with my boyfriend rather than just sleep the entire time. I want to wake up and go to the gym, go to class, go to work, but it just seems so impossible.

I am going to a primary care physician for the first time in 4ish years next week, and plan to bring up this issue in addition to other random health concerns (mostly digestive issues). I do have a history of autoimmune diseases and sleep apnea in my family which I’m assuming would make sense to look deeper into.

Any advice is appreciated.",1,1765074588.0,sleepdisorders,1,1.0,False
