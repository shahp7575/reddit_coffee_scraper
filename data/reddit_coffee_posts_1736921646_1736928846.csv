When it comes to candy, every country has its own unique sweetness quotient. Canada, often overshadowed by its American and British neighbors, offers a candy culture that‚Äôs a delightful blend of local innovation, multicultural influences, and nostalgic flavors. At [**Candyville**](https://candyville.ca/), your go-to [**Canadian candy store**](https://candyville.ca/), we celebrate these differences every day by curating treats that represent Canada‚Äôs distinct confectionery charm. So, what sets Canadian candy apart? Let‚Äôs unwrap the story together.

**1. Maple Syrup: The Iconic Canadian Touch**

Canada is synonymous with maple syrup, and it‚Äôs no surprise that this national treasure has found its way into Canadian candies. Unlike the U.S., where peanut butter dominates, or the U.K., with its penchant for licorice, Canadian candies often feature the rich, earthy flavor of maple syrup. From maple sugar candies to maple-infused chocolates, this unique ingredient makes Canadian confections truly one-of-a-kind.

**Must-Try: Maple Leaf Candies**

At Candyville, our collection of maple-themed sweets is perfect for anyone looking to savor the quintessential Canadian experience.

**2. Chocolate with a Distinct Canadian Twist**

While American chocolate brands like Hershey's are known for their sweetness and British chocolates like Cadbury's boast creamier textures, Canadian chocolate strikes a balance between the two. Many Canadian chocolate bars, such as Coffee Crisp and Big Turk, have distinct flavors and textures that can‚Äôt be found anywhere else.

**Unique Favorites:**

* **Coffee Crisp:** A perfect blend of wafer and coffee-flavored cream, this candy bar screams Canadian innovation.
* **Big Turk:** A chocolate-coated Turkish delight that‚Äôs surprisingly light and fruity.

At Candyville, these iconic bars are a hit among candy enthusiasts exploring the flavors of Canada.

**3. Old-School Nostalgia with Canadian Candy Classics**

Every Canadian has fond memories of corner stores filled with unique penny candies. Unlike the U.S., where brands dominate, and the U.K., where vintage sweets are still thriving, Canada‚Äôs candy culture has a more localized and nostalgic vibe.

**Popular Picks:**

* **Thrills Gum:** Known for its quirky tagline, ‚ÄúIt still tastes like soap!‚Äù Thrills Gum is a love-it-or-hate-it Canadian classic.
* **Sweet Marie:** A peanut and caramel-packed chocolate bar that‚Äôs been a part of Canadian childhoods for generations.

Candyville ensures these classics remain accessible, keeping the spirit of old-school Canadian candy alive.

**4. The Role of Multicultural Influences**

Canada‚Äôs multicultural fabric is reflected in its candy scene. From Asian-inspired Pocky sticks to Indian gulab jamun-flavored chocolates, [**Canadian candy shops**](https://candyville.ca/) are a melting pot of global treats. This diversity sets Canadian candy apart from its American and British counterparts, offering something for every palate.

**Discover at Candyville:**

Our shelves are stocked with international sweets, offering a unique opportunity to explore flavors from around the world without leaving Canada.

**5. Healthier Candy Options**

Canada takes pride in offering healthier alternatives to traditional candies. While American candy often focuses on indulgence and British sweets lean heavily on sugar, Canadian candy brands are increasingly introducing organic, vegan, and lower-sugar options.

**Trending Choices:**

* **SmartSweets:** A Canadian brand revolutionizing gummy candies with plant-based ingredients and reduced sugar.
* **Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate with Maple Syrup:** A nod to Canada‚Äôs love for maple, with a healthier twist.

At Candyville, we ensure our selection caters to health-conscious candy lovers, without compromising on taste.

**6. Seasonal Specials: Canadian Holidays and Treats**

Canada‚Äôs seasonal celebrations often inspire unique candies. Whether it‚Äôs maple fudge for Canada Day, pumpkin-spiced treats for Thanksgiving, or peppermint chocolates for Christmas, Canadian candy shops celebrate the seasons with flair.

**Seasonal Favorites at Candyville:**

* Peppermint Bark for the holidays.
* Pumpkin-Spiced Caramels in autumn.
* Maple Taffy during winter festivals.

**7. Packaging: A Subtle Yet Significant Difference**

Canadian candy packaging often reflects a blend of practicality and artistry. While American candy packaging emphasizes bold, attention-grabbing designs, and British wrappers lean toward traditional elegance, Canadian candy packaging often has a fun, playful vibe that resonates with its diverse audience.

**Why It Matters:**

The unique packaging makes Canadian candies excellent for gifting, and at Candyville, we offer beautifully curated gift boxes perfect for any occasion.

**8. Canadian Candy Shops: A Community Experience**

One of the biggest differences lies in the shopping experience. Canadian candy shops, like Candyville, are more than just stores‚Äîthey‚Äôre a trip down memory lane, a celebration of multiculturalism, and a hub for discovering unique flavors.

**Why Candyville Stands Out:**

Our store isn‚Äôt just about selling candy; it‚Äôs about sharing the joy of Canadian confectionery culture. Whether you‚Äôre hunting for an old favorite or eager to try something new, we make every visit special.

**9. Why Choose Canadian Candy?**

Canadian candy combines the best of both worlds‚Äîthe rich indulgence of American sweets and the refined flavors of British treats. With its distinct ingredients, nostalgic charm, and multicultural offerings, Canadian candy holds its own in the global candy arena.

**Final Thought:**

At Candyville, we believe candy isn‚Äôt just a treat; it‚Äôs a way to connect with Canada‚Äôs rich cultural tapestry. Whether you‚Äôre a local craving nostalgic classics or a visitor eager to explore Canadian sweets, our collection is sure to delight.

I did all my homework and scouted the whole forum & sites. Its so frustrating that there is no ONE workable way for foreigner to send money to our own bank account in China?! isn't that crazy

1. When we do a bank telegraphic transfer(TT) from our homecounty to China, Chinese ID is needed. 

2. Using Wise, even to Alipay/Wechat/bank account, Chinese ID needed. 

3. Any other remittance we attempted, Chinese ID is needed as well.

Is there no other ways? there's tones of expats in China, how do u guys go about getting your money in? Say i need to buy an expensive scooter or a whatever expensive coffee machine that cost 15k usd

Moreover plz disregard Ailpay link to foreign credit card ( that is not the best choice & mostly for tourist slapped with a 3% fee)

  
Everyone thought its hard to get money OUT of China, but getting IN is tough as NUT as well.

Anyone can advise? Or did i missed anything else that worked that i do not know of?

1i1sqgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/1i1sqgc/aigenerated_content/,AI-Generated Content,"**Title:** ""The Great Sock Conspiracy of 2023: A Cautionary Tale of Missing Footwear and Mysterious Forces""

**Fellow Redditors,**

I'm writing this post as a warning to you all. The other day, I experienced an event so bizarre, so inexplicable, that I'm still reeling from the shock. It's a story of socks, of deceit, of the unseen forces that govern our daily lives.

It started innocently enough. I woke up, got dressed, and headed to the kitchen to brew some coffee. That's when I noticed it: one of my favorite socks was missing. Not just any sock, mind you. This was a soft, comfortable, and slightly faded blue sock that had been with me through thick and thin. I searched high and low, scoured the floor, and even enlisted the help of my trusty sidekick (aka my cat, Mr. Whiskers). But it was nowhere to be found.

I shrugged it off as a minor annoyance, but as the day progressed, I began to notice a pattern. Every time I went to put on a pair of socks, one would mysteriously vanish. I'd take off my shoes, and suddenly, I'd be left with an odd number of footwear. It was as if some mischievous entity was playing a twisted game of hide-and-seek with my socks.

I tried to reason with myself, telling myself it was just a silly coincidence. But the evidence mounted. My drawer was a mess, with lone socks strewn about like a war zone. My laundry basket was a graveyard of singles, each one a testament to the Great Sock Conspiracy.

And then, the final nail in the coffin: I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. A fleeting shadow, a whisper of movement, as if the Sock Thief itself was lurking just beyond the edge of perception. I turned to face it, but it was gone, leaving behind only an echo of malevolent laughter.

So, Redditors, beware! The Sock Conspiracy is real, and it's coming for you. Protect your footwear at all costs, for once they're gone, they're gone forever. Share your own tales of missing socks in the comments below, and together, we can unravel the mystery of this dastardly plot.

**TL;DR:** My socks keep disappearing, and I'm convinced it's a conspiracy. Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon? Share your stories and let's get to the bottom of this!",1,1736928282.0,test,0,1.0,False

Anyway so it was a pretty normal morning at first, I had woken up before the rest of my family as usual, made a pot of coffee, than while waiting on my mug to cool down a little I decided to go into my backyard and get a couple of jumps on my trampoline, but even before i opened that door I knew something was off. I lived in walking distance from a runway so there was always planes taking off and landing, but I could hear allot more planes than usual, I could also hear helicopters and sirens. I didn't think much of it till I opened the back door and was hit with a strong burning smoky smell so pungent it practically knocked me backwards, a second or two later I regained my composure and looked outside, there was smoke everywhere, I walked out and looked at the sky, it was a deep dark red and the sun was so dim from the smoke you could look at it as long as you wanted. And it was raining ash like a snow storm from hell. Then I looked to the mountain and saw it was engulfed in a gigantic blaze. Helicopters and sirens went by dropping water and flame retardant over the flames. There was so much smoke I could barely breathe. About an hour later cops came knocking on the doors of everyone's houses to tell us there was a mandatory evacuation order. We grabbed our stuff and left. Than when we returned a few weeks later our home was intact. But just a 10 minute drive away was complete destruction, absolute hell. Home businesses forest's etc etc all gone. It was weird driving that way and not seeing certain things like a repair shop we took our car to or a pizza place we would eat at. And the Woolsey fire was only like a quarter as bad as the Palisades is. I can't even imagine what it might be like to have such ""urban"" destruction.

I could no longer receive or transfer money. It lasted for a month. I got angry yesterday and it was resolved. 

I know that Turkey is a high-risk country for finance. I can provide various documents. I was even asked to prove the legality of the Turkish president's administrative actions. I tried hard, although it is not right for a citizen to explain government actions.

 I don't know why HSBC's auditors suspected that the documents were fake and suspected fraud. The Chinese police issued me a residence permit. Are Chinese police not as good as banks? What's more, who are the people who kidnapped Chinese celebrities in Thailand? Are they Turkish? no, they are some bad chinese.


The Commercial Bank Law stipulates that deposits are voluntary and withdrawals are free. Is it legal to freeze my account without any judicial procedures? If you suspect that I am a fraudster, you can call the police.

I plan to take time to go to HSBC headquarters in Shanghai in the next two days, bring all the documents and documents, and try to  find the auditors. Ask them if there is anything suspicious. You can ask me face to face.  Since the auditors do not believe in the certificates issued by the Chinese and Turkish governments, I will go to the bank headquarters and turn myself in.

Auditors can have discretion, but whoever makes the audit decision should explain the reasons and provide guidance, instead of drinking coffee in the office and torturing others.

Has anyone gotten to adulthood and realised they likely have just been ina state of dissociation their whole lives? Until burnout and exhaustion or something small broke you?
I've never really told anyone about my life - they know about events they've been present for but the culmination of my life just seems to be trauma and I never sat in the victimhood mentality. 
Like most of us I met it with humour and smile on my dial.
Generally focussing on helping others and I've never made comparisons but their traumas seem mild. Some aren't mild obviously but they're general the ONE trauma or event.
I've never waste too leave people alone or stranded so I've made it my unknown (I was unawares) to help those that were going through suffering or pain. 
Possibly just distracting from my own but also because I don't wsnt others to ever feel horrible or sad. Or depressed. 
I've told stories and downplayed them or laughed it off and hit the next hurdle head on and capable. 
Nit to be cliche but even the mild storied I've told therapists and psychologists have shocked them or made them cry and it's stopped me from going on with the rest. It all seems made up and I never gave it the credence it probably deserved.
 I've been depressed, I've been medicated and not wanting exist but these moments are when I'm alone and I feel shame for them. 
I hate telling people what's happened and if I read everything that has happened in a document or book I wpukdnt wsntnto be around that perosn and nor because they're sad but because they're so damaged and broken and seemingly a danger to be around.
There's a quote from The Crowded Room that has stuck with me -

* I had this patient, Anna, when I was a first-year resident. And Anna had been [graped] six times, by six different men, over the course of eight years. And, Candy, she was 19. How do you explain that? There's a phenomenon, an awful phenomenon. Victims of abuse survive. They-they get away, only to be abused again by somebody else. And I think, hearing these stories, ""My God, these-these poor people. The unluckiest human beings on the planet."" Only it's not luck. It is a fucked up twist of nature. Because as children, they are forced to relate sexually. They are trained to be abused. Predators are very adept at finding their prey. They're picking up on cues that nobody else can see. These cues can be chemical, psychological, behavioral, nonverbal. To the predator, neon signs. And here's the thing that I cannot emphasize enough. None of it is under the victim's control. None of it is the victim's fault.*

I never felt like a victim but everyone even the ""friends"" I had had a long running joke *""if she didn't have bad luck she wouldn't  have any luck at all""*

I just felt cursed. One of the unlucky people and I lived in it. That was my tagline. And that there is the epitome of being a victim. 
I hate that but I've gotten to an age where people have been broken by less and I always wondered why I felt like I hadn't lived in that victim mentality but seemingly I have but in a completely different way. 
I've hit a wall. I'm so tired. I've become so burnt out I feel like I've wasted my life and I've never compared the trauma but something small got me and I haven't stopped crying for weeks. Every day and I hate it. I didn't cry for years. 
I've even gotten to the point where I cried but I wrote my goodbye letters to my family like I was writing forms. It was just a process. The tears fell but my brain left. 
I've been in fight or flight for so long that I think my brain and body have matche up in their collapse finally but before this I just intellectilzed everything and didn't feel sorry for myself. Never. My pain was nothing in comparisons to others in my brain. And now.. I'm in this self hating self pitying rage and misery filled being. 
I've dislocated since I've been 3yrs old. My first memory is trauma. My last memory is trauma. 
The good has never outright the bad but now I can't even hold onto the good to keep going.

I'm sorry I've waffled on but.. ultimately has anyone else just dissociated their whole life. Never really living for yourself until something like dropping your iced coffee made your brain explode?

He's a light sleeper that gets up easily with the noise of an open door, but most of the times, he sleeps through right after I have to get up in the morning.

I make as little unnecessary noise as possible, tripping through the dark room at times since he's still sleeping.

I recently got up later than him, but woke up to the noise of a loud alarm. Granted, I knew about the alarm. The difference is, he didn't shut it off and let it play for 30 seconds or so.

It made me feel completely disregarded, as I try my best to wake up quietly and walk around the house quietly. At times, I would make coffee or wrap up garbage but even stopped that in the morning since he wakes up to light noise.

He told me it's how he felt since I woke up early and would wake him up from time to time. How is that comparable? An alarm with blasting that he knowingly let play for seconds to what I did?

Am I overreacting or is his reaction reasonable? I can't control what time I wake up for work.

TL;DR Boyfriend reacted in an inconsiderate way to his alarm blasting me awake and compared it to me waking him up accidentally from time to time because I get up early for work.

* I‚Äôm not apolitical, and I believe in standing up for what‚Äôs right. Definitely not a Marcos/Duterte supporter‚Äîsocial awareness is important to me.
* I‚Äôm based in Manila, so it would be nice to meet someone nearby for easier meetups. 
* I have a strong personality and can be opinionated.



# What I‚Äôm Looking For in You:

* 21-27 years old. Older guys tend to be more mature, which I like, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll tolerate immaturity or manipulation just because I‚Äôm younger.
* No girlfriends, kids, or open relationships. I‚Äôm here for a genuine, uncomplicated connection.
* You understand the importance of personal space and aren‚Äôt pushy about things.
* You don‚Äôt smoke and take care of yourself. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into fitness or can cook.
* I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs ready for a serious relationship. No games, just a real connection.
* It‚Äôs easier to plan dates and hangouts when we‚Äôre in the same area.
* I want someone who‚Äôs willing to share their world while embracing mine. Even if we have different hobbies, we can learn from each other.
* While I don‚Äôt have pets right now, I‚Äôd love to have one someday. It‚Äôs a plus if you love animals as much as I do!
* Someone who enjoys memes, silly debates, and random jokes.
* Someone who keeps their word and values trust. I‚Äôm not here for inconsistent communication or flaky behavior.
* I enjoy watching and playing sports occasionally, so it‚Äôd be fun if we could share this interest‚Äîor at least cheer each other on!

I‚Äôm not rushing into anything, but I‚Äôm serious about finding someone who‚Äôs ready for a committed relationship. I believe the best relationships are built on mutual respect, trust, and shared effort.

If you think we‚Äôd get along, send me a message! Let‚Äôs start with a conversation, see if we vibe, and who knows‚Äîmaybe we‚Äôll find something special together. üòä",5,1736927116.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

What would you do next?,"Against your own inner desires, you were trained to be a prize fighter your whole life. You may not have had the interest, but you had the talent and physical gifts to excel. Speed and power all throughout your body, ambidexterity, the ability to recover quickly, a skeletal frame ideal for generating force, and unusually fast reflexes, especially for an athlete. 

You started training since the age of 5 to impress your parents. But you soon came to hate this as when you were 12, you realized how much of your childhood you were missing out on. Not many real friends and you were never anyone's best friend. You never knew what it was like to have a significant other and being home schooled, always traveling for fights, made you feel isolated. You ate like a fighter, no junk food, candy, or soda. You had gum, tea, black coffee, or fruit as your favorite foods.

After a dominant amateur career, your parents put you in the pros at age 16. Though not yet an adult, your parents pulled some strings with a promoter to get your fighters license at 16, before even a drivers license. 

For 6 years you dominated the pros, winning championships in 3 weightclasses and earning $50 Million. Your parents told you to keep all of that money for yourself, but you gave then $10 Million. They refused and expressed deep regret for robbing you of a childhood. You said nothing, even though you had contempt. 

They pass away soon after. 

At age 23, you are involved in a brutal fight with the hardest hitting opponent you've ever faced. You are knocked out in a stunning upset. 

At the hospital, it turns out your opponent cheated and had tampered gloves, meaning they are going to jail. You on the other hand suffered a severe concussion, a skull fracture, and a herniated disc. You are told to never fight again which deep down, you are okay with it. You make a miraculous recovery.

You are now free to do what you want. You never went to college, had friends, found love, owned a pet, and anytime you traveled, you simply trained or fought. No fun.

My life is simple‚Äîcozy apartment, good coffee, and the best companion I could ask for: Finn, my golden retriever. He‚Äôs been with me for two years, and honestly, he‚Äôs the one who makes life feel alive.


---

The day started like it always does. Finn‚Äôs tail wagged against the bed, a gentle rhythm coaxing me awake before the alarm could. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good at this, you know that?‚Äù I mumbled, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Finn barked softly in reply, hopping off the bed and heading straight for the kitchen.

Coffee for me, peanut-butter-kibble for him‚Äîit‚Äôs our morning ritual. Finn sat patiently, watching every move I made. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the real boss here, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I asked, setting his bowl down. He wagged his tail like it was a performance review, and I‚Äôd passed.

Laurelhurst Park was our next stop. The crisp morning air felt refreshing, and Finn was in his element‚Äîchasing squirrels, barking at the occasional crow, and making friends with every dog we passed. Walter, a retired teacher we often ran into, greeted us with his usual smile. ‚ÄúMorning, Finn. Morning, Elliot. How‚Äôs the world treating you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter with this guy around,‚Äù I said, gesturing to Finn, who was happily sniffing Walter‚Äôs cane.

After the park, it was coffee time at Brew Haven. Clara, the barista, had Finn‚Äôs biscuit ready before I even ordered. ‚ÄúYou spoil him,‚Äù I said with a grin.

‚ÄúHe deserves it,‚Äù she replied, sliding my cappuccino across the counter. Finn, biscuit in mouth, wagged his thanks.

Back home, it was work time. I dove into a logo project while Finn snoozed at my feet, occasionally stretching and letting out a sigh as if to remind me that breaks were important. Around mid-afternoon, he nudged my leg, tail wagging.

‚ÄúAlright, buddy. You win,‚Äù I said, grabbing his leash for our second walk. This time, it was a slower stroll through the neighborhood. Finn stopped to sniff every tree, every mailbox, every speck of life.

Dinner was quiet‚Äîpasta for me, kibble for Finn, and some leftover chicken for Hazel, the stray cat who had recently joined our little family. She and Finn had formed a surprising bond, often sharing space on the couch like old friends.

The evening ended on the couch with a book in my hands, Finn sprawled across my lap, and Hazel perched on the armrest. The apartment was quiet except for the soft hum of the city outside.

It wasn‚Äôt a grand day, but it didn‚Äôt need to be. Finn and Hazel made every moment feel full, and for now, that‚Äôs all I need.

Now I've been sleeping for 10-11 hours a night which... isn't really great. And if I undersleep one night, I'll either take a nap or sleep longer the following night.

Last friday I had an exam, I slept for 7 hours. The entire rest of the day post exam was spent running errands, and then in the evening I went out with my friends (no alcohol involved). I got home and went to sleep around 3 am. 

Y'all I woke up at 5 pm the next day. I didn't even get to see the sunlight during that day. My roommate was worried about me and was planning to enter my room to check on me. 

This is a bit jarring because I also have an issue falling asleep now so if I go to sleep at 10 pm, it will take me at least one hour to fall asleep. I know this because usually I have a show running in the background. 

Right now it's exam period so I can adjust my everyday schedule to my sleep needs. But once I start the semester, it will fck me up.

Yes I do drink coffee, 1 or 2 cups a day. It seems to be the only thing keeping me up because even though I sleep so much, I still feel sleepy and yawn like crazy.

Currently, I'm managing the shop's social media accounts myself, but it‚Äôs been challenging to keep up with content creation, engagement, and strategizing. I‚Äôm considering hiring a social media manager or content strategist to help elevate our brand, but I have a few questions:

1. **Cost:** What‚Äôs a reasonable budget for hiring a part-time or freelance social media manager/content strategist?
2. **Value:** Have any of you small business owners hired one? Was it worth the investment in terms of increased engagement or sales?
3. **DIY Tips:** If hiring isn‚Äôt feasible right now, what are some beginner-friendly strategies I can implement to improve my content and engagement?

Any advice, experiences, or resources would be incredibly helpful. Thanks in advance! ‚òï",2,1736926398.0,PHJobs,0,1.0,False

Hey friends
I'm looking to see if there is any interest in continuing the series Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi and Geoffrey Trousselot. R/Bookclub read the first book of the series roughly one year ago in November 2023. You can find the discussions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/s/FLXouwQpyM)

The next book in the series is Tales from the Cafe:

In a small back alley in Tokyo, there is a caf√© which has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. But this coffee shop offers its customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time...

From the author of Before the Coffee Gets Cold comes a story of four new customers each of whom is hoping to take advantage of Cafe Funiculi Funicula's time-travelling offer.

Among some faces that will be familiar to readers of Kawaguchi's previous novel, we will be introduced to:

The man who goes back to see his best friend who died 22 years ago
The son who was unable to attend his own mother‚Äôs funeral
The man who travelled to see the girl who he could not marry
The old detective who never gave his wife that gift...

This beautiful, simple tale tells the story of people who must face up to their past, in order to move on with their lives. Kawaguchi once again invites the reader to ask themselves: what would you change if you could travel back in time? 


There are 5 books in the series. The third book is Before your Memory Fades, the fourth is Before We Say Goodbye, and the fifth is Before We Forget Kindness 

If you are interested in reading this as a group please comment and like this post. If there is enough interest then I will get a schedule together shortly. Thanks all

I've spent 8 years helping startups grow, and I want to share something counterintuitive that's working incredibly well right now. Instead of hiding our ""*weaknesses*,"" we're highlighting them - and it's bringing in more clients than our bigger competitors.

Here's the exact process that helped one of my clients boost sales by 40%:

* **Stop apologizing for being small.** Change ""*Sorry, it's just me handling everything*"" to ""*You'll work directly with the owner. No middlemen. No mix-ups.*"" Clients love direct access to decision-makers.
* **Document your journey openly**. One of my clients started sharing daily behind-the-scenes videos - messy office, coffee spills, and all. Their audience grew 5x because people connected with their authenticity.
* **Position limitations as advantages**. Limited capacity? ""*I only take 3 clients per month to ensure deep, focused attention*"" beats ""*We serve hundreds of clients*"" for high-value B2B relationships.
* **Share real mistakes and learnings.** When I messed up a client project, I wrote about it. Counter-intuitively, this brought more trust and clients. Nobody believes in perfect - they believe in honest.
* **Use small size to offer what big agencies can't.** Quick decisions, flexible solutions, and personal relationships become your edge. One client now leads with: ""*No account managers - you work directly with our strategic team.*""

The market is saturated with polished corporate messaging. Your ""*weaknesses*"" might be exactly what makes you stand out.

Would love to hear your experiences - have you ever turned a business limitation into an advantage?

my 23F ex over an argument. We were so deep into love
and never hesitated to show it. She frequently told me
that she loves me more than anybody, and sometimes
her amount of love even scares herself. I loved her the
same, and always assured her of it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
She was in a destitute financial status tho, bc she was
studying at a university without her parents' support.
And the school policy prohibited her of getting multiple
part-time jobs, limiting her income to about $400 a month.
I truly loved her and never wanted her to feel miserable
due to her financial status, so I provided substantial
amount of money to support her, like paying her
apartment's $5000 safety deposit, getting appliances
and electronics for her, planning trips, paying her
healthcare bills, etc. Did it purely out of love, and never
mentioned or guilty tripped her of those supports.
Regardless, she was extremely grateful.

And our level of intimacy was pretty high, we literally
spent every holidays and weekends together, cuddled
every night, and talked on the phone for hours every
single day we were away from each other. We found
each other very attractive, and had similar interests and
intelligence, which made it so fun to communicate.
Even on the day we broke up, she ran towards me in the
first sight, and told me how much she loved me.
Neither of us lied or cheated, since we both knew
each other's passwords. And there was no abuse.

Then we had an argument, over the same topic we argued 
twice before and made a promise to never bring up ever 
again. I never used any profanity, violence or showed abrupt 
behaviors, but mocked her in a disrespectful way like 
repeating her words and calling her illogical.
She seemed deeply disappointed, and dumped me 
via message the next day.


TL;DR : We loved each other wholeheartedly and I devoted
              to her both in materialistically & mentally, but she
              dumped me after a disrespectful argument I started.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried to contact her on the day of BU, and a month later.
I apologized and told her about my therapy, the books i read 
which adheres to the values she hold, and other efforts I‚Äôm 
putting into myself to become a completely new person. 
She did reply me and told me about her recent issues, but 
clearly did not want to continue the conversation and ghosted me once I told her that I wish to talk to her in person.

Now it's been two months. I still love her a lot, but since she
ghosted me I'm well aware that the chance of reconciliation
is slim to none. I'm trying to move on, and there had been
3 people who approached and showed interest in me. They 
were attractive and congenial, mentally & financially stable. 
But whenever I tried to develop a relationship with them, I felt 
heartbroken and as if I'm about to have a breakdown.
I still miss my ex so much, and all the times we spent together, places we went, and the fact that I caused the BU 
by hurting her feelings haunts me every time. I would die for
a second chance, or to earn her trust back, but it seems
impossible now. The pain and guilt is excruciating, and
I just can't get myself out of it.

I'm thinking of contacting her next month, for a coffee or 
something light without mentioning anything about 
reconciliation. I know everyone on this sub will stand against
my plan, but it's just too painful and I think it's necessary for
me to make that attempt, in order to finally move on.

Are there anyone who went through something similar to 
my experience? Would highly appreciate any kind of advice.",3,1736926149.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Scientists actually measured this stuff, and it turns out goldfish can focus for 9 whole seconds, while we humans tap out at 8. I don't know whether to laugh or cry about this, but here we are! 

And if you're a fellow SaaS founder like me, this tiny fact probably just made your stomach drop a little. Because let's be honest ‚Äì we're not just building products anymore, we're fighting for attention in a world where people scroll past content faster than you can say ""revolutionary AI-powered solution.""

Remember that time you spent three weeks perfecting your landing page copy? (Just me? Okay...) Well, here's the kicker: you've got about 3 seconds to make someone care. Three. Seconds.

Let that sink in while I grab another coffee... 

*sips coffee*

Alright, let's get real for a minute. We've all been there ‚Äì excitedly showing off our latest feature update only to watch someone's eyes glaze over faster than a donut at Krispy Kreme. The problem isn't your product. It's not even the market. It's that we're all speaking 'feature' when we should be speaking 'human.'

Here's what I learned the hard way:

1. Nobody (and I mean nobody) wakes up thinking, ""Gee, I really hope someone sells me a new SaaS tool today!"" They wake up thinking about their problems, their deadlines, and probably their next coffee.
2. Those shiny features we love? They're like trying to show someone the engine specs before they've decided they even want a car. Lead with their pain points ‚Äì the stuff that makes them want to throw their laptop out the window.
3. Trust isn't built with a fancy tech stack. It's built one solved problem at a time. Be the friend who helps first and sells later.

You know what's funny? We spend so much time optimizing our products, but sometimes I wonder if we should be optimizing for humanity instead. Because at the end of the day, we're not selling to businesses or ""users"" ‚Äì we're selling to people who just want their lives to suck a little less.

And here's my favorite plot twist: Once you stop trying to grab attention and start trying to actually help people? That's when they actually start paying attention.

Mind-blowing, right? 

So, what now? Well, if any of this hit home (and if you're still reading, I'm going to assume it did), I've got something that might help. I went deep down this rabbit hole and documented everything I learned about turning those precious seconds of attention into actual, you know, customers who stick around.

Notes:
* Cold open: Patrick begrudgingly leaves
* Do we ever actually learn who decided Patrick leaves? Cuz I feel like not wanting to have sex with your landlord who then kicks you out, it‚Äôs just gotta be a violation of some law even in Australia. 
* Tom kind of is gross. Would I though? Probably
* I‚Äôll have to say, this is also not a favourite episode. It‚Äôs a quasi bottle episode, if you count Tom being the only one bottled. I think sad Tom sucking is an anchor on things. 
* ‚ÄúMy outer shell is not snug to my ske-lee-tal system, independent flesh is the enemy of speed‚Äù god tier quotes from Hannah this episode
* Proof in point ‚Äúkisses‚Äù
* Arnold: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about ginger I‚Äôm just sick of talking about it‚Äù. Which for a mental hospital post unaliving sounds reasonable.
* The conversation with Arnold and Josh about dating feels very autism coded on top of the regular ‚ÄúWill they or won‚Äôt they‚Äù
* Who DOES decide who‚Äôs a poet or farmer in communism?
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going out with a mental?!‚Äù That pretty much captures how easily close friends can be crass and inappropriate together
* My fave part of the whole episode EVERY single time, is Alan saying Premium Product with those SUPER annunciated P‚Äôs. Pete‚Äôs Pizza is Premium Product!
* I kind of hate that they keep having Tom ‚Äúdraw‚Äù crude cartoons they never show us. It feels like the way they repeat it, that Tom Ward in real life CAN draw. 
* Also, truffle oil is pretty earthy tasting. Hard to believe Tom wouldn‚Äôt taste it.
* I also can‚Äôt imagine Josh making dry cupcakes. 
* Stuart is still gross
* I‚Äôm also surprised that super cynical Josh actually comes around pretty quickly on the coffee cart. 
* That pizza looks flat af. Prop pizza or Melbourne style?
* ‚ÄúDid you sex a goth Claire?‚Äù Turns out the episode is full of quotables.
* The exchange with Claire and Tom, ugh. You hate to see it. Sad bath just made it worse.
* Psychiatric hospital Arnold is still just adorable as hell. The shrink wanting to meet a prospective date is horrid tho. I do like how Arnold appropriates Josh‚Äôs verbal teasing. 
* Sad sulky Tom did ruin the prank 
* Claire says she fucked up. Do you think that means she fucked up the first time she engaged Tom? The second? The Jenny thing? Or this conversation?

I hope this post doesn‚Äôt come across as desperate or rude; that‚Äôs definitely not my intention.

I‚Äôm a single mom of two young kids, and lately, I‚Äôve been struggling financially. I work part-time, but with mortgage payments, car bills, and daily expenses, I‚Äôm finding it really hard to make ends meet. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not eligible for government assistance, and it feels like I‚Äôm constantly just getting by.

I‚Äôve recently done some research into the financial domination (findom) space, and while I know it‚Äôs far from the glamorous Facebook reels that show women making thousands weekly, I can‚Äôt help but feel intrigued. I‚Äôd love to explore this as a way to gain some financial relief, while also embracing an interest I‚Äôve always had: being a domme. I‚Äôve never felt comfortable exploring this side of me in past relationships, and now I‚Äôm in a position where I feel like it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to explore with someone who understands the dynamic.

I‚Äôm not looking for huge financial gains ‚Äì honestly, I‚Äôd just love any small help that could make my situation a little easier. A subscription payment, a weekly coffee, or even just a bit of support would go a long way. I‚Äôm looking for someone I can connect with, someone I can talk to daily, alongside exploring the domme/sub relationship. I want to have control and feel empowered while also offering something meaningful to someone else.

I know this is probably a bit cringey for some of the more experienced dommes here, and I totally get that. But if you‚Äôve made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to read and understand my situation.

Thanks again for listening, and I‚Äôd love to chat more if anyone is interested.

Wanna budget alternative? The ol fashion lmg wreaks the raids. It's got no spin up time, faster reload, and almost doubled the rof. All for the low price of around 50 less damage per shot, and just 75 rounds.

But let's be honest here. How often are you actually mag dumping the entire plasma core without performing an action that makes you stop shooting? The answers; probably every 40-50 rounds shot.

Tired of grinding for the new mods? Wanna shoot immediately? Use it. Worry about ap cost? It's 16 ap cost now, not 50. Worried about ammo? You get 1100 rounds for each stage of the raid, and generally a bunch of ammo from dead mobs.

The effective dps is damn close to an equivalent fully modded gat plasma. For BE25, the lmg(prime) sits at 2385dps, and the gat plasma(with accelerant nozzle) sits at 2462dps. That's damn close!

Obviously for generally mobs the lmg wins everytime. Your not beating no spin up time. But for bossing, it's sorta personal preference. With the lmg, and speed demon you can reload in 2.5 seconds. It takes the the gat plasma 1.3 seconds to spin up to shoot. In a boss fight that requires ap regen periods; the lmg wins. If we're talking expending hundreds of canned coffee; then the gatvplasma wins.

Concensus: the LMG is generally overall a lower maintenance platform than the gat plasma, with superior performance against multiple enemies. The gat plasma excels marginally in specifically a sustained boss fight at the expense of resources.",0,1736924843.0,fo76,13,0.5,False

Journal. Journal journal journal‚Ä¶ what to say. Hm. 

I‚Äôm going to do a recap, both head & heart aren‚Äôt really in it today: 

* I dreamed about my honey and I don‚Äôt remember enough to write down what his part in the dream was but I woke up lovey. 
* I made a coffee and first time eyeballing it the milk ratio was perfect! Second two of the day less so‚Ä¶ I do need to measure it though so I know how many calories each coffee is. Tomorrow. But microwaving the milk worked well. Though is it bad for me? And when I switch to oat or almond milk will it work as well? I really don‚Äôt want to drink cows milk on the daily - it icks me out tbh. I will and do drink it but rarely ie at a cafe or at mum and dads with a splash in my coffee or hot chocolate but no more frequently than that. I have dairy like it‚Äôs not that as much, it‚Äôs just the iccckkkkk stuff I‚Äôve read about cows milk. Plus I bet one trillion dollars it won‚Äôt be good for my eczema. 
* Focus is still shot. Where oh where has it gone? 
* Ummmmmmmmmmmm
* I had a fun chat with him today, and last night! And today. He‚Äôs my favourite. 
* I cleaned my makeup brushes and hairbrushes! I love when things dry in the breezy sunshine, it feels so ideal. 
* I think my period is imminent. I can *feel* it. It‚Äôs so odd. I‚Äôve tried googling it in the past but it only comes up with cramps. Maybe it is a form of cramps? But it‚Äôs like all of a sudden I am aware I have ovaries and they just feel‚Ä¶ not heavier per se, but for a short period they just feel so existent to me. Not for long, it doesn‚Äôt last long, it‚Äôs not painful like cramps are but maybe it‚Äôs still cramps. Idk. I‚Äôd like to learn to be more in tune with my body. I think sometimes I am, like I remember before I found out I was pregnant (god that‚Äôs so scary to say) but I knew I was because I just felt like I was before I was even really that suspicious or uneasy about it. It wasn‚Äôt paranoia it was like, oh okay so I think I‚Äôm knocked up. Idk. It‚Äôs weird. While idk if I ever want kids, the experience of pregnancy would be incredible - not in a fun way but just to go through those changes? To know you‚Äôre currently growing a PERSON INSIDE OF YOU? And feeling a person kicking you? It‚Äôs mental. It‚Äôs insane. 
* I made beans for dinner again. How fun. My avocado was perfect! 
* The caffeine worked, eventually. But it didn‚Äôt feel any different til he mentioned anything so maybe it was just a placebo.
* I wish I had chocolate. I want some realllllly badly. Am I a clich√©? Bring probably PMSy and craving chocolate? Yes, yes I am.

## Types of Foldable Ottomans ‚Å£with Storage: Navigating the‚Äå Options

The beauty of the foldable ottoman lies not only in its functionality but also in the sheer variety that's available. Let's explore some options‚Äå that cater ‚Äãto various needs ‚Äåand preferences:

**1. Ottoman Cubes:** these‚Å§ are among the ‚Å§simplest and most affordable choices. Often ‚Å¢compact, they are perfect ‚Äãfor ‚Å¢small spaces like dorm rooms or ‚Å¢studio apartments. An ottoman cube with storage, they are also highly favored by interior designers that need‚Äã portability and space optimization. These can accommodate smaller ‚Å£items and can serve quickly as ‚Å¢footrests for individuals who might need one.‚Å¢ They‚Äôre‚Äç particularly useful for storing small collections and personal items. They can also be grouped in clusters to form larger storage solutions and can easily‚Äç retract to‚Å§ single units when requirements shift.

**2. Storage Benches:** ‚ÄçLonger and wider than‚Å¢ cubes, storage‚Å£ benches provide a ample ‚Å§amount of storage and additional seating. A storage bench foldable option is ideal ‚Å£for living rooms, hallways, or at the foot of a bed. It can‚Äç host multiple users, and serve as‚Äã a great space to store larger items such as blankets, pillows, and even children‚Äôs toys. They can even hold larger items like blankets or pillows and still appear as a sleek piece‚Äå of furniture. When ‚Äånot required, these easily retract‚Äå into ‚Äãflat ‚Äãpacks, taking up very little room.

**3.Multi-Functional Ottomans:** Some‚Äå designs push the envelope by adding extra‚Å£ features. These‚Å§ might include features such as lift-top storage, with internal ‚Äådivisions‚Å£ for organization, or converting ‚Å§from a compact ottoman to a coffee table or temporary work surface. Such features make them incredibly versatile.The ""multifunctional ottoman"" aspect makes ‚Å¢it a favorite for multi-purpose rooms that require quick‚Å§ furniture transitions. These allow for seamless navigation through ‚Å¢various applications,a ‚Äãfeature‚Äå especially favored by professional stagers who ‚Äårequire the most flexible designs.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing Your Foldable Ottoman

Now‚Äã that you have‚Å¢ a grasp on the different types of foldable ottomans,it's critically‚Å§ important to ‚Å¢consider various key features before making a ‚Äåpurchasing decision. Here are some factors to keep in mind:

**1. Size and Dimensions:** First, accurately measure your intended space. A foldable ottoman should fit comfortably, both ‚Å¢when it is set up and ‚Äåwhen it has been folded away. Look ‚Å¢at detailed product specifications to ensure the dimensions ‚Äåsuit the space you have available. Ensure also that when folded ‚Äçflat, the item does not take‚Å£ up undue storage ‚Äãspace. This‚Å¢ will allow for maximum adaptability should other ‚Äçproducts need to temporarily take ‚Å¢up the space when not in use.

**2. Storage capacity:** Analyze how much ‚Å£you want to‚Å£ store. Consider if you deal with small loose items, large bulky items, or a combination of ‚Äãthe two.‚Äã certain products‚Å§ come with internal ‚Äãdivisions and others come with single open storage areas. Ensure you think about the ‚Å£required internal structure to best address‚Äã your needs. A storage chest ‚Å£foldable‚Å£ design will make sure your ottoman will collapse down wholly flat when ‚Å£storage isn‚Äôt needed.

**3. Material and Durability:** The material of both the exterior‚Äã and the‚Å¢ interior storage area are‚Å§ crucial. Look for durable materials‚Äã that are easy to ‚Å¢clean if required. If you choose to include the ottoman in a child-friendly area, ‚Äçconsider ‚Å£also‚Äç materials‚Å£ that will be safe yet resilient. Sturdy frames and quality stitching are also critically‚Å£ important ‚Å£for long-term use. Faux leather is often preferred because it is aesthetically appealing, is ‚Äçeasy to clean, and has a strong durability factor too.

**4.ease of ‚Å§Folding and Portability:** A ‚Äòportable storage ‚Å¢ottoman‚Äô‚Å£ that is truly portable‚Äã needs a seamless and easy folding mechanism and will require‚Å£ little hassle to assemble and collapse. Ensure the product is light enough to easily pick up and move ‚Å¢when required. Also consider that a sturdy mechanism is essential for frequent set up and breakdown. Consider that ""easy to store ottoman"" is also crucial for individuals that might need to frequently rearrange their furniture.

**5. Style‚Äã and Aesthetics:** While function is key, the‚Å§ look matters. Select an ottoman that complements the decor of your space ‚Å£in terms of color, style, and material. ‚ÄçSome come‚Å£ with ornate designs,while others‚Å£ keep a minimalist look,all of which need to be‚Äå considered. An ""ottoman‚Å¢ cube‚Äç with storage"" design may work well in a more modern design space, while a folding ottoman storage chest might work well for a space with a more traditional aesthetic.

1i1rq5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/1i1rq5x/air_canada_flight_attendants_contract_is_up_for/,Air Canada flight attendants contract is up for negotiation soon and here‚Äôs what we are fighting for:,"I wanted to take a moment to explain what‚Äôs going on with Air Canada flight attendants right now as we approach contract negotiations, especially as we push for fairer wages and better working conditions. We‚Äôve recently seen the Air Canada pilots almost-strike and the Canada Post strike. We may be next and I want to shed some light on the issue. This is by no means a full detailed account of everything we‚Äôre fighting for. 

A lot of people think our job is just about serving coffee at 35,000 feet, but there‚Äôs so much more to it. We‚Äôre safety professionals first and foremost. Before we ever step foot on a plane, we go through weeks of intensive training to handle emergency evacuations, fires, medical emergencies, unruly passengers‚Äîyou name it. Our job is to ensure your safety from the moment you board until you disembark, yet the pay and working conditions we face don‚Äôt reflect the importance of what we do.

Back in 2004, Air Canada was facing bankruptcy, and like everyone else, we took major wage cuts to help save the company. At the time, our starting wage was $24 an hour, but it was slashed to $21 for new hires. Adjusted for inflation, that $24 should be $36.38 today, yet new flight attendants start at around $30 an hour‚Äîor just $27,000 annually. This means we haven‚Äôt even recovered to our pre-bankruptcy wage levels, despite the airline being profitable for years now. Imagine your wage remaining stagnant for 20+ years.

But it‚Äôs worse than it sounds. We‚Äôre only paid for our ‚Äúin-flight‚Äù hours‚Äîan average of 75 hours per month‚Äîwhile the average person works 150-160 hours monthly. This doesn‚Äôt include the hours we spend doing pre-boarding safety checks, helping passengers board, or waiting at airports after flights. CUPE (our union) estimates we work an extra 35 hours per month unpaid. When you add it all up, many flight attendants are effectively earning below minimum wage.

What makes this even more frustrating is that Air Canada is not transparent about its pay structure. When you‚Äôre hired, you don‚Äôt find out until after training that you won‚Äôt be paid for all the hours you work. The airline goes out of its way to hide the fact that you‚Äôre only compensated for flight hours, not the hours you‚Äôre actually on duty.

To compound the issues further, Air Canada‚Äôs paychecks are riddled with errors, and the pay statements are intentionally made so difficult to understand that the average person can‚Äôt understand them. You‚Äôd need to be an expert on the 293 page contract to catch all the errors. As a result, some experienced flight attendants have become makeshift accountants to help the rest of us review them. Claiming missing expenses is a lengthy process, with arbitrary rules on which expenses are automatically paid and which require manual claims. There is no penalty for the company that makes these errors constantly and has no reason to rectify their process.

There‚Äôs also this misconception that we get to travel the world for free. While we technically have standby passes, most flights are oversold these days, and there are rarely empty seats for us to use. The idea that we‚Äôre jet-setting around the globe is just not the reality anymore.

Experienced flight attendants are critical to the safety and well-being of passengers. When wages remain low, the turnover rate increases, which can lead to a workforce made up of people who don‚Äôt take this as a long-term career but rather a short-term job. This creates a revolving door of staff who lack the deep, accumulated experience that is essential to handle the complex situations we face in the air. Inexperienced flight attendants may not be as equipped to handle emergency situations, deal with difficult passengers, or recognize potential safety hazards.

Moreover, experienced flight attendants are often the ones advocating for passengers‚Äô interests because we are the direct point of contact during the flight. We‚Äôre the ones on the ground fighting to protect passengers, whether it‚Äôs preventing grooming staff from rushing onto a plane before elderly or disabled passengers are assisted, or intervening to stop the discomfort and embarrassment that often results from this practice. These issues might seem minor, but they directly impact passengers‚Äô travel experience, and it‚Äôs flight attendants who are standing up to the airline‚Äôs management to make sure passengers are treated with dignity. We‚Äôre the ones who have seen shrinkflation and the meals and snacks get smaller for passengers. We‚Äôre the ones that feel a sense of embarrassment serving our business class passengers, who pay thousands for a single ticket, when the meal we‚Äôre serving looks like it came from Wendy‚Äôs rather than a high end restaurant. And we‚Äôre the ones who insist the company fix these issues for passengers.

Furthermore, when flight attendants and pilots are not paid for all the hours they work, safety protocols can be compromised. If pilots or flight attendants know they aren‚Äôt going to get paid for additional time spent on safety checks or dealing with minor issues, there‚Äôs a temptation to overlook those small problems to avoid delaying the flight. This can have disastrous consequences. Flight attendants have a series of mandatory safety checks that are crucial for the safe operation of the flight. When we aren‚Äôt compensated for these hours, there is less incentive to take the time needed to identify and resolve potential safety concerns. This is compounded by the airline‚Äôs constant pressure to rush through briefings and checks, which undermines our ability to prioritize passenger safety. These challenges not only affect flight attendants but directly affect the safety and comfort of every passenger on board.

Right now, we‚Äôre fighting for several things: fair wages that reflect the work we do, pay for all hours worked (not just flight hours), and transparency in how our pay is structured. We‚Äôre also supporting Bill C-415, which would ensure that flight attendants across Canada are paid for all mandated duties, including the unpaid work we do on the ground.

We‚Äôre not asking for the moon. We‚Äôre just asking for fair pay and basic respect for the work we do. If you‚Äôve ever felt safe flying with Air Canada, it‚Äôs because a flight attendant was there to make sure you were. We‚Äôre proud of what we do, but we deserve to be compensated fairly for it. We‚Äôre one of the few employee groups that are required to be Canadian. This is a fight for Canadian wages. If the company could replace us with foreign workers, they probably would.

If this resonates with you, please share or support us however you can. Public awareness is critical in helping us get the fair treatment we‚Äôve been waiting for since 2004. Our contract is up in March 2025. We stood with our pilots shoulder to shoulder when their contract was negotiated earlier this year. They deserved the raise they got and deserve much more. It was good to see the support they got on this sub. Really hoping to see support for flight attendants also. Thanks for reading!",10,1736923729.0,flightattendants,4,0.92,False

Some days, getting through that list feels like trying to run a marathon with a backpack full of bricks. But guess what? Technology to the rescue! Let‚Äôs dive into some of the best productivity apps that help streamline your day and make that list less... world-dominating.

First up, **Todoist**. This app is like having a personal assistant... minus the awkward small talk. It's super user-friendly and helps you organize tasks with deadlines, priorities, and even categories. My favorite part? You can set up recurring tasks. Hello, automatic grocery list reminders!

Next on the digital superpower list is **Trello**. Imagine having a massive whiteboard with all your ideas neatly organized, but you can fit it in your pocket. Trello‚Äôs card-based system lets you move tasks around like a game of Tetris (we all love a good Tetris game, right?). It's perfect for visual thinkers who need to see everything at once.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about **Evernote**. Think of it as your digital brain. Ever have those brilliant 3 AM thoughts that vanish come morning? With Evernote, you can jot them down, organize them into notebooks, and even attach voice memos. Because, let‚Äôs be real, who has time to type everything?

Feel the need to declutter your thoughts (and your workspace)? **Notion** is like minimalism in app form. It combines tasks, notes, databases, and even wikis into one streamlined platform. It‚Äôs great for those who want everything in one place without the chaos of juggling multiple apps. Does it sound too good to be true? Give it a shot and let me know!

Of course, we can‚Äôt ignore **Focus@Will**. If background noise is your nemesis, this app could be your new best friend. It offers music scientifically tailored to boost concentration. Suddenly, that noisy coffee shop turns into your productivity zen zone.

Ever tried out these apps or stumbled upon a tool that changed your life? Or do you have a productivity hack that's your secret sauce? I'm all ears, especially if it means I can finally conquer that task list without setting up camp in Stressville.

Because in the end, finding the right tools is all about working smarter, not harder. So go on, give your brain a break with these apps and see how light that backpack of bricks can actually feel. üòâ",1,1736923584.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1i1rnqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i1rnqs/20_months/,20 months ,"Hey everyone 
Im 20 months and 16 days caffeine free today 
Let me tell you it's been a hell of a ride no coffee,tea or chocolate.

I have deffently had PAWS throughout this whole experience and I still get waves of feeling good and bad much less than the start of course, I still suffer from DPDR,anxiety and brain fog, I really thought by now I would feel back to my old self but now being this far along I don't  think I will never be that same person again.

I wonder if any other long haulers feel the same as me this far in? Does it really get better one day? Everyday I wake up feeling foggy and just not getting that mental clarity that I use to have.

Every supplement I take like magnesium or vitamin d seems to effect me negatively just makes my symptoms worse. I've been to the doctor's I eat healthy, workout 3 times a week

I have been thinking of going back to maybe having one black tea a day as I heard that doesn't make you feel as anxious like when having a coffee?

Thanks everyone

1i1rn77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canada_sub/comments/1i1rn77/as_an_air_canada_flight_attendant_heres_what_were/,"As an Air Canada Flight Attendant, Here‚Äôs What We‚Äôre Fighting For (and Why You Should Care)","I wanted to take a moment to explain what‚Äôs going on with Air Canada flight attendants right now as we approach contract negotiations, especially as we push for fairer wages and better working conditions. We‚Äôve recently seen the Air Canada pilots almost-strike and the Canada Post strike. We may be next and I want to shed some light on the issue. This is by no means a full detailed account of everything we‚Äôre fighting for. 

A lot of people think our job is just about serving coffee at 35,000 feet, but there‚Äôs so much more to it. We‚Äôre safety professionals first and foremost. Before we ever step foot on a plane, we go through weeks of intensive training to handle emergency evacuations, fires, medical emergencies, unruly passengers‚Äîyou name it. Our job is to ensure your safety from the moment you board until you disembark, yet the pay and working conditions we face don‚Äôt reflect the importance of what we do.

Back in 2004, Air Canada was facing bankruptcy, and like everyone else, we took major wage cuts to help save the company. At the time, our starting wage was $24 an hour, but it was slashed to $21 for new hires. Adjusted for inflation, that $24 should be $36.38 today, yet new flight attendants start at around $30 an hour‚Äîor just $27,000 annually. This means we haven‚Äôt even recovered to our pre-bankruptcy wage levels, despite the airline being profitable for years now. Imagine your wage remaining stagnant for 20+ years.

But it‚Äôs worse than it sounds. We‚Äôre only paid for our ‚Äúin-flight‚Äù hours‚Äîan average of 75 hours per month‚Äîwhile the average person works 150-160 hours monthly. This doesn‚Äôt include the hours we spend doing pre-boarding safety checks, helping passengers board, or waiting at airports after flights. CUPE (our union) estimates we work an extra 35 hours per month unpaid. When you add it all up, many flight attendants are effectively earning below minimum wage. To clarify, this means we only start getting paid once the aircraft doors have been closed and the brakes come off. 

What makes this even more frustrating is that Air Canada is not transparent about its pay structure. When you‚Äôre hired, you don‚Äôt find out until after training that you won‚Äôt be paid for all the hours you work. The airline goes out of its way to hide the fact that you‚Äôre only compensated for flight hours, not the hours you‚Äôre actually on duty.

To compound the issues further, Air Canada‚Äôs paychecks are riddled with errors, and the pay statements are (in my opinion) intentionally made so difficult to understand that the average person can‚Äôt understand them. You‚Äôd need to be an expert on the 293 page contract to catch all the errors. As a result, some experienced flight attendants have become makeshift accountants to help the rest of us review them. Claiming missing expenses is a lengthy process, with arbitrary rules on which expenses are automatically paid and which require manual claims. There is no penalty for the company that makes these errors constantly and has no reason to rectify their process.

There‚Äôs also this misconception that we get to travel the world for free. While we technically have standby passes, most flights are oversold these days, and there are rarely empty seats for us to use. The idea that we‚Äôre jet-setting around the globe is just not the reality anymore.

Experienced flight attendants are critical to the safety and well-being of passengers. When wages remain low, the turnover rate increases, which can lead to a workforce made up of people who don‚Äôt take this as a long-term career but rather a short-term job. This creates a revolving door of staff who lack the deep, accumulated experience that is essential to handle the complex situations we face in the air. Inexperienced flight attendants may not be as equipped to handle emergency situations, deal with difficult passengers, or recognize potential safety hazards.

Moreover, experienced flight attendants are often the ones advocating for passengers‚Äô interests because we are the direct point of contact during the flight. We‚Äôre the ones on the ground fighting to protect passengers, whether it‚Äôs preventing grooming staff from rushing onto a plane before elderly or disabled passengers are assisted, or intervening to stop the discomfort and embarrassment that often results from this practice. These issues might seem minor, but they directly impact passengers‚Äô travel experience, and it‚Äôs flight attendants who are standing up to the airline‚Äôs management to make sure passengers are treated with dignity. We‚Äôre the ones who have seen shrinkflation and the meals and snacks get smaller for passengers. We‚Äôre the ones that feel a sense of embarrassment serving our business class passengers, who pay thousands for a single ticket, when the meal we‚Äôre serving looks like it came from Wendy‚Äôs rather than a high end restaurant. And we‚Äôre the ones who insist the company fix these issues for passengers.

Furthermore, when flight attendants and pilots are not paid for all the hours they work, safety protocols can be compromised. If pilots or flight attendants know they aren‚Äôt going to get paid for additional time spent on safety checks or dealing with minor issues, there‚Äôs a temptation to overlook those small problems to avoid delaying the flight. This can have disastrous consequences. Flight attendants have a series of mandatory safety checks that are crucial for the safe operation of the flight. When we aren‚Äôt compensated for these hours, there is less incentive to take the time needed to identify and resolve potential safety concerns. This is compounded by the airline‚Äôs constant pressure to rush through briefings and checks, which undermines our ability to prioritize passenger safety. These challenges not only affect flight attendants but directly affect the safety and comfort of every passenger on board.

Right now, we‚Äôre fighting for several things: fair wages that reflect the work we do, pay for all hours worked (not just flight hours), and transparency in how our pay is structured. We‚Äôre also supporting Bill C-415, which would ensure that flight attendants across Canada are paid for all mandated duties, including the unpaid work we do on the ground.

We‚Äôre not asking for the moon. We‚Äôre just asking for fair pay and basic respect for the work we do. If you‚Äôve ever felt safe flying with Air Canada, it‚Äôs because a flight attendant was there to make sure you were. We‚Äôre proud of what we do, but we deserve to be compensated fairly for it. We‚Äôre one of the few employee groups that are required to be Canadian. This is a fight for Canadian wages. If the company could replace us with foreign workers, they probably would.

If this resonates with you, please share or support us however you can. Public awareness is critical in helping us get the fair treatment we‚Äôve been waiting for since 2004. Our contract is up in March 2025. We stood with our pilots shoulder to shoulder when their contract was negotiated earlier this year. They deserved the raise they got and deserve much more.

It‚Äôs strictly a coffee experience kind of place where they roast and sell beans wholesale. They have another location for ‚Äúnormals‚Äù who want food and the standard cafe fare.

Owner is pretty chill and his philosophy to brewing is ‚Äúas long as the coffee is good, use any tool, recipe, brewer, you want‚Äù. And you can see he experiments with almost everything.

Initially curt in responses, but opens up and becomes more friendly when he knows you‚Äôre a fellow weird coffee person. There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúSelf Brew‚Äù option on the menu that‚Äôs $1 less, but he will warn you that this option is only available if you know what you‚Äôre doing. 

I picked a Colombian thermal shock double anaerobic to try, Kasuya V60 brewer. He‚Äôll grind the beans for you, but otherwise will just hand you the brewer, scale, filter paper, carafe and kettle to do your thing.

I started writing short stories as a hobby around six months ago. Now I've learned about ""show, don't tell"" and started to question if I should find another pastime. üòÇ I'm a bit explicit and declarative by nature, so it's a struggle.

Only the hum of the kitchen light broke the silence between them. Nick held his hands outstretched before him, fingertips tapping in a quiet rhythm‚Äîhis bravado now tempered with thoughtfulness. It seemed to Dennis that he had struck a nerve. He kept his eyes fixed on the coffee table where he could see Nick without staring.

""So, what did you think I did on weekends before I came home to harass you?"" Nick's lips curved into a half-smile, but his eyes held a hint of vulnerability.

Dennis' breath caught at the unexpected acknowledgment. All those months of pointed looks and barbed comments hung in the air between them. He pressed his fingers to his brow, feeling the weight of Nick‚Äôs question. He wasn‚Äôt used to these kinds of conversations.

‚ÄúHonestly, I had no idea. Not really into clubs.‚Äù Dennis studied the carpet, choosing his words carefully. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the muscles and five-o‚Äôclock-shadow thing going on... remind me of the popular jocks from high school. So, I guess I imagined you chasing tail, but with guys.‚Äù

Nick's eyebrows rose slightly, and understanding flickered across his face. ""That's not me."" He adjusted his position in the chair, the fabric rustling in the quiet room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all glitter and polish either way."" He seemed to reflect on the words. ‚ÄúA show‚Äôs a show, whether it‚Äôs for an audience or... yourself.‚Äù Nick's gaze dropped, his voice softening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to put on a performance than deal with what‚Äôs underneath.‚Äù

For the first time, Dennis caught a flicker of pain behind Nick's bravado‚Äîa mix of weariness and defiance. It unsettled him, this realization that Nick's sharp edges weren't merely provocations or defenses‚Äîthey were scaffolding holding fragile pieces in place.

Nick leaned back, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make it easy for you to see past... all this.‚Äù He gestured vaguely at himself, the hint of a smirk still playing on his lips.

Dennis shrugged. ‚ÄúI could have tried harder.‚Äù

The words came out softer than Dennis intended, and for a moment, the air between them felt heavier, as if the hum of the kitchen light had grown louder.

Nick studied Dennis, his gaze steady but unreadable. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong, though. I‚Äôve got the ‚Äòpopular jock‚Äô thing down when I want to. It‚Äôs just easier sometimes. People know what to expect from a clich√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the club?‚Äù Dennis asked. ‚ÄúIs that another... role?‚Äù

Nick tilted his head, his eyes catching the dim light. ‚ÄúNot exactly. It‚Äôs... me but turned up to eleven. I make the most of a few hours there so I can deal with...‚Äù He trailed off, looking at the dark TV screen. ‚ÄúWell, everything else.‚Äù

The quiet settled between them like dust after a storm. A yawn crept across Nick's face as he pressed back into the armchair, triggering an answering yawn from Dennis.

Dennis pushed himself up from the sofa, his hip protesting slightly. The leather of his wallet felt cool against his fingers as he slipped it into his pocket. Nick stretched out in the armchair, his legs dangling over one arm, looking ready to drift off right there.

At the edge of the hallway, Dennis paused. The darkness ahead beckoned him toward Heather's room, but a small thought made him glance back. Nick's form was barely visible in the dim light.

""Hey Nick,"" Dennis whispered.

""Yeah?""

""Nice to meet you.""

A soft chuckle came from the darkness. ""You too, Dennis.""",2,1736922445.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

1i1rdnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1i1rdnv/6_months_of_mouth_taping_gave_me_the_best_sleep/,6 months of mouth taping gave me the best sleep (and skin!) of my life - sharing my journey,"Been lurking in the mouth taping threads for a while and needed to share my experience because it's been life-changing.

I thought it sounded insane at first. My friend mentioned she started taping her mouth at night while reading ""Breath"" by James Nestor. I remember laughing and thinking she'd lost it. But then I kept noticing how genuinely energized she looked every time I saw her, while I was still dragging myself through each day feeling half-dead.

The change was immediate. That first morning, I actually felt rested. Like, actually rested. Not the ""five coffees to feel human"" kind of morning I was used to. The dry mouth was gone. No sore throat. My head felt clear.

Since then:

* I wake up feeling refreshed
* No more 3pm energy crashes
* Brain fog is gone
* My anxiety has improved so much
* Actually have energy after work

I'm about 6 months in, and I think I might be able to stop using the tape altogether. My body seems to have actually retrained itself to breathe through my nose while sleeping. It's like my body finally remembered how it's supposed to breathe.

For anyone interested - after trying a few different tapes (some were awful, either fell off or felt suffocating), I found one called SayLess Night Lips that's super breathable and stays on over skin care adn lip balm). Makes a huge difference when you're just starting out.

I know this all sounds dramatic, but when you've lived with terrible sleep for years and finally find something that works, it feels like magic.

TLDR: From skeptic to believer - mouth taping gave me actual, restful sleep for the first time in years.",3,1736922247.0,sleep,0,0.8,False

1i1ra9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1i1ra9n/financial_trajectory_plan/,Financial Trajectory Plan ,"I‚Äôd like some feedback on our situation, retirement security, my order of steps/plan (especially step 4 below). Thank you for your time everyone.

Live in Alberta. I‚Äôm 36 and my partner is 34, one child (1.5 y/o). Last year, I took a parental leave and my partner took one the year before. Unsure if we will have 1 more child.

**Income**

For 2025, I have two jobs. T4 govt job, est. 98k gross for 2025 with defined benefit pension (5 yr service - I could buy back 6 mo-1 year service likely). Another is self-employed, est. 25k pre-tax/after deductions). I will likely carry on with these two for the foreseeable future. Salary cap is 114k; annual 5% increase until I reach the cap (and we get COLA adjustments on current salary and the cap).

Partner self-employed - est. she will make 45k in 2025 after deductions/pre-tax.

Given the above, I'm estimating we will be just shy of 10k/mo (after all tax/cpp/ei contributions)

Physical Assets House - approx 550k value, 341k mortgage 4.34% fixed 5 year expires in 2027 2 vehicles - 3k and 15k value (very rough approximation)

**Financial Investments** 

My TFSA - 97k - with another 24k in room (approximated) - all equities, ETF - mostly XEQT, plus 10k [CASH.to](http://CASH.to) for emergency fund 

Partner TFSA - 38k, with prob high 50k left in room 

My RRSP - 19.5k - tons of room left despite DB pension

RESP - 8.6k (maxed for contribution match) 

RDSP (I‚Äôm approved 10 yr back and for next 5 years - DTC; RDSP started last yr) - i expect it‚Äôll be near 30k in a couple months with the match/catch-up 

My Savings/chequing accounts - 1600 

Partner's savings/chequing accts - 10k - another amount for emergency fund

**Debt** 

Just the Mortgage! I do have a line of credit available (variable 6.90% currently) - for emergencies, plan would be pay for an immediate emergency, while waiting for the time it would take to sell CASH and transfer out, then pay the line of credit off.

**Expenses/Budget**

All housing costs - 3300/mo

Groceries - 500-600/mo

Online shopping (includes some groceries,  toiletries, hygiene, etc stuff too - hard to break apart) - $235/mo

Daycare - 150 to 200/mo - could drastically increase in future

Other child costs - I'm still somewhat unsure, but I've been budgeting $125/mo

All vehicle costs - 615/mo - some of this we write off; and I'm budgeting into it $150/mo in repairs, but I hope it will be much less than that

Fitness - 160/mo

Entertainment - 31/mo

Alcohol - 20/mo

Phones - 95/mo for 3 phones ( 1 is business)

Wellness appts (portion/ones not covered by benefits) - 100/mo

Prescriptions/medical - 130/mo (not sure on this amount)

Eating out -big or small (e.g. includes coffees, etc) - 150/mo (used to be **alot** higher especially my partner; part of long-term relationships is some level of compromise)

Dogs - Might be nearing the last few years of their lives and they have some ongoing medical needs that we pay for; including that and dog food - 300/mo

Approx 6k/mo in expenses averaged out (good grief, btw)

**Plan**

Hoping we can save 3.5-4k/mo towards the these goals in this order:

1. Max TFSA contribution room over the next 2-3 years.
2. Save up more emergency fund amount outside TFSA; move TFSA CASH holdings into XEQT instead, to not lose the room
3. Beginning of every year max RESP (2500), RDSP (whatever the amount I‚Äôm told for grants catch-up), TFSA new room
4. Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck on where to focus. Options:

A. RRSP contributions and invest the refund, too.   

B. Pay down the mortgage.

*Considerations* \- 

*Will we end up having a higher income in retirement than we do now if I focus on our RRSP? Which to my understanding, ruins the tax advantage of RRSP.*

RDSP withdrawals (which begin at 60) are considered income just like RRSP, and their calculator suggested approx 17k annual payment/withdrawal (probably not adjusted for inflation? nominal value?) from age 60 to 85 for me. Combine that with my DB benefit income (probably replaces 50-70% income; LAPP calculator sucks btw), our CPP (won‚Äôt be nearly as high for my wife, but I would likely get near the full amount) and OAS amounts, and I‚Äôm thinking maybe RRSP contributions don‚Äôt make sense? I believe with DB and RRSP I can do income splitting in retirement (at 65, unless they change this by then lol) so that would help address this problem, would it not? 

Another factor is that while my mortgage interest is a significant cost, I do get to write off a portion of it through home office percentage of home, reducing it's impact.

Last factor would be that contributing to RRSP may help increase certain other govt benefits (e.g. child tax benefit, daycare subsidy)

5. If I do proceed with focusing on paying off the mortgage as step 4, once that‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs still the same question for my RRSP vs unregistered investments.

6. Invest in a flipping vacation

I‚Äôm aware lots of things can change, but one of the things I‚Äôve been trying to change in my life is having better long term financial planning.

How good of a long-term plan for retirement does this sound?
