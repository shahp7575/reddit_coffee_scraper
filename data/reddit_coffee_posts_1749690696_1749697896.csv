(Mainly surreal with comedy mixed in)","Just in the mood for good comedy but want something really surreal, weird or horror mixed in the podcast. Good worldbiilding and lore is a plus

Some podcasts kinda like this that I  like and may recommend are : 

- Hello From the Magic Tavern (My Favourite) : Arnie Niekamp fell through a dimensional portal behind a Burger King into the fantastical land of Foon. He's still getting a slight wifi signal, so he uploads a weekly podcast from the tavern the Vermilion Minotaur where he interviews wizards, monsters and adventurers. It's a major discovery!

- Last Podcast on The Left (Also My Favourite) : The Last Podcast on the Left covers all the horrors our world has to offer, both imagined and real. From demons and slashers to cults and serial killers, The Last Podcast is guaranteed to satisfy your bloodlust.

- Milk Man of St Gaffs : Lovecraft meets Kafka in this serialized fantasy/horror podcast about Howie, a troubled young man who joins the milkmen on the island of St. Gaff's, only to discover that the milkmen harbor a dark and dangerous secret. Be sure to start with episode one!

- Return Home : Return Home is a serialized comedy/horror story that follows Jonathan, Buddy, and Ami as they unravel the mysteries of Melancholy Falls. Isn't time for you to return home?

- Beef and Dairy Network : The number one podcast for those involved or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds.

- Desert Skies : On a lonely highway between life and the next life there's one last stop that we all have to make. Desert Skies Astral Plane Fuel and Service Station serves travelers as they embark on their journey through the celestial spheres. Meet the Attendant, the Mechanic, and C.A.S.H. Register. Together, they'll make sure you're prepared for the ride.

- Midnight Burger : When Gloria took a waitressing job at a diner outside of Phoenix, she didn't realize she was now an employee of Midnight Burger, a time-traveling, dimension-spanning diner. Every day Midnight Burger appears somewhere new in the cosmos along with it's staff: a galactic drifter, a rogue theoretical physicist, a sentient old-timey radio, and some guy named Caspar. No one knows who built Midnight Burger or how it works, but when it appears there's always someone around who could really use a cup of coffee.
At the nexus of all things, there is a diner. We open at 6.

- Gamma Radio : Madcap post-apocalyptic radio style comedy. With inspiration from video games, pop-culture and sci-fi. Warning: Heavily irradiated.

- Squad Car 22 : Back in the 90s two police officers were promoted from bicycle cops to real ones. With the help of their trusty tape recorder they started chronicling their time protecting and serving America. Ride along with Officer Steins and Holloway as they save the world from a Mad Scientist, a Squid-Pig, a Talking Campari Bottle, and Jewish Space Lasers.

- Nowhere, on Air : Semi-late night community radio broadcasts from a strange little town in the Crowsnest Pass, Alberta (aka, not just the middle of nowhere, but nowhere itself). Nothing ever happens here.

Certainly nothing weird. Why would you even suggest that? Listen close. Don't wander off. It's a long way to get where you're going. Especially out here.

I have a few side hustles I want to turn into a business ( art and beauty products). I haven't gotten around to making it a business yet but I want to. I also was thinking about pursuing visual communications at my local community college (I won't be paying out of pocket much at all if not any) for marketing and online writing work. I understand professional communications is geared more towards writing, but as a creative person I thought the VC would make more sense. I know that this type of job doesn't have a set salary and it soley depends on you and how you work. But then I look at other assocaties degrees that generlaly pay more such as dental hygene, nursing, tech etc. However, I hate the idea of it. I mean I don't HATE the idea, it just doesn't sound like something I would enjoy long term. I understand you need to make money to live, and believe me I know, I'm poverty level rn. For context I'm 18 and my family moved back in with my grandparents temporarily bc we couldn't get a home. I'm applying for jobs, but no one is responding lol. I have this desire to sell my paintings and beauty products. As well as writing. I would love to be a freelance writer, I just don't know where to start. I'm writing a children's book rn too.  Another thing is handling peoples marketing in regard to the look of their business building, profile online etc.  I just think of everything, and I want to open a coffee shop in the future whenever I'm somewhat financially ready.

I've currently taken Ozempic for about 4.5 months to prepare for my wedding next year.  For reference, I am a 32, 5'9, woman.

  I didn't have a lot of the side effects reported on this board.  After my first dosage, I did not feel the need to eat ANYTHING.  Like, I'd feel like buying food or ordering food and still do but when it is in front of me, I have zero desire to eat it.  

At best, I've been sustaining myself on an insane amount of seltzer, water, Diet Coke, and coffee, plus anything with electrolytes and a teaspoon of salt a day.  I also have bulk ordered mini Hershey bars and lollipops and have about 2-4 of the latter to keep my stomach from grumbling at work.  

However, I've gone from 179 pounds to 127 pounds in the last few months.  The last time I was in the 120s, I was literally in sixth grade.  

I get dizzy all the time, despite taking supplements, and have some really scary moments where I can't see for about half a minute if I get up too quickly.  At the same time, I no longer feel like my husband to be will be disappointed in me and I look better than I have in forever (I've gotten Juvederm long before I started Ozempic and I think that helped me from getting sagging skin).  

That said, I want to stop Ozempic but I'm worried that between me stress binge eating, which caused me to gain weight in the first place, plus my wedding still being next year, I will gain the weight back and then some.  

Has anyone gotten passed their goal weight and either stopped or found a way to get over the loss of appetite and stayed at a consistent weight while on it?  I want my husband to be to be happy and I want my parents to be happy at my wedding.  Personally, I'd also like to be happy, which I was in the second picture but now I feel I look too extreme but I don't know how to go back without having to redo this whole process again.  

Sorry if this was more of a ramble.  I just don't know what to do. ",1,1749697261.0,Ozempic,2,1.0,False
1l9bupq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l9bupq/i_cannot_sleep_normally_for_the_last_7_days/,I cannot sleep normally for the last 7 days,"Hi, I‚Äôm 21F and I‚Äôve never had issues with sleep before. This all started exactly a week ago. One night, I just couldn‚Äôt fall asleep at all. I lay in bed all night, totally unsure if I even drifted off or if I was awake the whole time. It felt like my brain was switched on the entire night and I couldn‚Äôt shut it off.  

On the fourth day, a friend took me to the gym in the evening. That night I finally slept normally after three bad nights. But the next night, the insomnia came back. For the past couple of days, my sleep has felt really weird. I don‚Äôt feel sleepy, and when I lie still for a long time, I ‚Äòmight‚Äô fall asleep but it doesn‚Äôt even feel like real sleep. My mind stays awake and I‚Äôm still aware of what I‚Äôm thinking or imagining. It‚Äôs not a dream, just conscious thoughts I can control. Then after 4‚Äì5 hours, my brain suddenly ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù on its own, and I struggle to fall back asleep.  

I started to feel emotionally low, foggy, exhausted, and my skin‚Äôs breaking out. My face also looks puffier and more aged than usual.  And I stopped drinking coffee after the first sleepless night (I usually just have one cup in the morning). I‚Äôm not under any stress, there‚Äôs been no major change in my diet or lifestyle. My period is due next week, but this has never happened around my cycle before. I‚Äôve always been healthy.  

The only possible factor I can think of is that I stopped going to the gym about two months ago due to work and exams. I also started fish oil supplements but have been taking them inconsistently.  

That‚Äôs all I can think of. If anyone has insight, I‚Äôd be so grateful this is starting to really affect my wellbeing.  ",1,1749697247.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I do heavily regret ever getting into psychology. I had hopes to get into the Master of Business Administration program at my university, but this semester I've accrued 4 thousand dollars for my tuition and I've maxed out my financial aid, and subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The financial aid office at my university told me that I'd have to take out a personal loan. I plan on taking out a credit card with 0% interest for 15 months, and putting in $500 a month to pay it all up before the 15 months are up. 

  
My GPA is incredibly mediocre. I used to have a 3.2, but it shot down to 3.0 because I had 3 hard classes (research methods, statistics, and a math course). So there's no hope that I can ever get scholarships based on that. I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to get an MBA and go into HR or project management. I feel stuck now, I know I can try to get a case manager position because a BA in Psychology is required. But what do I do now? I don't want to be stuck working retail positions forever, and I don't want to work in the psych world. I've a friend who got his BA in political science in 2014, and he worked with me at a coffee shop up until recently. He now does landscaping and I do it with him, but it's not stable at all as he's just now picking up his business. I feel lost and worthless.

We hadn‚Äôt spoken much since then until a few days ago. I got drunk at a party and texted her I didn‚Äôt say anything wild, just that I missed us and still had unresolved feelings and anger about what she did and that I wanted to get it off my chest. She responded, and eventually, I asked if she wanted to meet up and talk.

We were supposed to meet at a coffee shop, but due to time constraints, I invited her over to my apartment instead.

We had a long conversation, I expressed my frustrations about the past, and it felt cathartic. But emotions got high, and we ended up having sex. I‚Äôll be honest: that wasn‚Äôt my intention when I invited her over, but it happened.

The next morning, I realized I was still confused and, more importantly, that I still didn‚Äôt trust her. I texted her and said that unless we were both 100% ready to try again seriously, it wasn‚Äôt healthy to reconnect. I apologized for any mixed signals and told her I shouldn‚Äôt have said I missed her or invited her over if it would‚Äôve made her think I wanted to get back together.

She replied saying she thought the night meant we were getting back together, and that I played with her feelings. She was really upset and said I led her on.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I genuinely didn‚Äôt know she came into the night expecting to rekindle things. She never said that. If I had known, I wouldn‚Äôt have let things unfold like that. I thought we were just catching up and getting closure. I apologized sincerely, but I still feel guilty.

So AITA?

Just a door away, the conversation in that hospital corner continued.  
  
""Get ready. While Celia's still unconscious, go ahead and perform the hysterectomy!""  
  
Dr. Davis stood there, completely stunned.  
  
""You want to remove Mrs.Ravenscroft's uterus?!""  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, I have to remind you‚Äîyou don't have any children right now. If you really remove your wife's uterus, you'll never have an heir!""  
  
""I don't need an heir. Ashley gave birth to my child yesterday. I promised her I'd leave everything to our baby. Keeping Celia's uterus... it's a threat.""  
  
The doctor looked pained, speaking urgently,""But your child with Miss Green will still take someone else's name, call someone else daddy. Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really worth it? Besides, after seven miscarriages,Mrs.Ravenscroft's chances of getting pregnant again are already so low.""  
  
Dante lit a cigar, his voice tender yet bitter.  
  
""Worth it? There's no question about worth. I love Ashley, and I'll give her everything I have.""  
  
""But‚Äî""  
  
Dante's brow furrowed.  
  
""Enough! Just do what I fucking told you!""  
  
Just as Dante was about to get up, his phone rang. He accidentally hit speakerphone.  
  
""Dante, bro, got the money! Heh, call me for this kind of gig anytime. I've done it seven times now‚Äîgot it down to a science. And next time, I've got it all planned out. I'll pretend to be a kidnapper and go straight for the wife's belly‚Äî""  
  
""There won't be a next time. Take your money and get the hell out of the city!""  
  
Footsteps echoed from inside.  
  
I stumbled back to my room, barely making it before Dante walked in.  
  
""Celia, when did you wake up?""  
  
I was drenched in sweat, my body trembling as I tried to stay calm.  
  
""Just now... I noticed you weren't here, so I was about to go look for you.""  
  
Dante's gaze fixed on me, studying, suspicious.  
  
My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. Just when I thought he'd figured it out, he picked me up and placed me back on the bed.  
  
""How can you be so careless with yourself? We've already lost the baby‚ÄîI can't lose you too.""  
  
The fucking nerve of him to even mention it.  
  
Thinking about my babies‚Äîthe ones he'd deliberately killed‚ÄîI clutched my chest as tears threatened to overflow.  
  
All those car accidents, robberies, falls... none of it was coincidence.  
  
It was my husband. For his mistress. Again and again, he'd tried to kill me.  
  
""The doctor said your uterus wasn't properly cleaned out. You need another surgery.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia. We'll have a beautiful baby someday‚Äîwith your eyes and my nose and mouth. When that happens, we'll love him twice as much, make up for everything we've lost.""  
  
Dante handed me a glass of milk. As he turned slightly, I caught him slipping something into it.  
  
He held me close, whispering sweet comfort, his eyes full of what looked like genuine concern.  
  
But I knew better. This was all just another lie to keep me quiet.  
  
""Do I... do I have to drink this? Can't I skip it?""  
  
Dante, you've killed seven of my children. Now you want to take away my last chance to be a mother too?  
  
Without hesitation, he stroked my hair with that indulgent smile,  
  
""Come on, you're a grown woman acting like a little kid. If you don't have the surgery, how will your body heal? You want me to be heartbroken?""  
  
""Here, let me help you.""  
  
He brought the milk to my lips, giving me no choice but to drink.  
  
I squeezed my eyes shut. It felt like I was swallowing razor blades instead of milk.  
  
My consciousness began to fade. Through the haze, I saw that corrupt doctor walking in.  
  
""Start the surgery now. And also...""  
  
Dante's voice hesitated for a few seconds.  
  
""Find a way to use the anesthesia to paralyze her legs.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, is this really necessary? Isn't this a bit... extreme?""  
  
""Just do what I fucking said!""  
  
I knew Dante was always cautious and paranoid, but I never imagined that just seeing me wake up early would make him this ruthless.  
  
My children, my chance at motherhood, and now even my ability to stand‚Äîhe wanted to take it all away.  
  
Dante, is this how you're going to destroy me completely?  
  
I screamed in despair, struggling to sit up, but I was sinking deeper into unconsciousness.  
  
As the anesthesia began to wear off, I heard the doctor's voice through the haze,  
  
""Mr. Ravenscroft, Mrs. Ravenscroft's uterus has been removed. And... she'll never walk again.""  
  
Dante sounded absolutely delighted""Good! Excellent!""  
  
When I finally came to, his tears were falling on my hands‚Äîsuch convincing, heartbroken performance.  
  
""Celia, the doctor says your uterus was infected... you'll never be able to have children in the rest of your live.""  
  
I ignored him, frantically trying to move my legs.  
  
But there was nothing... no feeling at all.  
  
I broke down completely, sobbing as I demanded,""Dante, what the hell did you do to my legs?""  
  
Tears streamed down his face as he choked up, barely able to speak.  
  
""There was a complication with the anesthesia... you're paralyzed from the waist down.""  
  
""Don't be scared, Celia... no matter what happens to you, I'll never leave you, I'll always love you.""  
  
I never knew Dante was such a damn good actor.  
  
He dismissed the nurses and took care of everything himself‚Äîfeeding me soup, cleaning my body, even dealing with the postpartum bleeding.  
  
He worked tirelessly until evening, then kissed my forehead tenderly.  
  
""Celia, you've suffered so much carrying our babies. I promise I'll make it up to you.""  
  
I looked at his exhausted face and coldly turned away.  
  
""If you're tired, get some sleep.""  
  
""Alright, I'll stay right here. Just call me if you need anything.""  
  
Once he fell asleep, I grabbed his other phone.  
  
I'd always known Dante had a second phone‚Äîhis work phone‚Äîbut I'd never bothered checking it.  
  
It unlocked on the first try.  
  
The password was Ashley Green's birthday.  
  
The moment the screen lit up, I was staring at a wedding photo of him and Ashley.  
  
A fucking wedding photo...  
  
He'd actually taken wedding photos with Ashley. The sight of that white dress made my eyes hurt.  
  
With trembling fingers, I opened his messages. Dante called her ""baby""...  
  
Pages and pages of chat history. The more I read, the more horrified I became.  
  
Every single business trip he'd taken was just an excuse to be with Ashley.  
  
I'd gotten upset so many times because he never came with me to doctor appointments.  
  
How many times had doctors asked about the baby's father, and I'd just smile awkwardly and say he was in business.  
  
He'd always take forever to reply,  
  
""I'm working to earn money for our baby. Besides, checkups aren't a big deal. I can't really help anyway, and it would just waste time. You can handle it yourself,all right?""  
  
But he went to every single one of Ashley's prenatal appointments. No matter how busy he was, he never missed one.  
  
He said he couldn't wait for their baby to be born, that she and their child were the most precious things in his world.  
  
As I kept reading, my heart felt like it was being ripped apart.  
  
Every time I got pregnant, they'd discuss how to kill my baby.  
  
Even that car accident when I was pregnant a year ago‚ÄîAshley hit me herself.  
  
She said she wanted to experience the thrill of hitting someone, and Dante was all for it.  
  
His only concern was""Just don't hit too hard.""  
  
They talked about hurting me, about killing my children, as casually as discussing the weather.  
  
My nails dug so deep into my palms that blood dripped onto the sheets.  
  
I opened the photo album‚Äîthousands of pictures, all featuring Ashley. Selfies, candid shots, the two of them waking up together, taking walks, going home, Dante lovingly preparing nutritious meals for her pregnancy...  
  
There were 99+ videos too. I clicked on them and felt like someone had dumped ice water over me.  
  
Countless videos of them naked, intertwined, sexed,like they were documenting every intimate moment.  
  
There was even cosplay shit‚ÄîDante in a maid outfit, kneeling on the floor...  
  
I pressed my hand to my stomach, too nauseous to speak.  
  
Besides those videos, there were six more labeled ""First,"" ""Second,"" all the way up to ""Sixth.""  
  
Realizing what they were, my blood ran cold and I tasted copper in my throat.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I bit my lip hard and clicked on the sixth video.  
  
Dante and Ashley were chatting and laughing together.  
  
Right in front of them was...  
  
That blade might as well have been cutting into my own flesh. My heart felt like it was being sliced into a thousand pieces, and my stomach began cramping violently.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore‚ÄîI leaned over the bed and dry heaved uncontrollably.  
  
I didn't sleep all night, tears soaking through my hospital gown.  
  
The next morning, Dante brought me breakfast as usual‚Äîa thoughtful spread he'd personally picked out.  
  
Such variety: coffee,hamburger, bread, sandwich...  
  
I used to think this was his way of spoiling me. Now I realized it was just thoughtless, half-hearted bullshit.  
  
Remembering last night's videos, I started dry heaving again.  
  
Seeing my distress, Dante looked genuinely concerned,""Still feeling sick? Fuck, this is all my fault. I hate seeing you suffer like this.""  
  
""It's nothing. I want to go home.""  
  
Dante's expression froze for just a moment.  
  
""You just had another miscarriage... Mom's not too satisfied about it. If you go back now, you'll just walk right into her rage. Maybe wait a bit longer? Save yourself the grief.""  
  
I didn't respond, but from his expression, I could guess what was really going on.  
  
That afternoon, while he was out, I packed my things and wheeled myself home.  
  
The moment I entered the house, I saw Ashley sitting in Dante's lap while they both played with a baby.  
  
Dante's mom,Sophia came out of the kitchen carrying a bowl of chicken soup, personally feeding Ashley spoonful by spoonful.  
  
The three of them were laughing together like the perfect family.  
  
When she saw me come in, Sophia's eyes turned razor-sharp.  
  
""You cursed bitchHow dare you show your face here! We promised you everything, and how do you repay us? Someone as unlucky as you should've just died out there!""  
  
""You knew damn well you were pregnant, but you kept running around like a maniac. How many of our babies have you destroyed? Why the hell didn't that fall just kill you, you worthless piece of trash!""  
  
""I'm telling you right now‚Äîfrom today on, Ashley is my only daughter-in-law!Get the fuck out of my house!""  
  
Ashley followed Sophia's gaze and looked over at me, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction,  
  
""Mom, don't say things like that. What if she gets jealous and starts spreading rumors about me seducing Dante?""  
  
""Let's see if she dares!""  
  
I knew Sophia had never liked me. She thought I was too strong-willed, too hard to control, that I'd walk all over Dante after marriage.  
  
But Ashley was beautiful and sweet-talking, always putting Sophia and Dante at the center of everything. So Sophia had always wanted Ashley as Mrs.Ravenscroft.  
  
It was only after Ashley married some rich guy and I willingly gave up my career to focus on family that Sophia reluctantly accepted me.  
  
After years of not giving the family an heir, her dissatisfaction with me had reached its peak.  
  
Now that Ashley was back and had given Dante a son, Sophia felt free to unleash all her pent-up resentment on me.  
  
But she had no idea that all seven of my miscarriages were personally orchestrated by her precious son!  
  
Every single one of her grandsons had been killed by Ashley‚Äîthe daughter-in-law she treasured so much.  
  
In the past, Dante would try to mediate. But now, holding the child Ashley had given him, he acted like he couldn't hear any of it.  
  
Ashley snuggled into his arms, her voice deliberately pouty,  
  
""Dante, baby,you're paying so much attention to our son that I'm feeling left out. If you keep this up, I'm going to get upset.""  
  
Dante affectionately pinched her cheek, his eyes full of tenderness.  
  
""I know you get jealous easily. Look what I have for you.""  
  
I followed Ashley's gaze and saw the words ""Share Transfer Agreement"" blazing before my eyes.  
  
""Oh wow! Dante, you're so good to me!""  
  
She kissed him on the corner of his mouth, her eyes smugly meeting mine.  
  
I gave her a cold smile in return.  
  
Enjoy it while you can.  
  
It won't be long before you and your precious Dante are crying and begging me to come back...

#### The Digital Nomad Visa: A Modern Passport to Freedom

What is a Digital Nomad Visa? It‚Äôs the golden ticket for the laptop-wielding wanderer. A government-issued permission slip that says, ‚ÄúYes, you can work here. No, you don‚Äôt have to sneak around.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just a visa. It‚Äôs a revolution in how‚Äîand where‚Äîyou live.

Why the World Suddenly Cares. The pandemic cracked open the old office paradigm. Now, countries are fighting to attract remote workers. Sun, surf, and Wi-Fi? Yes, please. The digital nomad visa is the hottest passport stamp since the invention of the gap year.

*üåé Curious about your nomad income ceiling? [Find out instantly‚Äîclick here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Clock Starts: Application Submission

The First Click: Gathering Your Documents. The journey begins with a scavenger hunt. Passport? Check. Proof of income? Check. Health insurance, background check, and sometimes, a photo that doesn‚Äôt look like a mugshot. Every country has its own shopping list.

The Submission Abyss: Where Does Your Application Go? You upload. You email. You mail. Your paperwork vanishes into the bureaucratic ether. Sometimes you get a tracking number. Sometimes just a prayer. The clock ticks, but whose clock is it?

*üïí Wondering if your skills can fund your travels? [Test your digital nomad income in 90 seconds‚Äîfree tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Waiting Game: Official Processing Times

Average Processing Windows by Country. Some countries move at warp speed‚Äîthink two weeks. Others? You‚Äôll measure the wait in seasons. The range: 10 days to six months. It‚Äôs a lottery, and the jackpot is time.

Fast-Track Options: Myth or Reality? Some nations whisper about ‚Äúexpedited processing.‚Äù Sometimes it‚Äôs real. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a mirage‚Äîan extra fee for the privilege of waiting in a slightly shorter line.

#### Bureaucratic Black Holes: What Slows You Down?

Government Backlogs and Holidays. Your application might land during a national holiday. Or in a pile on a clerk‚Äôs desk. Bureaucracy is a beast that naps often and moves slowly. Expect the unexpected.

Missing Documents: The Silent Killer. One typo. One missing page. Your application stalls, and no one tells you. Weeks evaporate while your file gathers digital dust. Double-check everything, then check again.

*üåê Want to know if your digital skills pay the bills? [Get your nomad income diagnosis‚Äîfast, free, no fluff!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Human Factor: How Your Profile Impacts Speed

Background Checks and Red Flags. Got a common name? Lived in five countries? Prepare for extra scrutiny. The more complex your backstory, the longer the background check.

Financial Proofs: Show Me the Money. Some countries want to see a steady income. Others want a fat bank account. If your finances are complicated, expect questions. And delays.

#### Country Showdown: Visa Timelines Compared

Europe‚Äôs Speed Demons vs. Island Time. Estonia and Portugal are the sprinters. The Caribbean? Sometimes they‚Äôre still sipping their morning coffee when your application arrives.

Asia‚Äôs Paper Trails and Surprises. Thailand, Indonesia‚Äîexpect paperwork. Lots of it. But sometimes, a well-prepared file gets you through the labyrinth faster than you‚Äôd think.

#### The Secret Sauce: How to Accelerate Your Approval

Pro Tips for Lightning-Fast Processing. Submit everything in one go. Use official translations. Triple-check your scans. Attach a cover letter that makes you look irresistible.

The Power of Professional Help. Visa agents aren‚Äôt just for the lazy. They know the system. They know the loopholes. Sometimes, they know the guy who stamps the approvals.

#### Real-World Stories: The Good, the Bad, the Delayed

Tales of 48-Hour Miracles. Some nomads get approved before their coffee gets cold. Right paperwork, right timing, right country. It happens. Rare, but real.

Nightmares That Dragged for Months. Others wait. And wait. Lost documents, silent embassies, Kafkaesque email chains. The process can break the strongest spirits.

#### The Hidden Costs of Waiting

Lost Time, Lost Money. Every day you wait is a day you‚Äôre not earning, not exploring, not living the dream. The opportunity cost is real. Don‚Äôt let it sneak up on you.

Emotional Toll: Stress, Uncertainty, and FOMO. The waiting eats at you. Plans on hold. Tickets unbooked. The world keeps spinning, but you‚Äôre stuck in limbo.

#### What Happens After Approval?

The Welcome Letter: Next Steps. You get the email. Or the letter. Instructions follow. Sometimes you have 30 days to enter, sometimes 90. Read the fine print. Act fast.

Entry Deadlines and Activation Windows. Miss your window, and you‚Äôre back to square one. Some countries are strict. No exceptions. The clock is always ticking.

#### If You‚Äôre Denied: Next Moves

Appealing the Decision. Some countries let you appeal. Most don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre rejected, the process is opaque. Try again, or try elsewhere.

Alternative Destinations or Visas. The world is wide. If one door slams shut, another opens. Sometimes a tourist visa or a business visa fills the gap.

#### The Future of Digital Nomad Visas

Tech Innovations in Application Processing. AI is creeping into the system. Automated checks, instant scans. The future could be frictionless. Or just faster red tape.

Predictions: Will It Get Faster? Governments are catching on. Competition is fierce. Expect streamlined processes, but don‚Äôt bet your ticket on it‚Äîyet.

#### Conclusion: The Race Against Bureaucracy

Is It Worth the Wait? For most, yes. The freedom, the adventure, the life less ordinary. But only if you‚Äôre ready to play the game‚Äîand beat the clock.

Your Next Step. Don‚Äôt just dream it. Plan it. Prepare. And, above all, act. The world‚Äôs waiting. Are you?",1,1749696091.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

FYI I grind actually on Timemore C3 esp on setting 2.25 which is below the manufacturer standard to achieve the grind size I'm looking for. The only issue is that I take 20 minutes to grind 6 gr. I'm looking to buy the Kinu M47 to achieve the same result but in less time.

And each of them trigger me so much in different ways! I feel like they deliberately try to drag me down into unhealthy habits.

The biggest culprit is my granny... a 5 foot nothing 70 year old, with diabetes. All she does is drink half a case of diet coke, smoke a 1.5 packs of ciggs, and look up ""Keto"" and sugar free recipes on her chromebook all day long!! All she every talks about is food! Showing me things! Saying how much she misses eating out.. and constantly asks what im making/cooking/eating and asks for a taste, she breaks her diet constantly by going out on ""shopping runs"" without planing lunch so she has an excuse to eat take out, then comes home with the leftovers and forces me to try it!! 
No matter what kind of diet I'm on or what boundaries I set she always inserts herself in the middle. 

And when I cook anything for dinner, it's either ""too healthy"", or she says we've had it too often and she's sick of it!! I can't do anything. 

When I try to make my lunch or breakfast she always buts in asking to try it! Or what im making! And if it's healthy, she'll literally audibly say ""yuck gross"" about it for no reason.
If my grandfather sees me cooking healthy, he'll also fake gag and laugh.

My family has big leftover culture too so I always make bigg suppers... but whenever me or my mom, take a portion that's ""little"" we'll always get a comment on us telling us to eat more. My grandmother has actually said, ""Oh well that's not enough you've barely had anything!"", even after I've eaten 3 slices of pizza. 
Not to mention always wanting us to try it with dip!! It ruins my eating experience being told the portion and  condiments I need to use, ON FOOD I MADE!!

And then after dinner, if there's something left they always say.. ""Oh, well its only a little salad with dressing! Just finish it! There's no point wrapping it up!"" 

And I'm just like WHAT TF in my head! I was full to begin with!! I'm trying to break my 'finish the plate mentality'! 



And my mom's bad too! She's on disability and doesn't work, all she does is watch anime, and bitch about shit, and about how she's gaining weight and looks so fat... (She looked like a model when I was a kid... and I've weighed more tgen her since I was 9). 
Meanwhile... the only two foods she fuckin eats are Ramen and nachos... barely any water and only coffee and tea... and stays up half the night smoking pot and snacking!





My grandmother gets offended when I don't want to watch TV for 3hours a night from 8pm-11pm. She mocks me when I say I'm going to bed early! 




How do I get better! How! It feels impossible! I'm always triggered, I feel like I have no privacy! And I eat in secret. I've been to two nutritionists in my teens! I just don't know what to do! 

I lost 40 pounds at 14... and gained 100 back in the past 5 years idk what to do. I need help. And I really feel like everyone just wants me to stay broken!",1,1749695797.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

1l9b0vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1l9b0vk/starting_a_referral_resume_support_discord_for/,Starting a referral + resume support Discord for Berkeley students (f*ck cold LinkedIn DMs),"We all know the job market is kinda ass right now, especially for new grads. Been there, done that... it‚Äôs rough. As someone who‚Äôs been through that cycle of hell, I wanted to try building something to make it suck a little less for fellow Bears.

So I‚Äôm building something for us: a **Berkeley-only Discord** that‚Äôs more than just chat. It‚Äôs a focused **pipeline** for resume help and job referrals... no coffee chat, no fluff, no corporate vibes, just Bears helping Bears.

# The Goal

Build a no-BS space where:

* Students get resume help from people who actually know what hiring managers/recruiters want (Roast Your Resume, Get brutally honest feedback about your resume)
* Alumni refer students when they‚Äôre ready
* Everyone feels comfortable and chill asking for help and offering help

# The Roadmap

**Stage 1: Core Alumni Team**  
Right now I‚Äôm gathering a small group of grads who:

* Are working (or recently hired) and down to help
* Can review resumes and submit referrals right after
* Have 1‚Äì2 hours a week max to give back

Not looking for career coaches. Just regular folks who remember the struggle and want to help someone else through it.

**Stage 2: Early Access for Students & New Grads**  
Once we have a decent core, I‚Äôll invite a small batch of Berkeley students/recent grads to test the system. You‚Äôll:

* Submit your resume
* Get it reviewed by someone who's been in your shoes
* Get referred when your resume‚Äôs in good shape

This is **not** a spammy job board. It‚Äôs 1-on-1 discord help.

**Stage 3: Structured Roles + Submission System**  
We‚Äôll build out some simple structure:

* Resume Reviewers (alumni volunteers)
* Referral Leads (people who actually submit referrals internally or submit directly to recruiters, not just a social job link)
* Submission queue with deadlines (e.g., 72-hour review turnaround)

**Why This Matters**

There are so many alumni who *would* help if someone just asked... but most students never do. They don‚Äôt know how, or it feels awkward. This fixes that. It‚Äôs all about making help **easy to ask for** and **easy to give**. No weird LinkedIn DM, no waiting three weeks for someone to ‚Äúcircle back.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî **f\*ck cold LinkedIn DMs and coffee chats.**

No one wants to hop on a ‚Äúquick 15-minute coffee chat‚Äù after a full day of work or meeting just to talk in circles and pretend we‚Äôre networking. Both alumni and students are tired. This is for people who want to cut the fluff and actually help each other get jobs ‚Äî fast.

Everyone in the server will be [**berkeley.edu**](http://berkeley.edu) **verified**. No randos. Just a chill, focused space where Berkeley students and grads can connect, review resumes fast, drop referrals fast, and move on with their lives.

And yeah, it‚Äôs 100% free. The only rule? If you get a job (through this thing or not), you have to come back and help the next Bear. Review a resume. Drop a referral. Keep the cycle going. No excuses. No freeloaders. Just a low-key referral cult built on good karma and getting sh\*t done.

Not sure yet which industries we'll focus on... honestly just seeing who shows up first. Could start with tech, but if we get folks from consulting, finance, biotech, etc., we‚Äôll adapt. Totally depends on the mix of grads who want to help.

# Interested?

# Alum: If you‚Äôre down to review a few resumes and keep refer someone now and then, drop a comment or DM me. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a big time commitment.

Students/New Grads: If this sounds like something you‚Äôd join once it‚Äôs live, plese upvote this post... I‚Äôll slowly roll out invites once we‚Äôre ready and have enough folks who can help.

P.S. We're the same people who started the Free Food@Berkeley Discord in 2022, which turned out to be pretty successful... That was fun, now we‚Äôre just looking to build something new that‚Äôs actually useful. Hope you'll be part of it. Thanks for reading all this",22,1749694683.0,berkeley,8,0.96,False

She‚Äôs always been a strong student. She loves learning, gets excited about school, all that. She was in honors classes at our local public high school and was thriving. My wife and I have always supported the school. We‚Äôve donated, volunteered, and showed up for all the events. We‚Äôre in a good place financially, so we try to give back.

Then last year, the school announced they were eliminating all honors classes ‚Äúto promote equity.‚Äù I understand the idea, but in practice, it meant kids like Emily had nothing pushing them anymore. She started getting frustrated, bored, and honestly, kind of disheartened. We talked to the school about it, but their stance was firm.

I was venting to some of the other dads (parents of Emily‚Äôs closest friends) and it turned out we were all feeling the same way. Our daughters were all in honors, and none of them were happy. So a few of us got together one night to talk through options. We didn‚Äôt make any decisions on the spot, but we started researching nearby private schools that still offer honors and AP programs.

Eventually, all five of us ended up transferring our daughters to the same private school. We didn‚Äôt do it as a group protest or anything. We just all came to the same conclusion: our daughters deserved to be in an environment where they were actually learning and being challenged. Emily‚Äôs been so much happier and more engaged since the switch.

Well it turns out we accidentally caused a mess.

The public school started freaking out once they realized who had left. The five of us were apparently the biggest donors to the school/PTA. Suddenly we were getting emails, phone calls, and even a couple of ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù coffee invites from administrators. They were upset, saying we‚Äôd ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù the school, that we were hurting the community, that we‚Äôd ‚Äúmade a statement against equity.‚Äù One board member told me we were sending a message that ‚Äúsmart kids deserve more,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt what any of us were trying to say.

But to me, this wasn‚Äôt about politics or making a point. This was about Emily. She was unhappy and unchallenged, and we had the means to put her in a better situation. I still believe in public schools, but I couldn‚Äôt justify keeping her in a place that wasn‚Äôt working for her just because of optics.",132,1749694345.0,AmItheAsshole,129,0.87,False
1l9aw1q,https://i.redd.it/tfvsjyf1ne6f1.jpeg,"My Little Secret: How I Finally Got That ""Look"" Without Breaking the Bank (Featuring a Cartier Clone Watch Discovery!)","Hey everyone,

Ever had that moment? You know, scrolling through Instagram, seeing someone's perfectly curated wrist shot with a watch that just *screams* elegance, and then you zoom in, recognize the brand, and your heart sinks a little because you know it costs more than your car? Yeah, that's been me. Many times.

My particular obsession was the Cartier Baignoire. There's just something about its unique, graceful curves and the way it sits so delicately on the wrist. It‚Äôs timeless, sophisticated, and frankly, aspirational. But with rent, bills, and, you know, life, a five-figure watch wasn't exactly in the cards. For a long time, I just admired from afar, sighing about ""someday.""

Then, a few months ago, I was chatting with a friend at a coffee shop. She's always impeccably dressed, subtle luxury, never over-the-top. And there it was ‚Äì a Baignoire on her wrist. My eyes widened. ""No way,"" I blurted out. ""Did you finally pull the trigger?!""

She just smiled, took a sip of her latte, and leaned in. ""Kind of,"" she whispered. ""It's one of those really good [Cartier clone watches](https://cartierwatchdupe.com/collections/cartier-baignoire-watch-dupe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cartier-clone-watches).""

My jaw almost hit the table. I'd heard whispers about ""dupes"" and ""replicas,"" but always imagined them to be flimsy, obvious fakes. She passed it over, and I was genuinely shocked. The weight, the polished finish, the intricate dial ‚Äì it felt *real*. It had that same delicate charm, the mini size, the subtle glint of what looked like rose gold. I couldn't tell the difference.

She explained that not all alternatives are created equal. There's a whole world of quality out there if you know where to look. We're talking about pieces crafted with meticulous attention to detail, available in various gold tones (white, rose, yellow) and even with options for delicate diamond-set cases, mimicking the original's exquisite design. These aren't just cheap knock-offs; they're genuinely impressive homages to classic design.

It was a total game-changer for me. Suddenly, that ""someday"" feeling turned into ""maybe today."" It‚Äôs not about tricking anyone; it's about appreciating design and finding smart ways to incorporate that aesthetic into your everyday life without financial stress. It‚Äôs about being able to try out a style you love, to enjoy the feeling of that elegant timepiece on your wrist, without the guilt.

After her recommendation, I did my own deep dive. And honestly, I was blown away by what I found. If you're like me, someone who appreciates the artistry of these watches but needs a more accessible option, you seriously have to check out what's available. I found an amazing collection that truly captures the Baignoire's spirit.

If you've been dreaming of that iconic look, but the price has held you back, do yourself a favor and take a peek. You might be as surprised as I was. Here's where I found them: [Cartier Baignoire Watch Dupes](https://cartierwatchdupe.com/collections/cartier-baignoire-watch-dupe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cartier-clone-watches).

1l9av2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1l9av2m/how_do_you_confront_homophobia_when_youre_closeted/,How do you confront homophobia when you're closeted,"I've been working at a coffee shop for the last month. As it's Pride, our manager bought us a batch of pride lanyards to attach to our till cards and left them in the staff room. I thought about taking one but decided against it and stuck with the lanyard I already had.

Anyway, while working on the shop floor during closing shift, I borrowed my female colleague's till card to serve a customer. She had a pride lanyard. After serving the customer, I wrapped it around my neck. 

My male colleague asked why I was wearing it. I said because I'm keeping it safe until my female colleague returns from her break. He then said ""Is it yours?"" 

Me: ""No. It's hers, I can't find mine""

Him: ""Please tell me you're not one of them"".
Me: ""...No"". 
Him: ""Thank God, it's not good to be like that"".

He started to laugh and slapped my back. Now this all seems like a minor situation but I felt uncomfortable and felt like a coward. I wanted to call him out on his homophobia but at the same time I didn't want to say that I'm gay because it didn't feel safe coming out in that moment. Why did he feel so triggered by a lanyard of all things? 

I've had several situations like that throughout years from family, co-workers and strangers. There was one time I was coming out of an underground gay bar and a group of teenage boys were laughing and pointing at me.

I'm conflicted because I want to confront them but still want to stay inside the closet. The thing is I'm not ashamed to be gay but I don't feel confident because I feel like I'll make the situation worse.

TL;DR:¬†The [Laughland](https://amzndp.org/B06X7Z) kit¬†was by far the best one I have ever used.. Teeth are noticeably whiter, zero sensitivity, and just an overall superior experience.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the top two I tried:

**1.**¬†[**Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit**](https://amzndp.org/B06X7Z)¬†**‚Äì Best Overall (and what I use everyday now)**

If you‚Äôre gonna try one, I¬†*strongly*¬†recommend Laughland. I‚Äôve got super sensitive teeth, and this is literally the only kit that didn‚Äôt make them feel like they were being electrocuted.

The results tho were crazy. My teeth were 9 shades whiter in under 2 weeks.. they actually send you one of those shade guides so you can track and measure the difference.

A few things that stood out-

* Absolutely zero pain or sensitivity at all (important for me)
* The gel feels stronger and more effective than others
* The light is a bit more powerful and plugs right into your phone
* Their site is running an insane promo right now (I think 40% off?)

They only sell it on their¬†[website](https://amzndp.org/B06X7Z)¬†(not on Amazon), but IMO it‚Äôs worth getting directly from them. Plus they will give you your money back if you don‚Äôt see get 7 shades whiter in a week which is wild, so you have nothing to lose if you want to try it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2.¬†[Auraglow Teeth Whitening Kit](https://amzndp.org/B00YI5VJW6)¬†‚Äì Runner-Up (Amazon option)

[Auraglow](https://amzndp.org/B00YI5VJW6)¬†is another good choice.. definitely effective, and it comes with everything you need. I noticed some whitening with this one too, and the gel was strong but not too harsh.

It uses a UV light similar to Laughland‚Äôs and also plugs into your phone which is convenient. If you prefer ordering from Amazon, this is a good alternative. but if I‚Äôm being honest, [Laughland](https://amzndp.org/B06X7Z) gave me better results and felt more premium overall.

Hope this helps if you‚Äôve been curious about trying at home whitening kits. Feel free to ask anything.. happy to share more details if you‚Äôre deciding between the two!

My teeth are also yellowing out of nowhere. I dont smoke, drink coffee, and brush my teeth twice a day, sometimes three. I also use whitening products. 

  
Have you guys ever had similar issues? Not sure what's going on. I'm reading periodontal disease can do this, but my dentist said my gums look fun. Autoimmune?

1l9at8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1l9at8p/ocean_blue_and_sand/,Ocean Blue and Sand,"Alright, we just got back and here are some observations: 

1. The ‚Äúsales‚Äù talk is intense. We got it on the second day, we woke up late and skipped breakfast, we were getting calls in our room/s (we traveled with friends and had booked 2 rooms in total), we walked to the buffet building and our ‚Äúbutler‚Äù was waiting and waving at us to come in, immediately gave us the speech of a ‚Äúquick offer and a gift for us‚Äù. We said we didnt eat yet, he said thats fine, called one of the staff, joined us for lunch and she started asking questions (how we travel, where we go, etc). After that and when she had all her initial answers she called a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù and he gave us the same speech and ‚Äúthe offer‚Äù. It took about 3hrs in total. It was draining. I read the reviews online after and am glad that we declined the offer as enticing as it was. 

2. The food. You get the usual buffet, there are 2, a smaller one by the beach and a bigger one in the middle of the resort. Then you get a steak house (best meal of our stay), japanese hibachi both of these you have to reserve at 730 in the morning for. It gets booked pretty fast and then a cafe, mexican, italian and a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù one which we didnt go into. Cafe is open all day, they have cookies, some pastries and decent coffee. Ice cream stall near the hotel convenience stores. Aside from the steak house we liked the buffet food, you get the usual stations, grill, pasta, omelette in the morning. 

3. Gym, is small but not bad, it had decent equipments. 

4. Pool, big enough, bar in the middle. 2 sides. One is for ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù members only. 

5. Beach, they could do a better job cleaning up seaweed. 

6. Entertainment, there‚Äôs one each night mostly in the middle and the hotel ‚Äúlobby‚Äù which is pretty big. Some nights they had karaoke, some nights there were shows on stage across the lobby. 

7. Staff are all friendly and attentive. Some struggle a little more with English but enough to get by and understand what you are asking/ telling them. 

8. Resort has mad feral cats that come out of nowhere, friendly enough but of course you still gotta be careful with interacting w them. There was also a lone flamingo, at first we found it cute but when we realized it was just there alone, it got sad quick. 

9. We did two excursions, both of which we booked outside through get your guide and enjoyed both thoroughly.

I am now medicated and even though it‚Äôs only been a few days - I am shocked. Appalled. A little heartbroken honestly that I have spent my entire life struggling. 

I have had a terrible case of perfectionism for as long as I can remember. I feel like that is partly why it took me until 25 to get diagnosed. 

Here‚Äôs an example of how my days would look before medication: 

Goodmorning. I should brush my teeth - but wait if I‚Äôm going to brush my teeth, I should have my coffee first. But I really drink coffee all day long so I should brush them now. No - I should wait. 

Gets up, goes to make coffee‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt sit down and enjoy my coffee until the dishes are done so let me do that real quick. Now my shirt is wet and I‚Äôm overstimulated so I‚Äôll change that. Sit down with my coffee (now cold) and kick myself for not reading my Bible or taking my dog on a walk to the park. 

I WFH, so I go to sit down at my computer - but my house isn‚Äôt perfectly clean. I get up, start laundry, make the bed, go sit back down to work, come up with a million reasons to not work, rewrite an email 4 times just to delete it..

Anyway - you get the point. 

I can brush my teeth without my brain telling me I‚Äôm doing it wrong, or that if I can‚Äôt waterpick, floss, tongue scrape, brush, etc. at specific times of the day, I might as well not do it at all. Now, I just do it. Without thinking. 

I am not actively picking apart every meal and snack and hyperfixating on the right amount of protein or carbs. I just make healthy food choices. I don‚Äôt have to think about it. The 24/7 stress about food is gone. I still eat and enjoy food, but I am not chasing a dopamine hit from it. 

Today was the first day in a very long time that I feel like I earned my salary pay at my job. It‚Äôs the first day that I actually felt accomplished in the amount of work I completed. 

It‚Äôs 9:02 PM and my screen time is less than half of what it was averaging. 

I know the meds are leveling out - but I don‚Äôt feel a sense of euphoria or overwhelm. I feel calm. Collected. Not anxious. Not overly happy, but not sad. 

My life is changed and I am grateful.

Or just make a coffee?Then heaving too is a skill you need to learn on every sailing boat  
  
An old seadog taught me how to hove too when we were on a blow on a trailer yacht and the outboard came loose, we hove to, the boat stopped instantly and stopped moving - it was like they turned the wind off

Ever since that time 20 years a go I've owned a few yachts, and I practice heaving too, here are some hints I can share

1 - Practice in different conditions - 10-15 knots - 20-25 Knots as the boat behaves differntly  
 \- To Heave too tighten the Jib in 100%, then to a tack with the boom in the midway (like you were reaching)  
 \- Slow the boat down while tacking, no more then 2 knots  
\- Boat may keep sailing at the speed you tack at so keep it a slow tack  
\- Mainsheet traveler in the middle locked for safety  
\- Leave Jib in place on opposite side, dont tack the Jib  
\- When the tack is done let the boat settle down, it the healing it too much then temp release the main NOT the Jib  
\- Push the tiller towards the boom (or just keep it in place after the tack)  
\- lock the tiller off with a fast release mechanism (bungy etc)  
Note:  
\-Dont use a Genoa or fully furned headsail unless in light winds  
\-If a furling jib reduce it to size of wind thats comfortable, DONT attempt to wind it in when under load, you'll damage the furler  
  
 \- Watch your boat stay at a steady healing angle and stay still, about 30 deg to the waves, now go and make a cup of tea  


remember - practictice this on every other trip you do, its a great trick to show the crew  


FINALLY Practice this for MOB, In casual conditions you can stop the boat in a few yards and they can swim to you

I just wanted to contribute to the collective knowledge/opinion database in this group about food. I‚Äôm a picky eater and struggled with finding foods that aren‚Äôt overwhelming with the taste of artificial sweetener or protein. Also I‚Äôm Australian so many of the products that get recommended here I can‚Äôt find. Fairlife sounds amazing!

- Aldi Slim and Trim meal replacement shake. Now up to $2.99 per shake. I don‚Äôt think it uses any artificial sweetener because it‚Äôs got 20 something grams of sugar but still only 200 and something calories (depends on what flavour you get, I recommend the chocolate).

- Complete Dairy high protein milk - light. At $3.70 a litre she‚Äôs not cheap but she‚Äôs at woolies/coles with 15g of protein per serve and 128 calories. The picky eater in me can‚Äôt stand skim milk in my coffee. 

- Gut good yogurt. $2.70 per little tub at Woolies - but it does go on special. I‚Äôm not going to lie to you, you can taste/feel the protein but it‚Äôs edible. Doesn‚Äôt taste much like artificial sweetener either (to me)

- Collagen co iced coffee meal replacement shake. So flavour was okay and though I could taste the artificial sweetener it wasn‚Äôt terrible. The big issue for me with this was the texture. It‚Äôs almost slimy? As you‚Äôre drinking it, it feels like there‚Äôs a film on it? It‚Äôs also quite pricey. Tried the sleepy time violet crumble hot chocolate and it was okay, way too chocolatey in the portions they recommend. Going to try it with more milk and less chocolate powder.

- Blue Dinosaur protein bar - choc chip and peanut butter. Sweetened with dates so they pass the artificial sweetener taste test and they don‚Äôt overwhelmingly taste like protein. They‚Äôre higher in calories than some others, 240 for this flavour but high in fibre and protein. Just got a bunch on EOFY sale

- Uncle Toby‚Äôs protein raspberry, goji and white chocolate bar. Yuuum. Not bursting with protein but enough to justify them and I‚Äôm not a machine, I need flavour. Hella expensive at Woolies or Coles - wait for a special and stock up. They also have a strawberry cr√®me, and chocolate variety.

- Macro Mike protein powders - got the variety pack to try. The peanut protein based ones are HEAVY on the peanut. The almond buttercream one was quite tasty. Golden gaytime was disappointing. I added the buttercream one in to my shakes but it was fine when I had it separately. All of them were really strong in flavour, sometimes too much. Mug cake was technically fine but very protein-y. Also not cheap so shop the sales

- Muscle diets meals -  I don‚Äôt know how they making so much food be so few calories and it also tastes good? Wild. It comes all vacuumed in but I promise it looks less like dog food when you heat it up. High in protein, low cal, good flavour buuut not cheap. $10.95 a meal. Look for promos (got mine through an insta ad). They can also be frozen so keep that in mind.

- Aldi food envy high protein custard - comes in a to-go pouch. 14g of protein, surprisingly good flavour but it is a THICK custard.

- Bondi co meal replacement shake - I don‚Äôt know who tasted the ‚Äú‚Äùchocolate‚Äù‚Äù shake and said ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs edible, we should sell that‚Äù but they need help. Tasted like brown. Awful stuff.

saturday - leave early, head to hoh, 2:00 drive, stopped in forks gas station for ice. got to hoh at 8:11am, no wait, plenty of campsites, note - at that time the campsites were first come first served, as of june 13th, they're become available to book online ahead of time, from 12noon-5pm, there is a crushing line of non-campers waiting to get in. got campsite for 2 nights, there was plenty to go around even with one loop closed. hiked mini trails (hall of mosses, spruce), talked with visitor center guys. hiked the hoh river trail (highly recommend) out to 5 miles island and back, 10 miles 3:30/4:00 hours walking ? note - much less traveled hike, most only go 2.75 miles out to the waterfall and back, after the waterfall theres many less hikers. campfire dinner, went out out 2 hours after sunset and and did the hall of mosses trail at night (highly recommend) with low level headlamp, stars, big moon, super cool, fire.

tuesday - breakfast at swantown b&b, awesome, highly recommend. oly parks, then head to seattle, pick your poison...

other notes - cold brew coffees worked great for me camping, not being a highly skilled camp cook and having brought limited supplies with me on the plane. / get some deschutes mirror pond beer if you drink, highly recommend. / the park will get more crowded thru summer, campsites might be harder to come by but you'll be able to reserve campsites at more, hoh and maybe some other places / the deer park campground is also awesome, the road to it wasn't open yet when i was there but is highly recommended for the sweet drive up, remoteness, mountain views, its also only got 12 sites and is first come first served, this is also a thin place \*.

this was my 5th visit to the park and its always a great reset, such an amazing place, so much to see, so much to do. i might post some pictures of the trip here eventually, just wanted to give some ideas about spots, driving times, veggie foods.

thanks - rr.

1l9ah5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l9ah5c/i_30f_might_have_cancer_what_do_i_do/,I (30f) might have cancer what do I do?,"I am (30f) and am currently in the process of getting diagnosed with something but I am unsure on what it is. I am extremely active and energetic typically but have been drained for a few weeks. I went to see my doctor for a routine check up where I was told that I had unusual muscle mass reduction and some other issues. They had me go do a few other tests. I got a call back from one of my doctors this morning that I needed to go back to get another pelvic ultrasound because I had unusual findings. They want me to go back later in my cycle but I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm set to go on vacation so I won‚Äôt be able to get the ultrasound until probably 2 months from now. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs cancer. They just keep calling and asking me for more tests and the tests keep coming back with results that COULD be cancerous ya know? and it‚Äôs just been getting in my head. 

So I need advice on if I should tell my wife now or wait until I have an actual answer. (After my vacation) We‚Äôve been on opposite shifts and have been busy for so long and have been looking forward to this vacation for months. My concern is that my wife will notice something is wrong and I don‚Äôt want to lie to her but I don‚Äôt want to freak her out. 

- I have been dropping weight and it‚Äôs gotten noticeable. I could always see my ribs but now I can see all of them. My clothes don‚Äôt fit the same. My face is thin and my bones just seem so prominent now. It‚Äôs been cold here so it hasn‚Äôt been noticeable but we‚Äôre going to a beach and I won‚Äôt be able to hide anything. 

I‚Äôve been having trouble with keeping up with my normal activities. I won‚Äôt be able to swim that much or hike too far. The air around me just feels heavier. I push myself but it makes me exhausted. I know she‚Äôll notice. (I‚Äôve been described as a dog right when you open the door after a long day at work) I‚Äôm just a happy person. 

Sleep. I cannot get enough sleep. I used to sleep a standard 5 hours a day. I used to a morning person like I wake up and I‚Äôm happy and ready for the day but recently it feels like I‚Äôm clawing my way out of a hole to wake up and get up. I slept for ten hours yesterday and it still didn‚Äôt feel like enough. She‚Äôll notice this because I‚Äôm the one that wakes up and makes us coffee and gets her awake. I don‚Äôt think I can do it. 

I‚Äôm leaning on not telling her until I know more because it just feels unnecessary to stress her out. I, myself am not stressed out. I don‚Äôt think I should worry until there‚Äôs a name to whatever is happening to me. Although I do miss my energy‚Ä¶. I just need to see if another person‚Äôs perspective could tell me if it‚Äôs wrong to wait. Like if she asks me why I‚Äôm tired or so skinny or something‚Ä¶do I tell her that I‚Äôm looking into it? What do I say? It doesn‚Äôt feel serious enough to sit her down and discuss. ",2,1749693081.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

I recently bought an Oster 5502 Inox coffee maker. It works well, but there‚Äôs an annoying rattling sound coming from the metal drip tray when the machine is running and a cup is placed on it. The tray fits loosely by a millimeter or so, and it seems to vibrate more in the center, especially because it doesn‚Äôt have enough weight or support underneath. When I press down on the tray with my hand, the sound stops.
Any suggestions to fix or dampen the vibration noise?

1l9afq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1l9afq5/10_days_in_iceland_campervan_ring_road_clockwise/,10 days in Iceland - Campervan - Ring road - Clockwise in May (Spring 2025) - Campsite Review - Packing List,"Warning: Long Post!

This sub has helped a lot in planning my trip - so this is my way of giving back. 6 months of research and a stunning trip later...

  
Some overall comments about this post:

* We visited from Ottawa, Canada and picked a shoulder season for visiting this stunning country. Your average Bengali girl visiting the land of her dreams with the man of her dreams! Our experience with Iceland weather was unparallel, as we were visiting during a heat wave. We had a 6 day stretch of no rain, no clouds and pure sunlight with stunning views!
* Before going on this trip, I had a hard time finding information about how dark it gets late may. I would say, if not the midnight sun, we experienced daylight 24/7. The darkest it got was may be pre-twilight. 

We arrived at Reyjkavik airport at 8:35 am. Collected our bags. Walk through the terminal, past the place where you buy alcohol. For us, we did not plan to consume much since we will be driving , but this is where you get it.

We made our way to arrivals to meet the representative from Happy Campers to go to the office for campervan pickup. The shuttle, although free, was 1 hour 15 mins late. After a red-eye flight, this can get very frustrating, as you will be waiting without a sim card. I emailed them, to which they did not reply. It can get pretty stress inducing for no reason. So **pro tip:** account for this delay, keep waiting or talk to someone to borrow a phone if they have not shown up after 2 hours.

Once we got to the office, everything was quite smooth. There is free coffee (very nice to have after a red eye flight, especially if you plan to drive a bit)

The office also has a free shelf, so please pick up essentials from there!

Things to check before leaving campervan office:¬†

* Rent the inverter ‚Äì this, for us, was a no brainer, even if we had only phones and portable speakers to charge. This is very convenient! Note, **always unplug before leaving the car, as this can drain battery sometimes)**  
* You can also take extra gas canister for food. This varies from company to company, but through Happy Campers, for a 10 day trip, we used our stove quite often and we did not need to purchase one.  
* Take photos of the camper ‚Äì **this is essential!** You want to make note of every single damage that is already on the outside of the vehicle, as to not have to pay for it later! We thoroughly took photos of all angles of the camper, and made the representative take notes of all the damages there already are to avoid paying a hefty fine at a later date)
* Check for inclusions: linens, comforters, etc.¬†

* Check where is the spare tire, you are responsible for this in Iceland.

* How to refill the water tank. The rep showed us to do this. Good learning , don‚Äôt fill it up to the brim)

* How to work stuff that might seem obvious: gas cap, wipers, lights (auto function isn't enough), the radio, etc.

* How to work the furnace

* Washer fluid

* Make sure cruise control works

* Diesel car? Ask how to operate diesel cars if yes ‚Äì if there are things that need to be maintained.

* Check if your camper has all the curtains. Ours was missing one which we subbed with a towel or something else ‚Äì not a big issue, but worth a check!

The campervan sink exits through the bottom of the vehicle, so you do not have to worry about dealing with dishwater. (However, this is where I will highly recommend using biodegradable dishwasher. See my packing list)

Campervan comments overall:

We rented the Happy 2 (formerly 2-3pax) for 10 days in May 2025. Overall a great experience! Shuttle runs every hour, but account for delays as they can sometimes get caught in traffic. We appreciated the pickup after a red eye flight

Pickup / Drop off is a breeze. Staff is amazing! They can give you lots of tips and tricks and answer any questions.

Office has a free shelf, coffee and washrooms!

Now for our experience:

Pros:

\- the team was amazing and helpful

\- our car had a brief issue with battery and needed to be jump started. A kind, fellow happy camper helped with that. Later, the car wouldnt start when we arrived at the campsite. The emwrgency line is 10/10! They sent a mechanic in skaftafell campsite at 11pm no issues. Very grateful for this service.

\- we chose the happy 2 for the big bed. And it paid off! We had a camping mattress but the bed is spacious for 2 people. Could fit a child too, but definitely would be tight with 3 adults

\- the car drives really well, can handle inclines and gravel roads (PLEASE GET THE INSURANCE)

\- camper comes with all necessities for cooking, staying. We brought some extras like our own pillows and linens for comfort

\- heater works fantastic! It got pretty warm, no problem heating all night

\- diesel driven cars, they have very long range of fuel

\- gas canister lasted 10 days no problem

\- convenient charging ports

\- the curtains get very dark. It never really gets ""night"" in May, so we appreciated the nice curtains

\- fridge is really big for two people. Van had Lot of storage in general

\- hanging hooks in the back on two sides, very convenient for hang drying clothes

\- all utensils etc provided

\- you can ask for extra pillows / blankets / pots and pans from the office

Now for the (small) cons:

\- they offer discounts at specific gas stations. For us, unfortunately, the discount tabs did not work when we tapped it

\- the car key battery stopped working mid way, but because we had the mechanic visit he was able to reset it for us

\- NOT A CON because we got the help BUT our car battery did need to be jumped, and later needed electrical reset

\- the pantry could use pot lids, a cutting board and a strainer. This is probably my fault for not checking after a red eye flight, but there are extra pots / kitchen utensils you can grab from the office for free

\- the pillows are a little flat if you like puffy strong pillows. Though I don't think they are totally bad. If you are specific about them, carry your own

Again, the staff is AMAZING! I think compared to other companies I appreciated this van for the space and conveniences (especially the shuttle)

Thank you Happy Campers!

* Beautiful views of the waterfall, nice playground for kids. Overall, a stunning campsite!

# Day 2 - Saturday, 17th May, 2025

1. Kolugljufur Canyon - there is also a volcano here and a lava field that you can hike up
2. Sj√≥narhorn - a waterfall at the edge of the Canyon
3. Hvitserkur - rock formation - *we did not find this thrilling, not sure it was worth the drive*
4. √ûingeyraklausturskirkja Church - oldest church in iceland
5. ~~Grettirs Pool - remote hot spring - could go here because we cannot shower after Beer Spa~~
6. ~~Grafarkirkja - terrain church , not sure if its accessible by 2WD~~
7. The Beer Spa - *this was an absolutely other worldly experience! One of a kind spa so we splurged on this one*
8. Akureyri city - Grocery / Gas stop
9. Godafoss



Campsite for the night: CJA

Price: about 1,900 KR and 500 KR tax, about $45 a night

¬†

Campsite review:

* There was someone at the reception to pay. We chose to stay on the open lot across from the campsite building, which I think is their winter lot.
* Bathrooms were clean! Kitchen was convenient and clean.
* Around Lake Myvatn, there is an issue of bugs. This campsite had very few bugs. We also met a couple that took a refund and drove away from Lake Myvatn to this campsite. We were very happy with this one!
* The owners here sell eggs from their chickens (for about 790 KR each though)
* No picnic tables on the campsite itself, just one at the back by the sauna. There is an indoor eating area as well, we did not go in there because the weather was so nice outside!

# Day 3 - Sunday, 18th May, 2025

1. Lake Myvatn
2. Dimmuborgir - *This was a really cool Lava field! My husband convinced us to do the ‚Äúdifficult path‚Äù that took us away from the crowds and into a really cool trail. For us, the weather was no problem but this trail can be quite dangerous during bad weather.* *Pro tip:* ***See the kirkjan cave before entering the difficult path.***
3. Krafla crater
4. Detifoss, Selfoss ~~and Hafraghilsfoss~~
   1. *We visited the West side trail as that is the only one open in May. The West side (Road 862) is the most visited one as it also the one with most infrastructure. The road is fully paved. West, Road 862: to get to the west side you can just follow the road signs to Dettifoss along the main road, the Ring road. After turning onto road 862 keep following it for about 25 KM. At times it will feel like you‚Äôre heading to nowhere. Enjoy the views, though! The day for us was so nice and clear that it felt like we were driving through Mars. After a while though, you will see signs pointing to the parking area. For us, the Hafraghilsfoss was closed.*
5. ~~Vestudalur lava church - along 862 so no need for a 4x4 (may not be accessible)~~
6. ~~Asbyrgi Canyon - along 862 , so no need for a 4x4 (may not be accessible for weather)~~



Campsite for the night: √Åsbrandssta√∞ir, Vopnafir√∞i¬†

Price: about 1.500 KR and tax, about $30 for two



\*\* NOTE ABOUT CAMPSITE: a black sand beach is nearby: Sandv√≠k is a long, black sandy beach at the innermost part of the fjord. This is a family paradise created by nature. Visitors may find seashells, take a walk, watch the birds, build a sand castle - or follow their own imagination.



Campsite review:

* Oh what to say about this campsite. This campsite is quite a detour away from the ring road, BUT THE VIEWS ARE JUST STUNNING. Shower, laundry included in the price. Many, Many kitchen utensils, pots, pans available for use.¬†
* Did I say the views were stunning? 10000% worth it!¬†



# Day 4 - Monday, 19th May, 2025

*Waterfalls in the East Fjords has my heart! Just follow the road, and stop to be stunned by the beauty of waterfalls everywhere! Of course, I mean, you have a chance to do so (do not stop on the side of the ring road, please. This makes for dangerous driving conditions)*

1. Grocery stop at Kr√≥nan Rey√∞arfir√∞i - *We did not make this stop , but looking back¬† I would have made the detour to get some extra groceries. This is because the one mentioned below in Hofn is an exceptionally expensive store! Netto is much more expensive than Kronan, so I absolutely should have stopped here instead*
2. Studlagil Canyon - *Google will take you to the west side parking. We made the mistake of paying for the parking here. Where you want to go is the east side parking, which is 4 kms away from the west parking. You will have to cross the metal bridge and continue. If you are not feeling like its a bumpy ride into the parking lot, you are on the wrong side!*¬†

1. *From the east parking, it is about a 2 km hike. For us on the hot day, it was quite something to be walking to the spot where you climb down to the canyon. However, this stop was a highlight of our trip. In May, we saw the beautiful turquoise color of the canyon and its stunning columns with very few crowds. \*chefs kiss\* Just Stunning!*

3. Gufu foss (stop and go location)

4. Rjukandafoss (stop and go location)

5. Folaldafoss *(absolutely stunning waterfall)*

1. ~~Hengifoss~~
   1. ~~you should take road 931 from Egilssta√∞ir. Keep following the road till you arrive at the Parking area at the start of the trail. If you are coming from the south and want to take a shortcut, you can take road 939 after Dj√∫pivogur. It‚Äôs a gravel road suitable for 2wd cars, and the drive is quite scenic. Road 939 will then merge into Road 95. From there, you can continue onto Road 931 until you reach the parking area by the trailhead. This shortcut will save you about an hour on the road~~

6. Nykurhylsfoss (Sveinsstekksfoss)



Campsite for the night: Foss√°rdalur

\*\* NOTE ABOUT CAMPSITE: waterfalls nearby, best camping site in Iceland. Shower/wifi included. Laundry available for $10

Price: about 2.000 KR and tax, about $40 for two



Campsite reviews:

* Really nice campsite with showers, and a stunning kitchen / indoor eating area. Very nice falls nearby
* Facilities were amazing, staff was great! Quite a popular location along the ring road but very worth it!

# Day 5 - Tuesday, 20th May, 2025

1. L√¶kjavik Coastline
2. Skutafoss - *We went for a polar dip here!*
3. Vestahorn Viking town
4. Stokksnes - *For those who know Shah Rukh Khan, my bollywood heart went bonkers here! Such a stunning spot!*
5. Shower and grocery stop at Hofn - no groceries in the next two days
6. Diamond Beach and Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon
7. Hofskirkja ( a church)¬†



Camping site for Day 5: Skaftafell

Price: 2.500 kr. So about $50 per night

# Day 6 - Wednesday, 21st May, 2025

1. Vatnaj√∂kull Glacier Hike - Booking made! Starts at 10:30am
   1. [https://adventures.is/iceland/day-tours/glacier-tours/glacier-tours-on-vatnajokull/glacier-explorer/](https://adventures.is/iceland/day-tours/glacier-tours/glacier-tours-on-vatnajokull/glacier-explorer/)¬†
   2. *This was an other worldly, absolutely unbelievable experience. The hike was quite interesting, i am sure it would have been easier for people with better fitness than mine. I trained for it, but as someone who always struggled to walk up hill, my 4 month 12-3-30 workouts absolutely paid off!*
2. J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n - Boat tour booked at 6pm - *we ended up cancelling this boat tour. First, because it was foolish to book it on the same day as the hike. There was a delay with the bus, we arrived back at Skaftafell well after 5pm. Second, because after being in the nooks and crannies of the glacier for 6 hours, it did not seem worth the 45 min drive (each way).*



We stay at Skaftafell again.



Campsite review:

* This was a crowded, busy campsite. While there are nice views of the glacier, it was nowhere close to what we had already seen in the north.¬†
* My husband who used the shower said that the water pressure and temperature was not consistent throughout his shower.¬†
* Large bathroom facilities but no kitchen!¬†
* Overall, what we paid seemed like a lot for what the facilities were. But hey, thats the south of Iceland for you!

# Day 7 - Thursday, 22nd May, 2025¬†

1. Svartifoss at Skaftafell campsite- 45 min hike, quite uphill!

9. Kvernufoss *(0.9km hike - this was a stunning fall where we walked behind the waterfalls and took photos with no one in sight! Quite the spot!)*
10. Seljalandsfoss & Glj√∫frab√∫i (two falls - must need waterproof gear) [https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gljufrabui](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gljufrabui) \- beautiful hidden waterfall near Skogafoss.
   1. *first stop was Seljalandsfoss ( 5 mins from parking ) , a majestic 60-meter-high waterfall on the Seljalands√° River. It has a footpath behind it, allowing you to fully encircle the waterfall and see it from all angles. A short 150-meter walk from the well-known Seljalandsfoss waterfall, hidden within a spectacular canyon, is another gem of this area: Glj√∫frab√∫i, also known as the Canyon Dweller.*



Camping site for Day 7: Reyjkholt \*\*\* there is a 20% discount at Secret Lagoon if we have the time \*\*\*

Price: 2.100 kr. So about $50 per night



Campsite review:

* This is the first night when icelandic weather was icelandic weather for us. It was all rain, so we could not fully enjoy this campsite! Just parked and slept
* To be fair, we went here so that we get the 20% off at Secret Lagoon the next day! After 7 days of hikes and torturing our bodies, we wanted to enjoy that!¬†
* Bathrooms were ok, not sure it was worth the $ (Again, my mind keeps going back to the north where the campsites were stunning!)

# Day 8 - Friday, 23rd May, 2025

1. Secret Lagoon \*\* Shower Stop\*\* - *So , so stunning!*¬†
2. *~~Keri√∞ Crater (Crater Lake) - 100m from the parking lot. underwhelming but easy to see - Keri√∞ Crater Lake is a 6,500-year-old volcanic crater lake with depths ranging from 7 to 14 meters, depending on the season and rainfall, and it is known for its uniquely vivid aquamarine-blue water. - optional~~*¬†
3. Geysir Hot Springs
4. Gullfoss Waterfall - *Short 5 minute walk from parking Gullfoss features 2 impressive waterfalls. The first falls from 11 meters and the second one drops from 20 meters, with a total height of 32 meters. For the best view of the waterfall, I highly recommend heading to the upper viewing platform*.
5. Br√∫arfoss Waterfall - *1.1km walk from Br√∫arfoss Parking*
6. Thingvellir (√ûingvellir) National Park -√ñxar√°rfoss - Oxararfoss waterfall in P2 parking - 5 mins from there - *Lots of crowds , go early or suuuper late!*
7. If needed, Can do grocery Stop in Arkanes Kronan\*\*
8. Hallgr√≠mskirkja Church for a birds‚Äô eye view of the colorful city
9. The Sun voyager Statue

  


Campsite for the night: St√≥ri-Lambhagi 4



Campsite review: Strap in, because this is about to get real!¬†

* All campsites around reykjavik have very poor reviews with very high prices! We found this one, which was an extremely small campsite, cash only. ONLY 2200KR for two with a campervan. Owner comes by to take payment.¬†
* Best part for us: Immaculate cleanliness (Toilets and dish sinks). Bathrooms had incents and it was very, very nice! No indoor space / kitchen but really loved how clean, nice and quiet it was! Best campsite around Reykjavik imo
* We were going to stay just one night but we stayed a second night! 100/10!

""Daylight Run""

‚ÄúDaylight Run‚Äù
Written by Chatgpt & Me

The phone rings low before the dawn,
While dreams still drift and stars hang on.
The house is hushed, the kids asleep,
Their breathing slow, their blankets deep.

I roll on over, soft and slow,
Kiss my wife before I go.
""See you in a couple days,"" I say‚Äî
She nods, still caught in sleep's ballet.

Steel-toed boots and coffee steam,
I slip out quiet, chase the dream.
By first light I'm on iron veins,
Rolling west through fields and plains.

Sun climbs up and paints the sky,
Boxcars hum as towns drift by.
Daylight wraps this run in gold,
But this ain't nine-to-five, truth told.

Folks in cars just see the train‚Äî
A blur of freight, a streak of strain.
But I‚Äôm the one behind that roar,
Clock don‚Äôt punch like at the store.

Out here it‚Äôs rhythm, grind, and wait,
Schedules written out by fate.
Two days gone, or maybe three,
While normal life keeps missing me.

Yet something 'bout that open track,
The sun behind me, wind at back‚Äî
Makes me feel alive and free,
Even if I‚Äôm absentee.

So I ride the rails while daylight spills,
Across the pines and over hills.
A working man, but not quite plain‚Äî
My office is this roaring train.",2,1749692852.0,Poems,1,1.0,False

It started long before I was born my father never wanted to have me but my mother begged him so she could be my great grandmother‚Äôs favorite and as soon as I was born my father used me as a way to quiet jobs and to be lazy and in my infant years I was exposed to either physical abuse or neglect by my father as my mother worked so hard to make money so we had food, clothes and other vital things my mom took me away from my father at the age of 3 and after 4 months of being single my stepfather worked relentlessly to build my mothers self esteem and my fears of men even though I was male and taught me that I don‚Äôt need to be like my father but at the age of 5 my father was able to come back into my life and at first it was good we bonded over video games and swimming but after a year I noticed his change back into the man my mother ran from he would use the belt and punish me for my mistakes no matter the severity and when i couldn‚Äôt swim without help he had gotten me his son a snorkel-set and dropped me in the deep end trying to drown me. Luckily i was saved by apartment supervisor. As the months went on he met my stepmother and she was just as cruel as him they were both narcissistic and entitled to everything I wasn‚Äôt allowed to play video games or even hangout with friends because they saw I was behind in school and never believed I was dyslexic like my mother so they would force me to stay in my room and do homework and read non stop and when it got to hard for me and I would break down they would fake sympathy but berate me saying you can do better and then making me a reason why I couldn‚Äôt attend family gatherings. In my sophomore year and was behind but making good progress on improving from what school and teachers told my mother and my father but my father used it as a way to take me from my mother to keep me quiet and submissive, and luckily my mother and stepfather were foster parents so it didn‚Äôt hold up in court fast forward to a few months before my 18 birthday I would have panic attacks about going to my fathers house and so i finally told the principal at my school but he said that he couldn‚Äôt do anything because there was no marks but dcys would leave a file on my father and stepmother so after school I ran away to my friends house living a message for my teacher to give to my mom saying I was ok and id be home on Monday after school so i left with my friend to go to his house but I had forgotten my father was friends with his father and my friends mom got a call from her ex husband telling her if I was there too tell me to show myself to my dad before a missing persons file was made so I told his mom when she gets home to drive me to the police station and when we got there I met the officer who sided with my father and threatened to force me into the car no matter what or to have a coffee date with him and I decided coffee date but i begged my friends mom now crying from a bad panic attack to be there to watch in case he tried anything. She agreed and came with and after hour of arguing back and forth my father took me to my moms work and gave up after I repeatedly stated I hated him for his actions towards me but I still love him but I can‚Äôt take his anger and mistreatment anymore. Before he left he had said some vile things to me that I am sure would go against guidelines for me to say. That‚Äôs my story a young boy or man depending on what time frame you look at it.

Its small but expensive so im often out on the road connecting with places like hotels community centers and the like to get the word out. I like in particular developing partnerships with hotels since its an easy way to hook new tourists into checking us out. Again- we are expensive so most locals dont come to us its mostly tourists. Thus the popularity with hotels

Now today I went in to get more brochures to pass out and was instead handed door hangers. My boss said that we are giving a discount to locals. Fantastic! I've been pushing for local discounts for months! However he wants me now to go door to door and hang the hangers on front doors in whatever neighborhoods I think will have the best response. 

Now idk about you but door hangers are a little old fashioned (its hard enough to convince coffee shops and other businesses to hold our brochures) and with the lets say charged environment of today going up to random houses and hanging a flyer doesn't seem safe. 

I said this. A lot. But he insisted and I was forced to take the hangers and go out. I went by my old neighborhood as a kid (im 30 so not that old!) But found it very odd to park and walk door to door with an armful of hangers. I also found several houses had do not solicit and no solicitors signs. Despite this i spent a hour and did almost 2 blocks worth.

I called another marketer for the company who's higher up then me and works in the main office. Now mind you she's in a completely different city. Same state but different city. So far though that she might as well be another state. I expressed my safety concerns and frankly the absurdity if doing something so old fashioned. She said she'd look into it. A few minutes later she called me back saying that she spoke with my boss and they agree for me to keep working the neighborhoods just ""not the unsafe ones"" and to ignore the no solicitor houses. She's also coordinated a meeting with me my boss her and one other marketer who's on her level for tomorrow morning to discuss my marketing progress.

Mind you we have been doing ok. As good as other locations? No. But i managed to secure 3 partnerships in the 5 months ive been here which is more then the last guy did and ive secured several events for us to be vendors at including our own towns biggest fair. 

Personally I think that door hangers are obsolete and im asking my life for very little (im only being paid $2 more then minimum) and I should be focusing on increasing pur presence with hotels and community events.

He convinced me that this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù he bought it from USED to have a cockroach problem, but it was not current and they were all dead. 
    Well fast forward to a few weeks ago, I thought I stepped on a funny looking spider in the bathroom, but after crushing it there were a lot of little dots about the size of coffee grounds surrounding it. Thought it was maybe baby spiders and cleaned/moved on. 
    Yesterday, I saw a light brown to caramel colored bug that was dead and about an inch in size with a wide oval shape by the door. I have never seen one in person besides baby germans but i KNOW it was a roach. I don‚Äôt have pictures but i‚Äôm unsure of if it looked more german or like a wood roach (I didn‚Äôt think to look for stripes‚Ä¶.) I am terrified and can‚Äôt even eat thinking about what could be inside my home. I looked in the bathroom for droppings, roaches and found nothing. Cabinet under the sink, nothing. 
    Where do I even start??? pest control immediately or do I buy products listed in this subreddit and try to fight them by myself?

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of horchata powder hinges on several key factors, influencing its taste, texture, and overall convenience.

**Base Ingredients:**

The foundation of any horchata powder is its base ingredient, typically rice flour, tiger nuts (chufa), or a combination of both. The type of base affects the texture and flavor profile. Powders made with rice flour are generally smoother and sweeter, while those based on tiger nuts offer a nuttier and slightly earthier taste. High-quality powders often specify the type and origin of their base ingredients for better clarity.

**Sweeteners:**

The type of sweetener used substantially impacts the taste and nutritional value of the horchata. Some powders use refined sugars like sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup, while others opt for more natural alternatives such as cane sugar, coconut sugar, or even sugar substitutes like stevia or monk fruit. The choice of sweetener can cater to different dietary needs and preferences, making this a crucial consideration for many consumers.

**Spices and Flavorings:**

Authentic horchata frequently enough features a blend of spices like cinnamon, vanilla, and sometimes citrus zest. The quality and balance of these spices are crucial for achieving a well-rounded and delicious flavor. Some powders might include artificial flavorings to enhance the taste, but many purists prefer powders with natural spices for a more authentic and nuanced experience.

**Solubility:**

A great horchata powder should dissolve easily in both hot and cold liquids without clumping, leaving a smooth and creamy consistency. Poor solubility can result in a grainy texture that detracts from the overall drinking experience. High-quality powders undergo processing to ensure fine particle size and ease of dissolution.

**Artificial Additives:**

Many consumers seek horchata powders with minimal artificial additives, preservatives, and colors. A shorter ingredient list with recognizable components frequently enough indicates a higher-quality product. While some additives might enhance shelf life or texture, thay are generally viewed as less desirable by health-conscious individuals.

Key features to look for in a great horchata powder include:

*   Natural sweeteners
*   authentic spice blend
*   Easy solubility
*   Minimal additives

## Core Benefits

A good horchata powder offers more than just a tasty treat; it brings several practical benefits to the table.

**Extended Shelf Life:** Unlike homemade horchata, which can spoil quickly, horchata powder has a long shelf life, making it a convenient item to keep on hand for whenever the craving strikes. this extended shelf life reduces waste and ensures you always have the ingredients ready for a quick and refreshing drink. Proper storage in an airtight container can further prolong its freshness.

You can add it to smoothies, coffee, oatmeal, baked goods (like cookies and cakes), and even cocktails for a unique twist. using horchata powder in place of some flour in baking recipes can add a subtle sweetness and creamy texture.

""And have you been sleeping? You looked tired.""

John Shamroy smiled, doing his best to whisk the wrinkles on his face away as he replied, ""Like a baby Maddie. And I've been eating and taking my meds they gave me on the dot.""

A slight frown fell on her lips at the answer, young woman's quizzical green eyes seemingly seeing through every ounce of his bullshit. The same look she'd given him when she was seven and asked if Santa was real. The same look when he'd tried to talk her out of dating when she was a junior in high school. He looked out the window past the porch towards the faded blacktop on the road and replied, ""Okay, I've had a bit of trouble sleeping. Nothing serious.""

The expression shifted, worry working its way into her voice as she asked, ""Are you sure you don't want to come with me? I don't like you out here alone on Christmas. I'm sure Mom-""

""Would pretend she didn't hate every second of having me there? No, I'm fine. It's not my first rodeo Mads. I've got a landline, cell phone, and if all fails the hospital is just thirty minutes up the road. The storm is supposed to pass right over us before dropping any snow.""

She looked away, emerald eyes drifting over his bachelor's paradise as though searching for evidence to prove her point. She eventually looked out the back and said, ""Do you have enough firewood? I don't want you to try cutting any. Your heart-""

Madalyn paused when she glanced his way, gaze caught on the sight of the fading line poking just above the collar of his shirt. John looked down, hiking his shirt up to conceal the scar, and replied, ""It's been six months since the surgery Mads. The doctors all say I've been really lucky. No sign of rejection or complications. As healthy as a heart transplantee could be.""

""I just..."" She trailed off and looked away. When she turned back, he saw the faintest hint of tears in her eyes, and his heart sank as she said, ""I almost lost you, dad. I don't know what I'd do if- if-""

""If nothing."" He stepped forward and drew her into a warm embrace. ""I'm right here, Mads. I'll be okay.""

After a moment, he let go, and she stepped back with an expression exploding into a brilliant smile as she said, ""Your present! I almost forgot!"" Without another word she was off, a ball of twenty-something energy off to the driveway to get a package. He sighed and headed over to the fireplace, drawing a card off the mantle and absently scratching at the skin over his eyebrow while he waited. In the corner of his eye, something shifted.

John turned suddenly, blue eyes widening at seeing a figure in the doorway to the backyard. He felt himself beginning to back away as the blood in his racing heart grew cold. The woman at the door with long blonde hair caked dark red only smiled.

""Dad?"" John turned with a start, his daughter jumping and nearly slipping off the balcony at the sight of her father's pale visage. He coughed and cracked the best smile possible as he replied, ""Thought I saw something in the backyard, is all.""

When she reached him and peered over his shoulder, John turned to find an empty amber afternoon splashed across his backyard. He laughed and said, ""It's a bit spooky out here sometimes, is all. But first, your present.""

With a slight pout, she accepted the card in his hand, looking up as he said, ""I wanted just to get it, but I don't know a damn thing about these new computers."" At the word, her eyes widened and he went on, ""B-but that should be enough to get a good one. Perfect for photo editing and your classes.""

He stopped as her arms clasped tight around him, voice nearly squeaking as she exclaimed, ""Thank you! You really didn't have to! You're the best! The best!""

""I wanted to. I've seen your work, and you deserve something that can keep up with you, kid. Now, this..."" He gently accepted the small package in her hands and stopped as she said, ""Not yet. Not until Christmas. It's special.""

He took the shiny green box, set it on the stones lined over the fireplace, and smiled. And with that, he gave his daughter one last long hug. She tittered at him about a few other things, but eventually, John convinced her to go, or she'd be late for her flight.

He watched her car slide out of the driveway, eyes lingering on the road after she'd slipped from sight. Once her car was gone, he sighed and observed the box lying on the fireplace. An unwelcome chill snuck through the air and down his spine, a shiver bringing his attention to the fire.

Moments later, he returned through the back with logs piled high on both arms, stumbling just before the fireplace with a small cry. He slipped to one knee, hand clutching his chest as each heartbeat felt laced with needles. He looked down to see his hand stained red, droplets falling free to the wood floor.

John tore his shirt open to find nothing but the pink line that had appeared six months ago when a group of surgeons had cracked him open like a walnut. He looked at his hand to find it empty save for soot and dust from the firewood. He tossed a few logs on for the flames to lick and set in his recliner, eyeing the assortment of pills on the small table beside it.

With a beer in hand, he slumped back into the chair and began cracking open bottles and consuming his nightly regimen. He took a heavy pull from the bottle, feeling the pills stuck in his throat dislodge and slide away. Outside he saw the air growing gray, clouds beginning to strangle the peaceful afternoon air.

His blue eyes flickered around his home until they eventually settled back on the pretty green package Maddie had left him. As though making sure the coast was clear, he looked back out at the driveway, the dark road catching his gaze again as he lingered.

He pulled the present off the fireplace and quickly tore the paper free, finding a box with two compartments waiting. He lifted a black eight ball from the box, turning the smooth surface in hand until finding the words, THE BEST Etched in the back. A wry smile spread across his face, and he thought about all the young men she was about to emasculate at pool in college.

They'd spent hours playing game after game, especially around the holidays when he tended to retreat into the den. She'd come in without a word and begin teeing up, and hours later, the pair would finish their last game with a smile.

His brow furrowed at the second item, wrapped in blue paper. He pulled it from the box, eyes widening at the sight of an old Coca-Cola branded camera emerging. He pulled the back open to find it missing film but felt tears beginning to well as he recalled the smile on her face that Christmas as she darted around the house taking pictures.

The endless trips to get the film developed into glossy photos until everything became digital. John felt his eyes growing heavy and laid back in his chair, darkness creeping in as he listened to the crackle of the fire and remembered that small smile so big on her face. 



PART 2

A scream tore John from his restless slumber. Heart racing in his chest, he looked around the living room filled with shadows only interrupted by the glowering embers left on the fire. He jumped to his feet, turning to the sound of brakes squealing outside. He tossed another log on with a spray of sparks and dashed towards the front door.

As he opened it, the storm tore into the house, flakes of snow sneaking across the hardwood floor. John squinted and eventually made out the sight of a red truck idling on the side of the road, several feet away from a form in the snow. His throat seized shut when he recognized a pink coat adorning someone lying facedown in the snow.

He cursed and turned on his heel, hardly registering the sound of the truck roaring to life outside as he reached for the cordless phone. The device in his ear only clicked after he'd dialed 911, offering no reassurance. He tried it again before dropping it and pulling his cell phone out. He ignored the lack of bars and tried again, to no avail. Phone at his ear, he moved to the doorway to look out and see-

Nothing.

The road in front of his home was pristine, a lofty loam of snow now resting over the blacktop since he'd fallen asleep. He took a step out and shuddered, chilled air tearing through the thin button-up he'd slipped on this morning. He peered at the road before shaking his head and shutting the door behind him.

John then kicked at the snow that had accumulated across the floor and made his way to the fireplace. He slipped another log on and poked at the embers, watching the heat begin to blacken the fresh additions. A hint of pain struck again, and he fell back into his chair, gently hitting his chest with a clenched hand and looking back at his phone to find there still was no reception.

John jumped when the front door flew open, turning to find his daughter framed in the darkness. ""Dad, you okay?"" She wondered.

John got to his feet, running fingers through the graying flecks of hair on his chin and offering her a halfhearted smile. He watched her close the door and wondered, ""Wait, why aren't you flying now?""

Maddie quickly walked in, approaching the fireplace and holding her hands out to the burgeoning flames while saying, ""The storm is way worse than anyone expected. Flight got canceled, so you're stuck with me.""

Pain beginning to fade in his chest, John smiled at her warmly and wondered, ""Well, we'll get you on the way tomorrow. Are you hungry?"" At that, she shook her head, blonde locks stuck in place by the melting snow on her shoulders. She motioned for the fire, continuing to hold her hands toward it.

""It's so cold. I could have frozen to death out there."" At that, John frowned and glanced up when she asked, ""You opened it already? I said wait until Christmas, Dad!""

He held the camera up and grinned at her, looking at the red plastic and saying, ""Hell of a gift though, Mads.""

She leaned back in her chair, finally satisfied with the blood flow returning to her hands, and sighed. She looked at him, green eyes growing inquisitive as she said, ""It really was, back then. You got me started on it all."" She paused, lips pursing before going on, ""But I've always wondered something.""

John looked up from the branded camera to find her staring his way intently. Her voice seemed to change softly as she asked him, ""Why do you always want to be alone on Christmas? Even when I was a kid, you'd hole up in your den for days, barely even coming out to watch me open presents.""

John cleared his throat and glanced away. He eventually settled on watching the flames and slowly answered, ""This time of year is just hard for me.""

""Why?""

John got to his feet, feeling the cold air settle in as he stepped away from the fire. He turned away from her and said, ""Just some things that happened before you were born."" He took another step and paused, gaze trickling out the window. ""Where's your car Mads?""

""So you really wouldn't tell her what you did?""

The orange glow behind him faded. John swallowed, slowly turning to the darkness swallowing the room and seeing the figure where his daughter had sat rise. The last cinder fizzled out as she swiftly approached, voice growing to a roar, ""You think you can escape this?""

John stumbled back, falling to the floor with one hand up. A woman in a pink coat with blood caking her platinum hair against it stood before him now. Her blue eyes burned into him, and she leaned in close, hand pressing into his chest. Searing hot agony screamed inside him, causing him to buckle forward before the apparition pushed him back against the wall.

A smile grew across her pale lips, cracking the thin layer of ice lining her cheek. Amanda glared into him and asked, ""You killed me, John. No more hiding.""

PART THREE

Her frigid fingers slid through the weeping, bloody scar on his chest. John cried out in pain as they enveloped his heart and clenched tight. The woman leaned in close, voice dripping venom as she asked, ""Tell me you remember the day it happened.""

""I- I can't-"" She scowled at the answer and, for one moment, released her grip to allow the swaying world to shudder to stop. When he'd caught his breath, John looked at her and replied between ragged breaths, ""December 20th, 1999. I..."" He trailed off, burning his face in his hands.

Amanda's eyes widened, and she slammed his head against the wall with her free hand. He felt her breath chill his cheek as she demanded, ""You hit someone, then just drove off. You fucking coward.""

She tore her hand free, blood splattering against the hardwood floor in messy spurts. She turned away and raged, ""And then had a beautiful life! A wonderful daughter. Even a second heart you know you don't deserve! ""

John took a long, shuddering breath to steady himself. He looked at the woman pacing in the dark gloom of the living room and replied, ""I was just a kid. I got scared. I'm sorry. I know-""

She whirled around at the word, a twisted smirk on her face as she sneered, ""Sorry? Sorry that you hit me. That you drove off without even checking? Sorry that I froze to death that night, lying in the road?""

At that, he only looked down. John felt the world beginning to slow as the blood from his wound began pooling around him in a halo, gently creeping across the floor. The ghost stepped through the red and gently shook his shoulders, saying, ""Stay with me, John. We're nowhere near done. Hey, hey,"" She shook him much harder this time, nearly roaring, ""Look at me!""

When he rolled his head up and caught her eye, the rage diminished, and she said, ""Did you know I had a son, John? I mean, I'm sure you do. It was in the paper. He's spent every Christmas since wondering who killed his Mom while you enjoy your perfect, little, life.""

At that, he placed a hand on her shoulder before clumsily pushing the spirit back. ""Perfect?"" He asked, a chuckle echoing in his chest. ""You think my life's perfect? Fucking look around.""

A moment of silence settled between the two figures, alone in the dark home on Christmas Eve. With a shuddering breath, John fired back, ""Everywhere I go, you. On my wedding day, you're there. My daughter's birth, you're in the fucking room. The day she went to prom, I cacouldn'tn't even notice how beautiful my baby girl was with you over her shoulder! I haven't been happy one God damn day!""

The ghost remained where she was, voice quiet as she pondered, ""And you think that's my fault?""

John woke with a start, knocking the beer bottle off the table beside his recliner. He let out a hiss and grasped his shirt, pulling it away to see the perfectly intact scar. A cry of pain escaped him, and he looked through the flickering light of the fireplace filling the room for his phone.

The cordless offered no noise, and his cell phone had no reception, just as it was in his dream. He stepped towards the front door and gasped, legs giving out beneath him. He collided with the floor, feeling every breath burn in his lungs as the world swam around him.

He noticed something on the floor, only feet away. With a deep breath, the kaleidoscope world slowed to a gentle whirl, and John gradually made out what lay before him. A red plastic camera with a polar bear holding a bottle of Coca-Cola on the side. He reached out, grasping the small gift and forcing himself to his feet and out the front door.

The storm screamed outside, the wind whipping the snow into a frenzy. Still clutching at his chest, John slid inside his car and turned on the ignition. He glanced back at his house one last time, stalling at seeing a dark figure framed in the window.

Despite the agony, the drive was uneventful, the chains on his tires tearing through the thick layer of snow that had swallowed the world. As he saw the halo of blue light appear in the sleet, he smiled, knowing the sign read Clemm Community Hospital regardless of what the storm said. His car skidded to a stop outside the Emergency Room, and he only hoped he was at least near a parking stall.

John opened the door to his car and screamed, voice smothered by the storm's roar as the piercing pain in his chest crescendoed. He slipped out of the vehicle, landing on his back in the parking lot with his eyes cast toward the dark sky.

Even as his vision blurred, he saw her appear above. ""Gonna- gonna get what you wanted."" He told the ghost.

Amanda's eyes glared into him before coming to rest on the camera in his hand. Her voice faltered as it slipped out into the night, ""I don't want you to die. You know what I want."" The two shared a long stare until he nodded, and the darkness finally took him.

In the ER waiting room, a nurse nursing her fourth cup of coffee that night glanced up when the twin doors leading outside opened. Moments passed, and she watched them slide back shut with a furrowed brow. Taking one last pull of her bitter midnight drink, she got to her feet, eyes widening as she exclaimed for another in the back, ""Jolene, we've got someone on the floor!""

John looked up at the woman in white talking, finally beginning to understand as she droned out, ""Endocarditis, Mister Shamroy. An infection in your heart. Not uncommon after surgery and with the immunosuppressants you're on. It's a good thing you came in tonight. With observation and antibiotics, your prognosis is good."" He only nodded, offering short answers to acknowledge the doctor until she left.

When alone, he reached over and pulled the corded phone to his ear, dialing three numbers. The professional voice at the end of the line asked, ""Nine one one, what's your emergency?""

""I need to report something.""

The voice on the other end carried a hint of concern as she wondered, ""Did something happen?""

""Yes, on December 21st, 1999, I hit someone and drove away-""

""Sir? We'll send officers to get your statement. Not here, on the phone."" John replied he understood and let the phone slide back into place with a soft click.

He then looked around the hospital room, dimly lit by a small lamp on the bedside table. Beside him, a monitor faintly beeped to the tune of his heart beating. He sat in the room alone for the first time he could remember.

Looking down at his hands, John smiled.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!

This fall, they're rolling out *not one, but two* online degrees in Artificial Intelligence. Who knew the robots would take over not just our jobs, but our classrooms too?

**Degrees with a Digital Twist**

Say hello to a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in AI, designed for the next-gen Einsteins and aspiring tech titans who'd rather binge-watch lectures than Netflix. They're not just teaching algorithms‚Äîthey're crafting the AI overlords of tomorrow.

- **Bachelor's degree:** A 120-credit buffet featuring AI essentials like machine learning and robotics, with a side of ethics (because nobody wants a rogue AI with a 'delete all humans' bug).

- **Master's degree:** This 30-credit masterpiece throws in some Adversarial AI and Reinforcement Learning. It's like the AI Olympics, but with fewer bronze medals and more job offers.

**Learn Anytime, Anywhere**

One hundred percent online. As in, learn to speak fluent machine-voice while sipping coffee in your pajamas. It's education for the Netflix era‚Äîpractical and flexible enough for tuckered-out professionals and military personnel alike.

**More Than a Degree‚ÄîA Leap Into the AI Future**

Partnerships with AI heavyweights, internships, and real-world capstone projects ensure these aren't just pie-in-the-sky qualifications. ASU is setting up students to strut straight into high-demand roles. Data scientists? AI engineers? Yes, please. 

Plus, they‚Äôre extending a robotic hand to K-12 students in underserved communities, aiming to populate the AI world not with monocultured algorithms, but with a vibrant, diverse set of voices.

**Now for the Real Question...**

Will AI get so smart that our new graduates will be learning from the robots they trained? Or will they still be leading the digital parade into a hyper-intelligent future? Has AI opened a Pandora's box or a treasure chest? What do you think about AI's role in education and whether it's a blessing or a curse?

Set the BrewOne to Dose 0.55 oz (about 15g), 1:1 coffee-to-water ratio(yeah, crazy low, I know, cuz the water just used to melt the ice), 176¬∞F temp, RPM on High, and F-rate at 3ml/s. Used 15g of medium-roast Ethiopian beans, ground medium-coarse with the built-in grinder. Warmed the BrewOne‚Äôs V60 with hot water, added the grounds, and tossed in 120g of ice cubes. Poured 15ml water to start the bloom and melt the ice slowly. Let it sit on the counter for 4 hours‚Äîno fridge, just room temp‚Äîfor a slow, clean extraction.

Tbh, it came out bright with lemony and stone fruit vibes, but kinda thin, maybe I put too much ice. Thinking of playing with the grind or dropping to 100g ice next time. And there's one more thing‚ÄîI should've used ice cubes instead of an ice ball. It melts too slowly. In fact, this was supposed to be a 4-hour recipe, but the ice ball took over 5 hours to fully melt.

I had a fourth, final interview with a panel (CEO, CDO, & COO) for a Marketing management job I was going for. For context: My prior interviews went well, but I actually withdrew my application after the third interview because I noticed their VP of Marketing didn‚Äôt really know any marketing and was also the CEO/founder‚Äôs daughter. 

The parent company called me and asked me to reconsider, so I did. I scheduled the panel interview for this last Monday. 

I got to the interview early and was sitting in their conference room. After I met the panel, the first question I was asked was if I was Mexican because of my last name. I, shocked, responded no, then was told ‚Äúwell your name is  ‚Äòxyz‚Äô‚Äù. I said that it was my married last name. He continued, ‚Äúis your husband Mexican?‚Äù

Later in the interview, I was asked by this same man about my current work from home setup. He asked, ‚Äúdo you have any children?‚Äù I responded no, again in shock.

I had known there was someone else in this position who was terminated after 30 days. When asked why that person was terminated, the CEO slammed his padfolio on the table, stood up, said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get me started,‚Äù and walked to the other side of the room. Turns out that person was unorganized. 

The interview was full of interruptions and taking my answers out of context. It was disappointing to say the least. 

The next morning, the recruiter called me and asked how I thought it went. I told her everything and that I felt disrespected. Later that afternoon, I received a call from the COO in the panel. She said, ‚Äúthe recruiter told me we had different experiences on Monday. We loved you.‚Äù I explained what happened and how I felt disrespected. I was met with ‚Äúthey‚Äôre good people, we are like family,‚Äù zero accountability and textbook gaslighting. I left the call actually wondering if I dreamt up everything.

That call ended with the COO extending an offer to meet for coffee and lunch to discuss if this would be a good fit for both parties. I initially said let me think about it, but then asked if an offer was on the table (not sure if I should have said that or not). She responded, ‚Äúwell, it was on the table, but now we need to see if it‚Äôs a good fit culturally for both sides.‚Äù I said I 100% agree and will let you know soon. 

I emailed my notice of withdrawal from the position the next morning.

I'm trying to remember the name of a film I saw around 10 years ago, probably on a channel like Telecine Cult. It was a low-key indie drama, spoken in English, set in a big city ‚Äî possibly New York.

The main character was a slim woman with straight, medium-length black hair. She worked in a casual setting (I think a coffee shop or something similar). She would often draw what she observed around her ‚Äî small everyday scenes and people in her neighborhood ‚Äî in a little sketchbook, maybe around 6x4 inches (15x10 cm).

At some point in the film, she casually becomes pregnant and chooses to have an abortion. This wasn‚Äôt dramatized too heavily ‚Äî it felt quiet, personal, and realistic.

The emotional high point of the film is when she holds an **art show/exhibition at night**, displaying the same sketches, now framed and hanging in a real gallery. I clearly remember people walking through the gallery and looking at the artwork. I think the man she had been involved with (the one related to the pregnancy) was also at the exhibition, perhaps as a guest ‚Äî it felt meaningful, like a quiet resolution.

There was little to no classical soundtrack, and the film had a clean, quiet, urban aesthetic ‚Äî which is why it stuck with me. It felt intimate, reflective, very much in the vein of 2000s‚Äìearly 2010s indie cinema. Definitely not amateur, but not a mainstream release either.

She had a wedding dress ready as she waited for him to say the words she'd been longing to hear.

Jared was Yvonne's first love and childhood friend. From campus to the workplace, she'd loved him so much she lost herself, becoming nothing more than his shadow.

‚Ä¶

Rumors were swirling in their social circle just days ago. Yvonne's close friends warned her to be careful because Jared was getting too close to Shirley Ember, the young woman in college he'd been sponsoring.

Yvonne was making an appointment for her premarital checkup in the hospital when she ran into Jared, who was supposed to be in a meeting.

He'd accompanied Shirley for her pre-employment checkup and was anxiously comforting her as she teared up from a blood test.

With a trembling hand, Yvonne threw away the final postponed checkup slip.

‚Ä¶

""Have you given any more thought to the blind date I mentioned last time, Yvvy? Simon Quillan's nephew just returned from abroad, and he's been wanting to set the two of you up,"" Lily Tanning, Yvonne's mother, carefully asked from the other end of the line.

When Yvonne remained silent, Lily quickly changed her tone. ""I'll turn him down if you really don't want to meet him.""

""Mom, you can tell Mr. Quillan that I'll attend the blind date,"" Yvonne replied calmly.

""Are you really agreeing to the blind date?"" Lily was surprised. She'd expected Yvonne to turn it down firmly like the last time. Worried, she asked, ""Will you have time? Didn't you say your job as a secretary keeps you busy?""

Yvonne replied, ""I'm no longer a secretary anymore. I transferred to a different department, so I can leave on time now. Just let me know when the blind date is set.""

After ending the call, she took the gift bag she'd picked up from the mall counter and got out of the car.

‚Ä¶

The banquet hall on the hotel's fifth floor was elegantly decorated. Jared had specially arranged tonight's lavish buffet to celebrate Shirley's new job.

Shirley was surrounded by a crowd as she stood in a white Dior cocktail dress, a tiara resting on her head. She looked every bit like a beloved princess.

Her colleagues playfully urged her to toast Jared, and she bashfully linked arms with him before they clinked their glasses.

However, she couldn't hold her wine well and drunkenly collapsed into his arms after drinking half a glass.

At that moment, someone noticed Yvonne entering the hall. Their expressions stiffened. ""Hello, Yvonne.""

The lively atmosphere fell silent in an instant.

With a flushed face, Shirley struggled to get away from Jared's arms. However, he pulled her even closer, not at all fazed.

""Why are you late?"" He completely avoided mentioning how he'd missed the premarital checkup.

Yvonne smiled as she replied, ""It was raining, and I got stuck in a jam.""

Jared took the gift bag from her. ""I promised you that I'd buy you a gift once you start your internship at Ford Corporation, Shirley.""

Shirley opened up the gift box and found that it was a diamond ring. ""It's my favorite ring! Thank you, Jared!""

""Let me put it on you."" Jared put the ring on her carefully, as if he was proposing to her.

The other colleagues were even taking photos at the side. ""You guys just shared a drink together, and now he's putting a ring on you. From now on, you're Mr. Ford's woman, Shirley.""

Jared pulled Shirley closer and whispered in her ear, ""How do you want to thank me?""

She tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.

Jared smiled affectionately as he announced to everyone, ""Shirley is my secretary from now on.""

Yvonne's breath caught in her throat as memories came rushing back to her.

‚Ä¶

When she was seven, new neighbors moved to the house next door. It was a beautiful woman with a young boy.

He complimented her looks during their first meet. Every day, he'd come find her to play and always held her hand, saying that he'd protect her.

Jared took his promise seriously and protected Yvonne ever since then. He wouldn't let anyone bully her, refused to let other boys look at her, and prohibited her from dating.

The night after her coming-of-age, she drank a glass of wine and shattered the unspoken understanding between the two of them. ""Why won't you let me date? I'm grown up now, and I want to date.""

Jared looked solemn as he cornered Yvonne in a secluded spot. His tone was domineering when he said, ""If you want to date, you can only date me. I've protected you for 11 years, and I won't allow you to be with other men‚Äîbecause I like you.""

Her first kiss was innocent and sweet, sending flutters through her heart.

Yvonne and Jared were inseparable in college. Whenever someone mocked him for being an illegitimate child, she would boldly defend him. She even gave him a rare emerald sculpture to help him reclaim his spot in the Ford family.

Later on, the Jamisons went bankrupt, and Yvonne's father passed away. Lily left the villa and moved back to their old house in the countryside, along with Yvonne and her brother, Ian Jamison.

That same year, Jared was brought back to the Ford family by his biological father.

Everyone thought Jared would abandon Yvonne. However, he hugged her‚Äîall sweaty after winning the long-distance race at their college sports meet‚Äîand publicly declared, ""Yvvy is my girlfriend. We'll be together forever until our last breath!""

Yvonne was the happiest back then.

After graduation, she gave up the opportunity to study abroad and chose to join Ford Corporation as Jared's secretary. She stayed by his side, day in and day out, watching as he gradually solidified his place as the heir.

She looked forward to the future, thinking she'd marry him; they'd build a family together and spend the rest of their lives with each other.

It wasn't until Shirley showed up that Yvonne suddenly understood why the person who'd once promised to marry her when he grew up refused to utter the same words again when the time came.

It turned out that Jared had a change of heart.

‚Ä¶

""Come cut the cake with me, Yvonne!"" Shirley smiled sweetly as she came over to invite Yvonne.

Yvonne avoided Shirley's touch. Her gaze and tone were cold and indifferent when she replied, ""No need. Your cake has nothing to do with me.""

Shirley hung her head low, her eyes reddening.

Jared noticed her reaction and quickly came over. His tone was laced with irritation when he said, ""Why are you losing your temper with Shirley? It's her first job. So what if I gave her something she wanted the most?

""You asked to transfer to another department as soon as Shirley joined the secretarial department. Since when did you become so willful?""

Jared wasn't patient enough to wait for Yvonne's reply. He dug out a black card from his wallet and handed it to her. ""That's enough. Stop making a fuss. Take this and get your favorite handbag.""

Yvonne felt a pang in her heart. She couldn't help but chuckle bitterly. He'd clearly known what she wanted, yet he'd never thought of buying it for her.

They'd gone from being childhood sweethearts to barely being able to stand each other. They'd been together for seven years, yet they had no plans to marry. Since they no longer loved each other, it was better to just walk away.

""Let's break up, Jared,"" Yvonne said, her voice quivering and her eyes reddening.

Jared's gaze turned cold. He frowned as he said in anger, ""You're the one who wanted to get married, Yvonne, and now you're asking for a breakup. Are you really making a scene over something so trivial?

""I can't always be the one coaxing you. You're the one who wants to break up, so you'd better not regret it!""

""Alright."" Yvonne's breath slowly evened out.

Behind them, Shirley was gathering everyone for a group photo. Jared ignored Yvonne and left.

As Yvonne left the hotel, her phone buzzed with a notification. She opened it, only to find Shirley's new post. The caption read, ""Today is the happiest day in my life, as I've met the most important person to me.""

In the photo, Shirley was surrounded by her gifts, with the ring given by Jared placed in the middle. She'd even made a point to tag Yvonne in the comments section, thanking her.

Yvonne found it almost laughable. She used to care, but now, she didn't anymore. She even liked Shirley's post.

‚Ä¶

Some time past 3:00 am, the drunken Jared stumbled home. The lights were still on inside, clearly indicating that Yvonne had come back and was waiting for him.

""My head hurts from all the drinking, Yvvy. Come give me a massage."" He collapsed on the couch and fell asleep instantly.

The next morning, Jared was woken up by a call from Frederick Manning, his assistant. ""We have a meeting at 8:00 am, Mr. Ford. It's now 8:30 am‚Äîare you still on your way to the company?""

Jared glanced at the time, frowning due to the massive headache as he wondered why Yvonne hadn't woken him up.

As Jared's secretary and girlfriend, she always made sure to arrange his schedules perfectly without missing any details.

""Yvonne?"" He searched the entire house, only to realize Yvonne wasn't home.

Jared was momentarily stunned before a mocking smile soon took over his face. ""It seems I've really spoiled her. I'll have to ignore her for a few days to get rid of her entitled attitude. She'll return to me naturally then.""

Chapter 2

It was quiet in the villa. After Jared finished showering, he reached out to grab the clothes hanging there as usual, only to find nothing there. In the past, Yvonne would have already prepared and placed his clothes there.

He paused slightly before going into the walk-in closet and putting on a suit. But after trying two ties, he felt that the colors didn't quite match. In the end, he pulled off the tie in frustration and unbuttoned the collar.

He went to the kitchen downstairs, only to notice that breakfast wasn't prepared. So, he headed straight to the office.

‚Ä¶

It was the first time Frederick had seen Jared having breakfast in the president's office in Ford Corporation.

Frederick stood by the side as he reported work updates. ""The morning meeting has been cancelled, Mr. Ford. It's Ms. Ember's first day at work today, and I've arranged for her workstation as instructed. She will be in charge of your work schedules moving forward.""

Jared looked up and happened to see Shirley, who was dressed in a professional skirt suit, outside. His gaze wavered as he recalled that Yvonne used to occupy that spot.

""Alright,"" he replied.

""This is the list of people in charge of the projects department's exhibitions, Mr. Ford,"" Frederick said.

Jared flipped through the document and spotted Yvonne's name on the list.

He said, ""This jewelry exhibition is complicated and challenging. Now that she's been transferred from the secretarial department, is Yvonne trying to prove herself by planning this all on her own? She's lost all sense of self-awareness after getting used to the comforts of being my secretary.""

Jared had completely forgotten that Yvonne was also a graduate from Alphoria College, just like him.

He continued, ""That's fine. Once she fails to complete the project, she'll realize that the secretarial department is where she truly belongs. Leave a place for Yvonne to come back to, Frederick.""

‚Ä¶

After closing six alarm clocks on her phone, Yvonne finally woke up at 10:00 am‚Äîa rare luxury.

She'd spent all night moving her things, called her best friend for help, and hired a housekeeping company to work overtime, just to clean up the villa.

Years ago, Yvonne had wanted to repurchase the villa the Jamison family had auctioned off. However, she'd missed the chance because Jared had unexpectedly changed his schedule.

Later on, he'd bought this beautiful detached villa as an apology gift for her. Although she'd never stayed here, it had been renovated in advance.

It gave Yvonne a huge sense of security to have a house of her own. Apart from this place, she also owned an apartment in the city and a sports car.

Now that she and Jared had broken up, everything she owned would follow her. She certainly wouldn't do something as foolish as sacrificing herself for the sake of moving someone else's heart.

Yvonne was cooking breakfast in the kitchen with her phone on speaker. ""Hello, I no longer want the wedding dress I custom-ordered before. You don't have to deliver it. Just dispose of it, thank you.""

Her best friend, Isabel York, yawned as she walked out. Her throat was parched.

""Morning, I made you some honey water to soothe your throat,"" Yvonne said.

""Thank you, babe."" Last night, Isabel had heard all about how Yvonne had gone from busying herself with wedding preparations to experiencing a sudden, dramatic breakup. She'd cursed Jared for hours until her throat went sore.

Isabel glanced at the time and asked hoarsely, ""Don't you need to go in for work? Or better‚Äîhave the Fords gone bankrupt?""

""I've transferred to the projects department, and we have weekends off. Besides, I'm planning to quit soon."" Yvonne brought over two bowls of instant noodles with fried eggs. She smiled and said, ""My fridge is still empty, so let's make do with this for now.""

""You always cook the best instant noodles."" Isabel took a mouthful of noodles as she said, ""What are your plans after you quit?""

Yvonne glanced at the old family photos on the table. She took a deep breath before replying, ""I couldn't bring myself to touch jewelry design again after Dad passed away. Do you think it's too late for me to pursue my dream again now?""

""Of course not!"" Isabel grabbed her hands tightly. ""The Jamisons were once the spearhead of the jewelry industry in Jeriton City, Yvvy! Your hands were made for design‚Äînot for cooking meals for anyone!""

Yvonne caught her enthusiasm. ""I'm thinking of opening a studio. Are you interested in partnering with me? I don't have enough funds on my own.""

Isabel replied, ""I've been waiting for you to say that. I would've been mad if you hadn't asked me.""

She continued smugly, ""I got half of my ex-husband's assets in the divorce‚ÄîI can even live off the interests comfortably. I'm confident in your design skills, so let me handle the startup funds. If we're doing this, we're going big! I'll start working on things tomorrow.""

Isabel immediately made a call to place an order for champagne and flowers to be delivered.

Then, they popped the champagne ceremoniously. Still in their nightgowns, Yvonne and Isabel held a glass of champagne each and shook hands solemnly.

""Here's to a successful partnership, Ms. Jamison!""

""Let's get rich together, Ms. York!""

Both of them laughed and hugged each other happily.

‚Ä¶

Yvonne returned to the projects department on the 17th floor of Ford Corporation on Monday. Before the meeting started, she overheard gossip about herself in the washroom.

""Do you think Ms. Jamison's transfer to the projects department is a promotion or demotion? I saw that Mr. Ford already has a new secretary now.""

""Of course it's a demotion! No matter how beautiful Ms. Jamison is, she can't hold a candle to a young and supple female college student.""

""So Mr. Ford dumped her? No wonder people were talking about how he dotes on Ms. Ember. You can really see the difference between the old flame and the new.""

Suddenly, Yvonne opened the door of the cubicle and stepped out. The two female employees who were gossiping behind her back immediately lowered their heads in silence.

She said nothing. She couldn't be bothered to defend herself.

‚Ä¶

Yvonne's exhibition proposal was extremely detailed.

The projects department's manager, Wayne Greene, hadn't expected the newly transferred employee to be anything more than a pretty face. But her presentation of the jewelry exhibition was unique, creative, and insightful.

However, he was surprised to see the resignation letter she'd handed over. ""You're planning to quit so soon after you got transferred to the projects department? Do you want to think this through?""

Yvonne replied, ""I'm resigning due to personal reasons. Don't worry, I'll complete the exhibition before I leave.""

She set a countdown reminder on her phone. Her last month on the job was her way of taking responsibility to finish what she'd started.

‚Ä¶

Jared stumbled out of the gathering with unsteady steps. He took his phone out to make a call.

When a car pulled up, Frederick was the one who stepped out of the driver's seat.

Anthony Locke, Jared's best friend, asked in confusion, ""Shouldn't Yvonne be picking you up?""

In the past, Yvonne had always been there at his beck and call.

""Ms. Jamison has left the secretarial department, Mr. Locke,"" Frederick replied.

Jared's friends stared at him in shock. ""Did you fight with Yvonne, Jared? Aren't you guys in the midst of preparing for your wedding?""

Jared's expression twisted in displeasure as he somewhat sobered up. ""She was the one who got unreasonably jealous and wanted to break up. I couldn't be bothered to coax her.""

Anthony said, ""You guys are childhood sweethearts. It's impossible for you to break up over something so trivial."" He stood beside Jared as he joined the latter in smoking. He then smiled and said, ""Let me call Yvonne up and help smooth things over for the two of you.""

When the call got connected, he put it on speaker. ""Jared is drunk, Yvonne. Can you come over and pick him up? I'll send you the address.""

After a brief moment of silence, Yvonne replied calmly, ""That's not within my job scope. You should call someone else instead.""

She ended the call immediately, rendering everyone speechless.

Jared exhaled a puff of smoke and chuckled. He complained bitterly, ""Aren't you just making things hard for yourself? Yvonne broke up with me because she wanted me to coax her. If you call her, she'll definitely think I'm trying to get back with her. You're just making things worse!""

Shane Thompson pressed on tentatively, ""Aren't you worried that Yvonne is actually angry, Jared? Even if she gets jealous, it's because she cares for you. You should just coax her.""

""I refuse to! She's the one who's being dramatic over nothing this time. Once she calms down, I'll have her come and coax me instead,"" Jared replied.

""Just flaunt it as much as you like, Jared. Everyone knows Yvonne won't marry anyone but you. She's already preparing for the wedding, and you‚Äîher groom‚Äîare right here. She'll definitely come back and find you!""

Jared was confident that Yvonne would never leave him.

‚Ä¶

Meanwhile, Yvonne received a text from Lily. ""Yvvy, I've arranged a blind date for you tomorrow at 7:30 pm at Brisa Cafe. You'll be free, right?""

Yvonne replied, ""Yes, I'll be there on time.""

Chapter 3

It was Yvonne's first time attending a blind date.

To show her respect, she washed her hair as soon as she got home from work. She then changed into a light blue fringed dress and put on a light touch of makeup before heading out.

Just as she got out of her car outside the cafe, she received a voice message from Lily.

Lily said, ""I've checked for you, Yvvy. His name is Harold Quillan‚Äîhe's 28 and about five feet and ten inches tall. He works in the marketing department of an international company and makes more than 50 thousand per month.

""He's average-looking, neither fat nor thin, and has an introverted personality. Simon said he's going over after work, and the signal is a white rose on the table.""

Yvonne couldn't help but laugh. Not only did Lily not give her a photo, but she even wanted Yvonne to look for a signal.

The cafe wasn't too packed at this hour. A man in a suit was sitting by the window, with a white rose in the glass of water on his table.

Yvonne felt slightly embarrassed. She took a deep breath before walking over. ""Hello, I'm Yvonne Jamison.""

The man had been lounging in his seat as he browsed the stock market on his tablet. His fingers paused when he heard her introduction, and then he slowly looked up.

Yvonne froze upon meeting his gaze. The man before her wore a tailored suit and sat there with an undeniable air of sophistication. His deep-set eyes held a hint of aloofness, yet there was a subtle, restrained intensity in his gaze.

Was this what Lily meant by ""average-looking""? This man's appearance was clearly superior no matter how one looked at him.

Yvonne realized she'd lost her composure. The man had been staring at her in silence. Could she have mistaken him for her blind date partner? ""Sorry, are you here for the blind date tonight?""

Samuel Hover subtly lowered his gaze and smiled faintly. ""Yes. Please have a seat, Ms. Jamison.""

As soon as Yvonne sat down, she noticed the half-empty coffee cup on the table. She then glanced at the time, noting that it wasn't 7:30 pm‚Äîtheir meetup time‚Äîyet. She wondered if she was late.

Samuel noticed her actions and quickly said, ""I came earlier. What would you like to drink, Ms. Jamison?""

Yvonne wasn't expecting him to be this attentive. ""I'll have a look at the menu.""

She ordered a mocha and a slice of cake. It was unnervingly quiet.

Yvonne wasn't sure what to talk about on a blind date, and the man before her wasn't inclined to speak either. She could only sense his uneasiness from his uneven breaths. It was probably also his first time attending a blind date, and he was equally nervous.

She recalled Lily saying that he was introverted, so she wondered if she should get the ball rolling.

Yvonne glanced at the stock market on the tablet and asked, ""I've heard that you just came back from abroad. How have you been adjusting? You must be busy at work.""

""Work is fine. I'm just adjusting to the time difference‚ÄîI've been craving coffee in the evenings."" Samuel's breath evened out eventually. His gaze met hers‚Äîcalm, without intrusive curiosity. He maintained a gentle, polite demeanor.

""What do you do for work now, Ms. Jamison?"" he then asked.

Yvonne was surprised Lily hadn't told him of her situation.

She smiled and replied, ""I'm in charge of exhibition planning in the projects department. This is my business card, but I've just resigned‚ÄîI'm planning to set up a studio.""

Samuel took Yvonne's business card, looked down at it, and lightly traced her name with his fingertip. ""I'm sorry, I didn't bring my business card today.""

""It's alright.""

Her gaze was suddenly drawn to his long fingers. Only then did Yvonne realize that the watch on his wrist was a limited edition worth millions from a high-end brand. Even the suit he wore was a custom-tailored Armani suit.

It seemed a little different from what Lily had told her. She wondered if he came from a wealthy family but didn't feel comfortable asking him about it.

At that moment, the waitstaff brought Yvonne's coffee and cake. The table was full of things.

As Yvonne lowered her head, she caught a glimpse of Samuel picking up an ashtray. Albeit surprised, she politely said, ""It's alright.""

He met her gaze. ""I don't smoke.""

It turned out he was just naturally putting aside the items. Yvonne couldn't help but smile and nodded. ""Thank you.""

She really hated secondhand smoke. Her hair and clothes would often smell of smoke whenever she headed home, so she had to wash her hair before bed. It annoyed her to no end that she had to dry her hair in the middle of the night.

""You mentioned that you're planning to set up a studio, Ms. Jamison. What is it for?"" Samuel asked.

Yvonne replied, ""I'll be working on my childhood dream‚Äîjewelry design.""

She'd expected this blind date to be incredibly awkward. He was slow to warm up, but once they started talking, he was the one asking all the questions‚Äîand they were all polite inquiries.

Samuel noticed his phone on the table lit up. He frowned before saying, ""I have something to take care of, Ms. Jamison. I'll be taking my leave now.""

""Alright, let's add each other on WhatsApp then,"" Yvonne said.

She wasn't expecting his profile photo to be of a kitten, and his name was just a simple ""H"". She saved his contact as ""Harold (blind date)"".

Samuel stood up and extended his hand. ""It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Jamison. Let's grab a meal next time and continue our conversation.""

Yvonne looked up and met his gaze. As they shook hands, she could feel his grip tighten briefly before loosening. ""Alright, see you.""

It was probably the usual procedure for blind dates. They wouldn't necessarily meet again.

A black car limousine was parked by the street outside the cafe. ""Did someone‚Ä¶ just hit on you earlier, Mr. Hover?""

""It's someone I haven't seen in a long time."" Samuel tucked Yvonne's business card away before he got into the car.

‚Ä¶

In the president's office at Ford Corporation, Frederick noticed that Jared hadn't been wearing a tie these past few days. It seemed like he wasn't in a good mood either.

After a meeting, Jared dialed the internal line for the secretarial department. ""Bring me a cup of coffee.""

Shirley stepped in wearing a professional skirt suit. She couldn't take her eyes off Jared, who looked captivating as he handled documents behind his desk.

She walked closer and bent down, intentionally letting one button of her shirt collar pop open. Jared would definitely notice it from his angle, yet he didn't look up.

""Oh my!"" Shirley pretended to lose her balance and spilled the coffee.

Jared quickly swept the documents away. There was a trace of anger in his gaze when he finally looked up at her. ""Being my secretary is more than just looks, Shirley‚Äîyour skills matter too. Don't make this kind of rookie mistake in the office.""

In the past, Yvonne had been efficient when handling her work and always set her personal emotions aside. She was definitely his right hand at work.

Shirley's bashful expression froze. She was surprised, as Jared usually enjoyed her clumsy mistakes and would playfully tease her.

""I'm sorry,"" she said with her head hung low, tears brimming in her eyes.

""I'm not scolding you. I'm just reminding you to do your work."" Jared softened his tone and continued, ""Button up your shirt and bring me another cup of coffee.""

""Okay.""

Shirley returned with a new cup of coffee and some biscuits soon after. ""I've bought the best Blue Mountain No. 1 coffee beans‚Äîfreshly ground and brewed‚Äîand paired it with pine nut cookies.""

The coffee had a wonderful scent. Jared took an expectant sip, only to frown and place the cup down. Somehow, the taste couldn't be compared to the coffee Yvonne used to make for him.

""Are there no other coffee beans left in the break room?"" he asked.

""There's none left."" Shirley couldn't understand how Jared was still dissatisfied even when she'd used the most expensive coffee beans.

Jared frowned before gesturing for her to take her leave. He'd been feeling inexplicably tired and irritated without his usual cup of coffee to freshen him up in the past few afternoons. Somehow, he craved Yvonne's coffee.

He wasn't sure what was going on with him.

After a while, Jared dialed Yvonne's number for the first time since that night. The call soon connected.

He said, ""Shirley hasn't been feeling well these few days, Yvonne. The position in the secretarial department is temporarily vacant, and I couldn't get anyone to fill it.""

Jared was confident. This was a great opportunity for Yvonne to return to him‚Äîthere was no way she would refuse it.

He continued, ""Why don't you temporarily transfer back to the secretarial department to fill in for a couple of days?""

Chapter 4

The other end of the line was silent for a moment. Jared's face broke into a smile as he waited for Yvonne's eager agreement.

However, an unfamiliar female voice stammered in reply, ""I-Is this Mr. Ford? Yvonne forwarded this number to the office. She said she doesn't want to be disturbed during work. When she's back, I'll inform her that you tried to reach her.""

Jared was at a loss for words.

His phone never once rang even as working hours ended. He then took the elevator to the 17th floor.

Wayne hurried over to greet Jared. ""What brings you to the projects department, Mr. Ford?""

In the past, Jared would always make a call whenever something came up. He never came in person.

""I was passing by and just thought I'd stop by."" Jared glanced inside but didn't see Yvonne.

Wayne keenly caught it and said, ""The projects department is understaffed, and the venue and guests for the jewelry exhibition still aren't confirmed. Ms. Jamison has been handling everything herself. Do you need me to call and have her come back?""

A fleeting look of barely noticeable disappointment flashed in Jared's eyes. His face immediately fell. ""Who said I was looking for her? Also, she's no longer my secretary‚ÄîI have no need for her now.""

Looking at his retreating back, Wayne couldn't understand why Jared had come over personally.

‚Ä¶

Yvonne wanted to make a cup of coffee before her meeting the next day. Just as she stepped into the break room, she saw Shirley rummaging through items with her name on them.

""What are you doing?"" she asked, her voice cold.

Shirley shyly explained, ""You know I'm now responsible for Mr. Ford's well-being, Yvonne. Even though he never tells me off, I'm worried that I might affect his work if I don't do well enough.""

""What's that got to do with me?"" Yvonne glanced at the coffee beans spilled across the table and coldly reminded, ""Even if I didn't teach you, don't you know the most basic manners, Ms. Ember? This is the projects department. If you need to do something, please do it at the secretarial department.""

The commotion in the break room caught the attention of their nosy colleagues, who gathered around to watch.

""Are you still angry, Yvonne?"" Tears filled Shirley's eyes immediately as she shifted uneasily in place. She choked out a sob and said, ""I'm here as a secretary just to repay Mr. Ford's kindness for sponsoring me. I never wanted to take your place.

""I'll apologize to you with this cup of coffee, Yvonne. After all, you've been making coffee for Mr. Ford all these years‚Äîno one knows his taste better than you. So please, teach me how to brew it.""

She then rushed over with a freshly brewed pot of hot coffee. Yvonne stepped aside to avoid her.

Shirley ended up bumping into the table and knocking over the coffee pot. The hot liquid scalded the back of her hand, causing a large patch of skin to redden immediately. ""Ouch!""

""Shirley!""

All the rubbernecking colleagues immediately stepped back when Jared showed up.

He rushed over and grabbed Shirley's hand, running it under cold water. Upon seeing her tremble in pain in his arms, he frowned and said, ""Your burn is too serious. I'll bring you to the hospital.""

""It's fine. I was being too careless‚Äîit's not Yvonne's fault."" She started sobbing as she explained, ""I just want to learn how to brew a good pot of coffee, Mr. Ford. I'm just too clumsy!""

""I know you're doing this for me, Shirley."" Jared softly comforted Shirley. He then turned to look at Yvonne, who remained indifferent to what was happening.

He grew annoyed and said, ""Is this how you act when Shirley comes to you for advice? Don't bring your personal emotions into the office, Yvonne.

""You're the one who chose to leave the secretarial department, so don't think about going back after you chose to stay in the projects department. The secretarial department has no place for you anymore!""

Yvonne didn't feel angry even as she watched Jared help Shirley out.

What a well-played scene. Shirley was using the same old tricks again. Did she really think Yvonne would care?

""Wait,"" Yvonne suddenly said.

Jared stopped in his tracks, throwing a condescending look at her. ""Have you realized your mistake? If you can correct it and get along with Shirley, you might be able to transfer back.""

""I just want to remind Ms. Ember."" Yvonne smiled and pointed at the break room. ""She should clean this up properly so it doesn't affect our department's use of the space.""

Her words angered Jared. ""Remember what you just said, Yvonne!""

He'd initially wanted to offer Yvonne a way out so she could transfer back to the secretarial department. But since she didn't appreciate it, he'd see just how long it would take before she came back crying in regret.

Jared barked, ""Call the cleaning staff to clean up!""

It wasn't until both Jared and Shirley left that Yvonne's colleagues from the projects department gathered around, curious to see her reaction.

Yvonne took a deep breath and turned to address the crowd. Waving her phone, she said, ""Since we can't use the break room, I'll buy everyone coffee for the afternoon.""

Once everyone had their takeaway coffee, Yvonne called for a meeting. There were six members in her team for the jewelry exhibition. They were currently discussing the guest list.

Someone suggested, ""We could invite Professor Jean Weedle. She's well-known both abroad and in Jeriton City. Having both rising and top-tier designers on the same stage would be the exhibition's biggest selling point, and it fits perfectly with our 'Legacy' theme.""

Yvonne nodded in approval. ""I'll personally extend an invitation to Professor Weedle.""

‚Ä¶

Yvonne arrived at Jean's residence, bringing a fruit basket with her. She sat waiting in the living room.

Upon seeing an elegantly dressed middle-aged woman coming downstairs, she stood up politely. ""Hello, Professor Weedle. I'm Andrew Jamison's daughter, Yvonne. Do you still remember me?""

""I remember you. Mr. Jamison mentioned that his daughter has a talent for design,"" Jean said with a kind smile.

""I'm here on behalf of Ford Corporation to extend an invitation to you."" Yvonne handed over the proposal she'd brought and explained the purpose of her visit.

""I know you've been having some trouble with your eyes recently and even turned down the National Museum Exhibition. I do have a personal reason for inviting you, though‚Äîsome pieces in the exhibition are your works,"" she said.
