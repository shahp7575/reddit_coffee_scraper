The world dictates your steps and you become pious,

You worry about them absconding, and rain heavy emotions.

…

But what’s the real tragedy?

You worry about them staying,

As they are, or worse, worse than they are.

And you’re in a pickle, 

Chary of the truth,

But wary of the lies.

…

Aren’t you a perfect disciple?

Always dreaming of a fuller life—

With those who torment,

And you dream of a life— cortisol-free,

Even if it’s giving you a high.

…

Contradiction is your name, because—

No other can be picked out to fit your fame.

1j7oda4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalguard/comments/1j7oda4/i_fell_in_love_on_the_nyarng_prison_mission_tldr/,I fell in love on the NYARNG prison mission —TLDR at the end,"I know what you’re thinking … I know. But slow your roll, I did NOT fall in love with an inmate rather as you might expect. 

No, this love interest was completely UNFORESEEN. No amount of METTTC, OACOK, or MDMP analysis could’ve prepared my little cadet self for the type of woman I was about to encounter at one of the most hellish places on earth. 

Day 3: I’m sitting in the CP doing very important pretend junior officer things ( I was the defacto Coffee Bitch for officers and all VIPs) and that’s when I saw her. A 5’4” dark haired Air Force tech sergeant (more like tech mommy). At least 15 years my senior. Our eyes lock, to my surprise, she approaches me and asks “where can I find your commander?”.  I blush and in my manly officer voice I advise her “stand fast sergeant he will back shortly” — my Professor of military science would’ve been so proud.  

She was clearly confused by the circle on my chest and asked what my rank was. I jokingly said “weellll you see I’m actually not really a person, but if you are going to pretend I exist, my rank is cadet”. She mentioned something about West Point which I thought was weird because not every cadet (especially those in the guard) go to a service academy…. I would’ve called her retarded but she was pretty and Air Force so I let it go.  

Fast forward a week and half: we’ve been working together for a while and the air force people were actually some of the nicest people to me.  They actually acknowledged my existence but not tech mommy. She would always pick on me… here are a couple examples (there are many more). 

1) I was trying to get the attention of a group of soldiers and raised my voice since they didn’t hear me and she said “sssssshhh you don’t need to yell, why are you being loud?”.

2) A group of NCOs came into the office and were shooting the shit and to fit in, I laughed. Her response was “wow that was really awkward. Are you autistic?” (Yes but she doesn’t need to know that).

3) “Hey since you’re not doing anything you should get me a cup of coffee” — I did so but not because I needed to listen to her. It was just a nice thing to do. 

After a few days of this naturally I was getting aggravated. “why does this beautiful enlisted woman think she can talk to me this way?” … “it’s honestly kind of hot … like I’m not against it”. 

**Then came Thursday** and I had enough! I door-dashed some Burger King because after 2 weeks of prison food I was starting to get suicidal. I’m chowing down, mouth closed, but I’m naturally a loud chewer. 

A SFC is sitting at one end of the table and she’s right next to me. Apparently she’s side eyeing me as I eat my burger and SFC goes “why are you mean mugging him?”. 

She goes onto say that I’m the loudest chewer in the world and that I should try not to chew so loudly. Furious but also a little wild 😝 up by her comment, I swallow fast. **I put my burger down and stand up, “if you ever tell me what to do again, if you ever even make fun of me again I WILL HAVE YOU BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES!!!! Well not right now but when I get my commission!!!! You do realize I outrank you sergeant? Don’t you?”**

She replied: “You know you’re really cute when you talk like that. Do you want to take your seat now”?

My heart skipped a beat. I felt things I haven’t felt since a 40 something year old tinder date let me call her mommy for the night. 

As I took my seat I came to the realization that I was in fact in love with this very rude airforce technical sergeant. She’s gone now… I wish I told her how I felt before she left. 

To this day I still don’t know what it was. She casted this spell on me. She emasculated me in every way.  She made me feel small…. She made me feel useless and I just surrendered to her power every day. 

**TLDR: I fell in love with an airforce technical sergeant that treated me like her boy toy, how do I find her? And is this considered fraternization—I don’t want my PMS to disenroll me**

1j7ocqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j7ocqe/my_23f_deceased_brothers_friend_25m_is_making_me/,My (23F) deceased brother’s friend (25M) is making me uncomfortable,"When I was 16F, my brother (who was 18) died in a car accident. It was brutal. He was my only sibling. He was popular. He had a girlfriend and a large group of friends, most of which were from the same group- they were tight knit.
My brother was a kind person, and had also manage to find friends in other walks of life, some of which he met in detention at school, some of which had no friends of their own- they were not apart of his “popular” group at school, so he hung out with them separately- for drinks, or lunch, or coffee- outside of school hours.

This year in November, it will be eight years since he passed. Recently, one of his “other”  friends has started to display some concerning behaviours.  
Although it has been eight years, those to have lost a sibling or a child know the pain that my family feels. Some days we get on okay. Other days it feels like at the moment we found out he was gone all over again. 
To sum up, this person 25M wasn’t close with my brother. He is a sweet boy who took classes with my brother, texted my brother, maybe even caught up with him once or twice. But I feel horrible in saying- he wasn’t “known” as a friend of his to my family or myself until after his passing. But for the past year, or so, he has sent me concerning messages. Messages on how he “sees my brother infront of him” and how he wants to see me in person for coffee or dinner to tell me the things my brother has told him in spirit. 
After my brother’s passing my family and I saw ladybirds as a symbol of him being around us. This person has now had a large ladybird tattooed on his arm. It sounds horrible without context, but he has been calling me and messaging me at all hours of the night, even at 2 am when my partner and I are sleep in our bed, asking if I have time for a phone call to talk about what my brother has been telling him. 
This makes me uncomfortable. But I must say I am not the kind of person to turn-away someone who I personally see, as in need of psychological help. It sounds wrong to say. I appreciate him thinking of my brother in this way- even going as far to get a tattoo in honour of him, but coming from someone who barely knew him, this is concerning. 
He has found my parents on Facebook- also messaging them asking to catch up for coffee or drink to “talk”.  Although my parents are adults and can make their own decisions, I feel protective- I don’t want them to sit down and listen to what I personally see as spiritual delusions. They are empathetic people, and I know this would upset them deeply, not due to my brother’s death, but due to a smart young man rambling on about his psychic abilities to see my brother talking to him. They care a lot for all people who knew him, who he loved- so to see one of them in this state would be confronting to them.
I am not a skeptic when it comes to the spiritual world, but if you knew all of the messages this person has sent me, you would see how I see it- he is not well, he does not sleep. He posts on social media about ladybirds and seeing my brother in them, constantly. He now has people who didn’t know my brother whatsoever sending him photos of ladybirds. He tells them *insert my brother’s name* is with them- people who didn’t know him whatsoever, he screenshots it and puts it on his story. He is making some kind of spiritual icon out of my brother and it makes me uncomfortable and upset.
I know, I need to tell him how I feel, how I feel his, turning my brother into some kind of martyr that he wasn’t, perhaps some of you will read this, and think that I should feel honoured or happy that someone is carrying on his legacy. But I am not comfortable with the fact that there are people out there, who didn’t know him who do not know us now see ladybirds and send them to this person and say that he’s with them when this person himself didn’t even know him well at all… A month ago, I found this person’s sister on Facebook and messaged her with my concerns for his mental health and obsession over my deceased brother. She was so empathetic and lovely and assured me that they were well aware of his situation as a family. I asked that my message to her remain anonymous as I would hate for him to think that I was “snitching” on him for something he clearly cannot help mentally- but the phone calls and messages have only persisted since.
I care for this boy, and I cannot help that- I care for him in the way I care for all the people who knew my beautiful brother. Due to my grief, I feel I cannot block him and I’ll wait to see his name on the news or in an article saying he took his life or something of the sort. But I cannot continue to play into this delusion, or tell him that we will catch up soon even though I truly do not want to, as I know what he will try to tell me will upset me. Any advice on what to tell him in a kind, caring way would be so appreciated.. i am at a loss currently. Is there anything I can do to put a stop to this and help him?

The waitress—her name was Lily—let me crash in the back room of the diner. Nothing fancy. Just a cot, a first-aid kit, and a space heater that rattled every few minutes. But it was quiet. No black SUVs. No satellite pings. No Carter.

For now.

I didn’t sleep much. When I did, the nightmares came.

Not about monsters. Those were easy. Predictable. Things with claws and teeth and ancient, hungering eyes.

No, the worst nightmares were about me.

The way my skin shifted if I wasn’t paying attention.

The way my bones felt like they weren’t settled right.

The way I could still hear the Revenant’s last words in my head.

“That thing inside you? It’s waking up.”

I woke up sweating, my body aching in ways that weren’t normal. Like something inside me was fighting to take shape.

I stared at my hands in the dim light, flexing them experimentally.

The skin felt too tight. Like it wasn’t really mine anymore.

“You were never meant to be the hero, 18 C. You were meant to be a weapon.”

I clenched my fists. Breathed.

If I was going to war with The Division, I needed a plan.

Two days later the diner was empty except for Lily. She leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching me with that same quiet curiosity.

“You’re not just some guy on the run, are you?” she said.

I paused, mid-bite. “Why do you say that?”

She motioned vaguely to my side—where my wounds had completely healed overnight. No stitches. No scars.

“I’m good with first aid,” she said. “Not ‘miracle-healing’ good.”

I sighed, putting my fork down. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”

She gave a half-smile. “Try me.”

I met her eyes. Searching.

Something told me she’d seen things too.

I exhaled. “The government turned me into something that shouldn’t exist. Now they want me dead.”

She didn’t flinch. Didn’t laugh.

Instead, she asked, “What kind of something?”

That was the real question, wasn’t it?

Because I still didn’t know.

I’d fought creatures that defied logic, things that weren’t just predators—they were wrong. I’d burned them. Buried them. Ripped them apart.

But now?

Now I wasn’t sure if I was the hunter anymore.

Or just another thing in the dark.

Lily studied me, her expression unreadable. Then she grabbed a worn leather notebook from under the counter and slid it over.

“I’ve been keeping track of things,” she said. “Disappearances. Government cover-ups. Weird shit.”

I opened the notebook.

The pages were filled with newspaper clippings, grainy photos, handwritten notes in the margins.

And halfway through, one entry stopped me cold.

“Division Outpost 3—Montana. Abandoned in 2019 after failed containment of subject.”

I swallowed hard.

Because I knew that place.

It was where I killed the Skin Man. My first mission.

But according to Lily’s notes, the outpost wasn’t abandoned.

It had gone dark.

Something was still there.

And if The Division had left it behind?

That meant they were afraid of it.

Lily must’ve seen the look on my face. “What is it?”

I turned the notebook toward her, tapping the entry.

“This might be where I start.”

She hesitated. “You sure about that?”

No.

Not at all.

But if I was going to war with The Division, I needed to know what I was.

And maybe—just maybe—Montana had the answers.

Montana was colder than I remembered.

The wind howled through the trees, carrying the scent of frozen pine and something else. Something rancid, buried beneath the natural smells of the forest.

Rot.

I tightened my grip on the steering wheel, my stolen truck rattling over the frost-bitten dirt road. The headlights barely cut through the thick fog rolling over the ground. This deep in the wilderness, there were no streetlights, no signs of civilization. Just me, the dark, and the growing sense that I was heading into something very, very wrong.

Division Outpost 3 had been classified as “abandoned” four years ago. No records, no debriefs, no retrieval teams. Just gone. Like it had been erased from existence after a few months.

And now, I was going to find out why.

The closer I got, the worse it felt.

That static hum at the base of my skull. The pressure in my ribs, like something was squeezing my lungs from the inside. I’d felt it before—on missions, right before something unnatural happened.

I wasn’t alone out here.

Something was watching.

Waiting.

I reached the clearing at 2:13 AM. Killed the engine. Stepped out into the cold.

And then, for the first time, I saw it.

The outpost.

The building loomed in the darkness, a skeletal husk of metal and concrete. Most of the structure had collapsed in on itself—rusted beams jutting into the sky like broken ribs, walls stripped bare, the remains of The Division’s insignia barely visible on the entrance.

The whole place smelled wrong.

Like old blood. Like mildew and decay.

Like something had been living here.

I adjusted my gear—handgun at my hip, combat knife strapped to my thigh, a heavy-duty flashlight in my grip. A rifle wouldn’t do me much good here. Not against what I was expecting.

Not against what was expecting me.

I took a slow step forward.

Then another.

The silence was suffocating. Not even the wind stirred as I approached the main entrance, its reinforced doors rusted and twisted outward.

Not broken.

Blown open.

Something inside me tightened. My breath fogged in the air as I raised my flashlight, stepping over the threshold.

The beam cut through the dark.

Dust motes drifted lazily. Footsteps, long faded, were smeared across the floor in old, dark stains.

And then—faintly—the walls breathed.

The air shifted. The scent of mildew thickened.

I turned, scanning the entrance hall.

No movement. No signs of life.

Just that feeling.

Like I wasn’t in control of this space.

Like something else was.

I moved deeper inside, boots crunching against debris, the quiet weight of the building settling over me like a held breath. The deeper I went, the worse it got.

This wasn’t just an abandoned outpost.

This was a grave.

A desk was overturned in what used to be the security station. I nudged it with my boot—spilled coffee, ancient paperwork, the remains of a handgun melted down to slag.

What the hell happened here?

The lights had been shattered. The security doors twisted like they’d been wrenched apart by hands stronger than they should’ve been.

I checked the terminals. Dead. Fried from the inside out.

Whatever went down here, The Division lost control.

And then, from somewhere deeper in the building—
A sound.

A wet, dragging shuffle.

I snapped my flashlight toward the noise.

Nothing.

The hallway ahead yawned open, stretching into the dark like a gaping throat. The air was thick, damp. My instincts screamed at me to turn back.

I ignored them.

Step.

Step.

The beam of light flickered over peeling walls, broken doors. Blood stains, faded with time. A message scrawled across the wall in something brown and flaking.

IT’S STILL HERE.

My breath slowed as I tried to remain silent.

I kept moving.

Ahead, the hallway split. Two paths.

Left—leading into what had once been the holding cells.

Right—toward the labs.

I hesitated.

The noise had come from the left.

But something in my gut told me the real answers were in the labs.

I tightened my grip on my knife, exhaling slow.

I ignored the sound from the holding cells.

Whatever was down there—whatever was still alive—it wasn’t what I came for.

I turned right, moving toward the labs.

The deeper I went, the worse it got.

The air was humid, thick with the scent of mold, blood, and something chemical. My boots squelched against the floor, the concrete damp underfoot. Water leaked from the ceiling in slow, steady drips, pooling in uneven puddles. The whole place felt… rotted.

Like the building itself had been infected.

The hallway ended at a reinforced door. Unlike the others, this one hadn’t been torn open. It had been sealed.

A security terminal flickered weakly beside it, the screen cracked, but still functional.

I exhaled slowly, pressing my palm against the biometric scanner.

For a long second, nothing happened.

Then—

BEEP.

ACCESS GRANTED.

The locks hissed. The door groaned, splitting open an inch at a time.

Behind it—

The lab.

It was massive.

Rows of shattered containment tanks lined the walls, glass shards glittering beneath the sickly overhead lights. The smell of chemicals and decomposing flesh hit me like a sledgehammer, thick enough to choke on.

But it was the corpses that stopped me cold.

At least a dozen bodies were slumped against the far wall, their uniforms blackened, melted into their skin.

I moved closer.

The damage wasn’t from bullets or blades. It was biological.

Like their flesh had been dissolved from the inside out.

I crouched, inspecting the nearest body.

The skin was bloated, distended—like something had swollen beneath it before bursting. The face was frozen in a grotesque scream, the mouth stretched too wide, teeth splintered from the force.

Something crawled beneath the skin of their arms, hollow tunnels where veins should have been.

I exhaled slowly, forcing my pulse to steady.

Whatever they were working on here…

It got out.

I stood, stepping carefully around the remains, scanning the lab for anything useful.

At the far end of the room, a secondary door hung partially open, leading into an observation chamber.

I pushed through.

The walls were lined with monitors, dead now—except one.

A single screen still flickered weakly, looping grainy security footage.

I stepped closer, watching.

The timestamp read 4 years ago.

The footage was distorted, glitching.

At first, it was just the lab—empty, still.

Then—motion.

A figure stumbled into frame.

A scientist.

His face was contorted in agony, veins bulging black against his skin. He clawed at his throat, gagging, retching—

And then, his body convulsed.

His stomach bulged.

Something moved beneath his flesh.

His ribs cracked—splintered outward.

And then—

He split open.

It didn’t burst. It didn’t explode.

He peeled.

His skin stretched, tearing in slow, deliberate ribbons.

And something pulled itself free.

Tall. Too tall.

Skeletal, with limbs that twisted the wrong way.

Its skin was translucent, veined with something dark, something writhing.

And its face—

No.

Not a face.

A hollow cavity, stretching open like a second mouth, lined with wet, pulsing tendrils.

The scientist didn’t scream.

Not after his lungs had been hollowed out.

The footage glitched.

And then—

The lab was full of them.

More than one. More than dozens.

The video cut out.

I stood there, staring at the blank screen, my breath slow, controlled.

The Division didn’t abandon this outpost.

They sealed it.

Because whatever they created…

They couldn’t kill it.

A new sound rippled through the air.

Dripping.

Not water.

Something thicker.

I turned.

And saw it.

Hanging from the ceiling, its too-long limbs pressed against the walls, its skin quivering like a heat mirage.

It had been watching me.

Waiting.

I raised my gun.

It moved.

Not lunging. Not attacking.

Flowing.

Its arms stretched, its bones shifting, rearranging beneath its translucent flesh.

And then—

It whispered.

Not in words. Not in any language I could understand.

But in memories.

My memories.

Waking up in a sterile lab.

Hearing my own bones break.

Feeling my body become something else.

I staggered back, my skull thrumming with something deep, something buried.

The thing twisted its head, watching me.

And I knew.

I knew.

This wasn’t just another experiment.

It was connected to me.

The whispers grew louder.

The thing lowered itself, its face—**or what passed for a face—**stretching open wider.

And for the first time, I felt something else inside me wake up.

A hunger.

A knowing.

Not fear.

Recognition.

I clenched my teeth.

The whispers clawed at the edges of my mind.

Memories that weren’t mine.

Pain that wasn’t mine.

Hunger that wasn’t mine.

The thing slithered lower, its limbs elongating, distorting. Its hollow maw trembled, sucking in the air between us like it could taste me.

It thought I was the same as it.

It thought I would remember.

I gritted my teeth, tightening my grip on the knife at my side.

No.

I wasn’t like this thing.

I wasn’t a monster.

And I was going to prove it.

The moment my stance shifted, it lunged.

It was fast. Unnaturally so. A blur of motion and whispering flesh. Its arms snapped forward—too long, too many joints, tipped with spindly, needle-like fingers reaching for my throat.

I dodged.

My body moved before I could think. Before instinct. Before fear.

Faster than I should have been able to.

I twisted, bringing the knife up in a vicious arc. The blade met flesh.

And the thing screamed.

The sound wasn’t just noise. It was a psychic assault. A thousand voices crying out in unison, overlapping, merging, breaking apart.

I hit the ground hard, my vision blurring, my skull rattling with something deeper than pain.

It wasn’t just attacking my body.

It was trying to unmake me.

I dug in.

Forced my mind to stay my own.

And for the first time, I pushed back.

The thing staggered, its shriek cutting off suddenly. It twitched, convulsing—like it wasn’t used to something resisting.

Like it wasn’t used to losing.

I didn’t give it time to recover.

I shot forward, knife gripped tight, and buried the blade into its gut.

The flesh rippled, sucking around the wound.

Not healing.

Absorbing.

I let go of the knife, grabbing its arm instead, and ripped.

The limb tore away with a wet, sickening pop.

Black, sludgy veins pulsed where the arm had been, twitching, trying to knit themselves back together.

Not this time.

I grabbed a broken pipe from the ground and drove it through the thing’s chest.

This time, the scream was real.

It spasmed, its body losing cohesion, rippling like something between liquid and flesh.

The whispers became static.

And then—silence.

The creature shuddered once, its twisted face locking onto mine.

And in that final moment—

It looked afraid.

Then, it collapsed in on itself.

The body didn’t decay. It didn’t melt.

It simply ceased to be.

I stood there, my breath heavy, hands slick with something that wasn’t blood.

I looked down at myself.

Still human.

My hands were shaking—but they were mine.

My skin didn’t crawl. My bones didn’t shift.

I hadn’t given in.

I hadn’t become something else.

I was still in control.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my pulse to steady.

Then I turned back to the monitors.

I wasn’t done here.

The Division thought this place was a graveyard.

But I knew better now.

This wasn’t just an abandoned outpost.

This was proof.

Proof that they didn’t understand what they created.

Proof that I wasn’t their experiment anymore.

I took one last look at the place.

Then, without another word—

I left.

I drove through the night, pushing the stolen truck to its limits. The road blurred under the headlights, a winding stretch of nothingness cutting through Montana’s endless dark.

I had a plan.

Find Carter.

Confront him.

Make him tell me everything.

But I should’ve known The Division was already ahead of me.

The moment I hit the outskirts of a dead mining town, the world exploded.

A thunderous boom split the air, and the truck lurched sideways, tires shredding as something tore through the axles. The steering locked. The windshield cracked as I slammed against the wheel, metal shrieking as the vehicle skidded into a ditch.

Then—silence.

For a split second, nothing moved.

Then came the floodlights.

Blinding. Overwhelming.

I reached for my gun.

Too late.

A figure stepped forward, his shadow cutting through the glare.

Carter.

Behind him, a full kill squad.

No containment teams. No hazmat crews.

Just elimination.

I barely had time to roll out of the truck before the shock round hit me.

Lightning tore through my body, white-hot and merciless. My muscles locked, every nerve igniting at once. I hit the ground hard, my limbs refusing to move, my vision pulsing at the edges.

Boots crunched against the gravel.

Then Carter’s voice—calm, patient.

“You should’ve stayed hidden, 18C.”

A second later, the world went black.

I woke up strapped to a chair.

The room was cold—not just temperature cold, but sterile. Lifeless. Metal walls. A single light overhead. No windows. No exits.

Across from me, Carter stood, adjusting his cufflinks like this was just another meeting.

I tested the restraints. Reinforced titanium. No bending out of this one.

Carter sighed. “You just couldn’t help yourself, could you?”

I stared at him. “Go to hell.”

His smile was thin. “You almost made it. A clean break. But then you had to start asking questions. Digging up things better left buried.”

I flexed my fingers. My body was still sluggish—dampeners, probably. They’d learned from last time.

Carter pulled a folder from the table and slid it in front of me.

“Project Revenant was never just about creating a better soldier,” he said.

I didn’t answer.

He opened the folder. Photos. MRI scans. My own face, my own body—but changed.

Denser bone structure. Increased metabolic efficiency.

Brain activity that didn’t register as fully human anymore.

He tapped one page with a gloved finger.

“You weren’t the first success, 18C.” His eyes darkened. “But you’re the first one who still thinks he’s human.”

I swallowed, jaw clenched.

He leaned forward. “Do you know why we didn’t kill you outright?”

I didn’t answer.

Carter exhaled. “Because you still have a purpose.”

He stepped back, motioning behind me.

A screen flickered to life on the far wall.

I turned just enough to see.

Surveillance footage. Live.

A diner.

A familiar diner.

Lily.

She was working the counter, oblivious.

My pulse spiked.

Carter’s voice was almost gentle. “She helped you, didn’t she?”

I forced my breathing to steady.

His eyes gleamed. “We let her live.” A beat. “For now.”

I yanked against the restraints. They didn’t budge
.
Carter sighed, as if this was exhausting for him.

“This is your last chance.”

The screen switched feeds.

Lily’s apartment.

A Division sniper on the opposite rooftop.

Red laser dot hovering on her chest.

My world shrunk.

Carter’s voice was a knife. “Come back to us. Work with us. Or she dies.”

I forced myself to think.

They wanted me alive. That meant they needed something from me.

But if I said no—

Lily was dead.

I had seconds to decide.

The room felt smaller. The air thinner.

Carter watched me, his expression calm. Confident. Like he already knew the choice I’d make.

I turned my gaze to the screen—Lily at the counter, moving like she had all the time in the world, unaware of the red dot hovering over her chest.

A sniper. An execution waiting for the go-ahead.

My fingers curled into fists against the restraints.

I needed to think. Fast.

They needed me alive. That much was obvious. If they really thought I was expendable, they would’ve put a bullet in my head back at the outpost.

Carter was playing me.

Using Lily as leverage to break me down. Make me compliant.

I took a slow breath, forcing my pulse to steady. If they were going to kill her, they would’ve done it already.

But that didn’t mean she wasn’t in danger.

I needed to get out of here. Now.

I exhaled. “Fine.”

Carter raised an eyebrow. “Fine?”

I met his eyes, forcing every ounce of resentment into my voice. “I’ll work with you.”

His lips curled into the ghost of a smile.

“Good.” He turned to the door. “Let’s start—”

Now.

I lunged.

I wasn’t at full strength—the dampeners in my bloodstream saw to that. But even weakened, I was faster than him.

The chair legs snapped under my momentum as I threw my body forward, restraints digging into my wrists. The table crashed to the side, papers flying. Carter staggered back, reaching for his gun.
Too late.
I swung my legs up and hooked my ankles around his throat.

Yanked.

His body slammed into the ground, hard.

The guards outside would hear the commotion in seconds.

I twisted against the restraints, forcing my wrists to dislocate, the pain sharp and sudden. The cuffs slid free. By the time Carter gasped for air, I was already moving.

Gun. First priority.

I grabbed his sidearm from his holster, leveled it at his temple. “Call off the sniper. I know these rounds will kill another revenant.”

Carter’s hand twitched, but he stilled. His face was red, veins bulging from the choke. “You’re making a mistake.”

I shoved the barrel against his skull. “I won’t say it again.”

He exhaled sharply, then tapped the communicator at his wrist. “Hold position.”

The sniper feed flickered. The red dot vanished from Lily’s chest.

My pulse didn’t slow.

I couldn’t trust Carter. Couldn’t trust The Division.

I needed to end this.

I aimed the gun at his knee and pulled the trigger.

The shot was deafening in the enclosed space. Carter’s scream was worse. He clutched his leg, blood pooling around his fingers.

I grabbed his communicator, clicking into the security feed. Hallways. Guard positions. Exit routes.

The facility was deep underground—one entrance, two exits.

The main elevator was a kill zone.

But the ventilation system?

I clenched my jaw. Risky. Tight. But I could make it work.

Outside, the alarm system wailed.

Time to move.

The first guard burst in before I even reached the doorway.

I shot him twice—one in the vest, one in the throat. He went down hard.

A second guard lunged from the hallway, a baton crackling with energy.

I dodged, the weapon missing my ribs by inches. I grabbed his wrist and snapped it backward, bones grinding against muscle.

He screamed—then stopped as I drove his head into the steel wall.

I exhaled. Two down. More incoming.

I sprinted down the corridor, footsteps pounding behind me.

Then—

Gas.

The vents hissed, thick white vapor spewing out.

My vision swam, my movements slowing.

No. No, no, no.

They were flushing me out.

I pushed forward, legs burning, my lungs raw. The world blurred at the edges, my muscles heavy.

I stumbled into a security room, barricading the door behind me.

My head pounded. My vision was fractured.

I wasn’t getting out of here on foot.

I forced myself to focus. The room was lined with monitors, screens flickering through security feeds.

Then—

A name.

HANGAR BAY.

My breath caught.

They had a plane.

I kicked open the vent cover and dragged myself inside.

The tunnels were tight, suffocating. My arms ached with each pull forward, my body sluggish from the gas.

I could hear boots below me, shouting.

They knew I was moving.

But they didn’t know where.

I reached the final vent. The hangar.

I peered through the slats.

A sleek black aircraft.

A pilot, already on board.

Two guards standing outside, weapons lowered.

I closed my eyes. Centered myself.

Then I kicked the vent wide open.

The metal screeched as I dropped down, landing in a roll. The first guard barely had time to react before I drove my elbow into his throat.

The second reached for his gun—

I put two bullets in his chest before he could fire.

The pilot scrambled for the controls, panicking.

I hauled him out of the cockpit, slamming his face into the dashboard. He crumpled.

I climbed in, gripping the controls.

I had no idea how to fly this thing.

But I’d figure it out.

Alarms blared through the hangar. Guards poured in, opening fire. Bullets pinged against the hull.

I gritted my teeth and hit every switch I could find.

The engines roared.

The plane lurched.

The guards dove for cover as I pitched the aircraft forward, the force slamming me against the seat.

Then—

I was airborne.

The facility shrank below me, disappearing into the frozen wilderness.

I took a shaking breath, my heart still thundering.

I had done it.

I had escaped.

But Carter wasn’t dead.

And The Division wouldn’t stop.

I gripped the controls tighter, my jaw clenched.

I flew through the night. The stolen aircraft was running hot—fuel levels dipping dangerously, alarms flashing across the console. Didn’t matter.

I had to reach Lily.

I adjusted course, heading straight for the diner.

The Division would be moving fast. I had to move faster.

By the time I landed, the sky was bruising with sunrise. The forest around the roadside diner was too quiet. No wind. No birds.

I gritted my teeth, stepping out onto the pavement.

The truck she used was still parked outside. She was here.

I moved quickly, shoving open the diner door—

Empty.

The lights flickered overhead, the air thick with burned coffee and something else.

Something rotten.

Then—

A sharp click.
I turned just in time to see Lily step from the kitchen, shotgun raised.

For a long second, neither of us moved.

Then her grip loosened. “Jesus,” she exhaled, lowering the weapon. “You look like hell.”

I almost laughed. Instead, I studied her—bruises under her eyes, knuckles raw. She hadn’t been sleeping.

She motioned to the overturned chairs. “Had visitors earlier.”

The Division.

I clenched my jaw. “Are you hurt?”

She shook her head. “No. But they weren’t here to kill me.” A pause. “They were waiting for you.”

I exhaled. Of course they were.

I moved to the window, scanning the woods. The air felt thick, the same electric wrongness I’d felt at the outpost.

Lily stepped beside me, arms crossed. “What now?”

I turned to her. “We run.”

She hesitated. “To where?”

That was the problem.

I had no safehouses. No contacts.

But before I could answer, I felt it.

That pressure in my skull.

A creeping, insidious feeling like I was being watched.

The diner lights flickered again.

And outside—

Something moved.

It started as a ripple. A distortion in the air, like heat rising off asphalt.

Then it stepped into view.

Tall. Thin. Skin the color of dead bark, its limbs too long, its joints bending in ways that shouldn’t be possible.

But the worst part?

It was wearing faces.

Not masks.

Faces.

Human faces—stitched together, layered, shifting as it moved. As if it couldn’t decide which one to wear.

Lily sucked in a sharp breath. “What the fuck is that?”

I knew.

Or at least, I recognized what it was trying to be.

It was mimicking. Stealing identities.

The last time I’d seen something like this, it had taken a week to clean up the remains.

This one was worse.

It knew me.

Because when it stepped closer, the shifting faces stopped—and one settled.

My own.

Lily tensed. “Tell me that’s not—”

It smiled.

My own expression, staring back at me.

Then it spoke.

“You are not the first.”

My blood ran cold.

Lily whispered, “Oh, we are so fucked.”

The thing moved.

Fast.

It blurred, shifting forward like liquid shadow, its limbs stretching, cracking—

I grabbed Lily and threw us both behind the counter as the windows exploded.

Glass rained down, the air buzzing with static.

The thing’s voice was inside my head now, whispering, filling my skull with something deep and ancient.

“You were built to be like us. Let go.”

Lily scrambled for more shells, loading the shotgun with shaking hands. “I don’t suppose you have a plan?”

Yeah.

But neither of us were going to like it.

I scanned the diner—nothing left but a back door and the broken windows.

We weren’t fast enough to outrun it. And if it caught us, we weren’t dying fast.

There was only one option.

“We have to trap it.”

Lily blinked. “With what?”

I exhaled sharply. “Me.”

She froze. “No.”

I didn’t have time to argue. The thing was inside now, unfolding from the shadows.

I met her gaze. “You run. Get as far as you can.”

She shook her head. “I’m not—”

“Lily, GO.”

The thing tilted its head. Watching. Listening.

Then, it whispered. “You do not have to fight.”

A creeping sensation crawled up my spine.

I felt my skin shift.

It was trying to change me.

I clenched my teeth. Fought back.

But I could feel it digging.

Not just into my body. Into my thoughts.

It wanted me to give in.

To become like it.

No.

I turned back to Lily, pushing something into her hands—Carter’s communicator.

Her eyes widened. “What am I supposed to do with this?”

I inhaled sharply. “Find Carter.”

She gaped at me. “Are you out of your goddamn mind?”

“Maybe.” I stood, muscles coiled, preparing for what came next.

“If he wants me so badly?” I nodded toward the communicator. “Let’s make him come to me.”

Lily hesitated. Then—slowly—she nodded.

I took one last look at her.

Then turned to face the thing wearing my face.

Lily ran.

I didn’t watch her go. Didn’t check to make sure she got out. I couldn’t afford to.

Because the thing standing across from me—the thing wearing my face—was already moving.

The diner walls groaned as it unfolded, limbs stretching, twisting, snapping into impossible configurations. Skin and bone warping as if it hadn’t quite decided on a final shape.

I wasn’t holding back this time.

I didn’t care if The Division had made me into something else.

I didn’t care if the thing in my blood was waking up.

I was going to kill this thing.

It lunged.

A streak of bladed limbs and hollow mouths.

I met it halfway.

We collided, the impact sending a shockwave through the room. Tables flipped, walls cracked, the floor splintered beneath our weight.

I felt something slip in my head—some limit, some restraint I’d been clinging to.

I let it go.

The world slowed.

For the first time, I saw everything.

Every muscle twitch.

Every movement before it happened.

Every weak point.

I tore into it.

My fist shattered through its ribs, its flesh rippling like water around my arm. I grabbed whatever was inside—something **thick, pulsing, wrong—**and ripped.

It screamed.

A sound that wasn’t just noise, but pressure.

A thousand voices at once. A tidal wave of stolen screams.

It drove a tendril into my arm trying to get me to back off.

I barely registered it.

I drove my knee into its sternum, launched it backward. It slammed into the diner counter, its body twisting, reforming, repairing itself.

I was already on it.

I grabbed its throat—if it had one—and squeezed.

Bone crunched.

The thing convulsed, limbs flailing wildly. Launching me off it.

But I was quick to get back to the fight.

I was past fear. Past hesitation.

I twisted, lifting it off the ground, hurling it across the room.

It hit the wall hard enough to crater the drywall.

The thing gurgled, its body flickering, trying to reform.

I didn’t let it.

I grabbed the closest thing I could find—a jagged chunk of rebar from the broken floor.

And I drove it straight through its head.

The screaming stopped.

Its body twitched. Seized.

Then—

It collapsed inward.

Not like a dying animal. Not like a man.

Like a shadow curling away from the light.

Like it had never really been there at all.

I stood over the shapeless mass, chest heaving.

My veins were burning, pulsing, shifting.

For the first time, I didn’t fight it.

For the first time, I let it settle.

I was in control.

Not The Division.

Not Carter.

Not whatever was inside me.

Me.

I flexed my fingers. The sensation faded.

I was still human.

I was still me.

The diner was wrecked. Glass, shattered booths, blood smeared across the floors. My blood. Its blood.

I turned toward the exit.

And saw the headlights.

Three black SUVs.

The Division.

They were fast. Too fast.

Didn’t matter.

Let them come.

I stepped outside, rolling my shoulders. The wind was sharp, cold against my skin. I barely felt it.

The SUV doors opened.

Carter stepped out first.

Gun in hand.

His men fanned out around him, weapons raised.

He studied me, his expression unreadable. Then, quietly:

“…You won.”

I didn’t respond.

His eyes flicked to the remains of the thing behind me. Then back to me.

Slowly, he lowered his weapon.

He turned to his men. “Stand down.”

They hesitated. He didn’t repeat himself.

One by one, the rifles lowered.

Carter sighed, rubbing his temple. “Jesus, 18C.” He gestured toward the diner. “Do you even realize what you just did?”

I met his gaze.

“I saved her.”

A flicker of something—amusement? Annoyance?—crossed his face.

Then he nodded.

“Get in the car,” he said. “We need to talk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t take a step toward the car. Didn’t even glance at the open door.

I just stared at Carter.

He stared back.

Behind him, his men waited—silent, tense. Fingers hovering near triggers. Watching.

Waiting.

For the first time, I wasn’t afraid of them.

I was stronger. Faster. I could tear through them before they had time to react.

Carter knew it, too.

And that’s why he wasn’t giving the kill order.

I exhaled slowly. “I’m not going with you.”

The words were steady. Final.

One of the soldiers flinched, barely perceptible. Carter didn’t.

His expression remained unreadable. Then he sighed, rubbing his jaw, like this was exhausting.

Like he had expected this.

“Of course you’re not,” he murmured.

He turned slightly, glancing at the ruined diner, at the shredded corpse of something that should never have existed.

Then he looked at me again.

“I knew you’d win,” he said. “That’s why we didn’t interfere.”

My gut twisted. He let this happen.

He let that thing come after me.

I clenched my jaw. “You sent it.”

Carter shook his head. “No.” He nodded toward the corpse. “It found you on its own.”

A slow, creeping chill worked its way through my bones.

Something in his voice—something raw.

Not anger.

Not resentment.

Dread.

I stepped forward, my hands curling into fists. “What aren’t you telling me?”

Carter hesitated. For just a second.

Then, in a voice too quiet, too controlled:

“You felt it, didn’t you?”

The muscles in my neck tensed.

I didn’t answer.

Because I had.

That moment in the fight—when my skin shifted, when my veins burned, when the world slowed.

When I knew exactly how to kill it.

Carter exhaled sharply, his breath misting in the cold air.

“We knew something was coming,” he said. “We didn’t know how soon.” His eyes darkened. “But when we saw that thing heading straight for you?”

He shook his head. “That’s when we realized it’s already started.”

My pulse pounded. “What’s started?”

Carter looked at me.

And for the first time in years, I saw something I had never seen in his eyes.

Fear.

He took a step closer. His voice was low. Controlled. Final.

“Everything we’ve been hunting? Every creature, every experiment, every nightmare we thought we put down?”

He gestured toward the corpse.

“They weren’t isolated incidents.”

I felt my stomach drop.

Carter’s eyes locked onto mine.

“They were warning signs.”

The wind picked up, howling through the trees. The forest felt wrong now—like it was watching. Listening.

Something deep in my gut twisted.

Carter’s voice dropped to a whisper.

“They’re waking up.”

Silence.

The weight of his words settled into my bones.

I wanted to ignore it. Walk away.

But I couldn’t.

Because I knew—**I knew—**he wasn’t lying.

I had felt it.

Something stirring.

Something waiting.

I exhaled, stepping back. “Then you better be ready.”

Carter let out a quiet, humorless laugh. “You think I’m the one that needs to be ready?”

He shook his head.

His next words were almost pitying.

“No, 18C.” He nodded toward me. “They’ll be coming for you.”

A beat of silence.

Then he turned to his men.

“Move out.”

The SUVs pulled away, tires crunching against the frozen ground.

I stood there, watching until the red taillights disappeared into the dark.

Only when they were gone did I let out a slow, controlled breath.

I had won.

But it didn’t feel like a victory.

I looked back at the diner. At the corpse.

Then up at the trees, at the deep black beyond them.

I wasn’t alone.

Something else was still out there.

And it was coming.

I turned toward the woods.

I wasn’t running anymore.

I didn’t leave right away.

I stood there, staring into the trees, feeling the weight of Carter’s words settle like a stone in my gut.

“They’re waking up.”

I exhaled, steadying my breathing, trying to shove down the instinct that had kept me alive for so long—the need to fight first, ask later.

Carter let me go. Why?

I had just killed something stronger than anything I’d ever faced and did it without much effort.

And instead of trying to put me down like they had before, The Division had simply… walked away.


That wasn’t relief.

That was a warning.

I clenched my fists, blood still wet on my knuckles.

I needed answers.

But first?

I needed to find Lily.

I found her an hour later, holed up in a cabin two miles off the main road. She had ditched her phone, wiped down her truck, covered her tracks. Smart.

When I knocked, she didn’t answer.

I waited.

Then—a shotgun barrel slid through the cracked door.

For a moment, neither of us spoke.

Then she exhaled. “Jesus. You actually made it.”

I almost smirked. “That makes one of us.”

She let me inside, shutting every lock behind us.

The place was small—one room, old furniture, no tech. Safe.

She watched me carefully, eyes flicking over the blood on my shirt. “I’m guessing things went sideways?”

I sat on the edge of the rickety couch. “Somethings coming.”

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “Something?”

I met her gaze. “Something that makes the division scared.”

The words hung in the air, and for the first time, I saw real fear in her expression.

But she didn’t run.

She just grabbed a half-empty bottle of whiskey and took a long drink.

“Jesus Christ.”

Yeah.

That about summed it up.

Why Are They Letting Me Go?

Lily paced as I told her everything.

The outpost. The thing that came after me.

Carter’s warning.

By the time I finished, her fingers were digging into her arms, tension bleeding through her stance.

Then, after a long silence—

“You realize they just let you go, right?”

I exhaled through my nose. “Yeah.”

She shook her head. “That doesn’t make sense. After all this time, after everything they’ve done to keep you under control—now they just walk away?”

I didn’t respond.

Because I’d been asking myself the same damn thing.

The Division didn’t take risks. If they were backing off, it was because they thought they didn’t have to chase me anymore.

Because something worse was already on its way.

Lily sat across from me, gripping her drink. “So… what do we do?”

I stared at the floor.

I wanted to fight. To track down whatever was waking up and put it down before it ever reached me.

But how do you hunt something you can’t see?

How do you kill something that isn’t even here yet?

I let out a slow breath.

“We go dark.”

Lily frowned. “Go dark?”

I nodded. “Disappear. Stay ahead of them.” I met her eyes. “If Carter’s right—if there’s something bigger coming—we need to be ready.”

She studied me for a long moment.

Then she sighed. “Well, shit. Guess I’m on the run now.”

I almost smiled. “Welcome to the club.”

We left that night.

Took back roads. Changed cars twice.

No phones. No digital footprint.

For now, we were ghosts.

But the question still lingered.

What’s waking up?

The things I had hunted—the cryptids, the creatures, the experiments that should have never existed—they were horrors. Monsters.

But they were scattered. Isolated.

Not part of something bigger.

Carter’s words echoed in my skull.

“They weren’t isolated incidents. They were warning signs.”

I gritted my teeth.

Then what the hell had we been warning against?

Lily glanced at me from the driver’s seat. “You look like you’re about to hit something.”

I exhaled sharply. “Trying to figure out our next move.”

She drummed her fingers against the wheel. “I’d start with figuring out what exactly is waking up.”

I nodded.

Because if I knew what was coming—

I could figure out how to kill it.

I’m planning a solo journey to take a breather from life, find some quality headspace, and (hopefully) spark some much needed creative inspiration. My aim is to keep my expenses under $600/month, and I’m eyeing Southeast Asia for its affordability, culture, and natural beauty.

What I’m looking for:

Privacy & Quiet: I need my own small apartment or Airbnb (hostels just don’t cut it—I need solid sleep and a personal workspace).

Reliable and fast Internet: For streaming and staying in touch with family as well as doing a bit of research

Basic Amenities: Somewhere fairly safe, with access to restaurants, coffee shops, and local stores—plus some nearby sights or cultural experiences to keep me from feeling isolated.

Budget Living Tips: Whether it’s saving on rent, cooking at home, or local deals, I’d love practical advice on keeping costs low.

I’m hoping this trip will give me the calm I need to reflect, explore my creative side, and rediscover what really lights my fire. If any of you have done a similar low-cost, soul-searching adventure, I’d love to hear your stories or any recommendations for specific towns, neighborhoods, or even local rituals that helped you reset and recharge.

Ive heard this quite a few times now, so lets address how to fix this shi!

1.) stop taking notes / shorten that shi 

You’re already getting lost in the lecture, dont make it harder for yourself to catch up by writing notes AT THE SAME TIME!!! Write them after the lecture OR write down keywords instead of entire slides. 

2.) Learning the Topics beforehand

This is the secret to success. Knowing your topics beforehand removes alot of pressure, instead of everything being brought up fresh and warm. You get these left overs that you can microwave and eat bit by bit, not all at once. (You get to choose what topics to focus in) WAY EASIER to connect the dots with this one! 

3.) Sleep

Good sleep = Good energy, sleep is underrated, THATS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LEARN and rewire your circuits btw. Google that shi up twin.


4.) Coffee

Wake you up mmmm + locks you tf in for whatever lectures ur attending. (Not too much tho)

5.) You can talk to your lecturers or email them.
You paid for these services… abuse the fudge outta it gang.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Around this time two and a half years ago, I started developing extreme fatigue to the point where I would easily sleep 2-8 hours a day on top of my normal sleeping schedule (8-10 hours). During this time my sleep at night was absolutely fine, but I was literally exhausted all the time. I was prescribed melatonin and promethazine (on separate occasions) but this did not help. 

Around the beginning of this year started getting interrupted sleep, where I couldn’t stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time. I can fall asleep pretty much instantly after wards but it’s so annoying waking up almost every 2 hours.

Now on top of this, I have literally started dropping off in the day, this is a similar feeling to what started happening two years ago. But now it is so intense that I can be standing, sitting, chatting, anything and I struggle to stay awake. I struggle to hold my head up and keep my eyes open. I am constantly fighting trying to stay awake and it’s starting to take a serious toll on my studies, concentration and overall mood.

I drink one coffee a day in the morning, I try to refrain from napping or it will turn into ~6 h sleep, even with alarms, I just cannot for the life of me get up.

In the morning I wake up not feeling refreshed, I feel better than I do in the afternoon though.
I am on 100 mg sertraline (wanting to change as it gives me tremor and sweating issues), oxybutynin (for the sweating) and vaciclovir (for cold sores). 
I have caught COVID at least 6 times and each time I have gotten it, it has tanked me down even worse than the last, making me so freaking exhausted. 

I also have atypical anorexia but this is under control at the moment, and wasn’t really an issue when these sleep/wake symptoms started. I have never been a great sleeper, having insomnia when I was younger but I can fall asleep now, just staying asleep is the issue. My dad has what I believe to be undiagnosed sleep apnoea, mum is fine. 

I am seeing a psychiatrist on Wednesday and I am wondering if there’s any suggestions as to what to bring up to them? Exactly this or perhaps some suggestive diagnoses? 

I have been asking my doctor for help since this started, I’ve had bloods done at least every 3 months, I take vitamin D and B, there’s nothing wrong with my thyroid functions. I am just lost as to what to do.",1,1741570106.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.
* I'm INTJ and am Type 5. I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Think we could have a great exchange? Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance. If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1741570097.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.
* I'm INTJ and am Type 5. I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Think we could have a great exchange? Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance. If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1741570080.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

The infected. Zombies. Walkers. Deadheads. Whatever the hell we’re calling them today. The reality of them wasn’t something I’d ever truly considered—just movies, TV, games. Pure entertainment, right? Wrong. Dead wrong.
I didn’t plan for my Saturday night to go like this, and honestly, the last thing I expected when picking Ella up from her shift at Coffee Pulse was becoming an entrée for the undead. But life—or rather, undeath—has a way of surprising you.
My mind screamed panic, but I forced calm as I stumbled through the shattered door of Coffee Pulse. Ella stood barricaded behind the counter, gripping an espresso tamper as if it were Excalibur.
“Jake! God, you scared me!” Her weapon lowered slightly.
“Sorry,” I mumbled, glancing at the spreading black veins already inching past my wristwatch. I forced a smile, trying desperately to hide the fear pooling in my gut. “You okay?”
“Yeah, but everything’s chaos. What happened to your wrist?” Her voice trembled, eyes wide with alarm.
“Nothing,” I lied badly. “Just now. It happened fast.”
Her face went pale, fury and fear battling in her eyes. “Dammit, Jake, you promised you’d be careful!”
“I know.” Months ago, when this was all just a bad joke in movies, we’d promised each other we’d never hide a bite. We’d been naïve enough to think promises mattered in an apocalypse.
“You need to go,” I urged. “There’s a car outside—fuel, supplies. Take it. Go.”
Ella shook her head fiercely. “Not without you.”
But I knew better. Minutes, maybe seconds—that’s all I had. Staying meant I’d kill her too.
Glass shattered loudly behind us, snapping us back to reality. The first zombie lurched through, jaw slack, eyes vacant, seeking flesh.
“Ella, run!”
She hesitated only a second, pain etched into her face, before survival instincts overtook sentiment. She bolted toward the back door, gripping her weapon tightly.
“I love you!” she screamed over her shoulder.
“I know,” I whispered back.
More undead spilled inside, oblivious to my presence. Blackness crept steadily through my veins, numbness swallowing my limbs. My pulse faded, replaced by a chilling calm. Zombies shuffled past, uninterested, sensing the infection taking hold.
But clarity lingered. My final thought burned fiercely:
Protect her.
With fading strength, I threw myself between Ella’s fleeing form and the undead mob, hitting the cold floor hard.
The world narrowed to darkness.

Silence.

Yes, I told people, including my coworkers, had to get time off of work. Not a single person reached out or responded when I messaged them first. My coworkers clearly don't like me because when I came back to the office they said ""you're back, please do ABC stuff today"" and barely acknowledged that I was gone.

I regret choosing the major I did... while it pays well, and I can afford to live ok, I dread going to work every day. I hate what the job entails. I started in early July 2024 and can't leave the job until July 2026 without paying back the relocation assistance the company gave me. While I can afford my rent and groceries, I can barely save, so moving and/or finding a new job until then is not an option.

I've spent the last 8 months in the area I moved to trying to make friends through everything I can think of: local clubs, facebook, Meetup, bumble friends app, dating apps, and just being out in coffee shops. I've been the one to initiate plans only to get left on read or just constantly be told that the other person is busy. I feel like I'm not clicking with anyone at all in this area and that it's just not my vibe.

I like to think that I'm doing what I can - I exercise consistently, I eat right, I go out and sit in the sunshine, I have a pet - but I'm so fucking lonely it's causing me physical pain. I have a few long-distance friends from college but a lot of us have fallen out of contact. I was venting to a friend a week or so ago about how I was lonely and wish I had ""someone"" and she told me that ""romance didn't solve depression."" I had to explain to her that if I got in a car wreck and had to call someone to pick me up, it would be a fucking Uber rather than a person I knew. And only then did she give me a half-assed apology.

I'm seriously dreading the rest of my life. It's not that I want to die/am going to kill myself, but really just the fact that there is so much loneliness ahead of me for another, what? 40-60 years? is just depressing. I don't even know how to fix it. I'm an extrovert and because I don't know anyone here, I live alone.

We both expressed a lot of excitement about making our own space prior to buying--but the moment the deal closed, my husband said that he does not want our space to ""have personality"".

Aside from his office, he says every single room needs to be white and gray, both in paint and furniture. This ""appeals to everyone"". He wants nothing on the walls, no greenery, just absolutely nothing but the bare minimum and as colorless as possible.

I don't need everything to be bright--in fact, I generally like moodier, duskier colors.

I don't know what to even suggest to get him to think about other possibilities? Does anyone know how to compromise on a style somewhere between minimalist and...literally anything else at all? 

The most offensive part to me is really the gray, honestly. He wants it on the floors, he wants the cabinets to be made gray, he wants the walls gray and rugs gray.

Ok, so, you work at Starbucks, and it can be stressful. But can we drop the whole “I’m a frontline worker” attitude?

But no, sometimes I get the guilt stare as I awkwardly hit “No Tip” on the screen, like I just went outside and kicked a puppy.

1j7muvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1j7muvy/able_carry_max_edc_ripstop_review/,Able Carry Max EDC Ripstop review,"I've been using the Max EDC for a week so I thought I'd give some feedback. My edc prior was an AER flight pack 3. I walk a couple miles round trip to work every day with a 16"" laptop, ipad, lunch, coffee, umbrella, wires/tech and in the winter add gloves, hat and scarf. Sometimes I'll be wearing the gloves, hat and scarf and sometimes I'll bring it in the bag and use it if needed. The Aer bag was an incredible bag for years. I weighed my Aer bag with daily loadout at 24 lbs. Loved the size, shape, comfortable straps, and the ability to tuck the straps in and use it in briefcase mode for meetings. It was a little tight though depending on the size of lunch and if I had to carry a one-off item (coffee creamer for office every now and then or lots of papers, business papers...). I dont love deep packs so was a little turned off by the xpac Max EDC. When the ripstop came out in a light and more collapsible fabric I grabbed one. 

Wearing it for a couple days I first realized the straps were even better than the Aer ones which were already very good. Able Carry is somehow able to just make the straps feel like they aren't there, even packed out. Something just seemed a little off then I remembered a review I read on here about the Daily Plus where someone pulled out the removable back panel and found it more comfortable. I removed mine and the bag was able to then conform to my back while still having plenty of cushioning. Definitely give that a go if you buy a Max EDC. I found the bag to be incredibly comfortable with that removed. The bag is much bigger than the Aer but I'm not small so I could see how it might look a little awkward on a smaller person. The ripstop material is more collapsible and softer than xpac so it doesn't seem as bulky and it certainly isn't heavy, at least coming from an Aer bag. It also isn't very deep, whereas I feel like the Aer city pack pro v1 and Evergoods bags look too deep. I think the ripstop, especially in black, helps here too. 

While a lot of reviews have been critical of the duffel compartment I find it extremely useful. I moved the key leash to that area (there are a few different places you can move it to) and its a perfect spot for hat, gloves and scarf. Ipad in the main compartment tablet sleeve while laptop goes in very well designed laptop area. I put a tracker in the laptop section hidden pocket. Lunch goes in main cavity along with umbrella in the internal side pocket that is a perfect size for a Blunt metro. Admin section in laptop area I keep unzipped and that is what I use for a quick access pocket with phone and ear buds case. Always thought I needed an external water bottle pocket but I bought a 16 oz coffee mug that doesn't spill and it works great in the water bottle pocket. Only thing that doesn't work well is the right side ""quick access"" pocket but honestly there are so many other pockets and compartments that it can be used for things you want to have with you, but rarely need, since it's tough to use. 


Overall, it's an amazing bag and I love using it. I think the design is incredibly functional and I would recommend it to anyone who carries similar items. I haven't had the opportunity to travel with it yet but I'm looking forward to using it with the luggage pass through and side handle. I'd also like to try out their compression packing cubes but haven't picked them up yet.

Overall, it gets a 9 out of 10. 

Edit: for comparisons, I've also had the Evergoods MPL22, Aer Pro Pack 24L, Bellroy Transit, and Aer travel pack 3 small and gotten rid of them as they were never as good as the Flight pack 3. Now the Max EDC takes the crown. ",14,1741568815.0,ManyBaggers,6,0.95,False

My wife and I both consoled her and told her how proud we were of her drawing and spelling because we could still make out most of it (she's learning to spell and is really trying to do it independently so this was wonderful to see).

Turns out it was a seminar run by Lifeplus trying to  get me to ""get a feeling for the vibe and the great benefits"". The second they started talking about the products my heart sank. This was an MLM circle jerk meet up and I straight up ran into it. 

I got swarmed by random people telling me their stories and trying to make me feel welcome and intoxicated by this great product and lifestyle and the lovely community. 

I just wanted to leave. 

It's just baffling to me how convinced those people are that spending all your time and energy on promoting this product and hanging out with the people involved changes their life to the better. Most of them left their entire old life behind to limit their whole social and financial life to this. It felt like getting a glimpse of what a cult is like and jt was scary.

I am particularly picky about not going overboard with mods that impact settlement building in FO4, with the only things I'm running being Place Anywhere (because it lets me skip past the pillar and rug glitches I'd be using anyways), Scrap Everything (I just like the freedom it gives me), Functional Displays (which I might drop soon) and the CC content they gave away with Next Gen.

Who’s still unvaccinated?,"The weekend of lockdowns, I had just come out of homelessness. I had been on the streets of Los Angeles for 9 months, and not exactly how you'd think. I was enjoying myself doing what was planned for me to experience, camping out in nature and paying attention to the surroundings and how they were revealing to me something, an answer. There was a point where I gave up resistance to being where I was, and I was content with staying here a while. That's when the doors opened, and opportunities flowed in to meet me. I found myself having my own apartment literally the weekend lockdowns hit. It was a real warm embrace, a surreal feeling that everything happened in its perfect timing and place.

After some time, we had the rollout round after round. Funny thing is, the last time I was ill was in 2019. I had caught an annoying cough that didn't want to quit, my throat a little sorer than I wanted it to be from the repetituve outbursts. 

I can vividly remember because it was a winter morning in November. Seasonal drinks were hot in the cafes I often frequented. It was my regular request to ask the baristas for free water refills, hot or cold for making my own oatmeal and instant coffee or to drink as normal. I didn't want the barista to take my thermos and catch what I had gotten, warning them to wash their hands. That kind of love...I was learning in all things. Ever since, I have never been affected by any illness. We could say my immune system is strong, and my relationship with all that is, I have a bond.

I was ready mentally and emotionally for houselessness, and where homelessness was a mentality, I was going through a physical trial of necessities and a challenge to feeling that I could follow my own calling despite the circumstances. It was a situation in which my first public speaking gig led me to finding a home, against the advice of my mentor at the time. Wild.

When it came to the shot, I happened to pick up David Icke's book, ""The Answer"", a few months after its release. A real placeholder and staple at the time; it foretold and connected the dots on the world hold and plan predetermined to be a pandemic, piecing together evidence of how it was all a hoax. Nurses dancing in empty hospitals with no patients on Tiktok, the virus never having been isolated in the first place, viruses not being able to be passed through the air, but requiring a host...My own experiences such as an empty hospital for a walk in x-ray visit and arguing with family members advising us as though their doctor friends knew what's up etc., and this book, all of this was just what I needed to justify the culmination of my experiences up to that point, therefore consuming 5 large highlighters to underline what I considered to be new information to me in this book.

I then went on to post publicly advising against it, and to sad dismay, loved ones didn't listen. I had one girlfriend in early 2021, the both of us aware of the dangers of getting the shot. The rollout was in December of 2020. Ever since then, the world has gone dark. Relationships have been an empty container to peek into and see what's inside. In many ways, humanity will never be the same. Yet, I am hopeful for meeting the right people and in gathering community with other like-minded individuals who serve a part in this world.

I found the same mug from a seller in Poland. With shipping, it cost 80 (the original was 25). When it arrived, I glued the broken handle back on the old one and hid it in the garage. Told her I “fixed it with superglue” and acted surprised when she noticed the “new” mug looked nicer.

There's no end in sight besides the one I give myself.,"I'm a fucking failure and there doesn't seem to be an end to this vicious cycle. I work two jobs, averaging about 65 hours a week, just to aggressively pay down my student loans. My full-time job is third shift, which has wrecked my sleep schedule and worsened my insomnia. The PT job paycheck goes entirely toward my loans.

I don’t spend money on anything unnecessary. No coffee, no eating out, no streaming services. I don’t go to concerts, events, or any paid activities. I don’t even buy new clothes.

Despite sacrificing my time, sleep, and sanity, I’m only making around $50K a year. It doesn’t feel worth it, especially when people are making that same amount with only one FT job.

I’ve tried to increase my salary by applying to new jobs, but I keep getting rejected. My job search is also limited because I rely on public transportation. I have experience and a degree, but it feels like none of that fucking matters anymore. It’s frustrating watching my friends return from years abroad and land higher-paying jobs while I struggle with no car, no energy, and no real prospects.

I take depression and sleep meds, but they don’t quiet a mind constantly worried about bills and the future. Adjusting my medication is difficult because of my schedule. Between third shift and my PT job, I have almost no time for doctor’s appointments. Public transportation turns a simple appointment into a 2-hour round trip—assuming I even get any sleep that day.

Every day, I compare myself to my two roommates. They both make very good wages, go out, have fun, and live without the weight of student loan debt or insomnia. We’re the same age, but we live in different worlds. It’s hard to relate to them when my reality is so different.

On top of everything, I was hit by a car two months ago while crossing the street. I’ve been out of my FT job since then, burning through my savings while I wait for the driver’s insurance case to settle and for clearance to return to work.

I can feel myself slowly unraveling under the stress. I keep thinking about ways to escape this cycle for good. I have 80mg of oxy from the pain meds for this injury and a surgery last year. I’ve kept it safe—just in case. Some days, I take it out and look at it. And then I put it back.",1,1741568049.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Food:
I should note, we’re both vegetarian and felt we had options. Not a ton of options but options nonetheless. We didn’t eat everywhere but I’ll outline where we did. 

Agave (dinner) was OOOKAY. Not great. Got veggie fajitas that didn’t blow us away but were serviceable. The chips and Guacamole were unreal. 6.5/10

Sports bar (dinner) was pretty good tbh. Decent salad, decent cheese sticks. Was empty when we went. Played some pool. 7/10

Oregano (lunch and dinner) was actually trash. Pasta tasted terrible and seemed like it had been under heaters or warmers for 30 mins. Bad service. The chocolate tart was fucking awesome those. 4/10. Chocolate tart 10/10. 

Spice (dinner a few times) 10. Awesome. Bomb. 10/10 no question. 

Lunch time za. I don’t remember the name but it’s by the party pool. Honestly pretty good. 8/10. 

Las Olas. Great veggies quesadillas and fun spot to hang out. 8/10. 

Breakfast was pretty decent tbh. Lots of options. 8/10. 

Aroma coffee was honestly nothing special imo. 6/10. 

Room service: we waited 1.5hrs for lunch after ordering at 2pm. It was fine. 6/10

Pools:

We hung out at the lazy river the entire time and loved it. The bar there was great and workers friendly. Tip well!

Resort:
Saw a couple cockroaches lmao. 

Room:
Pretty great, but had to request waters a few times.

Seriously though. 

Please excuse the mess of cords back there, but we're still moving into our new home.

I really wanted to dislike this steamer wand and replace it with a traditional one, but it went and did a consistently good job and is pretty easy to clean. 

It's a Delongi Dedica machine. My main coffee maker is a Flair 58. I bought this because my wife prefers to not use the lever press and likes machines. And, I do like a milky coffee as much as a black. 

I feel like I'm cheating. ",3,1741566696.0,espresso,5,0.72,False
1j7m5d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diffuser/comments/1j7m5d2/how_cleaning_the_l105_diffuser_block_improved_my/,How Cleaning the L105 Diffuser Block Improved My La Marzocco Espresso Shots,"After using my La Marzocco espresso machine for some time, I discovered the water flow was not as consistent as it once was.  The pictures weren't extracting correctly, and I began to notice varying crema.  After considerable investigation, I discovered the L105 diffuser block which helps uniformly spread water over the coffee puck might be the cause.  
 I resolved to split the group head and examine the diffuser block.  Indeed, coffee oils and mineral deposits caused some accumulation and slight blockage.  I cleaned it completely, being sure to eliminate any left-overs.  Once everything was back together, I tested to see whether it changed anything.  
 I noted right away a more uniform and smooth water flow.  The crema returned to its rich, golden richness while the espresso came out more consistently.  Though it was a minor adjustment, it improved the quality of my photographs entirely.  
 I now make sure the diffuser block is routinely cleaned to maintain my machine working as best it can be.  Although it's one of those things you might ignore easily, maintaining good shape of this component greatly influences the espresso extraction.  Checking and maintaining the diffuser block is really worth it if your La Marzocco is showing inconsistent shots.",1,1741566688.0,Diffuser,0,1.0,False
