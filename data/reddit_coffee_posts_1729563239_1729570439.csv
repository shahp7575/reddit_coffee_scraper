I ran water through it like the manual said, running a few rounds before actually drinking it, and have run many rounds of coffee through it as well.

What are some favorite ways to consume caffeine? I don’t like coffee but I love Coca-Cola and Red Bull. I am trying to find something a little bit stronger like a Celsius.

Anyway, I’ve been struggling with my heart these past few months. I really thought something was wrong because I noticed it was beating faster than normal, and I started feeling nauseous and super anxious. I stopped drinking coffee and other stimulants, but it didn’t help. One day, my heart rate hit 120 beats per minute, and I freaked out and had a panic attack. That’s when I finally convinced my mom to take me to the doctor. They ran a ton of tests, and everything came back fine, which I couldn’t understand. They just prescribed me bisoprolol to slow down the beats and sent me home. I decided to see another doctor for a second opinion, and he said the same thing: that I was fine and if I wanted, I could stop taking the medication. 

Now my heart rate is normal (I’m still taking the bisoprolol), but I keep getting these weird palpitations. It feels like my heart skips a beat and then beats 2 or 3 times faster to catch up before going back to normal. Honestly, I don’t even know how to describe it, it's a super weird feeling.

1g99cdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1g99cdg/this_has_been_the_hardest_year_of_my_life/,This has been the hardest year of my life ,"Hi everyone! This might be long so I apologize in advance I just need somewhere to vent that isn’t biased. In JanuaryI was working at a very toxic place (since Dec 2022) with micromanaging beyond anything I’ve seen. I’m talking about us having to type in a Teams chat with the entire company any time we got up from our desk to say where we were going and then say when we are back so they know how long we took. This included going to the bathroom, getting a coffee in the kitchen, grabbing more pens from the storage closet, etc. Anyways, a few weeks into January my grandmother passed away so I worked from home for a week while I grieved. Not even took time off, I was still working. The day I returned to office they fired me for not being dedicated enough (yes, they knew what happened). This led to my husband being extremely overwhelmed because all the bills were now solely on him. I did get unemployment for a few weeks but it was barely anything. 

For months I was stressed that I couldn’t contribute anything and I wasn’t hearing back from any jobs, so I was already in a dark place. I had a falling out with my mom in May, which led to my father cutting me out as well. I would text my dad that I had nothing against him and would say “I love you” but he would never say it back after the falling out. In July he had a heart attack and has been in a coma since due to lack of oxygen to his brain. So I might never get to hear him say “I love you too.” The doctors have all said he might never wake up and if he does he won’t be the same. I made up with my mom after this happened and have been visiting every weekend and some weekdays to see my dad at the rehab center and help my mom with everything. My sister was also no contact with my mom when this happened and they still don’t get a long but have tried to fix things since we need to be a family right now. Since this happened, I have basically become my dad for my mom. I organize her bills, I’ve spent countless hours calling insurance and trying to get the best care for him, I am doing their taxes, my mom calls me about 2-4 times a day to breakdown and vent to me about how she’s feeling, and all the while I’m still looking for a job and having interviews because we need income. I can’t even describe the amount of pressure that has been on me. 

Right now my mom called me begging me to come stay with her because my sister is visiting and they fight a lot so she needs a mediator. Throughout all this, nobody has asked me how I’m doing besides my husband and his family. As for mine, it’s like I’m just there to take care of everything. For context, it’s my sister (27), me (F25), and my brother (M21). My sister and brother have done basically nothing to help. I live two hours away from my parents, my sister lives 2 hours away in the opposite direction as me, and my brother is still at home. Yet, everyone in my family all says “I can’t believe [sister’s name] makes that drive so often.” She’s always been a favorite with them so I’m not surprised, however I make the same length of a drive every few days whereas she has only done it like every other week. Nobody seems to care about everything I’m doing to keep this family afloat and I can’t take it anymore. I’m the mediator, parent, therapist, and assistant all in one. I want to be there for my family but I feel like I’m drowning. ",1,1729569434.0,venting,1,1.0,False

One popular choice among fitness enthusiasts is yoga pants. But why exactly should you consider wearing yoga pants during your workout?

# 

# Improved Flexibility and Range of Motion

[Yoga pants](https://shoppingds.xn--com%20%20products%20%20yoga-pants-with-pockets-for-women-high-waisted-workout-leggings-tummy-control-athletic-leggings-8820foa/) are designed to stretch and move with your body, allowing for a full range of motion during your workout. This flexibility is essential for exercises that require bending, stretching, or twisting, such as yoga, Pilates, or dance. With yoga pants, you can move freely without feeling restricted by your clothing.

# Moisture-Wicking and Breathable Fabric

Many yoga pants are made from moisture-wicking fabric that helps to draw sweat away from your body. This feature is especially beneficial during intense workouts or hot yoga sessions, as it helps to keep you dry and comfortable. Additionally, the breathable nature of yoga pants allows for proper ventilation, preventing overheating during your workout.

# Compression and Support



Yoga pants often feature a compression fit that provides support to your muscles during exercise. This compression can help improve blood circulation, reduce muscle fatigue, and enhance overall performance. The supportive nature of yoga pants can also help with post-workout recovery by reducing muscle soreness and stiffness.

# Versatility and Style

Not only are yoga pants functional, but they are also versatile in style. You can easily transition from your workout to running errands or meeting friends for coffee without having to change your outfit. With a wide range of colors, patterns, and designs available, you can express your personal style while staying comfortable and practical.

# Enhanced Confidence and Focus



Wearing [yoga pants](https://shoppingds.com/products/eco-friendly-nbr-yoga-mat) that fit well and make you feel good can boost your confidence during your workout. When you feel confident in your appearance, you are more likely to stay focused and motivated to push yourself further. Whether you're practicing yoga, hitting the gym, or going for a run, the right workout attire can make a difference in your mindset and performance.

Overall, wearing yoga pants during your workout can offer a multitude of benefits, from improved flexibility and support to enhanced comfort and style. So next time you hit the gym or attend a fitness class, consider reaching for your favorite pair of yoga pants to experience the difference for yourself.

","I genuinely feel like there’s something wrong with me because whenever I have a crush or fall in love, I can’t help but follow whatever the guy says. I 22F currently dating a 27M, and even before we started dating, I noticed myself slipping back into this pattern—like I become a complete bot, doing everything a man tells me. For example, my boyfriend asked me to stop drinking coffee in the afternoon because it wasn’t good for my sleep, and I quit completely, even though I was working two jobs at the time, and I was a serious caffeine addict. 

I have my own personality and values, and I’ve never compromised my morals, so it doesn’t really bother me on that level. But it scares me how much I change when I start liking someone. I once wanted to work at a gas station near my college, but my boyfriend at the time told me not to, so I didn’t. Another guy I liked told me not to go to a party, and I stayed home. When it comes to big decisions, I feel paralyzed unless I get their opinion. I’ve never told any guy I’ve dated about this because I’m scared of being taken advantage of. I also tend to rationalize the changes I make, I also lie to my bf / crush on why I changed my opinion. 

Is there something wrong with me? I don’t think I have “daddy issues,” though a couple of my friends think that might be the cause. I know I’m smart and capable of making my own decisions, but when I let my guard down with a guy, it’s like a switch flips, and suddenly I’m weak In the knees 😭 I’ve only dated two guys, my current boyfriend being the second, and I’ve never done anything casual because I know I’d lose my mind, idk how people get over being done dirty time after time, cuz ik id land in jail. People have told me to gain more experience with men, but I don’t want to go through emotional turmoil just to learn how to detach.

I’m not someone who’s male-centered either—I genuinely avoid and dislike 99.99% of men. This only happens when I develop strong feelings for someone or get into a relationship. And I know I fell out of love with my ex after I started ignoring his feelings and opinions. Is it weird for me to like doing everything a man wants me to do, i legit feel sick typing this out 😭😭, I’m a complete bot, and I’m nvr going to admit this publicly or ever tell a man this. 

Anyways what can I do, do I need serious help?

I take modafinil daily and also drink coffee but if they’re going to stress out my heart I’m thinking I may have to stop them for the next few weeks but I really don’t want to because I had terrible fatigue before this that only became more manageable once I started taking the modafinil and most of the time I feel like I can barely function without caffeine. I could probably handle it for two months since I work from home, but it’ll be pretty miserable unless by some miracle my body adjusts.

Hi all, I'm new to this sub, and I'm glad to find it. I've been kind of quiet to my friends about taking Zepbound because of the stigma surrounding taking a drug for weight loss. I spent most of my adult life worrying about my weight, trying numerous diets, excessive exercise, etc. I'd lose the weight and gain it back with interest within a couple years. The older I got, the harder it was to lose weight. I hated tracking food, I hated that my mental health was inextricably linked to how I felt about my body. I sorted the mental health stuff, and made a conscious decision not to try losing weight anymore. Figured fat was what I was going to be, and made as much peace with it as I could.

Two things happened early this year that convinced me to try Zepbound. The first thing was going to a local convention and walking the exhibit hall all day, which left me so sore that I was in bed all day the next day. The second thing was getting a colonoscopy, and finding out the day of the procedure (after doing all the prep) that they didn't feel comfortable sedating someone of my size in their office (when my weight hadn't changed between the previous appt and this one), and my choices were either to reschedule on a day they could do it at the hospital, or to do the procedure without sedation. I chose to go without sedation and WOW, I will never do that again. I think those 15 minutes were on par with labor (and I've done that twice).

That was my last straw, but I still wanted to do some research - I've been reading Regan Chastain's Weight and Healthcare newsletter for a while, and her view on weight loss drugs is generally skeptical-to-negative, but the research I was reading on the drug trials for the GLP1 drugs was encouraging. Then a friend of mine started on Zepbound, and after talking to them about their experiences, I was ready to talk to my GP. Surprisingly (or not, my doc has been asking me for years if I would consider bariatric surgery 🙄🙄🙄) they prescribed Zepbound right away. Took me 10 days (and 3 different pharmacies) to finally get my prescription filled, but I'm up to the max dose now and I have no regrets, even with a bit of nausea on 15mg. The food noise in my head, the constant obsession over what to eat and when, is finally, blessedly silent. I don't worry about what I'm eating; I add sugar to my coffee and eat bittersweet chocolate, but I have found that my cravings for sweets are greatly reduced in general. My meals are smaller because I'm simply not that hungry. For the first time in probably 40 years, I'm not thinking about food. It's amazing. For that alone, this medication is worth it.

I'm so glad I found this sub, it's nice to be around people who aren't judgemental about weight loss and don't fat shame.

Happy to share my stats if people want to see them, but I also understand completely if you don't. I'll just say that it's working for me, I am losing weight at a reasonable pace, and I'm able to do more in terms of movement and activity.",1,1729568744.0,antidietglp1,0,1.0,False
1g994rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1g994rn/how_do_i_tell_my_enabler_mum_that_i_am_going_no/,How do I tell my enabler mum that I am going no contact (also move out in secret advice??),"edit: i posted this another subreddit as well because i am kinda lowkey terrified and looking for all the advice i can possibly get 

My (22F) step-dad (58M) is a narcissist and complete asshole. He moved in with us in 2015 when I was 13 years old and married my mum shortly after. He has 50 shades of trauma including being a US veteran who served in afghanistan, emotionally and physically abusive parents of his own, and a bunch of other things that have resulted in severe anger issues. Growing up, getting screamed at multiple times a week while we sobbed was the normal routine for my brother and I. He uses our fear of his outbursts for get us to say and do whatever he wants (is this coercive control?? idk) 

I have a complicated relationship with my mother because of this. I understand that she is a victim in her own right and that he uses fear to control her too, but she things the sun shines out of his ass. She is constantly making excuses for him because she loves him. She is so passive and has never tried to protect me or my brother. He has her convinced that her husband should come before her kids (as she told me verbatim) and that she shouldn’t keep secrets from him ever. 

My younger brother moved out several months ago because he couldn’t take it anymore so it’s just been me at home. There was an explosive episode the other morning (i would say argument but that implies that i was saying anything back lol) and it was pretty bad. We had a “family talk” about it last night and it was basically just gaslighting 101. Please see below for a direct quote from my step dad:

“the reason I get angry is because you really agitate me. And the only people I let agitate me are the people I care about. So when I get angry at you it’s because I love you”

Yeah… anyway. My Bio Dad has been very helpful. He has found a place for me to live which I can afford on my income and is in a different city. Whenever I decided will be a good time to move out, he is going to drive down to me and help me move everything into the new place. I think it might be best to not tell my mum and step dad that I am moving until right before the move date because they have been very clear about not wanting me to move out and have been really discoursing because “I still need to learn some lessons” whatever the fuck that means. 

Once I move out, I know that I need to go no contact. do not plan on having a discussion with my step dad about going no contact because i can already tell you that that won’t go very well. But I do want to have a conversation with my mum. I understand that she is not my responsibility and that she is a grown adult, but even enough I am hurt by her, I cannot justify leaving her with him. I know I probably won’t be able to convince her that she is in an abusive marriage and deserves better but I want her to know that if she ever decided she wanted to leave, I am in her court and I will do what I can to help her. 

Do I take her out to coffee right before I move and try to get through to her? Do I write her a letter? If anyone has done something remotely similar I would really appreciate your wisdom. 

Also does anyone have advice on how to move out secretly? I don’t have my own car but my boyfriend does and so does my dad (although they both love over an hour away). I can pick a weekday to move and get domestic violence leave at my job (thanks australian government lol) so that my step dad won’t be home but my mum works from home so she will be around. i am planning on moving out in just under two weeks but i don’t know if i can get everything  together in that time :/ tips for moving quickly and quietly? 

Ultimately I am really scared for the next few weeks and I don’t know if I have it in me but I know that I can’t stay here. Any advice re: moving, no contact, or literally anything at all would make me feel slightly less terrified lol. Thank you ",3,1729568725.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1g992af,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WritingMothman/comments/1g992af/every_three_days_horror_story_part_two/,Every Three Days (Horror Story Part Two),"She was standing before Dolly.

The rain soaked her body, dirtying the dress that had already gone through Hell and back. Dolly stared up at heaven while she stared down at her. She took a deep breath and dipped to pick up the blonde from around her back and behind her knees. Dolly's scent no longer bothered the girl after so long of handling her.

""It's not ladylike to get your dress all dirty like this, Dolly."" The girl said, her eyes glued to Dolly's drawn-in features. The dead woman's head rested on her shoulder where her arm had been wrapped around her shoulders to make it easier for her to carry her.

She looked at her home, the lights glowing warmly, inviting the two inside. She rocked from one foot to the other as if nervous to speak to the corpse again. ""I think it's too late for me to take you back. I think you should stay with me tonight."" 

Dolly didn't answer.

She closed her eyes and spun around in a mock dance, the ruffle of Dolly's dress the only sound. The forest was silent in the wake of the rain and danger that lingered in the air—a warning wrapped up in the sound of drips on the roof that subtly became louder.

""We can listen to Bobby Darin. I like his music, and I think you would too…"" Before her eyes, the corpse had changed. Dark eyes trailed up to a living blonde in her arms. She looked the same from the first night that she had met her. Dolly gave her a bright smile, her cupid bow lips bright red and white teeth gleaming. She bats her eyelashes at the girl.

""Of course, you carried me here. The least I can do is listen to some Bobby Darin with you,"" Dolly said, her voice a melody to the girl's ears. The girl just stared, stunned by the being who was once dead. Dolly tilted her head and gave her a concerned look. She leaned into the dark-haired girl, making her redder by the second. An uncomfortable feeling fluttered in her stomach the closer the girl got. She knew the corpse was beautiful, but living was a different story. When Dolly was alive, she was ethereal. An angel who walked the earth in white heels and bright smiles that could blind the darkest of souls with her kindness. Her heart stuttered, and she looked away from the girl.

""Are you okay, Barbara?"" The dark-haired girl, Barbara, looked at Dolly in confusion.

""You know my name..?"" Dolly laughed at her question.

""Of course I do, silly. We've done this before. Can we get out of the rain, or will you carry me all night?"" Barbara stilled, and the color drained from her face. The man screaming in the woods alerted her, but Dolly didn't hear it. 

Dolly smiled at Barbara. She patted her back to get her into motion. The dark-haired girl approached the house, but her limbs were stiff and icy. Dolly swung her legs lightly and looked up to the sky. The rain didn't blemish the makeup on her face. Dolly reached for the doorknob and opened it for the girl who stared into her house with fear in her eyes.

Brutus sat on the floor of her home. His red eyes stared at the now-living girl and watched as Barbara put her down on her feet. She noticed the lack of a heel on one of her feet, and Dolly kicked off the other beside the door. Her pantyhose was soaked through, so she bent down to pull up the sides of her dress, the dress bundling up higher and higher until Barbara could see her underwear. Dolly stopped to look over her shoulder to make sure she was watching. Her thumbs hooked around the dryer part of the pantyhose as she gave her a grin. Barbara watched the motion with apprehension and something darker.

""You know how wet pantyhose can feel on your skin. I hope me taking them off isn't a problem."" Dolly coyly asked, her bright-colored eyes focusing on the other's every emotion and action. Barbara swallowed and looked away from the eyes that could see everything. The heat that had gathered between her legs moments ago came back with full force, and she looked away.

Dolly's cheeks were rosy as if she were bashful, but Barbara knew fully what she was doing. She knew what this meant despite the lack of human contact. She felt it in her bones with every sly eye and pull of red lips. If the Devil were in the body of Dolly, then she would submit.

""No, it's okay. You're fine with doing what you want."" Barbara quickly replied, and Dolly nodded. She finished pulling down the wet garment and stepped out of it. Barbara looked away as soon as she had these thoughts and let her eyes trail over her small home.

It was cozy. There was a floral, threadbare couch with a green blanket thrown over the top of it tucked in the corner of the room. A coffee table was placed in front of the sofa, and a red rug was tucked underneath it. There were stains from Barbara's dirty boots, but Dolly didn't notice them as she walked around the dark-haired girl and sat down on the couch that swallowed her. She pulled the blanket over herself. Her feet were tucked under her. Her arm propped up her head from the back of the couch, making her neck look long and elegant. Her hair was held back by a headband that Barbara didn't remember being on her corpse moments ago.

""You stare a lot. Do you like what you see?"" Dolly asked. The question took Barbara aback. She loved it, and her body heavily agreed with her statement. Her mind flickered to the fact she was covered in dirt and looked unladylike, but Dolly drank in the sight. The sight of a soaked white shirt that left nothing to the imagination and a thin brown vest that would be so *easy* to rip off. Strands of dark hair framed her face, and the blush on her cheeks made her eyes look darker with lust. It made Dolly feel happy.

After a few moments of silence, Barbara spoke: ""Yes, I do.""

It was admittance to what felt like a sin. How many times had her parents been wary of her actions? Of her disinterest in boys? She wondered where she met Dolly. Suppose Dolly had the same thoughts she did about other women. She wrapped her arms around herself and looked to the window where the storm raged on outside. The hate inside each drop of rain that flooded the ground outside. Every bad word and thought in the trickles of water racing down the window. A reminder that she *shouldn't* be doing what she was doing.

The rain falling down the window was just as fast as the race of her heart underneath her muddy clothes that smelled of dirt and death. She felt her hands shake, and she didn't dare look up. These things felt familiar as if she had lived them repeatedly, but at the same time, they were new. The feeling of knowing everything while knowing nothing at the same time. Why? Why is this all happening, and why is it happening now? Was it the rain? Did it bring these feelings that ran rampant inside?

It was silent after that.

Dolly stood up and walked over to Barbara. She had a conflicted look, and the womanizer she had played moments beforehand was gone. Dolly stared at the girl momentarily before looking at a redwood record player. There was a plethora of music, jazz, classical, and swing, but only one was necessary. Dolly flipped through the records before finding the one with a bright pink covering and a smiling man on the front. Bobby Darin. She flipped it over and looked through the list of songs. She carefully took it out and placed it on the record player. Immediately, you could tell something was wrong with the player; the music came out slower than the original. A symphony of slowed voices echoed into the room, and Dolly swung her hips to the beat with a smile. 

Her steps to the song led her to Barbara, who watched the girl dance towards her. Dolly cocked an eyebrow, and Barbara loosened from the curl she had around her body. Barbara stared at Dolly as she removed her gloves. Dolly's smile grew with every second, her eyes staring down at her hands like gold despite being calloused and blunt. Barbara was used to the feel of leather, but Dolly's warm skin felt just as familiar. Dolly pulled her closer and put her arms around Barbara's neck. With their chest close together, Dolly stared up at Barbara and swayed. The sound of her dress moving against her made her feel warm inside.  

""I'm not much of a dancer,"" Barbara said, pulling away to swirl the girl around, who chuckled and let herself fall back onto the other's chest. She could feel the pounding heart against her back and moved against her to the beat. Her hand reached behind her to press against the other's neck, and she took a deep breath. 

""I didn't ask if you were."" Dolly finally turned back to Barbara, and they stared at one another. An idea so immoral rolled around in the brunette's mind. She could feel her chest constrict at the thought. Everything she had run from, the feelings she had suppressed, all flooded out and poured itself into the comfort of Dolly's smirk. She danced like it was okay to do such a thing with another woman. That the batting of eyelashes and touches that lingered for far too long were allowed in a world so cruel. The storm outside beats against the roof, warning her not to give in. The sky screamed at the sinner's thoughts and threatened her with the power of God.

Dolly and Barbara stopped moving. The song was still blaring in the background as they just took in the feeling of being this close to one another. Barbara could feel the air grow thick. She held her breath as the blonde had her shoulders and pushed herself up to close the distance between them.

The feeling of soft lips against her's made her snap. The dam broke loose inside, and her heart flooded into the sweet taste of Dolly's mouth. Her eyes fluttered closed, and Dolly's hands reached behind her head to pull her long hair out of the bun. The hair fell around her face, and Dolly pulled away to look at the girl whose eyes were glazed with desire. When that sunshine smile was directed her way, Barbara knew she was a goner.

She was no longer a believer. With red lips pressed against her own, there was no God. Giving in to the temptations Dolly played with so quickly, she reached up to Dolly's face and pulled her closer to capture those sinner's lips again. Dolly laughed, her smile breaking the kiss and making Barbara smile back. She stared into her eyes, and Dolly let her fingers tangle themselves into the locks of wet, black hair.

""I remember when we met… You were always so weird in school."" Dolly chuckled and let her head fall onto Barbara's shoulder. Dolly's air fanned her neck, making her skin break out into little bumps as if her cells were trying to reach out and attach themselves further to her. Dolly reached up to one of the hands-on her face and guided it down to her waist. She kissed the sensitive skin on the junction of her neck and shoulder. The brunette forgot what she was thinking beforehand; her mind mixed feelings and electricity. Thoughts bounced around her skull, but nothing came of them. Fingertips that trailed along her scalp overpowered the words Dolly spoke.

""You liked to wear men's clothes, you never had a boyfriend, and your dad sent you off to some insane asylum, but I didn't care. While I hid it better, you and I were very similar."" Dolly reached into Barbara's arms and encouraged her to go higher until Barbara's fingers bumped into the clasp of her dress. The trim tab that led to so much more right between her fingertips. The smooth metal kept her away from the rest of Dolly's beautiful body and a point of no return. Dolly tilted her head, her lips trailing up her neck until she kissed right below her ear.

""We both liked what we couldn't have; you were too scared to accept that, as I had long ago. Do you remember Barbara? The night we both came to this house? The night you carried me here after I lost my heel in the woods and took off this dress?"" Dolly's voice was growing darker and more robust, but Barbara was still hyper-focused on the clasp in her hands. The tiny blue metal clasp made her body freeze and her heart race.

The storm outside grew louder, and her blood pumping echoed into her mind as she shook. Images of dark blood on her hands and shirt flashed through her mind. The sounds of pleasure and music before blood-curdling screams shook her core for a moment before everything stilled for Barbara. The rain was still pouring more than ever, but Dolly's voice rang louder than anything that could try and rival it.

""The night you loved me more than anyone had *ever* loved you."" Dolly sighed and pressed herself closer to Barbara.

The thin hands crawled under the shirt, and Barbara threw her head back at the touch. The hands on her body felt familiar, like the ones that had guided her to Dolly in the first place. She had a glimpse of the dead body, and the hands felt bonier than before on her skin, but she was too engrossed in the act of being touched to care. Dolly pressed her lips underneath her chin and pushed her back a little. 

""Show me that love again, show me that you love me, that those looks you gave me through all these years meant *something*, baby."" Dolly breathed into her, and Barbara opened her eyes and bent down quicker than Dolly anticipated. She pulled away and gasped when Barbara weaved her hands around her thighs and picked her up. Dolly wrapped her legs around Barbara's waist.

All thoughts she had before, everything she had resisted, melted away. Barbara's movements came out practiced and eager. She nearly fumbled with her, but Dolly leaned closer and attached her lips to her neck. 

Dolly was just as practiced.

Barbara led them to her room, her back bumping into the door that resisted her. She huffed and rolled her hips to reposition Dolly while fumbling for the door handle. Dolly yelped when she felt Barbara nearly fall onto the floor, but she held her tight and righted Dolly back onto her hips. Barbara huffed and began kissing her again. Barbara closed her eyes and drank in the feeling of being touched. Dolly opened her mouth, and Barbara's eyebrows furrowed at the odd taste and pulled away to look at Dolly, who looked embarrassed.

""Sorry, I didn't-"" Barbar kissed her again and licked her lips to encourage her to open her mouth. The taste assaulted her again, but it was early, and she could ignore it, especially since the heat pressed against her grew the more they kissed like this. Barbara took a few steps backward as Dolly fisted her hair. Finally, Barbara felt the bed bump into the backs of her knees and sat on the plush comforter. She pulled away to press kisses against her neck like Dolly had done for her beforehand; between the kisses, she spoke.

""Don't worry about it; I love you anyway,"" Barbara said. Dolly grabbed her hand. Dolly pulled her hand close enough to herself to brush against her breast, and Barbara let out a breath she didn't know she was holding. The temptation to rip off the clothes between them grew, but apprehension gripped her heart tightly. Fear of her inexperience pulling her into the present made her nervous. The last thing she wanted was to mess everything up and ruin the perfection in her lap.

""I- I've never-"" 

""Just do what feels right..."" Dolly explained, and Barbara did as she was told. She pressed her palm against one of Dolly's breasts and squeezed. Dolly took a deep breath, and Barbara could feel it through her touch. Every place Dolly touched was fire, and she wanted so badly to be burned to death. To feel this moment every time she woke up, to feel this body against her every moment she breathed. Barbara let her other hand roam her dress and feel the skin underneath her palm. The skin felt odd, leathery, and cold, but she forgot about it when Dolly pressed her lips against her temple. 

""You can take my dress off, Barbara,"" She sighed into Barbara's ear, and the girl didn't have to be told twice. Barbara's hands slid up to the clasp that determined everything, the last stop before entirely giving in to the sinful temptations she had belittled herself for. Every painful thing her mother and father said, boiling down to her, letting desire take control and turn her into the sinner she knew she was. She gripped the cold clasp and quickly jerked the zipper down, causing Dolly to gasp at the cold air suddenly hitting her back. She looked at Barbara's eyes, which were darker than they were before—lost in lust and unbridled love that boiled deep inside her soul. Barbara had never shared herself like this with anyone else. No one else *wanted* to.

Dolly *loved* Barbara; she'd be her's forever. 

The blonde hunched her shoulders and let the dress fall around her lap. Barbara stared at the girl's chest and reached behind her once again to pop off the white bra she wore. Dolly pulled the straps off her shoulders, and Barbara took it to toss it off to the side of the bed. She let her hands find their way back onto Dolly's sides, tracing patterns into porcelain skin that still felt odd under her fingertips. It was as if the skin would fall off if she pressed too hard, but that wasn't possible. Dolly tilted her head when Barbara's eyebrows furrowed for a moment. 

""Are you okay?"" Dolly asked, her delicate hands running through Barbara's hair, and the girl smiled. 

""I'm perfect, especially with you here,"" Barbara spoke, her voice soft and full of something she didn't think she could possess. She pressed her lips against her collarbone for a moment, pressing kisses along her shoulder and neck before pulling away and putting her fingers in the other girl's mouth. Dolly sucked the fingers until they were wet, and Barbara smiled before standing on the floor, her shadow towering over Dolly, who watched with a raised brow. ""Take the dress off."" 

Dolly obeyed and let her eyes flicker over Barbara, who kneeled at the edge of the bed and grabbed her ankles, pulling her down to where her feet touched the floor, but she stayed on the bed. Barbara's breath on her exposed skin made her skin scatter with glee. Little hairs stood on edge from where they had been hidden under Dolly's pantyhose. Barbara ran her hand over her legs, hooked her fingers around Dolly's panties, and pulled. Dolly's breath caught in her throat as she leaned on her elbows to watch Barbara, who stared at her intensely. Dolly put a hand over herself embarrassingly. ""I'm not the prettiest-"" 

""You're beautiful."" 

""What is then..?"" Dolly asked, unprepared for the girl to stop after things had just started to get going. Barbara put her hand on Dolly's, the heat from the blonde intoxicating as she threaded their fingers together. Her fingers were thinner than they appeared, more bony, but Barbara didn't care. She pulled the hand away and brought her lips to Dolly's sensitive area, making Dolly groan at the ghosted contact. Barbara's breath was hot against the heated skin, and she licked experimentally. Barbara whined, a loud lover she was, and used her free hand to grip Barbara's hair. 

Barbara pulled her head back, enjoying the tug from her stolen hair, and smiled. ""I just think you're perfect.""

Dolly didn't have time to answer before the fingers she had sucked before were being inserted inside of her. She gasped, and Barbara moved her fingers slowly, afraid of doing something wrong, but with every pant from the girl below her, she grew bold. She moved her fingers and curled them, drawing out whines from the girl. Barbara leaned down, her tongue darting over her, which made her gasp again and grip Barbara's hand harder. ""D-Do it.""

Barbara obeyed and stuffed her mouth over folds that reacted to the girl. Her fingers kept moving while her tongue swirled over her sensitive areas. She sucked, pulling and tasting the girl who stirred in pleasure. Her legs were soft and wrapped around her head involuntarily as Barbara got lost in the action of bringing Dolly to an orgasm. The sound of sucking, moans, and Dream Lover still playing on repeat in the background brought Barbara to unimaginable happiness. She kept going, sucking and pulling and pushing until finally, Dolly couldn't take it anymore. She cried and melted, her hand falling from Barbara's hair, leaving it a mess as the girl pulled away. Her lips were slick with Dolly's love, and when she looked up to Dolly, she screamed. 

Dolly was a corpse again. 

Barbara nearly passed out at the sight.

She couldn't believe it. The naked sight of the corpse sprawled out before her. Dolly was in a position of vulnerability, and she was the one who put her there. She felt sick, and then the taste assaulted her senses first. The feeling of smeared remanets of decay and piss and shit on her mouth made her turn and vomit.

Maggots crawled into her throat, making her gag. She coughed, hoping to eliminate the feeling of bugs in her throat, but to no avail. The blackened walls of the woman she had just eaten stared back at her as she stood up, her limbs shaking and face pale as a sheet. She nearly slipped on her vomit that held pieces of decay and dirt.

*She had fucked a corpse* played on repeat in her mind. She stumbled out of the room, her hand slamming on the door, causing a loud bang to echo throughout the house. Barbara coughed some more, the wet sound interrupting the faint sound of Bobby Darin's: *""Dream Lover, where are you? With love, oh, so true! And the hand I can hold, to feel you near as I grow old!""*

Barbara gripped her hair and felt hot tears roll down her cheeks. She gasped, she hiccuped, she *bawled*. She cried so hard the sound of her hyperventilating reigned over the music. Her body curled, and she vomited again. The only things that came out were dead maggots and stomach acid. She tried to breathe normally again, her chest expanding and deflating quickly. She counted to herself, telling her body to calm down with every timed breath. She fell to the floor, her back pressing against the wall and her body shaking. She closed her eyes and gripped her slacks for some semblance of comfort. Finally, after a few moments, Barbara's blood dropped to her feet at a sound she thought she'd never hear again. 

""Barbara!"" It was Dolly. The sound of a zipper being pulled up and tiny feet pitter-pattering down the hall made Barba freeze. Her vision stayed locked on the ground. Afraid to look over at the corpse she had fucked. Her quick breathing returned tenfold, the footsteps grew closer, and Barbara darted like a wild cat into the kitchen. ""Barbara! What's wrong? g! What happened? Did I do something wrong?"" 

Barbara searched the kitchen with shaky hands for a knife. She grabbed a sturdy-looking blade that was thick and familiar in her hands. She had cut so many things with this knife, things she didn't even know about. She waved the blade around, her eyes falling onto Dolly, who looked shocked by Barbara's actions. She looked normal again, her dress clean and cut marks gone. She looked nothing like she had before. Her skin was healthy, her cheeks pink from her post-orgasm, and her hair was messy from being pressed into the bed. Her lipstick was smeared from kissing Barbara.  

""D-Don't come closer,"" Barbara said. 

Dolly held her hands up and looked fearfully from the knife to the crazed girl. Her dark locks fell into her face, and her eyes were wild with fear. ""I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what's wrong."" 

Barbara shook, her blade faltering for a second before she gripped it tighter. Her eyes twisted shut, the hot tears building up in the corners of her eyes, and then she blinked them away. Her heart still raced in her chest, but she didn't let the fear control her. She already had her panic. She didn't need it now that she was facing the center of her worries. The woman who seduced her into sin. The woman who waltzed into her life and changed her every day. The woman who was *dead,* yet still came back. ""What are you, sh-she demon."" 

""I'm your friend, your *lover-*"" 

""No! No, you're not! You're a liar; you seduced me, then tricked me!"" 

Dolly looked confused. ""I love you, Barbara, I wouldn't trick you! I love you!"" 

""S-Stop, stop talking!"" Dolly slowly put her hands down as Barbara cried. Dolly approached her cautiously, put her skinny fingers on Barbara's head, and ran them through the girl's hair, which shook under the weight of her own emotions. She pulled her closer to her chest and gasped when she felt something stab into her stomach. Dolly froze, pain blistering her stomach as Barbara looked up to her through dark bangs. Dolly stumbled back, looking down at her stomach where the blade stuck out of her body. She went to grab and pull it out, but Barbara beat her to the punch. She yanked it out of Dolly, blood splattering with it, making Barbara cringe. 

""W-Why?"" Dolly asked. Her eyes watering painfully as she gripped her stomach. Barbara stared at the blade, then back at the woman. She still looked alive, but Barbara couldn't trust herself. She was petrified of Dolly, the person she was supposed to love. She could hardly believe what was happening. None of it felt real. When Barbara looked back up to Dolly, who had stumbled away from her, she pressed herself against the wall. Her bloody hand stabilized her, causing a smear in the shape of her delicate hand.

She pushed herself off the wall, running out the door as fast as her pained body would allow. Barbara didn't think twice about following her. Following her into the rain that fell so hard, it flattened her poisonous flowers in her treacherous home. She gripped the knife and ran outside, where Dolly tried to run but fell, her pain too excruciating for her to handle. She screamed for help, but not a soul could hear her. Not then and not now. 

Barbara towered over and straddled her, dropping to her knees harshly around Dolly's waist. Dolly screamed again, her hands gripping onto Barbara's wrist to avoid the knife in her hand that hovered over her stomach once again. Dolly's figure flickered from corpse to girl, hurting Barbara's heart. Dolly screamed, this time toward Barbara, whose eyes were vacant and red. ""Why!"" 

""You s-seduced me, I'm-I'm going to Hell. My parents were right."" 

Dolly writhed below her and shook her head. ""No! You're not going to Hell because of love-!"" 

""God said-!"" 

""God isn't *here!* God gave us this place and love so we could be together! It doesn't have to be like this, Barbara!"" Dolly cried, her voice cracking with the intensity of her emotions. Her dress was soaked, much like Barbara's white shirt. Dolly took in a deep breath and let go of the girl. ""I love you."" 

Barbara stared. Started. Started. Started.  

Finally, she said: ""I'm sorry."" 

The rain overpowered the sound of the girl being stabbed again. Again. Again. Dolly's cries eventually died out, and the blood poured all over her. Ruining that pretty floral dress she wore. Barbara stopped stabbing after a few minutes of Dolly's silence. She huffed out, exhausted from the murder she had committed. She looked up, and there, in the rain, was the dog from this morning.

Brutus. He watched her. He sat with his big paws, leaving marks in the mud as she panted. The rain drenched her skin, making her heavier than anticipated. She stood up, her finger pointing at the dog while her knife sat in her other hand. ""You did this, Devil! You made me do it!"" 

The dog barked at her naive insolence. She was the only one at fault, and he would ensure she re-lived this terror repeatedly until finally she learned. The dog's bark was blistering to her ears. She covered them with her bloody hands before she looked down at Dolly, who stared at the sky blankly. The rain died, and Barbara could see what she had done correctly. The lights of her porch shine onto Dolly's blood, making it look a sickly brown that stained the concrete she laid on.

Barbara took in deep breaths and went back inside. She threw the knife into the sink before going to her closet, picking out her dad's boots, putting them on, and wishing they weren't so big. Her hair was placed back into a bun like before Dolly took it out. She went to her shed and grabbed a pair of gloves, a shovel, Red Devil Lye, and a wheelbarrow with the flax seeds package in it.

She repeated the same process this morning.

Taking Dolly's limb body out into the forest that fluttered its poor heart for the girl slumped in Barbara's arms. The girl was killed by the woman she loved and was never found by the ones who cared about her. Barbara laid her on the ground softly, kissing her temple before flicking the dirt over her body until the forgiving earth consumed her. The flowers are growing from the ground and sprouting happily in memory of the forgotten lover. Barbara returned home, put her things away, stripped off her clothes, scrubbed them clean, and went to sleep.

Three days later, she had forgotten about the whole ordeal.

I was recently feel confused by a thing that is  a customer who come in my workplace frequently (but not a regular customer)

She comes serval times but every time when she place order , she always ask me to do
“More frothy, more texture “.

So I try to make as froth as possible, but it still happens, I did ask her explain what she really want but every time still same results,
Because I’m not natural speaker, so I’m quite confused about this.

I mean I don’t mind make special for people but just I really need to know what is that .

So I’m just wondering if there have anyone else who happy to explain this for me .
I will really appreciate it 😭

I do best (as I’m assuming most of us do) when I’m following a routine, and that becomes considerably easier when I’m not staring at my phone for hours at night staying up way too late, or waking up and immediately looking at my phone. 

My method with this device (when I’m following a good routine) is to lock my phone up one hour before I’m ready to go to sleep, and set the timer for it to unlock one hour after I wake up. This would be different for everyone depending on their schedule and preferences, just stating what works for me.

When my phone is locked up for the first hour I’m awake, I tend to get out of bed more easily and quickly, and go straight to a cup of coffee and my yoga mat.

Tbh there are some red flags about her - e.g. we bonded over both being sober, but then when she found out her ex of 5 years, Mira (42F), didn’t want to get back together, she went back to heavy drinking and using drugs. Her alcohol use led to her getting charged with a crime that I will not disclose, and she lost her job as it requires working with vulnerable people.

Laura initially told me she was getting sued by someone at work and then a few months later, told me she was dishonest about the actual charges. To be frank, the actual charges are worse than I could have ever imagined. She lost some friends because of these charges but a few, myself included, stuck around. I understand that Laura is going through a hard time; the majority of our conversations revolve around her but I like to think that she just has a lot going on and may be struggling to cope with some very big problems and possible changes. My long-term partner (33M) is understandably concerned about my friendship with Laura being one-sided but also knows that I am someone who likes to give people the benefit of the doubt, even to a fault. 

Laura recently ended things with Michelle (28F) after about a month. They were exclusive but Laura did not want to use titles such as “girlfriends.” A few days prior to Laura ending things, Laura told me she was annoyed with Michelle calling her “her girl” in front of her friends. So my impression was that while they were exclusive, they weren’t very serious.

Since meeting, Michelle and I have gotten along really well and exchanged numbers and socials the last time we saw each other. I had no idea that Laura was not very interested in Michelle until about a week ago when she broke things off, stating that she needed to be honest with herself that she just was not very interested in Michelle. I didn’t ask any details so I don’t know the full story. 

Over the weekend, Michelle texted me saying she will be in town and asked if I was free to go for coffee. I said yes and we arranged a time/place. The next day, Laura said she felt “weird” and “uncomfortable” that Michelle and I were “friends” because of the negative things she told me about Michelle. I didn’t realize that she and Michelle were still talking and Michelle told her about this. I was planning on telling Laura about the coffee date after it happened, as I know she has a lot going on and didn’t want to bother her with the “what ifs” of something that from my perspective, is very insignificant. Honestly, I was thinking about reaching out to Michelle for coffee, but wasn’t going to do so until at least 4-6 weeks after their breakup to give it some time. I also didn’t think of Michelle as a friend as we’ve never hung out outside of a group setting with Laura, but was open to being friends with her if the breakup was amicable and after a conversation with Laura.

For the last two days, Laura has been texting me about how she doesn’t have negative feelings towards Michelle but feels “uncomfortable” about us going for coffee. She also said that I am an important person to her and our relationship is “sacred.” I told her I didn’t expect Michelle to reach out to me, but I do like her as a person and didn’t think going for coffee would be an issue. I also clarified that Michelle knows that Laura and I are friends, so she would be wrong to start talking negatively about Laura, if that’s what she’s worried about. Further, Michelle and I have never even talked about Laura aside from one comment about how good she was at bowling. Typically my conversations with Laura revolve around each other - we’ve only ever talked about our career aspirations and family lives. A lot of these align which is why I could understand why she reached out. 

I recognize I could be misinformed about the situation. I also just found out that Michelle is no longer talking to Laura and has her blocked. Laura mentioned that heterosexual and homosexual relationships are different so my agreement to go for coffee with Michelle was “invasive.” AITA?",1,1729567850.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

Recently, I was venting to a friend about my overly sensitive child. We traded stories about our kids' struggles with adult independence. It's a strange feeling - like money, we enjoy having our children around, but managing their affairs drives us to frustration.

Here's the thing: My childhood wasn't special or uniquely challenging. Like many others, I was practically a mini-adult by age 6-8. To my fellow Gen Xers reading this - if you're nodding along, you know exactly what I mean. We survived:

- Our questionable life choices

- Battles with addiction

- Legal troubles

- The loss of friends along the way

Now in 2024, many of us find ourselves:

- Parenting 30-somethings like they're teenagers

- Operating as their personal ATM

- Watching our adult children struggle with basic life skills

The irony isn't lost on me: our 8-year-old selves would have probably bullied our own kids for being so soft. We would have treated them like the annoying younger siblings we had to toughen up.

If you're looking at your adult children and thinking about how you navigated life's challenges at half their age - and survived to tell the tale - you're not alone. We're a generation caught between our resilient upbringing and our perhaps too-protective parenting style.

The contrast between who we were as kids and who our children are as adults is striking. Sometimes I wonder: Did we make life too easy for them by trying to protect them from the hardships that shaped us?



**Coming of Age: A Personal Story**

When I started my senior year of high school, my father gave me clear expectations: upon graduation, I needed to attend college or find a job, but either way, I would need to move out. I spent that last summer at home, and when I left, my parents converted my saved ""rent money"" into a starter fund for my new life.

I moved 300 miles away for college. My first apartment, costing $265 monthly with utilities included, was basic - no stove, just a hotplate for heating soup and making grilled cheese sandwiches. Though only 17, I presented myself as 19, and in those simpler times, ID checks were less stringent than today's world where even buying coffee requires sharing personal information.

**The Generational Cycle**

Our family story reflects the saying: ""Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times."" Our parents, who lived through the Depression, World War II, and the Korean War, earned just 85 cents an hour. They raised us to be responsible and self-sufficient, often caring for younger family members - siblings, cousins, or nieces and nephews. We learned to share and sometimes do without.

**The Unintended Consequence**

When we had our own families, we tried to give them an easier life than ours, perhaps too easy. This created an unfortunate cycle:

* Less responsibility
* Fewer decisions to make
* Limited life experience

Our self-sufficiency became our handicap. We developed a ""Superman mentality,"" always doing things ourselves or helping others, never letting anyone fail. This created a dependent mindset in our families: ""Mom will do it"" or ""Dad will bail me out."" The worst part? We enable this behavior by following through.

**The Breaking Point**

Even when faced with health issues or physical limitations from living in different states, we push ourselves to exhaustion. Instead of asking for help, we plead for less burden. Frustration leads to harsh words:

* ""I'm glad you don't work for me - you'd have to pay me! I work harder fixing your screw than just doing it myself in the first place.""
* ""How can you not handle simple things?""
* ""I raised you better than this!""
* ""Are you an I-can or an I-can't person?""
* ""I would rather have a three-legged dog because they can still successfully retrieve! Bring the broom, which doesn't mean yelling, 'I think I saw it in the kitchen!' while remaining on the couch!'

And that's how the silent treatment begins - a cycle of frustration, harsh words, and emotional distance. The millennial/GenZ retaliation...I won't text you or talk to you. This is until they need money, help to move, car trouble, home plumbing, or repair.

As college went on we became best friends, bonding over our nerdy interests, books, being raised very religious and figuring out how to navigate leaving that, etc. Even in the beginning of the friendship I noticed her being possessive of my time/relationships but always chalked it up to her being from a small town, being raised as an only child and not having many friends. She would say things like “you’re going to leave me and find better friends” or “you’re always choosing x over me” etc. She’s never liked any of my other female friends and always finds reasons to hate any boyfriends I’ve had over the years. 

Backstory on Jamie, she was raised more strictly religious than I, by a single mother who had her as a teen. She has never been in a relationship, never kissed anyone or had sex, etc. and claims to be straight whilst hating most men and being severely shy/embarrassed even talking to guys. I have brought up in multiple instances if she’s ever thought she could be bi or lesbian but she flat out denies it defensively. I have always told her it’s nothing to be ashamed of if she was, but always dropped the subject.


We have kept up over the years but I have really found a niche with my career and found my coworkers/friends who I feel mesh with me the most and Jamie has been very possessive and persistent about me never making time for her anymore. I will admit when we hang out I find myself feeling drained, depressed and suffocated due to her insecurities about our friendship. It’s pushed me away to the extent that I don’t want to be friends anymore. I feel awful because I know I’m the only one who is her friend that is her age. She doesn’t know what she wants career wise and always complains about this but shoots down any suggestions or encouragement I have tried to give her. 

My coworkers have begin to suspect that Jamie is in love with me. Although she’s never hit on me or made any advances, the behaviors do add up. She randomly comes into my job to bring me coffee/ presents, or buys me super sentimental or expensive gifts for my birthday or holidays and again she always complains about my other friends spending time with me, guys and girls and really doesn’t like it when I date. 

I don’t know what to do to stop this. I’ve had conversations with her previously that I don’t like possessiveness and explained that I am fiercely independent but she always reiterates all her failed friendships and how everyone “abandons” her. I don’t want to abandon her but at the same time I’m over this behavior and people grow apart. Any advice for how to break up with a best friend is appreciated.

1g98tvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g98tvs/i_always_listen_to_my_bf_is_there_something_wrong/,"I always listen to my BF, is there something wrong with me? ","I genuinely feel like there’s something wrong with me because whenever I have a crush or fall in love, I can’t help but follow whatever the guy says. I 22F currently dating a 27M, and even before we started dating, I noticed myself slipping back into this pattern—like I become a complete bot, doing everything a man tells me. For example, my boyfriend asked me to stop drinking coffee in the afternoon because it wasn’t good for my sleep, and I quit completely, even though I was working two jobs at the time, and I was a serious caffeine addict. 

I have my own personality and values, and I’ve never compromised my morals, so it doesn’t really bother me on that level. But it scares me how much I change when I start liking someone. I once wanted to work at a gas station near my college, but my boyfriend at the time told me not to, so I didn’t. Another guy I liked told me not to go to a party, and I stayed home. When it comes to big decisions, I feel paralyzed unless I get their opinion. I’ve never told any guy I’ve dated about this because I’m scared of being taken advantage of. I also tend to rationalize the changes I make, I also lie to my bf / crush on why I changed my opinion. 

Is there something wrong with me? I don’t think I have “daddy issues,” though a couple of my friends think that might be the cause. I know I’m smart and capable of making my own decisions, but when I let my guard down with a guy, it’s like a switch flips, and suddenly I’m weak In the knees 😭 I’ve only dated two guys, my current boyfriend being the second, and I’ve never done anything casual because I know I’d lose my mind, idk how people get over being done dirty time after time, cuz ik id land in jail. People have told me to gain more experience with men, but I don’t want to go through emotional turmoil just to learn how to detach.

I’m not someone who’s male-centered either—I genuinely avoid and dislike 99.99% of men. This only happens when I develop strong feelings for someone or get into a relationship. And I know I fell out of love with my ex after I started ignoring his feelings and opinions. Is it weird for me to like doing everything a man wants me to do, i legit feel sick typing this out 😭😭, I’m a complete bot, and I’m nvr going to admit this publicly or ever tell a man this. 

Anyways what can I do, do I need serious help?

TLDR: I 22f find myself listening to everything a man I like/ love tells me, ofc I don’t compromise my morals or change my personality, is there something wrong with me, am I I being overly paranoid? Do I need to change? ",1,1729567703.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Query:

As Sophia Borden knows, being eleven isn’t easy—especially when you’re a Colour Weaver. Being a Colour Weaver means controlling colour, chasing strange creatures, and making sure all the world’s colours stay where they should. Weavers are essential to the balance of the world. They keep the sky blue, the grass green, and that annoying coffee ring on your grandma's favourite table brown.

Of course, Sophia knows none of this—yet. But she is about to learn. When it is first discovered that Sophia is a Weaver, she is taken through a portal to the world of Chroma to study. There, Sophia is told she must leave behind her ordinary sister in the regular world. Sophia doesn’t want to do this, and so she agrees to apprentice under Miriam Loughborough in exchange for Loughborough's help to live in both worlds.

However, Sophia soon learns why no other student had ever volunteered to work with Loughborough; she is intimidating, cranky, more than a little eccentric, and her help always comes with a price. Things at the Colour Weaver academy, Everbright, are becoming strange (even by Weaver standards). Colour is leaking and changing, people are growing more emotional, and Chroma’s critters are running wild. This last problem is perhaps the worst for Sophia, who is tasked with hunting these creatures through disgusting sewers. Although, it’s still somehow more enjoyable than maths class.

As fights begin to break out and colour starts disappearing, Everbright becomes on the verge of falling apart. If Everbright falls, the regular world risks descending into the same chaos. Someone needs to discover who is behind these events and why. Much to Sophia’s dismay, Loughborough is certain that person is her. It should be simple: she only needs to spy on her friends, avoid her enemies, save the day, and somehow keep her sister from discovering who she really is—all while being the newest and most useless student at Everbright Academy.

If she’s going to get through it, Sophia will need to find her voice and her courage. Fortunately, she won’t be alone.",1,1729567149.0,PubTips,3,1.0,False

""Brewing Love"" is a heartwarming tale of unexpected romance, family, and the perfect cup of coffee.

Raina Matthews, a single mother and owner of The Daily Grind coffee shop in Battle Creek, Michigan, has sworn off love after a painful divorce. Her life revolves around her precocious daughter Lily and the comforting routine of grinding beans and pulling espresso shots. But when Mary Winters, the new HR director at the local hospital, walks into her shop, Raina's carefully constructed world begins to shift.

As the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, so does the undeniable chemistry between Raina and Mary. Their budding romance is as rich and complex as the perfect roast, but it's not without its challenges. Raina must navigate co-parenting with her ex-husband Jack, while Mary grapples with the demands of her high-pressure job.

With the support of a colorful cast of characters – from the loyal customers of The Daily Grind to Raina's fiercely protective best friend Zoe – Raina and Mary embark on a journey of love, self-discovery, and creating a blended family.

Set against the backdrop of small-town America, ""Brewing Love"" explores the bittersweet complexities of second chances, the strength found in chosen families, and the courage it takes to open your heart again. It's a story that reminds us that like the perfect cup of coffee, love is worth the wait and best when shared.

Heartfelt, honest, and as comforting as your favorite latte, ""Brewing Love"" is a must-read for anyone who believes in the transformative power of love – and a good cup of joe.

I'm in my 30s. I've only ever had 1 GF when I was 17. Who promptly cheated on me. Literally had the other guy show up at her door at 3AM. Hadn't seen her since.

Haven't had a GF in 10+ years. Or anyone even show any interest.

Then finally, a couple months ago, a girl actually said yes to getting coffee after meeting her at a coffee shop when I was working out of state. We saw each other a couple more times here and there since I wasn't in that office.

Then BOOM... I got a 5 month assignment to that office... and we suddenly started seeing 3-4 times a week.

OMG, did I finally have a GF? I asked if she wanted to date me, and she said ""maybe""

....

I thought we were dating?

Guess not. Guess that's not what that means.

After another 2 months with her basically sleeping over every night... I was about to tell her I love her and ask her again, she suddenly said ""I love you"" as we were watching TV. Omg it finally happened. I said it back, and wooo things were going great.

But had to go back to my home city, but I made damn sure I got assigned there more often. Even without an assignment, I would just drive 4 hours there every weekend to see her. So from Aug to Sept, I was there from Thu-Sun.

But her mental illness got really bad. She missed her medications.. .she started hallucinating and her mental illness is deteriorating. She has glimpses of when she's normal, and she's on her meds again.

A mutual friend of ours (her friend) told me she's never seen her this bad, and it usually only lasts a week, but this time, it's been 5 weeks...

During her ""normal"" phase yesterday, she was back to being coherent and talkative again so... maybe it's looking good.

Suddenly she tells me ""I was lying when I said I love you, I'm sorry.""

I was like ""why did you even say it then?""

""Just to be nice. I only see you as a friend. I only stayed with you because I needed a place to sleep when I was in the city. I never loved you""

I've previously bought a few slimes from them so I figured why not. I'm mostly posting this to talk about the chicken noodle soup one, but I'm including my impressions of the other 3 as well just because.

**Chicken Noodle Soup!**  
**Texture**: clear  
**Scent**: chicken noodle soup  
Oh my god. It smells SO good. It's not just like a chicken bouillon sort of scent; it actually smells like REAL chicken soup. There's a hint of veggies and spices in there! This was probably meant to be more of a novelty slime, but I genuinely love it. It's nice and thick, with fake noodles, veg, and spices. I can't even really play with it yet because it just came in and it's sticky, but I don't even care. It's immediately one of my favorites, if only just for the delightfully realistic scent. It looks like they're sold out now, so I'm glad I bought one.

**Birthday Cake Ice Cream**  
**Texture**: butter  
**Scent**: birthday cake  
This one smells just like cake icing. It's nice and soft and fluffy, like playing with a handful of buttercream. There's nothing super unique about it, but it's lovely all the same.

**Pumpkin Spice Cow**  
**Texture**: cloud creme  
**Scent**: pumpkin spice latte  
To me, this smells almost exactly like their Apple Cider Donut slime, just without the hint of apple. It's more of just pumpkin spice--I don't smell coffee or anything. The cow fimos are so cute! I haven't been able to play with this one much yet, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to love it as much as the Apple Cider Donut, which was my first super-inflating slime.

**Ducky Booty**  
**Texture**: crunchy microfloam  
**Scent**: caramel popcorn  
Not my favorite. It just sort of smells like chemical-y to me and not at all like caramel popcorn. This is the first time I've bought a floam slime, and I think maybe the texture just isn't my thing? I'm definitely going to revisit it in a few days to see if my opinion has changed, though, because that's happened before.

I love Parakeet Slimes! I'm relatively new to this whole slime thing, so I haven't bought from TOO many shops (Momo, Razberry, Slime Senpai, Slime Fantasies are the only other ones), but Parakeet's seem to last pretty long. My favorite thing about them, though, is that their scents are light. I can't handle overpowering scents, especially perfumy type things. Parakeet's scents are generally true to what they claim to smell like, too, which is important.

In conclusion, 10/10 will buy again, except for microfloam lol",2,1729566215.0,Slime,0,0.75,False

I took the job because it’s 21 an hour which was the same amount I was making at my last job as a teachers aide. I needed a break from working with kids and thought this would be a chill gig. The thing is they take all of my digital tips (which is like 80% of my tips). I also only get paid until 5 pm but I am always there until 630 often times 7 UNPAID. This is because the store takes so long to clean that if I don’t clean it correctly it will literally be violating health codes. If I don’t stay late to clean my coworkers the next day will be fucked over and I risk getting fired. I also work alone every shift with no breaks. I am paid for 30 hours a week but I am basically working 37 hours a week with mostly none of my tips being given to me. I work 6 days a week. I’m having back problems and the worst acne of my life and I’m only 25 years old. Would it be fucked up of me to just quit on the spot today?

Their response to it in my opinion is absolutely insane given that I have had multiple google reviews from customers mentioning what a great barista I am, I have been praised by my bosses for how well I’m doing verbally multiple times over text and in person, and I have brought in a number of new regulars into their shop. I know for a fact I wasn’t horrible at my job. Here is first the quitting text that I sent them: 

QUITTING TEXT 

“I am writing to formally resign from my position, effective immediately.
I wanted to express my gratitude for barista training that you provided. I genuinely respect the hard work and dedication it takes to run a small business in New York City, especially given the challenges involved.

However, I have significant concerns regarding several practices at the workplace that I believe violate the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and my rights as an employee:
	
1.	Digital Tips: my digital tips are being taken without my consent, which violates the provision that tips are the property of the employee under FLSA Section 3(m). Customers believe their tips are going directly to me, and the lack of transparency in this practice is troubling.
	2.	Unpaid Work: I am frequently assigned tasks that require me to work beyond my scheduled hours, often until 6:30 or 7 PM, without compensation. This practice violates the FLSA, which mandates that employees must be paid for all hours worked.
	3.	Expectation of Off-the-Clock Work: When I raise concerns about the time required to complete these tasks, I am told to work harder to finish by my scheduled end time. This expectation contradicts the FLSA's regulations against requiring employees to work off the clock, which is intended to protect workers’ rights to fair compensation.

In New York State, the New York Labor Law (NYLL) requires employers to pay employees for all hours worked and specifically mandates that tips belong to the employee, as outlined in NYLL § 196-d. This law ensures that employees receive their earned wages and tips without unauthorized deductions.

Given these circumstances, I request full compensation for any unpaid hours and tips owed to me. By my calculations I have worked at least an hour overtime for every closing shift I have done by myself at your store. I am not sure what the exact amount of digital tips are that are owed to me but on the iPad yesterday I saw that over 200 dollars of digital tips were earned by all the baristas throughout the day. I hope this message encourages you to reconsider these practices for the benefit of future employees. While I am a loyal and hard working person these are practices that I cannot tolerate anywhere that I work. Whenever you calculate how much you owe me you can send it to the Venmo down below or mail it to me in the form of a check. Let me know what would work best for you. If you are not willing to compensate me for my unpaid work I will have to send in a request myself to the NYS department of labor.”

Ok and here is THEIR RESPONSE:

THE RESPONSE 

Dear Susan, you should read the law before trying to blackmail us. For your information, 8$ out of every 18$ hourly salary (already a huge compensation for your weeks long part time work as a trainee) was tip credit. That exceeds the total amount our business and team has received during your shifts, so in case you will insist in your defamations, we will be forced to hire an attorney and ask for damages and all the amounts we overcompensated you with back. We did our best, all of our team did, with you but you were honestly the worst trainee/employee we ever had. Everyone will be glad you finally quit. You will find your last compensation in your account in 2 business days. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours


This is all just so manipulative and hurtful. I am truly in shock…I am definitely going to file a complaint with the department of labor this week. ",1,1729566201.0,Serverlife,2,1.0,False

1g98cs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRobotVacuums/comments/1g98cs9/roborock_q_revo_review/,Roborock Q Revo Review,"I’ve always been a fan of keeping my home spotless, but let’s be real—cleaning can be a chore, especially with a busy schedule. That’s when I decided to invest in the Roborock Q Revo, hoping it would take some of the burden off my shoulders. After using it for a few weeks, I can confidently say it’s been a game-changer for my cleaning routine. This vacuum and mop combo goes beyond just vacuuming—it truly delivers a hands-free experience with some incredible features.

**My Experience**

When I first set up the Roborock Q Revo, I was skeptical about how much it could actually do. My house has a mix of hardwood floors, rugs, and one very curious dog, so I was looking for something versatile and low-maintenance. This thing has really impressed me, especially with its mop-washing and drying dock, which has cut down my need to constantly check on it. And trust me, I was thrilled when I realized I could leave it for almost seven weeks without worrying about the mop getting stinky or the base needing attention!

**What Makes the Roborock Q Revo Stand Out:**

* **Multifunctional Dock with Auto Mop Washing and Hot Air Drying**: One of my favorite features is the dock that cleans and dries the mop pads automatically. No more smelly mops or mildew! The hot air drying system ensures that everything stays fresh, even if you don’t empty the dock for weeks. I’ve gone nearly two months without having to clean the base manually, and it still feels like the first day.  
* **Dual Spinning Mops**: The mops spin at 200 RPM, and the 30 adjustable water flow levels are perfect for tweaking the amount of water based on the type of floor. I’ve noticed that even tough stains—like dried-up coffee spills—get scrubbed off with ease, leaving my floors spotless. It really helps cut down on scrubbing sessions after meals or pet accidents.  
* **Auto Mop Lifting to Protect Carpets**: This feature blew my mind! The Roborock Q Revo knows when it’s approaching carpet and lifts the mops automatically to prevent streaking. I don’t have to worry about the mops dragging dirty water onto my carpets. My living room rug stays clean and dry while the hardwood areas get a deep clean—it's like having a vacuum and mop in one smart device.  
* **5500Pa Suction Power**: With this level of suction, even the finest dust and pet hair don’t stand a chance. My dog sheds a lot, especially around the corners and under the couch. But the Q Revo's 5500Pa suction power pulls up everything in one go. Even after a week, I barely notice any dirt buildup.  
* **Precise Obstacle Avoidance and LiDAR Navigation**: The Roborock Q Revo has never once gotten stuck on cords or shoes, which happens way too often with other vacuums. Thanks to its obstacle avoidance and LiDAR navigation, it maps my house perfectly and cleans exactly where I want it to. You can even customize which rooms it cleans and when, which makes it super convenient for busy days.  

**Overall**

The Roborock Q Revo has completely transformed how I approach cleaning. Its ability to vacuum, mop, and self-clean means I spend less time maintaining it and more time enjoying a clean home. If you’re looking for a device that delivers powerful cleaning with minimal effort on your part, the Q Revo is an excellent choice. Just keep in mind that it’s a bit of an investment, but for the convenience and peace of mind it brings, I think it’s worth every penny.",1,1729566191.0,TheRobotVacuums,0,1.0,False
1g98cgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1g98cgq/hijab_does_not_prevent_rape/,Hijab Does Not Prevent Rape,"I had a frustrating conversation recently with a Muslim woman who claims to be very religious—someone who prays five times a day, goes to the mosque every Friday, and strictly follows Islamic practices. Despite her devotion, she holds a deeply problematic view about women and rape. She argued that if women dressed modestly, wore the hijab, and covered their bodies, they wouldn’t be harassed or raped by men. It’s disheartening to hear such a perspective, especially coming from a woman. 

I chose to listen to her, not wanting to argue. A question lingered in my mind: ""If a non-Muslim woman were raped by a Muslim man, would it still be the woman's fault for not wearing a hijab? Should the man be excused because of her choice of clothing?"" But instead of confronting her directly, left it to Allah swt, trusting that He will guide her to the right path of thinking in time.

She now then shared a troubling story about a political family in one of the oldest municipality in Mindanao. She said the men in this family were notorious for targeting young women in the community-inviting these girls for coffee and eventually luring them to hotels to exploit them. Many of these women were minors. I couldn't help but ask, ""Shouldn't the men be held accountable?
They're the predators, and those girls are minors.""
Her response shocked me: ""If you're not malandi/pokpok, you wouldn't go with the man in the first place.""

I was speechless. It's incredibly concerning to hear someone, especially a woman, place the blame on young girls for being preyed upon by men. This kind of thinking is dangerous because it excuses predatory behavior and shifts responsibility away from the perpetrators onto the victims-many of whom are vulnerable, underage girls. These men are in positions of power and influence, yet instead of holding them accountable, she placed the blame on the girls, perpetuating the toxic mindset that a woman's behavior or attire somehow justifies the actions of a predator.

And how many times do we need to emphasize, on every social media platform and in every discussion, that rape is never the woman’s fault? It doesn’t matter how she dresses or what she wears. The responsibility lies entirely with the rapist. It’s troubling to see how victim-blaming persists 😔",6,1729566164.0,exmuslim,3,1.0,False

1g98bx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1g98bx3/cant_work_for_casino_anymore/,Can't work for casino anymore.,"Hi everyone, my fiancée (20F) and I (23M) have been working at a casino for 4 years (me) and 2 years (her) in the Food and Beverage department. It’s been a rough experience, and I’ve given up hope that things will improve.

Our department is always understaffed and overworked, with constant events and giveaways adding to the chaos. We’re mistreated by both guests and upper management, although middle management is tolerable despite enforcing some questionable rules.

A few months ago, our trailer burned down. As we were new to park living, we didn’t know insurance was an option. Thankfully, my mother used her settlement from an accident (which I took 3 months off to help her recover from) to help us clean up the lot. She’s also given us her old house, but we had to take on $30,000 of debt to remodel it because the property is honestly junk.

Back to the casino—my fiancée and I have been stuck on swing shifts (Wednesday-Sunday), the busiest days and times, which has left us both burned out. The pay isn’t great, and we’ve been trying to get her promoted to a bartender for a year. She’s worked as a barista at the coffee bar, which also serves cocktails, earning $17.50/hr plus about $2/hr in tips. Bartenders, on the other hand, make significantly more, ranging from $25/hr on a slow night to $70/hr on busy nights. That kind of money could really help us with our financial struggles and allow us to start planning for a family.

When the casino announced a $33 million expansion, we thought this would finally be her chance to train as a bartender. Instead, they’ve moved her from one position to another near the bar without actually training her. Now they want to make her a Beverage Server, a role we’ve been strongly against.

Beverage Servers wear very short skirts and are essentially eye candy for guests, many of whom are older men. We understand that dealing with inappropriate behavior can come with the job, but the casino doesn’t actively discourage it. Beverage Servers have shared horror stories, and women are told they can only call security if a guest physically touches them. Even then, the guest only gets a warning, and verbal harassment is considered ‘part of the job.’

I’ve also faced this issue. I’ve been threatened at work, but management does nothing. I’m not allowed to refuse service to rude or inappropriate guests, which includes those who sexually harass employees.

There are so many other problems. Our hours were cut from 40 to 34 per week due to the construction (budgeting because of the expansion). My stepmother, a former card dealer, was assaulted by a guest who was back playing the next day. Our employee parking was given to guests, so we now have to walk 5-10 minutes to get to our entrance, while upper management expanded their own parking right next to the door. In the last two weeks alone, four people in my position have quit—that’s a quarter of the staff. I’ve been in my role the longest, despite only working here for four years, which tells you a lot about the turnover.

I’ve been humiliated by management in front of guests for refusing service (they usually get free food), and my fiancée was berated by management for not being able to handle 20 full tables and a dozen to-go orders on “Football Sunday,” all by herself. Her new position is supposed to be tipped, but most guests don’t tip her (it doesn't say to do it on the receipts), and the casino hosts large watch parties of 12-30 people where they tell guests ‘no gratuity required,’ when signing up online, which gives the employees more work without benefits.

At this point, we’ve become numb to the idea of staying at the casino. I'm starting to doubt they’ll ever train her to bartend, and we can’t put her through bartending classes due to working swing shift. We’re just tired of the abuse and wondering if it's time to move on.

That being said, we live in Central New York, which isn't very densely populated. Honestly, we're scared to leave the casino because it pays a few dollars more per hour than the average job in the area. I've been working on starting my own business, but it won't be profitable until spring, and we still want her to bartend-just not at the casino. Walmart pays good enough with a lot more freedom, and working there would make it easier to put her through bartending classes, so she'd have more experience on her résumé. It feels like a more stable option, but we're still unsure about making the leap.",8,1729566114.0,antiwork,0,0.91,False

I did my entry at home but had it in my bag and decided to take my posting photo in different scenery. I went to a coffee shop where the coffee was so strong it felt like a kick in the teeth. And while the pumpkin muffin they raved about was pretty, it tasted nothing like pumpkin. But the atmosphere was excellent and we found a great table by the window. 

Sitting there, trying not to show any weakness as I attempt to drink my coffee, I noticed the couple sitting outside. The girl had the most interesting journal on the table. If you zoom in on my photo you can see it on the top right. It was at least 3 inches thick with paper designed to look like old parchment bound in leather. 

I would have loved to have told her how much I liked her journal, but I didn't want to interrupt. And for some reason it made me think about the Jeep wave. If you've ever owned a Jeep you know what I mean. Basically, Jeep owners give a wave to other Jeeps they encounter on the road. It's the culture and kinda like a head nod or sign of appreciation to one another. 

If journal writers had some kind of sign or gesture like that I could have shown my appreciation without interrupting. And if there is one, please let me know. Sharing is caring.

I took a glove and examined his latest droppings and I’m relatively positive that he decided to eat the dark brown playground wood chips at some point (maybe a kid dropped food). There was 2 whole pieces of hard wood chip in the last small, singular turd.

However, his initial poops resembled more of the “dark and tar like/coffee grounds” appearance and texture of Melana or some digestive bleeding issue. When we poked it around, it crumbled (like coffee grounds). We’re worried that even if wood chips explain some of the color/consistency, there may be a problem because of, or unrelated to, the wood chips. 

I guess I can’t upload pictures so I hope the fecal descriptions were helpful. 

He’s a 9 year old border collie mutt. He was perhaps more lethargic today than usual after a social outing, but he was happy and went on 3 solid walks.

He will sporadically skip eating for a day, but obviously with the other symptoms we’re paying extra attention to his choices. 

We’re likely to take him to the vet tomorrow either way (barring a complete bounce back to normal eating and stool), but I wanted to try and ask for advice given how serious and impending internal bleeding can be.

Hi, I'm 27F and have been sort of seeing this guy I met off of Bumble for the last 10 months now. For context, I'm from India and from a moderately conservative family. I've never been in a relationship before and this is the closest I've ever been to dating anyone and this was a long distance thing at that. 
Things were going quite well until around the 6 month mark, I got into a new job and things got a bit more busy for me. We met around 4 times in the last 4 months when he was in town. All coffee dates, short ones. Arounf this time I sort of felt that the feelings we initially had were waning off and felt like bith of us werent interested enough. The last time we met I brought up the topic of where this was headed and how he felt about me. Contrary to what I thought, he said he felt very sure about me and that he felt it ever since we met for the first time. He went on to say things implying that he could find a job if it meant he could get married to me and basically made me feel like I was somehow pressuring him into be someone he was not just for me, which I wasn't trying to do. Ever since that I've been feeling sort of detached and honestly bored of it. And after that he said he'll call me on phone (we've never done that before, we always text each other)  to tell me some things but he never got around to doing that. I feel very conflicted on where to go from here. Our conversations have been very sparse and boring ever since and I feel like I might be wasting his time because I don't share his feelings.  

I need advice on how to deal with this. 



Edit: also when I was asking him where he thought we were in the relationship scale (in my mind we were seeing each other, max I'd go to say is dating) he said, "" aren't we already in a relationship?"" I was baffled at this. ",2,1729565326.0,dating_advice,2,0.76,False

1g97yfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/monzo/comments/1g97yfd/my_account_was_closed/,MY ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED,"It’s been a while since we had a random “My account has been closed” story, that seems non believable. Here is one…

One crisp, chilly evening, the OP of the story sat in their flat, gazing out the window. The streetlights flickered as cars zoomed by, but they barely noticed. Their focus was on something far more pressing—the sudden Monzo account closure. How had it all gone so wrong?

It had been a week since the event that had set everything in motion. The day began as any other: a quick coffee, checking emails, and preparing for the day ahead. The OP had recently upgraded to a flying car—a sleek, silver hovercraft that moved like a dream and could effortlessly cut through Dundee’s traffic. The future had truly arrived, and the OP, always one for tech, embraced it.

But that day, their hunger got the best of them. While cruising through the skies, the scent of freshly cooked meat filled the air. A quick glance at the dashboard’s integrated GPS showed that their favorite kebab shop, Dundee Doner, was just a few blocks away. Without thinking, the OP redirected their car and made a sharp descent, landing smoothly in front of the small, neon-lit shop.

Inside, the aroma of sizzling doner meat, spicy sauces, and toasted naan overwhelmed their senses. They ordered their usual: a large lamb doner with garlic sauce, extra chilli, and chips on the side. After paying with their trusty Monzo card, the OP eagerly grabbed the warm, greasy parcel and dashed back to the car.

It was here that things started to spiral out of control. As they settled into the plush seat of their hovercraft and engaged the autopilot, the OP unwrapped the kebab, the soft naan and tender meat almost glowing under the cabin’s lights. Flying through the sky, a massive kebab in hand, the OP felt invincible. Their only task: drive, eat, and make sure not to spill the sauce.

What they didn’t expect was that eating while operating a flying car—even in autopilot mode—was technically illegal. As they soared over the Tay Bridge, the car began to sway slightly. Chunks of kebab meat and sauce dribbled from their hands onto the control panel, causing the autopilot to flicker and short-circuit. Without warning, the vehicle lurched to the left, sending a chilli-covered piece of lamb splattering against the windshield. The OP’s hands flailed, sending the rest of the kebab flying across the cabin.

“Warning: Manual override required,” the car’s AI stated, its calm tone contrasting with the OP’s panic. They grabbed the controls, steadying the car while wiping garlic sauce from their shirt. As they did so, they missed the automated message flashing across the dashboard, a message that would later become crucial: “Klingon Tax Filing Due – Urgent”.

The OP, being someone who always handled their affairs on time, would normally have seen this notification and dealt with it immediately. However, distracted by the chaos of the meal and the sudden malfunction of the vehicle, they dismissed it, thinking it was some error in the system.

Days passed, and the OP forgot entirely about the incident—until a letter arrived. It was from the Intergalactic Tax Bureau, a branch of the Klingon Empire. The letter was ominously worded, stating that the OP had failed to file their annual Klingon taxes. As a result, they were now facing hefty fines and legal action if they didn’t resolve the issue. They even threatened to revoke their interplanetary travel privileges.

For a brief moment, the OP chuckled. Taxes? With the Klingons? This had to be some sort of joke, right? It seemed ridiculous. But as they read further, their heart sank. As part of Earth’s new diplomatic relationship with the Klingon Empire, all residents who used certain space-based services—including flying cars, which operated using Klingon hyperdrive technology—were required to file taxes. And the OP, it seemed, had missed the deadline.

They immediately logged into their Monzo account, hoping to resolve the issue by paying the fine. To their horror, the account displayed a bright red banner at the top: Account Closed – Violation of Intergalactic Tax Code.

“What the hell?” the OP muttered, trying to process what had happened. Monzo had always been reliable, their digital wallet for all their everyday needs. It was seamless, quick, and, until now, hassle-free. How could a missed tax filing with the Klingon Empire result in the closure of their account?

They dialed Monzo customer service. After a few moments, a calm, robotic voice answered.

“Thank you for calling Monzo. How may I assist you today?”

“Uh, yeah, I’m trying to figure out why my account’s been closed.”

“One moment while I pull up your details.” A pause. Then: “It appears your account has been flagged for intergalactic tax evasion. Specifically, a missed filing with the Klingon Empire.”

“Wait, wait, wait,” the OP interrupted. “Are you telling me my account got closed because I forgot to pay Klingon taxes? That’s insane! I didn’t even know I had to!”

“Per Intergalactic Tax Regulation 14B, Earth residents utilizing Klingon technology are required to file taxes with the Empire. Failure to do so results in automatic financial penalties, which Monzo is obliged to enforce under the Interplanetary Financial Agreement of 2023.”

The OP stared at the phone in disbelief. “But…I didn’t mean to! Can’t I just pay the fine and get my account back?”

“There’s also an additional violation on your record, sir. It seems you were reported for reckless operation of a flying vehicle while consuming food.”

“What?! The kebab? I didn’t—”

“Yes, the kebab. Flying and eating is considered a distraction, and therefore, a Class 2 violation under airspace law.”

“So, let me get this straight,” the OP said, feeling the absurdity of the situation building, “my Monzo account is closed because I missed some space taxes and ate a kebab while flying my car?”

“Yes, sir. That is correct.”

For a moment, the OP wasn’t sure whether to laugh or scream. Here they were, someone who had successfully navigated decades of modern life, from the rise of smartphones to the advent of flying cars. Yet somehow, a kebab and a missed Klingon tax deadline had brought their financial world crashing down.

“What do I do now?” the OP asked, exasperated.

“Monzo recommends resolving your tax dispute with the Klingon Empire. Once the issue is cleared, you may be eligible to reapply for an account.”

The OP hung up, feeling utterly defeated. The next few days were a whirlwind of dealing with Klingon tax officers, who, while fearsome in battle, were surprisingly bureaucratic when it came to taxes. After hours of negotiations and fines, the OP finally cleared their debt.

But one thing was for certain: they would never again eat a kebab while driving their flying car, and they would definitely keep a closer eye on their intergalactic tax obligations. Life in the future was complicated enough without adding interstellar taxes to the mix.",0,1729564916.0,monzo,1,0.33,False

Young man dealing with a plethora of health issues, some directly tied to past alcoholism. Listed what I’ve been dealing with. I’m looking for others’ experiences with alcoholism effects and keto/carnivore improvements, but seeing if anybody can relate to my issues, regardless of what their experience is with alcohol.

***

Hi everyone,

Started keto on October 1st. Ideally would like to transition to carnivore. I’m 25M, 6ft 145lb with a history of pretty severe alcoholism and crippling anxiety. I went on a year and a half long bender (drinking all day every day) and ended up in the ER 2 months ago. I went in because of abdominal pain and bloating that wouldn’t go away. Severe enough to send me to the ER which is absolutely unheard of for me, but not horrific. I was worried about my pancreas, as I was having almost constant yellow liquid stools for months. Along with the pain I lost my appetite for a few days and felt a constant fullness before I went in. Haven’t drank alcohol since that ER visit…

I was a nightly drinker for a couple years before that, with only one sober stint (before my long bender). Developed vague health issues both physical and neurological which continued (and worsened) into sobriety and of course worsened during my bender. Now I’m here after wanting to do keto/carnivore for so long yet knowing I wouldn’t sustain it if I was drinking.

***

I have been dealing with the following issues:

- Daily abdominal pain/pressure, below my bottom left rib (mainly). It is never awful but my anxiety surrounding it is constant. Bloating has subsided, but my appetite isn’t high anymore. When I was in the ER I had a CT scan w/ contrast and bloodwork/enzymes done. Everything (organ scans) came back normal. Gastritis? Ulcer? Pancreatic insufficiency? I don’t know, I still think something is inflamed, stomach, pancreas, liver…my AST was slightly elevated but surprisingly only at 88. Blood glucose was at 97 which is a bit alarming to me. 

- TMJD/jaw pain, probably stemming from anxiety and tension in my neck.

- Pelvic floor dysfunction/chronic pelvic pain syndrome

- Peyronie’s Disease (fibrosis in the penis, causes pain, possible severe deformity), awful AWFUL disease but with more research is being linked to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. This falls into the same bank of fibrotic disorders such as Dupuytren’s Contracture and Ledderhose Disease.

- Floaters and afterimages in vision, loss of visual sharpness, overall neurological “strangeness” all through my body

- Dry mouth, dry eyes with spasming eyelids while my eyes are closed. Often painful.

- Persistent anxiety, sense of impending doom, “freeze” response if not fight-or-flight, rumination

- Anhedonia and fatigue, probably due to my reward center and GABA being wrecked

My diet so far has been beef (either steak or ground beef), “safe” cheeses, eggs, bacon, salami, broccoli and brussels sprouts. Coffee, some heavy cream and water. I use butter and avocado oil, and usually just salt and pepper. 

I will say that the only new issue is the stomach/abdominal pain from the drinking. The rest I have been dealing with for years. If anyone can relate or has had these issues (alcohol-induced or not) that have improved with keto/carnivore, please share your experiences. I have a long road ahead of me while so young and I’m trying to stay positive. Feel like my brain is trashed, but I need to find some hope in healing my body. These last couple years have been very traumatic.

My GF and I have been happily together for over 5 years.  I even ordered the engagement ring a couple weeks ago, and plan to propose later this year. 

Story:
Last weekend I went to a workout class with a friend for a birthday. My gf wasn’t available, so I went with a group of my friend’s friends. 

Afterwards I was casually chatting with one of the instructors. We didn’t talk about anything serious. I asked if she was teaching full time, and she shared some of her professional goals (to move on from the studio she was at to pursue a doctorate), and she asked if I liked the class and how I knew the girl who’s birthday we were celebrating. There was maybe 10 minutes in total of chatting before we left. 

A couple of days later, I found her profile and saw that my birthday friend was now following the instructor, so I added her as well. She accepted my follow and I scanned through a few of her posts. She was a cool person with an interesting backstory it seemed but I left it at that. 

About a day later, she slid into my DMs with a “hi :)”. After thinking about it, I tried to move the conversation to let her down easy.  She must’ve realized because a day later she follow up with “I was going to suggest getting coffee but it looks like you have a gf?” I replied nicely and it seems as though we’ve both gone our ways. 

Aftermath:
After getting the DM from the instructor, I was honest and told my gf about what had happened. We had some long talks, and we’re mature adults so things are smooth. 

But I can’t shake the feeling in my head about this instructor. I’d never been confronted by anyone like that before, and I’m a really modest and humble person in situations like this. I’m also rational and know that I would be a moron to let go of a 5+ year relationship over a person who DM’d me and has some maybe shared interests based on the Instagram page.

Developing a crush on someone feels normal, but I’m not sure how to confront these feelings (or if I even should). ",0,1729564747.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.25,False

It was pretty convenient, the bus stop was only a few blocks from my apartment and there was a stop just a few hundred feet from my work parking lot. For context, the place had a very long driveway that curved around and almost looked like a regular road. Two stops before this, there was a very popular supermarket. At the time I had a pretty generic college girl look, short purple hair and chunky glasses. Both of these things are relevant!



There was one specific driver who had the route pretty often, and every time we pulled up to the supermarket he'd wait 5-10 minutes while just staring at me. Sometimes he'd clear his throat or announced that ""well, we're here"". But it wasn't my stop so I'd just wait it out. Usually I just listened to music the whole ride and ig bored him until he tried to get my attention. Didn't think much of it at all, just figured he was ahead of schedule or something. But still, he started getting a little more cranky with me every day.



After a few months of this, he just popped off at me. Why wouldn't I get off the bus? Why did I insist on getting off in the research park and walking up that one road? Was it him, was i not wanting him to see me go into work? Did I lie about where I live, too??? I was baffled, and told him I don't know what he's talking about. I don't work at the store, and the 'road' was a driveway that didn't let out anywhere but a parking lot.



The guy guys furious! He's saying he sees me in the store every day, don't lie to him. He can spot my purple hair and glasses from a mile away! And I'm even more confused, I've seen dozens of other girls with the exact same hair. It's a college town, purple hair was cliché at that point. We keep arguing back and forth, him that I have to be lying and me that even if I was this was fucking weird.



He starts asking why I never acknowledge him when I ring him up, and never take my headphones off on the bus. He'd been apparently trying to seek ""me"" out to chat at ""work"" because I wouldn't in the morning, and trying to chat in the morning because ""I"" was ignoring him at ""work"". Because he was talking to two different people and neither of them were interested. He was visibly in his 40s and were both in our early 20s.


I wound up calling in a complaint to the main terminal a few weeks later, because if he wasn't sulking and shouting passive aggressive jabs at me, he was telling anyone else on the bus what a mean little ice bitch I am. Which, I can be, but what did he expect trying to form an emotional connection on a bus at 6 in the morning? I'm just trying to chug coffee and put on my game face, I'm not ready to function as a people or play nice with others. It was already weird, but he made it a whole thing. And he still didn't believe me, because he'd jab ""have a nice walk, I'll see you later"" as I got off the bus. So I complained about it, I know it was awful of me but I was tired of every morning being about this weird old guy being mad at me for not working at a supermarket. After that, there was a new regular driver on my route who was really lovely!


Fast forward a few more months after the complaint, I happened to need to stop by the supermarket before I went home. Hadn't seen the guy once since I'd complained so i hadnt thought about him much. By that point I'd found a shortcut in the fence so I didn't have to ride the bus all the way around to get there.) As I get rung up, I realized who was doing so. A very cute young girl, with purple hair and chunky glasses! Here's the wild part, we looked nothing alike!! Her hair was a completely different cut, we had different shades of purple, her glasses were black while mine were purple, she was thin and petite while I'm curvy and jiggly, she had freckles, and I was a good few inches taller. 


We made eye contact and after a few seconds she just asks ""do you ride the bus?""


I said yes and we just stared for a few more seconds. I said I was so fucking sorry and she just shoves my bag at me and tells me it wasn't my fault. We never spoke again. I have no idea what happened to the creepy bus driver or if he continued harassing the girl after my complaint. But still, sometimes I still wonder what the fuck all that was!",120,1729563931.0,IDontWorkHereLady,15,0.98,False

I’m really sorry if you’ve seen a multitude of similar posts, but I have not seen any quite relevant to my timeline. 

(24F) I’m planning my first solo trip abroad from the US this winter, in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Because of airfare prices, I’m flying into Barcelona and out of Lisbon. I will have 17 days (including my arrival day;  taking a red eye, so perhaps that should be 16.5). 

 I originally wanted to focus on just Andalusia but I could not pass up the ticket to Barcelona that was available. Technically I visited Barcelona and Madrid when I was a child, so although that doesn’t really count, I don’t have that mental duty of “checking it off” my list,  if that makes sense.

Like most people visiting Spain probably, I mainly value food, any kind of drinks (wine, sherry, cocktails, etc.), art, live music, coffee, sweets, markets, architecture, and fashion.  

I haven’t seen people posting about visiting in the winter and in the timeframe I am looking at. I will probably post again once I make more plans, but for now, could anyone let me know how this looks as a rough overview of an itinerary? 

I want to spend more time in Spain than Portugal on this trip because I have always loved the culture, speak a bit of Spanish, and it has my favorite food in the whole world. 

I was thinking about spending one night in Faro to break up the long bus ride in between Seville and Lisbon. Does that seem like a good idea? Will I regret not spending another night there?



* 2.5 days in Barcelona (.5 because of arrival day into Barcelona on day 1)
* 1 day train from Barcelona to Granada
* 3.5 days in Granada
   * Train from Granada to Seville in between here
* 4.5 days in Seville 
   * Bus from Seville to Faro to break up ride in between Seville and Lisbon  
* \~ 1 day in Faro 
   * Bus from Faro to Lisbon 
* 3 days in Lisbon 



I will only be taking public transit or walking - no rental cars. I don’t plan on fully booking everything way in advance, but maybe the train and bus as well as hostels on each end. 

I had originally really wanted to go to Cadiz and do a guided day trip to Tangier but I’ve read so many things advising against that. 

How much should I factor in the day of the week on my travels? For instance, if I follow this plan, I would be taking the long train ride from Barcelona to Granada on Saturday. (Maybe I am totally overthinking!) But is Saturday a time for fun happenings like markets or other things that I should not miss out on while on a train? Or is it more of a restful day so it would be good to use it as a travel day?

Is there anything I should keep in mind while traveling in these areas in December? I understand things will be less crowded but not fully closed down. 

This is a long shot but does anyone know if I could see a recorte / bull leaping anywhere in the winter? 

I have not fully dove into the planning of activities or places to eat, but any suggestions are always welcome!

Thank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and/or provide feedback!",1,1729563784.0,GoingToSpain,0,1.0,False

(Apologies for the long post)","Okay, I had Season Two on in the background and noticed something, but I'm not certain if it was deliberate or if I'm reading too much into it.  So, I wanted to ask the community.

Is it just me, or does Aziraphale embody the Seven Deadly sins a little too well?

The thought popped into my head during the scene where Crowley and Aziraphale are at Job's estate.  After Crowley tempts Aziraphale with the cooked beef, our angel just goes to town on that dinner table while Crowley just sits back and sips some wine.  I chuckled and said ""Wow.  Could you be more of a glutton, Angel?"" and a light bulb went off.

Aziraphale and Crowley both embody the traits you would think the opposite side would have: Aziraphale the sins and Crowley the virtues.  That doesn't mean they don't possess and act on their ""assigned"" traits, Crowley still commits the sins (he **is** the Sin of Wrath at some points in the story) and Aziraphale still follows the virtues (he is the definition of chastity).  Still, the number of times they each act on the other side's traits feels deliberate.

For example, Aziraphale loves food, maybe a little too much.  Shax makes a comment about how chubby he is because of this love of food.  He is in Rome because he wants to sample a local chef's oysters, he is captured during the French Revolution because he wanted crepes, in the Lockdown short he tells Crowley that he's baked way more cakes than he can eat and has to give some away, and, of the two of them, he is the only one who eats anything when they dine at the Ritz.

Crowley, on the other hand never eats anything, but he does drink.  HOWEVER, despite how often we see him drinking, he is only drunk once; when pitching the idea of being 'godparents' to Aziraphale.  We see him drinking at the tavern after the fire in season one, but he's not drunk.  He is temperance to the angel's gluttony.

A few other examples are:

**Greed** - Aziraphale runs a bookstore but never sells anything.  He just hoards books.  He owns the building his and Maggie's shops are in, but may also own the buildings the coffee shop, restaurant, magic shop and tavern.  So he his never more than a brisk walk from the things he wants.

**Sloth** - I love him, but Aziraphale doesn't do much.  He sort of stands by and lets Crowley resolve all the problems they run into.  He even goes as far as to threaten Crowley if he doesn't fix things at the end of season one.  Heck, he doesn't do much during >! the battle with Shax and the demons at the end of season 2 !< either!  He just stands by and watches others do all the work.  You can argue that his inactions are because he's not as powerful as Crowley, but Aziraphale doesn't even try.  He also complains when Crowley drives ""too fast"" and he goes well under the sped limit himself (and the fact the Bentley appreciates this is adorable).

**Pride / Vanity** - The entire second season is just Aziraphale being prideful and arrogant, but there were moments in the first season as well.  He is upset when his clothes get dirty and asks Crowley to miracle away the paint (ties in with Sloth, as well, I mean he can do it himself but doesn't) and makes a point of reminding Crowley where he ""stands"" as a demon.  He also takes the ""high road"" by forgiving others when he disagrees with them, as though their opinions have slighted or hurt him.

Couldn't find any good examples of Lust, Envy and Wrath, though I am sure there are some.

As for Crowley, he is constantly charitable and patient with his angel; always doing favors and breaking the rules to help Aziraphale (he is less patient with his plants, but he does take them with him when he gets kicked out of his flat).  And while he does have wrathful outbursts, he is fairly level headed and humble for a demon.

So ... am I nuts?  Could this have been done on purpose?  And if so, why?  To show the pair are closer to humans than the others?  To show the line between angel and demon aren't clear cut?  Or am I seeing things that aren't there?",3,1729563666.0,goodomens,1,1.0,False

Prompt 1: 

In the bustling heart of Hollywood 1946, Muse A, a charismatic and handsome rising star, finds himself trapped in a cycle of typecast roles. Known for his brooding charm and romantic leads, he yearns for a deeper, more meaningful role that will showcase his true range as an actor. Despite his success, he feels suffocated by the industry’s expectations and longs to break free from the superficiality of fame.
Enter Muse B, a gifted writer brimming with creativity and ambition, yet struggling to carve out her place in the male-dominated film industry. She works as a “paper girl” and coffee runner at the studio, a position far beneath her talents. With her scripts constantly overlooked and her ideas dismissed, she faces the dual challenges of being a woman and a person of color in a world that often marginalizes voices like hers.
Their worlds collide when Muse A stumbles upon one of Muse B’s scripts hidden in the break room. Intrigued by her unique voice and fresh perspective, he feels an immediate connection to her writing. 

Prompt 2:

In the gritty streets of 1930s New York City, Muse A is a disillusioned detective working cases that often lead him into the city's dark underbelly. Haunted by the unresolved murder of his former partner, he keeps everyone at arm's length—until he crosses paths with Muse B.

Muse B is a sultry lounge singer with a captivating voice and secrets of her own. When she approaches Muse A to help her find a missing musician—rumored to be tangled with the mob—he reluctantly agrees. As they navigate smoky jazz clubs and shadowy back alleys, their chemistry ignites amidst the danger.

Caught in a web of deception, they must confront their pasts and the growing attraction between them. But as they get closer to the truth, Muse A must decide if he can trust Muse B, or if her allure is a deadly trap. Will love flourish in the chaos, or will the city's darkness consume them both?

1g97hsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1g97hsn/fingerprints/,Fingerprints,"I love the fingerprints authors leave in their works.
Specifically, I love when you can tell an author is writing from experience. 
(Yes I know the research people put into writing- I mean when you can ‘tell’ its experience) 

Usually in AUs, coffee shop or restaurant/bar, or university when their area of study/thesis uses specific papers as reference. 

I  eat that up every time

Yes author, tell me about a geology experiment so nuanced that you have to have done it. Tell me me about how a character messed up a titration in such a specific way the author definatly witnessed or did it themselves.

Ah yes, food service knowledge you only get by working in a kitchen. 
 ‘fifo’ and fridge shelving orders, or a specific cocktail recipe and steps I can tell you’ve most certainly made it.
Or in corporate/office aus where it’s paperwork, spread sheets and forms- so specific-*chefs kiss*

Same with languages in a fic, conlangs or multi lingual characters. It’s such a human thing, the parts of you that you leave on the page intentionally or not.

I know I do the same thing when I write cafe/coffee shop/university fics. I’m sure other food service workers can tell- and I get to use knowledge about espresso and my moral judgments about coffee orders preferences to characterize and add subtext just for myself.

It’s so silly in the grand scheme of things, and research vs experience doesn’t matter as long as it’s read/written with enjoyment. But there’s something about the flavour I cannot get enough of when it feels like an author is using their firsthand knowledge- I love that",13,1729563482.0,AO3,4,0.89,False
1g97ffw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1g97ffw/am_i_overreacting_for_thinking_my_homewrecking_ex/,Am I overreacting for thinking My Homewrecking EX friend/coworker is responsible for getting my hours cut?,"Two years ago I had a small tight nit friend group consisting of me (A), my ex (R), my ex's sister (L), and her best friend (S). We all applied and got jobs at a small local movie theater so we could work together and see each other all the time. This worked really well for awhile and my ex, his sister and I ended up getting an apartment together and it was genuinely a great time in my life. Unfortunately nothing good can really last and my ex and I ended up fighting a lot while we lived together. Right around that time, R got promoted to manager and he started staying at work later- makes sense, more responsibilities. When I texted another coworker about a fight he and I had, they asked if it was because of S, because apparently her and R had been getting really close at work - while he and I were dating - but I wasn't around. I set the boundary that I didn't want S in the apartment while I wasn't there, while L was on my side this didn't stop her brother from breaking up with me and kicking me out for his new fling. R had repeatedly told me he just needed time and if I gave him space he would consider coming back to me. I'll admit it was a bit naive but because of this I spent much longer than I should've in my mourning period. The rent in my area, plus my parents living out of state at the time led to me becoming homeless and living in my car, through the Florida summer with no a/c, hot humid nights with just a dying Iphone to entertain me, and no reliable access to utilities. I lost my job at the theater during this time and got a new job at a coffee shop. I decided to spend this time saving money and trying to make my life a little more livable.

Cut to over a year later, I'm still living out of my car, but I've been promoted to general manager at my coffee shop and I'm making good money despite hating my job. I ended up meeting a really nice girl (E) during this time who changed my perspective on what life should be. I no longer felt like I had to suffer alone or punish myself for things I had no control over. Though I'd climbed to the top at my coffee shop job I now wanted less hours and responsibility so I could spend more stress free time with my new girlfriend. She helped me apply at the retail job where she works, where I work evenings and she works mornings so there's no HR issues. At first I was working less hours (still \~35-40 vs \~50-60 on salary) for about the same amount of pay and life was great. Due to some stroke of bad luck S also happened to work at this particular retail job on dayshift with my girlfriend. When S found out through my girlfriend that I'd gotten a job there, she threw a tantrum to one of my gf's friends (W). W also works there and is really friendly so people go to him for drama and personal issues. Once I realized she worked there I made the decision to avoid her as much as possible and only interact through pleasantries. This worked for awhile with me nodding politely and staying away from her section as much as possible until one day she decided to confront me. Up until this time I'd been informed that she was talking shit about me to other coworkers by W and those coworkers, who didn't believe that I would do such a thing. She was mis telling the above story, making it seem like she had done nothing wrong despite being the other woman. She came up to me while we were on the clock saying R had played both of us (he cheated on her too), shifting the blame off of herself. I told her I didn't accept her apology and I still largely blamed her for getting in the middle of my relationship and making me homeless despite us all being close friends. She stated that sometime after I had been kicked out, her sister found out that she had ruined her friend's (me) relationship and no longer trusted her. As a result, her sister kicked her out and S somehow found a way to blame me for this despite me not even knowing her sister. The kick here is that while when I got kicked out, I was living out of my car for a year she immediately moved in with her mother, who she apparently doesn't get along with, which was somehow also my fault. Anyways, I told her I didn't forgive her because I am still trying to recover from homelessness. I told her I refused to accept an apology where she blamed me for her less than ideal living situation after being a homewrecker and ruining my life. I told her while I don't forgive her, I'm capable of being professional at work (not hard because we work in different shifts/areas) and if she didn't bother me I wouldn't bother her. 

Cut to a few weeks later I notice my hours are being cut back significantly for seemingly no reason. I talked to some of my coworkers who had been hired at the same time and they were being scheduled regular 7hr shifts. While I was only getting 5hr shifts despite having open availability and stating I wanted close to 40hrs total. I thought it was just a coincidence that my shifts were being cut, until I learned S was working later shifts, more midday, to cover the gap between morning and evening crew. It was at this time my gf and I found out through W that, despite her 'apology' S had gone straight to HR and told them her side of the story-that I had bullied her online and ruined her living situation - and that she had been telling other coworkers around the store as well. Well, this happened to be the second time she had tried to apologize, with the first being soon after everything had occurred - over a year ago now - and was via Instagram. At the time it was still fresh in my mind and i angrily called her a ""homewrecking b\*tch"" for what she did. When I didn't accept her apology, she blocked me on everything and I just tried to forget about her. I never messaged her after that, how could I have bullied her if she had me blocked on everything? Anyways, my new clock in time now happens to be long after she has left the building so we won't interact. Unfortunately this means I never get scheduled over 25hrs even if i work 5 days a week. This has really been effecting my mental health because I had been saving to get my own place with my gf, but now I'm struggling to even survive off my paychecks. I feel like I'm overreacting but at the same time I've never truly done anything to effect her living situation and it feels like she's ruining my life for a second time. 

Am I overreacting thinking she's responsible for my hours being cut so drastically? Should I go to HR and tell them my side? I'm really at a loss for what to do. I work very hard at my job and I'd hate to lose such a good paying job in a small town. As far as I know I've done nothing else wrong to warrant them cutting \*only\* my hours and I'd like to get back to making a livable wage. 

  
TL:DR: Ex-friend is a homewrecker who made me homeless and blames me for her family hating her, and now that we work together, she is lying to HR and coworkers about the story, and my hours are being cut while no one else's are so she doesn't have to see me.
