Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, PLEASE ONLY MESSAGE IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.

Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden—maybe we could head home together.

After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.

Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.

The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.

The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order—all the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.

I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.

He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.

But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew—calm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.

As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.

I'd always considered this a strength.

Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.

That silhouette... was that Vera?

I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.

My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive—a breath of youthful energy.

But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.

Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.

Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""—to avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.

This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods—""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night—Aiden had had enough.

He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.

Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.

Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk—avoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.

So what was Vera doing here?

""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""

Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.

Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""

Complaints erupted immediately.

""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""

""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""

""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""

Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.

He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.

For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?

But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.

Chapter 2

My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.

The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.

An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning—but from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.

Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.

Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright—showing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.

She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.

As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.

Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.

He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.

Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients—after that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""

I said nothing.

The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.

Every minute of waiting felt endless.

The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume—Vera's fragrance from earlier.

I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.

I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.

When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water—I knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.

But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours—it could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""

Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""

And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?

Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance—wouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?

When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""

The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.

When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.

I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.

Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God—I'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""

She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""

Chapter 3

Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""

Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.

I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.

The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""

I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction—this ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.

I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.

Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.

The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute—in that moment, it made me nauseous.

Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""

Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""

My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?

Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.

Principles? Rules?

Apparently they only applied to me.

A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard—maybe sensing my emotional turmoil.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.

The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""

""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.

Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""

Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""

Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.

A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.

""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""

Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.

In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.

I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.

# Chapter 1 A Fateful Departure

The sun was setting on Rosalie Moreno's life with the Moreno family, and she had hoped for a silent farewell. But as she tiptoed towards the door, ready to vanish into the dusk, Jennifer Moreno, her adoptive mother, summoned her with a voice that cut through the quiet.

In the living room, Yuri Moreno, the family's true daughter, nestled close to Yosef Lennon, the Lennons' indulged scion, on the couch. A pang of realization struck Rosalie—her presence was surplus.

The Morenos and Lennons had a marriage pact, and Yosef, who'd boasted of claiming Rosalie as his bride since their school days, was now smitten with Yuri, who'd returned only a week ago. It wasn't Rosalie he desired; it was the Moreno name.

Jennifer wasted no time in confirming Rosalie's suspicions. ""Rosalie, can't you see? Yuri and Yosef are a match made in heaven. You and Yosef were never meant to be, but they... they're perfect together.""

""Love can't be forced; it's fate,"" Jennifer continued, her tone softening. ""Don't cling to Yosef out of habit. They'll be engaged before you know it.""

Rosalie raised a skeptical eyebrow. ""Tell that to Yosef. He's the one who can't let go. I've never been interested."" She had seen through Yosef's grand gestures long ago; he was nothing more than a plaything to her.

Yosef, who'd endured Rosalie's disdain for years, harbored a grudge. Seeing her still acting with an air of superiority, even after losing her Moreno status, he sneered, ""You're just a nobody, yet you talk so big.

""No wonder I never liked you. You're a fake! Thank God we weren't engaged. I'd be stuck with you and your replacement!""

Yosef sneered at Rosalie with a look of utter disdain, yet a tinge of regret lingered in his heart. Rosalie's beauty and figure were leagues beyond Yuri's, a fact that was hard to ignore. He thought it was such a shame that Rosalie wasn't the true-born daughter of the Moreno family.

Rosalie's retorted, ""That's what I'm saying! Thank God someone else is taking you off my hands, or I'd have to look at your pockmarked face forever.""

Yosef's face, scarred by acne, twisted in anger at Rosalie's jab.

Yuri, feigning concern at Yosef's mockery, played the peacemaker. ""Yosef, don't be so harsh. She might get hurt. After all, if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have taken you or the Moreno heiress spot from her.

""She's just lashing out because she's hurting inside. Can't you cut her some slack?"" Yuri's voice dripped with false sympathy.

Rosalie wasn't buying it. ""I'm not upset. This loser chased me for years, and I never cared. But you? A week back and you're already with him. Trash and a schemer—made for each other!""

Jennifer exploded at that, ""You heartless girl! Why are you so rude? No wonder I could never get close to you; you're naturally disrespectful.

""You lived a life of luxury for eighteen years while Yuri suffered. And now you insult her? That's outrageous!""

Rosalie, reprimanded by Jennifer, remained unflustered. Everything she had with the Moreno family, she'd earned through her secret contributions to the family's business.

Curtis Moreno, Rosalie's adoptive father, had saved enough to start a factory but lacked the business acumen to keep it afloat.

Without Rosalie's secret help, the factory would have folded, and the Moreno family wouldn't have become one of Serenity District's top merchants. But Rosalie never bragged; they were clueless about her role as the factory's biggest backer.

Curtis, dragged into the downstairs fray, frowned on purpose, playing the peacemaker.

Curtis pretended to blame Jennifer. ""Come on, that's not how you talk to Rosalie. She's going back to her family today, facing tough times. Besides, we messed up eighteen years ago; it's not her fault. Can't let her leave broken-hearted, right?""

Curtis, though hypocritical, had a fair point. But looking at Rosalie, his feelings were mixed.

He loved Rosalie since she was a kid—charming and lovely. But if she hadn't been with them, they wouldn't have missed their real daughter for eighteen years, suffering away from home.

Curtis let out a sigh as he spoke to Rosalie. ""Rosalie, you're not my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. You're like my own kid.""

""I've done some checking. Your real folks are out of work. If you ever need something, don't hesitate to come back and ask for help,"" Curtis added, feigning kindness.

Jennifer, sitting close by, jumped up and nudged Curtis. ""Why are you being so generous? Watch out you don't end up with a freeloader! Parents without jobs—what kind of decent family is that?""

Rosalie looked at the Morenos' fake smiles and Yosef, her face blank as she said, ""No thanks, Mr. Moreno. But you might want to focus more on running the factory and the company, especially keep an eye on the people around you.""

Rosalie glanced at Jennifer, a hint of warning in her voice.

There was a real snake in the grass at the company. Jennifer and her brother had been siphoning off money for years. If Rosalie hadn't been watching them, they might have bled the company dry.

If her birth family was really struggling, Rosalie figured she wouldn't have time to deal with the Morenos' drama.

Jennifer exploded at her words, ""So you can't stand to see us doing well, can you? Even as you're leaving, you have to curse our business. Like you've ever managed the factory! What are you even bragging about?""

Rosalie knew arguing with Jennifer was a waste of time, so she just snorted, ""You'll see what I'm capable of soon enough.""

Not wanting to waste any more breath, Rosalie stood up, slung her only backpack over her shoulder, and headed for the door. Inside was just her ID and the laptop she'd bought herself. She wasn't taking anything else.

But Yosef had to get in his digs. ""Mr. and Mrs. Moreno, Rosalie didn't even bring her luggage. Who knows what valuables she's got in that bag. You'd better check it!""

Jennifer, taking the bait, immediately said, ""Yosef's right! Open it up and see what's inside!""

# Chapter 2 The Enigmatic Ride

Yuri feigned concern with a practiced sigh. ""Mother, is this truly necessary? Rosalie's family is in dire straits. Even if she took a trinket or two, it's but a drop in the ocean for us. Can't we show some compassion?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Everything in her room was a gift from us. How dare she use our generosity to sustain her family? Her parents, jobless and adrift—will a few baubles truly make a difference?""

As she spoke, Jennifer advanced on Rosalie's backpack, intent on exposing her supposed thievery.

Rosalie, anticipating Jennifer's petty invasion, unzipped her bag with a flourish. ""Here, see for yourselves. No Moreno trinkets grace this bag. My ID is my own, and the laptop and clothes I wear were bought with the money I earned from my scholarship.""

If Rosalie hadn't been funneling her earnings to support her family, she would have flaunted her wealth in their faces. But they weren't worth the satisfaction.

Seeing the backpack's contents, Yuri and Yosef exchanged glances of disappointment. They hadn't expected Rosalie to have such integrity.

As the Morenos stood speechless, Rosalie slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to make her exit.

Suddenly, a frail figure descended the stairs with urgency. ""Rosalie... wait for me...""

The Morenos whirled in shock to see Yancy Moreno, fresh from surgery, hastening down the stairs.

Jennifer rushed to support her son, her voice laced with panic. ""Yancy, you should be resting! Why have you left your bed?""

Yancy, battling severe aplastic anemia, had undergone a bone marrow transplant by a mysterious doctor. Though the surgery was successful, he was still fragile, needing to avoid stress and exertion. They had kept him from Rosalie, but he defied their wishes.

Rosalie's heart, usually encased in ice, wavered at the sight of Yancy, the one who had always been weak yet her staunch protector.

At that moment, Yancy glared at Jennifer, his voice sharp. ""If you hadn't confined me, I wouldn't have had to rush."" The butler, under orders, had barred his way, but Yancy had slipped past. Luckily, Rosalie was still within reach.

Without delay, Yancy produced a card and pressed it into Rosalie's hand. ""Rosalie, I've heard about your family's plight. I've set aside some savings over the years. Please, take this, should you find yourself in need.""

Holding the card, Rosalie felt a warmth in her chest. In a family of strangers, Yancy was the only one who truly cared. It made all her efforts—researching his illness, ensuring his surgery's success—worthwhile. Now, as she left, Yancy was her only concern.

Seeing Yancy's generosity, Jennifer's face pinched with anxiety. ""You foolish boy, that's your only card, with at least ten grand in it! Why give it to her? She's not even your real sister!""

Yuri, feigning innocence, couldn't help but worry. ""Wow, Yancy is so generous to Rosalie. I've been home for days, and he hasn't even spoken to me much.""

Yosef, sensing Yuri's slight, immediately defended her. ""Come on, man, that's just too biased! You're so cold to your own sister, yet you lavish attention on that impostor.""

""You!"" Yancy fumed, his anger palpable.

Seeing Yancy upset, Rosalie's eyes darkened. She snatched a glass of water and splashed it directly in Yosef's face.

""Hey! Rosalie! How dare you!"" Yosef, heir to the Lennon family, had never been so humiliated, and he shouted in rage.

But Rosalie's gaze was icy. ""Yosef, this is the Moreno residence. Who are you to yell at the head of the Moreno family? Yancy just had surgery and can't afford the stress. Watch your tongue!""

Yosef, used to leveraging his family's friendship with the Morenos, often lingered at their home. Initially to pester Rosalie, he had lately shamelessly attached himself to Yuri, growing presumptuous, even daring to disrespect Yancy. He truly overstepped.

Realizing his blunder and noting the displeasure on Curtis and Jennifer's faces, Yosef retreated.

Yuri seized the moment to stir trouble. ""Mother, Father, even if it's to defend Yancy, Rosalie's actions were outrageous. Splashing water on guests? That's beyond rude.""

Rosalie, unwilling to waste more breath on them, handed the card back to Yancy. ""Yancy, your health comes first. Use this for your supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Rosalie..."" Yancy tried to resist, but Rosalie's grip was firm. He couldn't break free.

Rosalie smiled sincerely at Yancy, ""I appreciate the thought, but Yancy, don't worry about me. I don't need money. It's you who needs to take care of your health when I'm gone."" With that, she released his hand.

Yancy, still worried, tried to insist, but Rosalie was already walking away with a casual stride.

Yosef, grumbling to himself, ""Not short on money? Even now, still pretending to be rich. Rosalie, you really know how to play the part!"" He had harbored this complaint for years and finally let it slip.

Yet, Yosef felt a twinge of discomfort. Rosalie's parting gesture—splashing water on him—left him feeling frustrated and exposed.

Seeing Yosef drenched, Yuri quickly offered a handkerchief to dry him off.

Jennifer, spying the card back in Yancy's possession, quickly snatched it. ""Thank goodness she had the decency to refuse. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.""

Outside, Rosalie noted the Moreno family's driver made no move to offer her a ride, so she decided to call an Uber. To her surprise, a sleek black sports car, its brand discreet yet its presence commanding, pulled up just then.

Though the car's logo was subtle, the engine's purr betrayed its exclusivity. Under the sunlight, the black paint gleamed with a brilliance that hinted at hidden luxury.

A glance at the tires and rims confirmed their high-end origins. This car was no ordinary vehicle; it was a custom creation by a wealthy individual, likely as valuable as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Rosalie assumed an important figure had arrived. But to her astonishment, the man who emerged was shabby, with dark circles under his eyes.

He appeared no more than a few years older than her, yet his unshaven face and disheveled appearance contrasted starkly with his bright, piercing eyes. Upon seeing Rosalie, his eyes widened in recognition. ""You must be Rosalie?""

# Chapter 3 The Yoder Arrival

The man who stepped out of the unmarked luxury sports car was none other than Rosalie's biological brother, Zaki Yoder. His eyes widened at the sight of Rosalie, and he exclaimed, ""You and Mom... you two could pass for sisters.""

The Yoder family had planned for someone to collect Rosalie today. Zaki, having just wrapped up a high-stakes case, was on his way home for a much-needed break and decided to make a detour to pick up his long-lost sister.

He had half-expected to have to ask the Morenos to point out Rosalie, but the moment he saw her, he knew without a doubt that she was his sister.

Rosalie raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on her face. ""You're my brother?""

""Indeed, I'm Zaki, your third brother,"" Zaki replied, stepping forward with a grin.

Then, a realization struck him. Glancing down, he remembered he had been tailing a drug lord for days, without sleep or a change of clothes, and he had come straight here. Exhausted, he had forgotten to stop and grab a fancy suit to make a good impression.

""Sorry, I was in a rush and forgot to change,"" Zaki said, the tough commander feeling oddly self-conscious for the first time in front of Rosalie.

Rosalie was about to dismiss it as no big deal when Yuri interjected from behind her, ""Oh my, where'd this vagrant come from? Security, why are you letting just anyone in?""

The Moreno family's gatekeeper hurried over, explaining, ""Miss, this gentleman claimed he was here to see Rosalie, so I let him through.""

Yuri feigned surprise and turned to Rosalie. ""Oh... Rosalie, I had no idea he is your family. Please disregard my earlier comment.""

Rosalie gave Yuri the cold shoulder. ""If you're truly sorry, the best thing you can do is be quiet. No one wants to hear your incessant chatter."" With that, she walked past, opened Zaki's car door, and tossed her bag inside.

At that moment, Yosef arrived, seeking to settle a score. Seeing Zaki's beat-up car without a logo, he smirked. ""Never seen a car without a brand. Did you put this together yourself?""

Zaki leaned against the car, worn out, and replied, ""Yeah, it's custom."" They were a special forces team, and they all drove modified vehicles, especially this one, designed by his fifth brother, Kenneth Yoder.

Kenneth was still in school, but he was already a prodigy in weapon design for the Defense Department. His creations, once tweaked, were incredibly powerful and unmatched.

These cars could save a life in a tight spot. So, this car was worth more than any luxury car out there, and it hadn't come cheap.

But Yosef didn't understand and continued to mock Rosalie. ""I can't believe your family even has a car, but without a logo, who knows if it's stolen.""

Yuri chimed in, feigning concern, ""Rosalie, you should be careful. You could get entangled in some legal trouble!""

Rosalie had had enough of their nonsense, and now they were insulting her family. They had reached her limit.

Before Rosalie could speak, Zaki's face darkened. He strode over to them, his imposing figure over six feet tall as he towered over Yosef. Placing a heavy hand on Yosef's shoulder, Zaki said, ""Kid, you can't just run your mouth. Didn't anyone teach you that?""

After years of rigorous training and interrogating criminals, Zaki had earned the nickname ""Ice King."" His glare suggested Yosef might wet himself. Never had Yosef seen someone so intimidating. Yosef stammered, ""I-I-I was just guessing.""

Zaki snorted, ""Guessing? Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a price for every word. If your folks didn't teach you that, I can."" As he spoke, he squeezed Yosef's shoulder a bit harder.

In an instant, Yosef's shoulder popped out of its socket. He felt his arm go limp and screamed, ""Ouch! I won't do it again! Please, let me go!""

Zaki finally eased up, coldly putting Yosef's arm back in place.

Yosef was too terrified to utter a word.

Yuri, standing nearby, didn't fully grasp what had happened, but Yosef was pale as a ghost from the pain.

Zaki glanced at Yuri, causing her to shiver. His stare was absolutely terrifying.

""Young lady, I don't hit women. I'll let you slide today, but watch your mouth next time. I won't tolerate anyone cursing my family,"" Zaki said coldly.

Terrified, Yuri could only nod.

Zaki dialed back the intimidating aura and turned to Rosalie with a grin. ""Hey Rosalie, let's bounce.""

Rosalie gazed at Zaki's grin, seeing a totally different guy from the tough character he'd just played. She knew Zaki was definitely not someone to mess with.

Since he'd already shown Yosef and Yuri who was boss, Rosalie decided to play it cool. ""Alright, Zaki."" With that, she hopped into the car cheerfully.

Zaki, not thinking much of it, agreed, slid into the driver's seat, buckled up, and drove off from the Moreno residence. All that was left were Yuri and Yosef, staring in shock as the car vanished into the distance.

""Who is that guy really..."" Yosef muttered, feeling his arm had healed, but the fear from moments before still lingered in his heart.

Yuri shook her head. ""I don't know either, but the license plate seemed to be from Janivelle. And it looked like a police plate too."" It was puzzling; Zaki looked so scruffy, and yet he was driving a police car from Janivelle.

""You must have seen it wrong,"" Yosef shook his head. He had been too scared to notice those details, but he was sure she must have missed it.

Rosalie's original family was supposedly all out of work—there was no way that they could afford a car with Janivelle plates. After all, only locals could use Janivelle license plates.

Getting a residency permit in Janivelle was not something just anyone could do. Even with all the Moreno family's money, they still had out-of-town plates. They bet Rosalie's family must be really poor; there was no way they were locals from Janivelle.

# Chapter 4 Her Family Is Super Loaded

In the car, Zaki felt a bit awkward and said to Rosalie, ""Sorry, Rosalie, I was in such a rush I forgot to bring a change of clothes. I'm a bit messy, and now people are talking about you because of me.""

Zaki really didn't care about what he wore or used, but he couldn't afford to embarrass Rosalie.

Rosalie shook her head understandingly. ""It's fine, as long as the clothes are comfy.""

Zaki felt a bit warmer towards Rosalie. But when he noticed she only had one backpack, he couldn't help but ask, ""Rosalie, didn't you bring any luggage? Just this one bag?""

Rosalie nodded, her tone cool. ""I don't want anything from the Moreno family.""

Zaki, being good at reading people, noticed the displeasure in Rosalie's tone, and his gaze cooled a bit. He quickly said, ""It's alright. Once we're home, anything you need, I will buy for you.""

Rosalie gave a gentle smile. ""Okay."" No matter what her family's real situation was, at least Zaki genuinely cared for her.

Rosalie noticed the route Zaki was taking and couldn't help but ask, ""Zaki, isn't this road leading to Oceanside Manor?""

Oceanside Manor was home to the wealthiest and most influential people in Janivelle. The manor was huge, almost taking up the whole East District. As people went up the hill, they passed by groups of big mansions and a few fancy estates.

Even though the Moreno family moved to Janivelle not too long ago, they had already figured out their main goal was to get close to the ten ancient families of Janivelle, all gathered in the East District.

Unfortunately, the road leading to the hill was lined with checkpoints. Without an invitation from a property owner within the mansion district, entry to Oceanside Manor was not allowed.

However, their car paused briefly at a checkpoint, the license plate was identified, and they were immediately granted access.

Zaki casually replied, ""Yeah, Mom and Dad are waiting for you at home.""

Rosalie couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the fact—her house was actually in Oceanside Manor.

At this moment, Rosalie started to question Curtis's investigation. Curtis had said that her parents and brothers were all unemployed. If that was the case, there was no way that her family could live in Oceanside Manor.

Rosalie frowned, thinking, 'Curtis has always been unreliable in getting things done. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to manage the company behind the scenes. He probably assumed they were unemployed and jumped to conclusions.

'But that's fine. Since my family is quite well-off, I don't need to worry about supporting them anymore.'

As they drove past several small villas, she thought the car would stop, but it didn't. When she saw a large villa, she couldn't help but think, 'It seems like my family is richer than I thought.'

Yet Zaki's car continued for another ten minutes, exiting the villa area and heading straight into the manor district. Rosalie narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'It seems my new home is exceptionally wealthy!'

But just as she was settling into her thoughts, the car kept going. It eventually drove all the way to the top of the mountain.

Oceanside Manor was named so because the road at its peak had no barriers, and clear seas stretch out on both sides.

At the end of this road, there was just one mega mansion. This was also a landmark people can spot from downtown Janivelle, the Skyline Castle.

It was a landmark because Skyline Castle sat at the peak of Janivelle, and people can spot this castle-like building from way off in the city center.

This place was said to be personally managed by a world-class designer, making it a super luxurious and modern landmark.

Inside this grand castle, people can catch the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most beautiful sunset over the sea at night, which was why it was named after this stunning view.

The owner of this place was a mystery. It was rumored that even the ten most prestigious families in Janivelle couldn't touch them. Yet, no one really knew who owned Skyline Castle.

They say the owner was incredibly wealthy, with investments all over the place. But they didn't run a family business; instead, top managers and stewards handled everything.

So, this mansion's owner had never shown their face, and nobody knew the true identity of their family members.

Just when Rosalie thought Zaki was just showing her the view and would soon head to another villa area, Zaki surprised her by driving straight into this museum-like estate.

In the sunlight, the fountain at the center of the estate splashed water in all directions, reflecting bright rays. The sculpture in the middle was actually a masterpiece by a famous modern artist, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Rosalie, who was used to appraising valuable artifacts, thought the sculpture was truly exceptional.

At this moment, Zaki's car slowly stopped at the front entrance of the castle. Before Rosalie could gather her thoughts, Zaki got out and, with a gentlemanly flair, opened her door. ""Welcome home, Rosalie.""

As soon as he finished speaking, over twenty servants lined up on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison and said, ""Welcome home!""

For a moment, Rosalie felt like she had stepped onto a movie set.

""Zaki... Is this... my house? Really?"" Even though Rosalie wasn't short on money and had seen plenty of influential people, she was still a bit shocked.

After all, she was prepared for her family to be broke, with her parents and siblings all jobless, relying on her to support them. She never expected a complete turnaround. Her family turned out to be the legendary top-tier mysterious billionaires of Janivelle.

# Chapter 5 Back Home

Zaki looked at Rosalie's somewhat surprised expression and smiled warmly, ""Yes, this is your home. Go on in, Mom and Dad are waiting for you.""

Rosalie composed herself and got out of the car, glancing at the extravagant red carpet beneath her feet, feeling a bit awkward as she walked up. ""Isn't this a bit too much?""

Zaki smiled, ""It's important."" After all, Rosalie had been through so many hardships over the years. Her first time home should be celebrated.

While they were speaking, two figures dashed out from the grand doors at the end of the red carpet. ""Is that Rosalie?!"" A voice filled with excitement and melody called out.

Rosalie looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple dress, yet she was elegant and ladylike. Although she was over forty, she maintained herself very well, resembling a famous actress, gentle and charming.

Beside the woman was a charismatic middle-aged man, standing tall and handsome, looking very much like Zaki. Rosalie could immediately tell that this couple must be her parents.

They were looking like a wealthy couple, having nothing related to the broke couple Curtis had mentioned.

At this moment, Roxanne Yoder had already reached Rosalie, grabbing her hand with tears in her eyes. ""That's it... this is truly my daughter. Zachary, look at how much she looks like me, right?""

Zachary Yoder was equally surprised as he looked at Rosalie and Roxanne's strikingly similar faces and agreed, ""Yeah, she really looks a lot like you.""

Roxanne was once an internationally renowned superstar, known for her stunning and unique beauty.

Initially, no one suspected their daughter Xyliana Yoder had been switched at birth. But when puberty hit, and Xyliana started to look less like Roxanne and Zachary, people began to whisper, and they felt something was wrong.

They didn't expect that shortly into their investigation, the Moreno family would discover the mistaken swap, and the police confirmed it with DNA tests between them and Rosalie, finally confirming Rosalie was indeed their biological daughter.

Initially, they planned to conduct a DNA test after Rosalie returned home, but now it seemed unnecessary. Rosalie looked exactly like a younger version of Roxanne, without any makeup, yet she exuded breathtaking beauty and pure charm.

Rosalie couldn't believe how much she looked like her mother either.

Jennifer had always kept Rosalie at arm's length because she was cute and pretty from a young age, and as she grew, she became stunningly beautiful.

Jennifer even wondered if Rosalie was really her own daughter. Driven by these doubts, Jennifer started investigating, and to her surprise, her suspicions were confirmed.

Rosalie felt that she truly found her biological parents.

""Dad, Mom, the wind is strong outside, let's go inside and talk."" Being at a seaside mansion, the sea breeze was indeed strong. Zaki gently reminded Roxanne, worried she might catch a cold.

Roxanne nodded excitedly. ""Yes, yes, I was so excited I forgot! Let's go in,"" she said, grabbing Rosalie's hand as they walked inside.

Rosalie felt Roxanne's soft and warm hand, and a wave of warmth spread through her heart. Having been resented by Jennifer since childhood, Rosalie rarely experienced a mother's care and love. Now she could finally feel just how comforting her mother's warmth was.

They walked in together. First, they went through the foyer. Even though it was just a small entrance hall, it felt like an art gallery, with walls covered in paintings, and in front of them, various pottery and sculptural artworks were displayed.

As Rosalie passed by one of the pottery pieces, she paused for a moment. She pondered, 'This piece of art looks so familiar.'

Noticing Rosalie's gaze, Roxanne quickly asked, ""Rosalie, do you like this artwork?""

Rosalie paused for a moment, feeling awkward, and just nodded. She replied in her heart, 'Of course, I like it. I made it.'

However, with so many artworks she finished each month, she usually just packed them up and had her assistant take them to her art studio to sell.

This particular piece only took her three hours at most to finish. She never thought it would end up at her parents' house.

Roxanne said, ""If you like it, feel free to put it in your room. It's the masterpiece of a mysterious new artist. I bought it a month ago at a charity auction for 3 million dollars. It wasn't expensive, but it's quite creative.""

Hearing this, Rosalie's lips twitched, thinking, '3 million dollars, and it is not expensive?'

Although the Moreno family was among the top three wealthy families in Serenity District, they couldn't just easily spend 3 million dollars on such a small piece of art. And it was something Rosalie created on a whim. She couldn't help but guess how rich her family was.

They all moved to the main hall, where several servants were lined up on either side.

Ten of them were holding trays with various drinks. Even the coffee had several types, while another group carried assorted snacks.

Roxanne walked by with Rosalie and said softly, ""Since it's your first time home, I didn't know what you like to drink, so we made all sorts of coffee. We've also got a variety of juices. Just choose what you like.

""And over here are the pastries from Janivelle's best bakeries. I got one of each flavor for you to taste, so feel free to try them.""

Seeing Roxanne's eager eyes, Rosalie had to choose a cup of freshly ground coffee and two pastries. ""I don't like it too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors are just perfect.""

Roxanne was immediately overjoyed. ""I never would have guessed that our tastes are so similar.""

The selected servant brought the pastries, while the others left.

Zaki then said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to change my clothes.""

Zachary looked at Zaki's messy appearance and sighed, ""You're now the leader of Special Unit A of Interpol! What kind of case would make you personally lead a team to such an extent? If I'd known you looked like this, I wouldn't have sent you to pick up Rosalie. What if you scared her?""

Zaki felt embarrassed. ""We were capturing an international drug lord this time. It wasn't just me; even the deputy chief personally led the operation.""",1,1752236278.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The doctor didn’t disclose what they thought it was and we’re awaiting biopsy results. I saw the image and after a quick google search it appears to my untrained eye to be barettes esophagus. Not bad, not great. We will wait for the biopsy results before we celebrate. 

Background. My husband has suffered from heart burn since his teens, almost everyone in his family has it. He drinks alcohol regularly. Drinks at least two cups of coffee a day plus pre workout. A few months ago after a night of heavy drinking at a get together he started vomiting blood plus severe stomach pains. He’s been suffering from stomach pains the past few months also. 3 years ago his grandfather passed away from esophageal cancer. It was a terrible, painful death.

My husband read that barettes esophagus only has a 5% chance of turning into cancer. So he thinks he doesn’t need to change his lifestyle because he thinks it’s low. He’s acting childish. Last night before bed he literally cracked open a beer, his voice was still horse from the scope/biopsy. He will not listen to reason. I’m writing this as he left to go get his first coffee of the day and refused to at least eat something first. 

Once we get the results and know for sure what we’re looking at I want to tell him mother, to get back up, if he doesn’t change his tune. It was her father that passed from esophageal cancer. WIBTA?

1lx58zh,https://i.redd.it/2a5w6o6tk8cf1.jpeg,"Love Under The Billionaire's Gavel: Summary, Review and Reading Link","# 1.Chapter 1 Man In The Suite

Elara Langton had just finished her global journey and arrived back in Egeorto at 2 AM. Instead of heading to her apartment, she caught a taxi straight to the swankiest hotel in downtown Landblic.

She hadn't slept a wink the night before and was completely drained. When she got to the hotel, exhaustion hit her like a ton of bricks. She swiped her key card and let herself into room 2201 on the top floor.

Too tired to even glance around the suite, she tossed her suitcase into the entryway, unzipped it right there on the floor, and pulled out a black silk nightgown. Then she made a beeline for the bathroom.

The presidential suite had a bathtub right by the window, perfect for soaking while taking in the dazzling night views of Landblic. The one-way glass added a thrilling sense of privacy.

Suddenly, her curiosity was sparked—there was a small cabinet next to the tub. Most people wouldn't know what was inside, but Elara knew exactly what to expect—she'd seen these setups in plenty of local hotels.

She slipped out of her white dress, opened the cabinet with a flick of her fingers, and her eyes narrowed as she picked out something tempting, tore open the packaging, and stepped into the tub.

\*\*\*\*\*

Three in the morning, and Adrian was deep in sleep—until something tugged him back to the surface. It was a woman's voice, soft and low, like a whisper in the dark. At first, it was just a gentle hum, barely there, but with an undeniable pull.

He was half-asleep, but the sound wrapped around him, dragging him in. He let himself drift, caught in a hazy half-dream, until the hum grew more insistent and urgent...

His heart started racing, and he jolted awake, every nerve on edge. The moment he opened his eyes, the sound hit a high note and then vanished into silence.

Adrian blinked, trying to focus. The hotel room was dark, the only light coming from the dim yellow glow of the bathroom. Everything looked the same as when he'd drifted off. He started to doubt it was just a dream.

He shook his head, feeling a strange mix of confusion and frustration. He'd always been the type to keep a tight rein on his desires. This kind of dream was new territory.

It had to be the stress, the nonstop work for the past month, his mind and body stretched to the breaking point.

He decided a cold shower might help clear his head. Throwing off the covers, he got out of bed, naked.

The bathroom door was wide open. He stepped inside, his long legs carrying him forward. A white dress on the floor caught his eye, and he frowned, puzzled. He moved closer, and then his gaze landed on the bathtub.

There, a naked woman was lounging inside, her eyes half-closed, her face flushed, and her lips parted as she breathed softly. She looked like a dream, but in the most intoxicating way.

Adrian's face remained impassive, but his heart skipped a beat. He stood there for a moment, making sure this wasn't just another strange dream. Then he spoke, his voice calm but firm, ""Who are you?""

Elara was still in a daze, her mind foggy from the afterglow of her little escape. She was halfway to sleep when Adrian's voice startled her. She jerked upright, her eyes wide with surprise as she saw him standing there, his expression unreadable.

He was naked, having just come from bed, and this sent a jolt through Elara. She instinctively covered herself, turning away. She shouted, her voice soft but tinged with panic, ""Hey! You creep! Get out.""

Her voice was just the same as the one in his ""dream""—Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly. ""You saw me first,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""And now you're telling me to leave? This is my room.""

Elara rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""How shameless!""

""Me, shameless?"" Adrian raised an eyebrow. ""Who's the one in the bathtub, acting all self-righteous while doing something so indecent?""

# 2.Chapter 2 Sexual Harassment

Elara huddled in the tub, feeling like she was about to burst. She was just doing what any woman would do, so she was furious that Adrian was making a fuss over it. She snapped, her voice trembling with anger, ""Get out!""

But Adrian didn't budge. He stood there, unimpressed. ""This is my place. Why should I leave?""

Naked and exposed, Elara felt her anger bubble over. The humiliation of being caught, the frustration of being overruled, and the fact that he was still there—her chest tightened. She took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool.

After what felt like forever, he still hadn't moved. Elara closed her eyes, took a steadying breath, and softened her tone. ""Sir, have you seen enough? Could you please step out so I can get dressed? And maybe put some clothes on yourself?""

Adrian snapped out of a daze and didn't want any argument with her now. He turned and walked out of the bathroom without another word.

As soon as she heard the door click shut, Elara leaped out of the tub. She grabbed the black silk nightgown, pulled it on, and then tiptoed out.

Right then, Adrian was now sitting on the couch, wrapped in a hotel robe, a cigarette between his fingers.

Before they could even think about another showdown, the doorbell rang.

Adrian stood up, his tall frame looming over her. As he walked past, she felt a strange sense of intimidation wash over her.

Elara crossed her arms, her eyes still flashing with anger. ""Pervert! Where are you going?"" she snapped.

Without turning around, Adrian replied coldly, ""Who's the pervert here is still up for debate. Since we can't seem to sort this out, let the hotel handle it.""

He opened the door to reveal a woman in a grey pantsuit, her makeup flawless and her smile professional. She was the hotel's VIP manager. ""Mr. Hartley, you mentioned someone broke into your room?"" she asked.

Adrian's expression was grim as he stepped aside to let her in. He pointed to Elara, who was standing by the couch. ""That's her. She broke into my room at night and sexually harassed me.""

Elara froze. 'What? Broke into his room? Sexually harassed him? Me?'

Already seething, she exploded. ""Do you have some narcissistic problem? Think you're Brad Pitt or something? Why would I even want to harass you?""

""Isn't it obvious?"" Adrian retorted. ""Who was naked in my bathtub, enjoying—""

Elara cut him off sharply, her voice rising in panic. ""Shut up!""

Adrian didn't continue, but he didn't want to let her go. He said, his tone biting, ""So this isn't harassment?""

Elara knew she was no match for this silver-tongued man. Her face burning with frustration, she marched to the entryway, grabbed her key card and ID from her suitcase, and thrust them at the manager.

She said, ""Here's my key card and ID. I used it to get in here, just like anyone else.""

Her face was now flushed with anger, her delicate features twisted into a scowl that somehow made her look more exasperated than intimidating.

She pointed a slender finger at Adrian and snapped, ""The real creep here is him! He sneaked into my room in the middle of the night to spy on me while I was bathing. I'm calling the police.""

The manager glanced at the right key card and frowned. Hearing Elara's threat to call the police, she started to panic. That was the last thing the hotel needed.

""Ms. Langton,"" she said quickly, ""there must be some misunderstanding. Maybe the hotel system glitched and gave you the wrong room, or the front desk handed you the wrong key card.

""It's late now. Let me arrange a new room for you. I'll give you a full explanation in the morning, okay?""

Elara was exhausted, but Adrian's harsh words still rankled her. She retorted, ""Why don't you check him first? Did he check in under his own name? Does he even have a key for this room?""

""Ms. Langton,"" the manager explained, ""Mr. Hartley is a close friend of our boss. This room is reserved for him permanently and isn't available for rent. Technically, he can't be considered an intruder.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Beware

Elara was stunned into silence. It seemed she was really supposed to just take this. She glanced at Adrian, whose lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk, as if he was daring her to come up with a comeback.

But she just couldn't bring herself to back down. ""So you're saying I just have to swallow this and call it a night? Even though I was seen naked for no reason, and now he's accusing me of harassment?""

The manager looked apologetic. ""I'm really sorry. Please stay in another room tonight. We'll sort this out first thing tomorrow morning—""

Elara didn't want to hear more. She grabbed her phone from her bag and started dialing 911.

The manager's eyes widened in panic, and she glanced nervously at Adrian.

Before Elara could finish, Adrian grabbed her wrist and yanked the phone away. ""Miss, looking at someone naked isn't a crime. Calling the police won't change that. Besides, I was in the room first. If anyone's at fault here, it's you for barging in.""

His expression was cold and menacing, his eyes hard and unyielding. He had that air of someone used to being in control.

He didn't want to cause trouble for his friend's hotel, and as their regular lawyer, he knew a police report would only make things worse for him.

Adrian took another step closer, his cold gaze meeting her frightened one. His words were a clear threat. ""If you call the police, I'll sue you for trespassing and harassment.""

He tightened his grip on Elara's slender wrist, holding her so tightly that her skin turned red.

Elara winced, her eyes filling with tears. ""How dare you—"" Her voice was barely above a whisper, trembling with rage, and even the manager felt a flicker of sympathy.

Adrian's relentless approach also made the manager start to worry. She quickly stepped in. ""Mr. Hartley, let's calm down. Let me talk to her first and see if we can sort this out.""

Adrian released Elara's wrist, but his stern expression remained unchanged.

Elara frowned, her eyes glistening with tears as she rubbed her reddened wrist. Her usually confident voice wavered. ""Give me my phone back.""

Adrian tensed, thinking she might call the police. His grip on the phone tightened.

Elara lunged for her phone, her face streaked with tears. ""You'll regret this."" She tossed over her shoulder, her voice shaking. She spun around, grabbed a camel coat from her suitcase in the hallway, threw it on, and yanked her high heels back on. Then she stormed out.

Adrian raised an eyebrow. 'She's scared off just like that? I haven't even gotten a chance to question her yet, and she's already acting like the victim?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara gritted her teeth, dragging her suitcase out of the hotel. She pulled out her phone and made a call. ""Ruby, what kind of dump did you recommend? This place is trash!""

Her friend Ruby sounded surprised. ""Wait, what? It's the top-rated hotel in town.""

""Is it the kind where you end up getting arrested?""

Ruby, back home and sipping her coffee, frowned in confusion. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm posting about this on my social media. This hotel is a disaster.""

""Hey, don't! I'm trying to get in good with the owner. Don't mess this up for me.""

""You're so blinded by this guy. You have no idea how much I've been through today.""

Ruby didn't know what happened exactly and sighed, trying to smooth things over, ""Can't you just let it go? You haven't seen how hot this guy is. I finally got him to agree to dinner this weekend by having you promote his hotel.""

""No way. I can't take this. I'm exposing him. And I'm getting my influencer friends to share it.""

Ruby laughed, ""Elara, calm down. Was it bad service? Or was the place dirty? Once I've got this guy wrapped around my finger, I'll get back at him for you.

""Oh, and he's got this super-hot friend. I'll introduce you. This top lawyer guy—well, if I weren't into Victor, I'd never let him go.""

""Thanks, but I'll pass. You can keep those two for yourself.""

""Elara, seriously, are you just going to stick with Alex forever?""

""Hey, you're right. Alex is the hottest guy ever.""

After hanging up, Elara quickly drafted a tweet, then set up her phone tripod at the hotel entrance and started filming a video. Her fingers tapped away on the screen and soon, the tweet was posted.

\[Beware! Dolphin Bay Hotel owned by Montgomery Group ($3,000/night) is a scam. A creep broke in, and the manager silenced me, no cops allowed. The creep, a lawyer, blamed me for trespassing—all threats, no solutions! Avoid it, girls. It's pricey and ruins trips.\]

# 4.Chapter 4 Is It A Big Deal?

In Room 2201 of Dolphin Bay Hotel, Adrian sat on the couch, still wearing his hotel robe and smoking a cigarette.

He had just wrapped up a major case here. Last night, he'd hung out with some friends, drank until he was tipsy, and stumbled back to the hotel around midnight. Too tired to do anything else, he'd taken a quick shower and crashed into bed.

At 4 a.m., his grogginess vanished after the incident. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table, padded back to the couch, and poured himself a drink. His phone had died somehow, and he turned it on and started scrolling through his unread messages.

Victor: \[Crash in my room tonight. 2209, y' know. I got to hook up with this top influencer for a hotel staycation promo. She's a big deal—hard to get. Last-minute arrangement, no spare rooms, and my place is cluttered—so she's staying in yours.\]

After reading the message, Adrian frowned and quickly typed back: \[I pissed her off. Is it a big deal?\]

Victor was back home, playing golf with friends. When he saw the text, he was stunned. \[Huh?\]

Adrian: \[Saw your text too late. She was in the tub—I walked in.\]

Victor: \[What? You!\]

Adrian: \[Troublesome for you?\]

Victor: \[Yeah... So? Did you apologize? What did she say?\]

Adrian: \[I didn't apologize.\]

Victor: \[What? Man!\]

Adrian tossed his phone aside and didn't reply. Not only did he not apologize, but he even said something threatening.

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara took a cab back to her place and fell asleep almost immediately. She woke up naturally at 1 p.m. the next noon. She glanced out the window at the warm sunshine. It was her last time in this apartment, and she felt a pang of sadness.

She stretched, her long, straight hair cascading down her shoulders. In the sunlight, her hair gleamed with a soft golden light. Her smooth skin was covered by her black nightgown, which shimmered slightly.

She leaned back against the headboard and fumbled under the covers for her phone. It was dead. She must have been too exhausted last night to even plug it in before falling asleep. She plugged it in and turned it on.

Before she could even check her unread messages, her phone rang—it was Ruby.

She answered the phone. The voice on the other end was so loud it almost made her wince. ""Elara! Darn it, you finally picked up!""

Elara pulled the phone away from her ear. Her voice was hoarse. ""What?""

Ruby shouted, ""Didn't I tell you not to post about Dolphin Bay Hotel? Why did you go and do that? How am I supposed to explain this to Victor? And what about the sexual harassment? Someone harassed you at the hotel yesterday?""

""Yeah. This guy saw me naked.""

""What?! I thought you were just joking on Twitter. Are you okay? Who was that creep?""

""I'm fine, but I got falsely accused of sexual harassment. He even threatened to sue me.""

""Then why didn't you tell me yesterday?""

""You're head over heels for the hotel owner! What good would telling you do? And you're back home—what help could you possibly offer from there?""

""Elara, that's harsh. Do you really think I'm that unreliable?""

""Yep,"" Elara replied, her tone flat.

""Who is he? Is he a guest or staff?""

""The manager said he's the owner's best friend and a lawyer.""

Ruby sounded shocked. ""Don't tell me it's Adrian. Wait. I'll call Victor and find out what happened.""

After hanging up, Elara checked her Twitter. Her video from yesterday had gone viral—six of the top ten trends were about her. And this was just what she wanted. She scrolled through some of the comments below.

\[Sexual harassment? What's going on? That's terrifying.\]

\[I booked a room at Dolphin Bay for my honeymoon next month! What should I do? Should I cancel it?\]

\[Cancel now! Don't risk your life over it.\]

\[This is crazy! Elara's IP is in Landblic, and Dolphin Bay Hotel has branches all over the country. Should we avoid all of them or just the one in Landblic?\]

Elara replied: \[Brave enough and try the ones in other cities—but don't go alone. Bring some friends who know how to fight.\]

After that, she tossed her phone onto the bed and got ready to freshen up and pack.

Elara studied in Egeorto and graduated last month. She had planned to live with Alex Keating, her childhood sweetheart, in Egeorto and build their life together. But Alex had to return home last month. This left her with no reason to stay.

Most of her belongings had already been packed and shipped back, so there wasn't much left in the apartment. Now, she was just packing up the gifts from her graduation trip.

Alex's dad Dylan worked as an accountant at a middle school in Veritasiton. Not long ago, he had an argument at school that escalated into a dispute. Alex went back to help resolve it.

The process took over a month, so Alex asked his company to transfer him to the headquarters back home. Since Elara's graduation ceremony hadn't happened yet, she had to return a month later.

After finishing packing, Elara's phone rang. It was Alex. ""Elara, I can't pick you up at the airport tonight. I'll have Julian drive over to get you,"" he said.

Elara felt a bit disappointed but understood. ""Fine. Something going on tonight?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I have a meeting with a lawyer about my dad's case,"" Alex replied.

Elara responded gently, ""Okay, your dad's case is important. Just go ahead.""

""Okay. See you when you get back,"" Alex said.

After hanging up, Elara felt a bit down. She sat on the bed, thinking she'd scroll through Instagram. But then she noticed a friend request on WhatsApp.

She clicked on it. It was from Victor: \[Elara, I'm Victor Montgomery, the owner of Dolphin Bay Hotel. Please accept my friend request.\]

# 5.Chapter 5 All Dressed Up

Elara tapped ""ignore"" and then checked Ruby's message.

Ruby: \[The room was kept for Victor's buddy Adrian. Victor said Adrian was drunk, missed texts, and didn't know you were coming. He just thought you broke in and got upset. Victor's sorry and wanna treat you to dinner when you're back home.\]

Elara: \[Don't need it. Apology not accepted.\]

Ruby: \[So what do you say? How about you stop being mad?\]

Elara: \[Ruby, your bestie got gawked at! Siding with them? Not helping me?\]

Ruby: \[Elara, it just happened. Just let it go and get some perks from it. Don't be so uptight! And Victor said you checked Adrian out? Hot? How buff? Got any abs? I saw him in a suit—he looked amazing. Aren't you tempted?\]

Elara laughed in frustration and typed: \[Don't be crazy.\]

Ruby: \[You're totally obsessed with Alex! There's no room for any other guy in your life, huh?\]

Elara: \[Don't tell Alex about this.\]

Ruby: \[Well, I doubt he'd even care.\]

Ruby saw things clearly. Alex hadn't been in a relationship for years, and he'd never really sparked anything with Elara. Sure, Elara was stunningly beautiful, and Alex was always doting on her, but it hadn't gone anywhere.

If Alex had real feelings for her, they'd probably have gotten married by now. But Elara, completely blinded by it all, just couldn't see it.

Ruby was frustrated. 'What a waste of a pretty face! What good is beauty if you don't understand love? By age 22, she hasn't even been on a date or held a guy's hand.'

Ruby typed: \[Is Alex picking you up tomorrow?\]

Elara: \[No. He's too busy.\]

Ruby: \[Oh, come on. Only you would believe that.\]

Elara: \[What do you mean?\]

Ruby sent a screenshot. It was Nancy's tweet: \[Long distance for four years, finally celebrating our anniversary together.\] The picture showed the back of a man.

Elara knew that man all too well, having gazed longingly at his back countless times—it was Alex. Her heart ached as she closed the picture and turned off her phone.

But shortly, she still messaged Ruby: \[""You know Nancy always makes up stories. He said he was meeting the lawyer, and I trust him.\]

Ruby: \[Fine. If that makes you feel better.\]

\*\*\*\*\*

At nine o'clock in the evening, Elara arrived at Veritasiton Airport. September had brought a chill to the air in Veritasiton. She was wearing a long black trench coat over a gray knit dress. Her slender figure and long legs made her stand out in the bustling airport.

""Elara!"" Julian's voice called out from a distance.

She glanced up, hopeful for a moment, and then looked away, disappointment etched on her face. Elara pouted—Alex really hadn't shown up.

""Aren't you happy to see me?"" Julian jogged over, noticing Elara's expression, and tousled her hair. ""Long time no see, Elara. At least pretend you missed me.""

Elara turned her head away. ""Hey, I just washed my hair. Don't mess it up!""

Julian lowered his hand and casually took her suitcase. ""Come on. Ruby threw a party for you.""

Elara wasn't in the mood. ""I don't feel like it.""

Julian chuckled in mild annoyance, ""What? After being abroad for four years, you're only thinking about Alex now? You won't even spend time with us?""

He pulled the suitcase and guided Elara toward the garage. ""Alex couldn't make it. You can stay with us longer. If Alex were here, it wouldn't be as much fun.""

He loaded the suitcase into the trunk of the Rolls-Royce, then walked over and opened the passenger door for Elara. She got in and buckled her seatbelt absentmindedly.

Julian got into the driver's seat. Seeing Elara ignoring him, he shook his head helplessly. He reached over, gently grabbed her chin, and turned her face toward him. ""Hey, Elara? Did you hear me?""

""Huh?"" Elara snapped out of her daze. ""What did you say?""

Julian gave a wry smile. ""Elara, you've got some nerve."" With a light nudge, he pushed her head back against the seat. Then he buckled his seatbelt and stepped on the gas.

During the ride, Julian stayed quiet. Elara didn't need to think twice to know he was upset. They had grown up together since childhood, and even though she'd been studying abroad for the past four years and they'd seen each other less often, she knew him well.

Julian came from a wealthy family but was raised humbly at his grandparents' home. He was a rebel and a bit of a slacker who seemed to look down on everyone, yet somehow he got along great with Elara and Ruby.

Elara glanced at Julian, her eyes lingering on him for a moment before she looked away. It was the first time she'd seen him in a suit—his hair neatly styled, his boyish look replaced by a more mature, composed appearance.

In the suit, he looked very gentlemanly, almost ruggedly handsome, except for the sour expression on his face.

Elara clicked her tongue. He had never known how to dress properly since junior high—always hanging half his uniform off his arm and pulling up one pant leg. But now he was all dressed up.

Julian noticed Elara checking him out and a smile tugged at his lips.

Then Elara said, ""Going on a date today? Look at you, all dressed up.""",1,1752235875.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1lx58bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1lx58bb/anyone_else_creatively_using_iphone_reminders_as/,"Anyone else creatively using iPhone reminders as ""digital sticky notes""?","Reading about another Redditor who uses a widget or some such to put notes on her lock screen made me wonder if reminders app notifications could serve a similar purpose.

...and I had a specific use case for such because alarms can be too disruptive and this can also cause me to become desensitized to them.

*side note: it's probably worth mentioning that I've heretofore eschewed the reminders app for reliability reasons but which I don't believe affect use of the app for this narrow purpose.*

So yesterday I began substituting some of my alarms with reminders and I think it's promising.

Here are some example substitutions which are nice to just be reminded of via my lock screen:

""Walk vs anxiety"" at 10am <== Optional + not time-sensitive to specifically 10am + not always possible

""Monitor hunger so don't dine out"" at 2pm <== Nice as a persistent reminder in that I'll see this whenever I look at my lock screen instead of something more awkward/clunky and causing decision fatigue like repeatedly snoozing or rescheduling an alarm.

""Need to shred parmesan for pasta"" <== Another ""soft/persistent"" reminder / information delivery ABOUT something I'm doing vs an alarm THAT I need to do something. This pairs nicely with an ""It's time for dinner"" alarm (for time blindness) because I'll then know to task switch to making dinner but then the ""shred parmesan"" reminder on my lock screen functions kind of like a recipe where I'll remember to shred parmesan while waiting for my water to boil.

""Upper is actionable"" <== Similar to ""shred parmesan"" and paired with a ""Time for the gym"" alarm, this reminds me that I can work my upper body because I've recovered from my prior upper body workout.

*Side note: In case anyone is wondering, I track workout recovery using a paper monthly planner. For example, when I come across ""Upper is actionable"" while cleaning up my reminders tomorrow morning, I'll know to add ""Upper body"" to my monthly planner for three days from now, when, as my coffee is brewing that morning, I'll see it while reviewing my planner and add it as a reminder for that day and the cycle continues...*

""I should receive Crunch membership renewal email by July 30"" <== This is something I need to know while I'm at the gym because I need to follow up about this with the staff so having this on my lock screen is great because I'll see it while I'm working out and can just check with the staff between sets. Alarms don't work very well at all for something like this.

""(Eat?) > Shower > Meditate"" <== This is better as a reminder because this doesn't happen exactly at 6pm, for example, so instead of having to snooze/reschedule this alarm, I can just schedule the reminder notification to appear on my lock screen anytime during my workout so I see it whenever I'm done with my workout.

Anyway, you get the idea. ""Soft reminders"" and ""recipe"" / pure info delivery seem to be great use cases for reminders and also I'm excited that this may also help reduce or eliminate my dismissiveness of alarms because alarms will now be truly time-sensitive.

Is anyone else doing this?

Any experiences, tips or caveats you have to share?

*Side note: Another benefit of this is that my phone is very old (iPhone 7 😲) so third-party apps are often not an option as many won't install/work on my phone.*",1,1752235822.0,adhd_anxiety,0,1.0,False

1lx56pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lx56pa/love_under_the_billionaires_gavel/,Love Under The Billionaire's Gavel,"Elara Langton had just finished her global journey and arrived back in Egeorto at 2 AM. Instead of heading to her apartment, she caught a taxi straight to the swankiest hotel in downtown Landblic.

She hadn't slept a wink the night before and was completely drained. When she got to the hotel, exhaustion hit her like a ton of bricks. She swiped her key card and let herself into room 2201 on the top floor.

Too tired to even glance around the suite, she tossed her suitcase into the entryway, unzipped it right there on the floor, and pulled out a black silk nightgown. Then she made a beeline for the bathroom.

The presidential suite had a bathtub right by the window, perfect for soaking while taking in the dazzling night views of Landblic. The one-way glass added a thrilling sense of privacy.

Suddenly, her curiosity was sparked—there was a small cabinet next to the tub. Most people wouldn't know what was inside, but Elara knew exactly what to expect—she'd seen these setups in plenty of local hotels.

She slipped out of her white dress, opened the cabinet with a flick of her fingers, and her eyes narrowed as she picked out something tempting, tore open the packaging, and stepped into the tub.

\*\*\*\*\*

Three in the morning, and Adrian was deep in sleep—until something tugged him back to the surface. It was a woman's voice, soft and low, like a whisper in the dark. At first, it was just a gentle hum, barely there, but with an undeniable pull.

He was half-asleep, but the sound wrapped around him, dragging him in. He let himself drift, caught in a hazy half-dream, until the hum grew more insistent and urgent...

His heart started racing, and he jolted awake, every nerve on edge. The moment he opened his eyes, the sound hit a high note and then vanished into silence.

Adrian blinked, trying to focus. The hotel room was dark, the only light coming from the dim yellow glow of the bathroom. Everything looked the same as when he'd drifted off. He started to doubt it was just a dream.

He shook his head, feeling a strange mix of confusion and frustration. He'd always been the type to keep a tight rein on his desires. This kind of dream was new territory.

It had to be the stress, the nonstop work for the past month, his mind and body stretched to the breaking point.

He decided a cold shower might help clear his head. Throwing off the covers, he got out of bed, naked.

The bathroom door was wide open. He stepped inside, his long legs carrying him forward. A white dress on the floor caught his eye, and he frowned, puzzled. He moved closer, and then his gaze landed on the bathtub.

There, a naked woman was lounging inside, her eyes half-closed, her face flushed, and her lips parted as she breathed softly. She looked like a dream, but in the most intoxicating way.

Adrian's face remained impassive, but his heart skipped a beat. He stood there for a moment, making sure this wasn't just another strange dream. Then he spoke, his voice calm but firm, ""Who are you?""

Elara was still in a daze, her mind foggy from the afterglow of her little escape. She was halfway to sleep when Adrian's voice startled her. She jerked upright, her eyes wide with surprise as she saw him standing there, his expression unreadable.

He was naked, having just come from bed, and this sent a jolt through Elara. She instinctively covered herself, turning away. She shouted, her voice soft but tinged with panic, ""Hey! You creep! Get out.""

Her voice was just the same as the one in his ""dream""—Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly. ""You saw me first,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""And now you're telling me to leave? This is my room.""

Elara rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""How shameless!""

""Me, shameless?"" Adrian raised an eyebrow. ""Who's the one in the bathtub, acting all self-righteous while doing something so indecent?""

# 2.Chapter 2 Sexual Harassment

Elara huddled in the tub, feeling like she was about to burst. She was just doing what any woman would do, so she was furious that Adrian was making a fuss over it. She snapped, her voice trembling with anger, ""Get out!""

But Adrian didn't budge. He stood there, unimpressed. ""This is my place. Why should I leave?""

Naked and exposed, Elara felt her anger bubble over. The humiliation of being caught, the frustration of being overruled, and the fact that he was still there—her chest tightened. She took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool.

After what felt like forever, he still hadn't moved. Elara closed her eyes, took a steadying breath, and softened her tone. ""Sir, have you seen enough? Could you please step out so I can get dressed? And maybe put some clothes on yourself?""

Adrian snapped out of a daze and didn't want any argument with her now. He turned and walked out of the bathroom without another word.

As soon as she heard the door click shut, Elara leaped out of the tub. She grabbed the black silk nightgown, pulled it on, and then tiptoed out.

Right then, Adrian was now sitting on the couch, wrapped in a hotel robe, a cigarette between his fingers.

Before they could even think about another showdown, the doorbell rang.

Adrian stood up, his tall frame looming over her. As he walked past, she felt a strange sense of intimidation wash over her.

Elara crossed her arms, her eyes still flashing with anger. ""Pervert! Where are you going?"" she snapped.

Without turning around, Adrian replied coldly, ""Who's the pervert here is still up for debate. Since we can't seem to sort this out, let the hotel handle it.""

He opened the door to reveal a woman in a grey pantsuit, her makeup flawless and her smile professional. She was the hotel's VIP manager. ""Mr. Hartley, you mentioned someone broke into your room?"" she asked.

Adrian's expression was grim as he stepped aside to let her in. He pointed to Elara, who was standing by the couch. ""That's her. She broke into my room at night and sexually harassed me.""

Elara froze. 'What? Broke into his room? Sexually harassed him? Me?'

Already seething, she exploded. ""Do you have some narcissistic problem? Think you're Brad Pitt or something? Why would I even want to harass you?""

""Isn't it obvious?"" Adrian retorted. ""Who was naked in my bathtub, enjoying—""

Elara cut him off sharply, her voice rising in panic. ""Shut up!""

Adrian didn't continue, but he didn't want to let her go. He said, his tone biting, ""So this isn't harassment?""

Elara knew she was no match for this silver-tongued man. Her face burning with frustration, she marched to the entryway, grabbed her key card and ID from her suitcase, and thrust them at the manager.

She said, ""Here's my key card and ID. I used it to get in here, just like anyone else.""

Her face was now flushed with anger, her delicate features twisted into a scowl that somehow made her look more exasperated than intimidating.

She pointed a slender finger at Adrian and snapped, ""The real creep here is him! He sneaked into my room in the middle of the night to spy on me while I was bathing. I'm calling the police.""

The manager glanced at the right key card and frowned. Hearing Elara's threat to call the police, she started to panic. That was the last thing the hotel needed.

""Ms. Langton,"" she said quickly, ""there must be some misunderstanding. Maybe the hotel system glitched and gave you the wrong room, or the front desk handed you the wrong key card.

""It's late now. Let me arrange a new room for you. I'll give you a full explanation in the morning, okay?""

Elara was exhausted, but Adrian's harsh words still rankled her. She retorted, ""Why don't you check him first? Did he check in under his own name? Does he even have a key for this room?""

""Ms. Langton,"" the manager explained, ""Mr. Hartley is a close friend of our boss. This room is reserved for him permanently and isn't available for rent. Technically, he can't be considered an intruder.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Beware

Elara was stunned into silence. It seemed she was really supposed to just take this. She glanced at Adrian, whose lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk, as if he was daring her to come up with a comeback.

But she just couldn't bring herself to back down. ""So you're saying I just have to swallow this and call it a night? Even though I was seen naked for no reason, and now he's accusing me of harassment?""

The manager looked apologetic. ""I'm really sorry. Please stay in another room tonight. We'll sort this out first thing tomorrow morning—""

Elara didn't want to hear more. She grabbed her phone from her bag and started dialing 911.

The manager's eyes widened in panic, and she glanced nervously at Adrian.

Before Elara could finish, Adrian grabbed her wrist and yanked the phone away. ""Miss, looking at someone naked isn't a crime. Calling the police won't change that. Besides, I was in the room first. If anyone's at fault here, it's you for barging in.""

His expression was cold and menacing, his eyes hard and unyielding. He had that air of someone used to being in control.

He didn't want to cause trouble for his friend's hotel, and as their regular lawyer, he knew a police report would only make things worse for him.

Adrian took another step closer, his cold gaze meeting her frightened one. His words were a clear threat. ""If you call the police, I'll sue you for trespassing and harassment.""

He tightened his grip on Elara's slender wrist, holding her so tightly that her skin turned red.

Elara winced, her eyes filling with tears. ""How dare you—"" Her voice was barely above a whisper, trembling with rage, and even the manager felt a flicker of sympathy.

Adrian's relentless approach also made the manager start to worry. She quickly stepped in. ""Mr. Hartley, let's calm down. Let me talk to her first and see if we can sort this out.""

Adrian released Elara's wrist, but his stern expression remained unchanged.

Elara frowned, her eyes glistening with tears as she rubbed her reddened wrist. Her usually confident voice wavered. ""Give me my phone back.""

Adrian tensed, thinking she might call the police. His grip on the phone tightened.

Elara lunged for her phone, her face streaked with tears. ""You'll regret this."" She tossed over her shoulder, her voice shaking. She spun around, grabbed a camel coat from her suitcase in the hallway, threw it on, and yanked her high heels back on. Then she stormed out.

Adrian raised an eyebrow. 'She's scared off just like that? I haven't even gotten a chance to question her yet, and she's already acting like the victim?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara gritted her teeth, dragging her suitcase out of the hotel. She pulled out her phone and made a call. ""Ruby, what kind of dump did you recommend? This place is trash!""

Her friend Ruby sounded surprised. ""Wait, what? It's the top-rated hotel in town.""

""Is it the kind where you end up getting arrested?""

Ruby, back home and sipping her coffee, frowned in confusion. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm posting about this on my social media. This hotel is a disaster.""

""Hey, don't! I'm trying to get in good with the owner. Don't mess this up for me.""

""You're so blinded by this guy. You have no idea how much I've been through today.""

Ruby didn't know what happened exactly and sighed, trying to smooth things over, ""Can't you just let it go? You haven't seen how hot this guy is. I finally got him to agree to dinner this weekend by having you promote his hotel.""

""No way. I can't take this. I'm exposing him. And I'm getting my influencer friends to share it.""

Ruby laughed, ""Elara, calm down. Was it bad service? Or was the place dirty? Once I've got this guy wrapped around my finger, I'll get back at him for you.

""Oh, and he's got this super-hot friend. I'll introduce you. This top lawyer guy—well, if I weren't into Victor, I'd never let him go.""

""Thanks, but I'll pass. You can keep those two for yourself.""

""Elara, seriously, are you just going to stick with Alex forever?""

""Hey, you're right. Alex is the hottest guy ever.""

After hanging up, Elara quickly drafted a tweet, then set up her phone tripod at the hotel entrance and started filming a video. Her fingers tapped away on the screen and soon, the tweet was posted.

\[Beware! Dolphin Bay Hotel owned by Montgomery Group ($3,000/night) is a scam. A creep broke in, and the manager silenced me, no cops allowed. The creep, a lawyer, blamed me for trespassing—all threats, no solutions! Avoid it, girls. It's pricey and ruins trips.\]

# 4.Chapter 4 Is It A Big Deal?

In Room 2201 of Dolphin Bay Hotel, Adrian sat on the couch, still wearing his hotel robe and smoking a cigarette.

He had just wrapped up a major case here. Last night, he'd hung out with some friends, drank until he was tipsy, and stumbled back to the hotel around midnight. Too tired to do anything else, he'd taken a quick shower and crashed into bed.

At 4 a.m., his grogginess vanished after the incident. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table, padded back to the couch, and poured himself a drink. His phone had died somehow, and he turned it on and started scrolling through his unread messages.

Victor: \[Crash in my room tonight. 2209, y' know. I got to hook up with this top influencer for a hotel staycation promo. She's a big deal—hard to get. Last-minute arrangement, no spare rooms, and my place is cluttered—so she's staying in yours.\]

After reading the message, Adrian frowned and quickly typed back: \[I pissed her off. Is it a big deal?\]

Victor was back home, playing golf with friends. When he saw the text, he was stunned. \[Huh?\]

Adrian: \[Saw your text too late. She was in the tub—I walked in.\]

Victor: \[What? You!\]

Adrian: \[Troublesome for you?\]

Victor: \[Yeah... So? Did you apologize? What did she say?\]

Adrian: \[I didn't apologize.\]

Victor: \[What? Man!\]

Adrian tossed his phone aside and didn't reply. Not only did he not apologize, but he even said something threatening.

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara took a cab back to her place and fell asleep almost immediately. She woke up naturally at 1 p.m. the next noon. She glanced out the window at the warm sunshine. It was her last time in this apartment, and she felt a pang of sadness.

She stretched, her long, straight hair cascading down her shoulders. In the sunlight, her hair gleamed with a soft golden light. Her smooth skin was covered by her black nightgown, which shimmered slightly.

She leaned back against the headboard and fumbled under the covers for her phone. It was dead. She must have been too exhausted last night to even plug it in before falling asleep. She plugged it in and turned it on.

Before she could even check her unread messages, her phone rang—it was Ruby.

She answered the phone. The voice on the other end was so loud it almost made her wince. ""Elara! Darn it, you finally picked up!""

Elara pulled the phone away from her ear. Her voice was hoarse. ""What?""

Ruby shouted, ""Didn't I tell you not to post about Dolphin Bay Hotel? Why did you go and do that? How am I supposed to explain this to Victor? And what about the sexual harassment? Someone harassed you at the hotel yesterday?""

""Yeah. This guy saw me naked.""

""What?! I thought you were just joking on Twitter. Are you okay? Who was that creep?""

""I'm fine, but I got falsely accused of sexual harassment. He even threatened to sue me.""

""Then why didn't you tell me yesterday?""

""You're head over heels for the hotel owner! What good would telling you do? And you're back home—what help could you possibly offer from there?""

""Elara, that's harsh. Do you really think I'm that unreliable?""

""Yep,"" Elara replied, her tone flat.

""Who is he? Is he a guest or staff?""

""The manager said he's the owner's best friend and a lawyer.""

Ruby sounded shocked. ""Don't tell me it's Adrian. Wait. I'll call Victor and find out what happened.""

After hanging up, Elara checked her Twitter. Her video from yesterday had gone viral—six of the top ten trends were about her. And this was just what she wanted. She scrolled through some of the comments below.

\[Sexual harassment? What's going on? That's terrifying.\]

\[I booked a room at Dolphin Bay for my honeymoon next month! What should I do? Should I cancel it?\]

\[Cancel now! Don't risk your life over it.\]

\[This is crazy! Elara's IP is in Landblic, and Dolphin Bay Hotel has branches all over the country. Should we avoid all of them or just the one in Landblic?\]

Elara replied: \[Brave enough and try the ones in other cities—but don't go alone. Bring some friends who know how to fight.\]

After that, she tossed her phone onto the bed and got ready to freshen up and pack.

Elara studied in Egeorto and graduated last month. She had planned to live with Alex Keating, her childhood sweetheart, in Egeorto and build their life together. But Alex had to return home last month. This left her with no reason to stay.

Most of her belongings had already been packed and shipped back, so there wasn't much left in the apartment. Now, she was just packing up the gifts from her graduation trip.

Alex's dad Dylan worked as an accountant at a middle school in Veritasiton. Not long ago, he had an argument at school that escalated into a dispute. Alex went back to help resolve it.

The process took over a month, so Alex asked his company to transfer him to the headquarters back home. Since Elara's graduation ceremony hadn't happened yet, she had to return a month later.

After finishing packing, Elara's phone rang. It was Alex. ""Elara, I can't pick you up at the airport tonight. I'll have Julian drive over to get you,"" he said.

Elara felt a bit disappointed but understood. ""Fine. Something going on tonight?"" she asked.

""Yeah, I have a meeting with a lawyer about my dad's case,"" Alex replied.

Elara responded gently, ""Okay, your dad's case is important. Just go ahead.""

""Okay. See you when you get back,"" Alex said.

After hanging up, Elara felt a bit down. She sat on the bed, thinking she'd scroll through Instagram. But then she noticed a friend request on WhatsApp.

She clicked on it. It was from Victor: \[Elara, I'm Victor Montgomery, the owner of Dolphin Bay Hotel. Please accept my friend request.\]

# 5.Chapter 5 All Dressed Up

Elara tapped ""ignore"" and then checked Ruby's message.

Ruby: \[The room was kept for Victor's buddy Adrian. Victor said Adrian was drunk, missed texts, and didn't know you were coming. He just thought you broke in and got upset. Victor's sorry and wanna treat you to dinner when you're back home.\]

Elara: \[Don't need it. Apology not accepted.\]

Ruby: \[So what do you say? How about you stop being mad?\]

Elara: \[Ruby, your bestie got gawked at! Siding with them? Not helping me?\]

Ruby: \[Elara, it just happened. Just let it go and get some perks from it. Don't be so uptight! And Victor said you checked Adrian out? Hot? How buff? Got any abs? I saw him in a suit—he looked amazing. Aren't you tempted?\]

Elara laughed in frustration and typed: \[Don't be crazy.\]

Ruby: \[You're totally obsessed with Alex! There's no room for any other guy in your life, huh?\]

Elara: \[Don't tell Alex about this.\]

Ruby: \[Well, I doubt he'd even care.\]

Ruby saw things clearly. Alex hadn't been in a relationship for years, and he'd never really sparked anything with Elara. Sure, Elara was stunningly beautiful, and Alex was always doting on her, but it hadn't gone anywhere.

If Alex had real feelings for her, they'd probably have gotten married by now. But Elara, completely blinded by it all, just couldn't see it.

Ruby was frustrated. 'What a waste of a pretty face! What good is beauty if you don't understand love? By age 22, she hasn't even been on a date or held a guy's hand.'

Ruby typed: \[Is Alex picking you up tomorrow?\]

Elara: \[No. He's too busy.\]

Ruby: \[Oh, come on. Only you would believe that.\]

Elara: \[What do you mean?\]

Ruby sent a screenshot. It was Nancy's tweet: \[Long distance for four years, finally celebrating our anniversary together.\] The picture showed the back of a man.

Elara knew that man all too well, having gazed longingly at his back countless times—it was Alex. Her heart ached as she closed the picture and turned off her phone.

But shortly, she still messaged Ruby: \[""You know Nancy always makes up stories. He said he was meeting the lawyer, and I trust him.\]

Ruby: \[Fine. If that makes you feel better.\]

\*\*\*\*\*

At nine o'clock in the evening, Elara arrived at Veritasiton Airport. September had brought a chill to the air in Veritasiton. She was wearing a long black trench coat over a gray knit dress. Her slender figure and long legs made her stand out in the bustling airport.

""Elara!"" Julian's voice called out from a distance.

She glanced up, hopeful for a moment, and then looked away, disappointment etched on her face. Elara pouted—Alex really hadn't shown up.

""Aren't you happy to see me?"" Julian jogged over, noticing Elara's expression, and tousled her hair. ""Long time no see, Elara. At least pretend you missed me.""

Elara turned her head away. ""Hey, I just washed my hair. Don't mess it up!""

Julian lowered his hand and casually took her suitcase. ""Come on. Ruby threw a party for you.""

Elara wasn't in the mood. ""I don't feel like it.""

Julian chuckled in mild annoyance, ""What? After being abroad for four years, you're only thinking about Alex now? You won't even spend time with us?""

He pulled the suitcase and guided Elara toward the garage. ""Alex couldn't make it. You can stay with us longer. If Alex were here, it wouldn't be as much fun.""

He loaded the suitcase into the trunk of the Rolls-Royce, then walked over and opened the passenger door for Elara. She got in and buckled her seatbelt absentmindedly.

Julian got into the driver's seat. Seeing Elara ignoring him, he shook his head helplessly. He reached over, gently grabbed her chin, and turned her face toward him. ""Hey, Elara? Did you hear me?""

""Huh?"" Elara snapped out of her daze. ""What did you say?""

Julian gave a wry smile. ""Elara, you've got some nerve."" With a light nudge, he pushed her head back against the seat. Then he buckled his seatbelt and stepped on the gas.

During the ride, Julian stayed quiet. Elara didn't need to think twice to know he was upset. They had grown up together since childhood, and even though she'd been studying abroad for the past four years and they'd seen each other less often, she knew him well.

Julian came from a wealthy family but was raised humbly at his grandparents' home. He was a rebel and a bit of a slacker who seemed to look down on everyone, yet somehow he got along great with Elara and Ruby.

Elara glanced at Julian, her eyes lingering on him for a moment before she looked away. It was the first time she'd seen him in a suit—his hair neatly styled, his boyish look replaced by a more mature, composed appearance.

In the suit, he looked very gentlemanly, almost ruggedly handsome, except for the sour expression on his face.

Elara clicked her tongue. He had never known how to dress properly since junior high—always hanging half his uniform off his arm and pulling up one pant leg. But now he was all dressed up.

Julian noticed Elara checking him out and a smile tugged at his lips.

Then Elara said, ""Going on a date today? Look at you, all dressed up.""

# 6.Chapter 6 No Harm To Me

Julian's smile faded. His eyes grew cold, but he replied lightly, ""Can't I just do this to see you?""

Elara frowned, pointing at herself. ""Me? Do you need to wear such a nice suit just to see me? I've seen you at your worst—no need to dress up like this.""

""Whatever,"" Julian muttered, his grip on the steering wheel tightening until his knuckles turned white. His laid-back tone returned. ""I dress like this every day now—not for you. Quit imagining things.""

It was true. He managed a branch under the Quinn Group and was the future heir—his suit and watch alone were worth millions. Any other woman would be all over him just for the outfit.

But Elara took half an hour after he picked her up to even notice his suit. He couldn't help but wonder if Alex was really that amazing.

""Oh, so Ruby was right. Our rebellious heir really did go back to take over the family business, huh?"" Elara said, her stunning eyes twinkling.

Julian glanced at her, his heart still racing. 'Damn it! Julian, so many years later, why are you still crazy about her?' He quickly looked away, bit the inside of his cheek, let out a bitter laugh, and fell silent.

Elara noticed he was dressed to impress, but she wasn't about to compliment him. His suit had no visible brand, but one could tell it was expensive just by the feel.

And then there was the Rolls-Royce he drove... She shifted a bit. ""Hmm, gotta admit, luxury cars ride real smooth.""

Elara's family was well-off, but not quite in the same league as the Quinn family. Her dad had been a physics professor there since getting his Ph.D.

While her mom was a big name in finance, rumored to have been a major player in her youth. But after Elara was born, she quit her high-powered job and taught at Veritasiton University with her dad. It was strange how two such different worlds had matched up.

Elara wasn't part of Veritasiton's elite circle. However, the Quinn family had an unusual way of raising kids. From age five, Julian lived with his grandma among ordinary people.

They were neighbors, going to the same schools from kindergarten through high school. When college came, Elara followed Alex abroad, but Ruby and Julian stayed home.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car pulled up to Aurora Club, Veritasiton's most luxurious entertainment venue. She used to love nights like these, but now she was over it. Walking in, she didn't even spare a glance at the glamorous scene.

Julian pushed open the door to a plush VIP room. Noisy chatter spilled out, and instantly, Ruby's laugh stood out.

As soon as the door opened, Ruby squealed. She jumped up from the table, rushed over, and hugged Elara tightly. ""Elara, you're finally back!""

Elara tried to dodge Ruby's enthusiastic hug but was caught and held tight. She knew Ruby was up to something. ""What are you up to now?""

After all, they had been texting constantly, both annoyed. They had just spent two weeks touring abroad when Ruby had left early to flirt with some guy back home. So, the exaggerated hug felt a bit weird.

Ruby pressed her lips close to Elara's ear and whispered, ""Victor's here.""

""Ha!"" Elara said, exasperated. ""So what?""

Ruby twisted playfully and begged, ""Elara, I really like this guy! Please help me.""

""What about everything I've been through?"" Elara countered.

""Oh, hush. I know you were wronged,"" Ruby said. ""That's why I had Victor bring that guy here to apologize to you in person.""

Elara was confused at first. Then she glanced toward the private booth and saw that annoying face. Yeah, it was Adrian again. Elara's face darkened instantly.

In the back of the booth, Adrian looked completely at ease. He was wearing an expensive black suit with subtle patterns, lounging lazily on the couch. The top buttons of his crisp white shirt were undone, revealing his collarbone and Adam's apple.

His long legs were casually crossed, exuding a cool, detached vibe. A cigarette dangled from his slender fingers as his sharp eyes locked onto Elara's annoyed expression.

Adrian had just gotten off the plane, and Victor had picked him up from the airport. As soon as Adrian got into Victor's car, Victor drove straight to Aurora Club without asking.

Adrian had wanted to leave, but Victor insisted. After all his bad experiences, he'd finally met ""The One"" and wanted Adrian to check her out.

But Adrian'd only been there for ten minutes. His cigarette had just been lit when he ran into his ""rival"" from yesterday. He realized Victor had set him up.

Elara couldn't believe Ruby even got Adrian here—they might really fight! Elara's voice turned cold. ""Ruby, what's wrong with you?""

With their lifelong bond, Ruby could tell Elara was upset. She shook Elara's arm, putting on a cute act. She pleaded, ""Come on, Elara, help me out here. I'm really into Victor. If it weren't for you, he'd never have come.

""His friend is super attractive and single. Why not make a move? You're at this age, but you're still single. How lame is that?""

Julian overheard this. He yanked Ruby away from Elara, giving her a warning look. Ruby quickly fell silent, remembering his major crush on Elara.

Ruby pulled Elara over to sit down, and then took a seat beside Victor. ""Elara, this is Victor. He owns Dolphin Bay Hotel.""

She then introduced Elara to Victor. ""And this is Elara Langton, my best friend.""

Victor's eyes lit up when he saw Elara. ""Elara, nice to see you. I've heard so much about you. You look even better than on video.""

Victor was trying to flatter Elara, and he genuinely meant it. Elara was stunning, but as Ruby had said, even with her incredible looks, her heart belonged to Alex.

Elara gave a faint, forced smile and stayed silent.

Victor leaned back to reveal Adrian sitting beside him. ""And this is my friend Adrian Hartley. He's one of the top lawyers here and owns Anchor Law Firm, the biggest one in town. If you ever have any legal issues, he's the guy to call.""

Ruby chimed in, ""Awesome! Elara and I are running our coffee shops. I was wondering if Mr. Hartley and your firm could handle our legal work?""

Adrian was taken aback and didn't respond immediately.

Ruby looked awkward and glanced at Victor, hoping he could smooth things over.

Victor nudged Adrian with his elbow. ""You caused this mess—aren't you gonna fix it?""

Adrian replied flatly, ""The mess is yours. Not my problem.""

""Okay, fair enough. Even if the mess is mine, you started it, right?""

Adrian shrugged. ""Hmm, so? I didn't lose anything.""",1,1752235688.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

So I (23F) was just out on Church Street today. I was alone. I don’t really have much friends in Bangalore and I’m still kinda new here only. Sometimes I just like walking and seeing places on my own, that’s it.

I was wearing a normal dress okay?? Not churidar or sari or anything aunty like. It was just a sleeved top and a skirt till my knees. Not even short skirt. Only like 1/3 of my leg is visible. And tbh compared to what some other girls were wearing there 😭😭 like full revealing type, crop top and tiny shorts and all, I was literally looking so decent pls.

So anyway I was just walking and chilling, and this guy came and started talking to me. He looked kinda nice? Like okay looking, 30-35 age, had that tech guy who works in Koramangala but acts softboy type vibe. But he was polite, respectful and all. I’m not gonna explain why he started talking, but he was being nice and friendly.

Then we started walking together, randomly chatting about Bangalore and cafes and all, and he offered to buy me Starbucks. And I don’t know why but I said yes. 😭 Bit foolish of me but ya I did take the coffee.

So like after 15–20 mins, we still talking and sipping coffee. Everything was fine. Until this ONE MOMENT.

He suddenly comes little close to me and goes like, “Okay, this is gonna sound strange, but can you do me a favour?”

And I was like... “Uhh how weird is weird?”

And then. This man. Actually opens his Starbucks cup... looks at me seriously and says:

“Can you spit in it?”

I thought I misheard. I was like wtf. So I literally asked him “Wait wait… did you just say you want me to SPIT in your coffee???”

And he just nods 😭😭 Like nods so casual, like he asking for extra sugar or something.

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE BRO.

I was so shocked I just stared at him. Then I said “No” obv. I stood up and was about to walk away. And then this guy legit goes:

“I’ll give you ₹1000 if you do it.”

I swear to god. Thousand rupees to spit in his coffee.

I just ran. I RAN to the metro station like my life depended on it. But now I’m sitting here thinking... did I just miss the easiest thousand rupees of my life?? 😭😭

It’s just spit no? I didn’t even have to touch him. Didn’t even have to look at him after. Just one pichak and walk away. I kinda regret not taking it??? 😭

Is this how Bangalore is now? Like is this normal?? Someone please confirm I’m not going mad.",2,1752235686.0,rant,3,0.75,False
1lx56ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lx56ck/i_cant_seem_to_let_it_go/,I can’t seem to let it go,"It’s been 2 months since my ex (f36) broke up with me (m32) over text. It’s unbearably painful, I keep hoping the next day will be better, but my mind has a poison. My failure to detach is robbing me of my growth and future.

We met at a concert on Halloween 2024. It was love at first sight. I asked her out on a date the following day, we got along so naturally.

We kept seeing each other 2-3 times a week in November and on Thanksgiving she accepted my boyfriend application.

On Christmas we shared our “I Love You’s” and just had the most beautiful, cute, and sexy holiday season. We met friends, family, and it was just wonderful. 

Jan/Feb/March was mostly good we had a couple of arguments but I thought it was just normal growing pains of a couple. 

Her Birthday in mid March was the last time I felt like I truly had her full respect. I wasn’t self aware or really being perceptive enough when things started to shift. It was subtle at first. Then another conflict arose because I didn’t want to go to a concert with her, and that was the beginning of the end.

She stuck it out another month and in retrospect was ready to end it at the 6month mark, but she waited a couple weeks because I had to go out of state for a week for my grand mothers funeral. She said how much she missed me while I was gone that week and the day I got back was bliss. But when I got back early May she was back to her discontent state.

I wasn’t filling up her “emotional love tank” by planning our time together, just generally in a funk, I was going through a lot, I am a full time student learning to fly airplanes and May was a very intense period for that for me, I took a break from work for a bit to really focus on school, and the death of my grandmother. She was starting to nag me about getting a job, and wasn’t happy about not getting taken on dates. 

I asked for a break for the weekend to collect myself and she texted me on Monday May 12, “that doesn’t sound like a relationship, all I can offer is friendship”

In that moment not going to lie, part of me was slightly relieved, but still highly upset.

We gave it a couple days and then had a the big break up phone call. I regret not trying to sort it out and fighting for our love more at that moment.

We checked on each other little bits the following 3 weeks. I truly missed her. I wanted to work it out and give her 1000x more than I ever did before. Thursday June 5th, we finally met face to face to give each other our stuff back and I wrote her this long letter telling her I was madly in love with her still and wanted to start over and this time will be different. She didn’t go for it, but was gentle and asked if we could stay friends.

I was reluctant and said that might be tough for me given still being madly in love. 

This was where my biggest error came. Trying to show more effort I tried to surprise her the following Monday June 9 with a pre fixed meal from one of her favorite markets and a coffee to try and make her Monday easier cause I knew she was going to have a stressful one.

Well that went over horribly, she said I wasn’t respecting her space and had to leave. And so I did. A couple hours later I tried to apologize with a voice memo and that just pissed her off more.

I can see now that, I crossed a line, tried to own it, but she wouldn’t even accept my apology. It’s hard not to think maybe she had another man there as a rebound. Other wise I don’t see her reacting that way. 

I gave it 9 days and tried calling her, she didn’t pick up, I left a brief voicemail with a song we used to joke about, and hoped she was doing well.

The following morning June 19th she wrote “Hi X we can’t keep in touch, you can’t contact me, don’t reply to this, just focus your energy on you”

And that hurt so freaking bad, way worse than May 12. I stupidly replied, just saying I wasn’t respecting going to respect it and she made the wrong choice.

I hated leaving it on such horrible note. So I regrettably did write her a longish email with my final words. 1) saying sorry again for showing up unannounced, and also for not showing up in the relationship like I wish I had. 2) my growth and how I’ve been working so hard to be different 3) How she mattered deeply to me 4) and just left the door open on my end if she ever had a change of heart and wanted to chat to leave it on a better note

She said if I kept contacting her she would look into a no contact order.

This hurt but I guess at this point I wasn’t surprised.

Now I really must honor her wish. I don’t want any legal trouble or if seeing my name is that stressful for her I don’t want anything but the best for her. 

Also to just keep my dignity and own self respect. But man does this hurt.

I should have let it go in May. But even now with legal threats and such a disregard for my feelings, dismissive of my value, and a lack of respect “break up over text” and “no contact with no explanation”, even now, part of me still wishes we could get back to that fantastical place where we fit so naturally, were building something with depth that was supposed to last.

But that fantasy is an illusion.

I have lots of hurt feelings. Honestly I don’t think I’ve ever had my feelings so hurt. 😖😭

I’m healing. Im facing the hard ugly truth-being devalued by someone you gave your heart to is unbearable. 

I was ready to move in together, ask her dad for her hand. I saw us old and grey with babies that looked like us. Her shift happened so fast. Yes I could have been better, but I am a flawed human like all of us. And not told why or given a chance to make it right just doesn’t add up.

Yes I feel rejected, betrayed, dismissed, but in that same breath, I refuse to let that pain become my identity.

My inner peace is too sacred to lease out to someone who doesn’t value it. 

I am not emotionally weak because I cared deeply. That care is a strength but only when directed towards someone who respects it.

Stepping back into my strength, principles, character, purpose, my power, my light, not all once but from a steady foundation brick by brick of self respect. ",1,1752235657.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False
1lx561z,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehack/comments/1lx561z/how_i_went_from_reading_0_books_to_50_books_a/,How I went from reading 0 books to 50+ books a year (without speed reading bs),"two years ago i was one of those people who bought books and let them collect dust. had a whole shelf of ""books i'll read someday"" that never got touched. now i'm reading 4-5 books a month and actually retaining what i read. here's how i cracked the code:

the mindset shift that changed everything:

* stopped trying to read ""impressive"" books and started reading stuff i actually wanted to read. turns out enjoying what ur reading makes u want to read more (who knew)
* realized reading 10 mins a day consistently beats reading 3 hours once a week. consistency > intensity
* gave myself permission to quit books that sucked. life's too short for boring books, there's literally millions of other options
* started treating books like netflix - if i'm not hooked in the first 30 pages, i move on. no guilt, no forcing it

the practical systems that actually work:

* always have 3 books going: one physical, one audiobook, one ebook. different moods, different formats
* bought a kindle paperwhite and it changed my life. reading in bed without disturbing anyone, built-in light, holds thousands of books
* started using library apps (libby is a game changer). free books delivered to ur phone, what's not to love
* created a ""books to read"" note in my phone. when someone recommends something or i see an interesting title, i add it immediately

the habit stacking stuff:

* read while drinking my morning coffee. 15-20 mins every day, no exceptions
* audiobooks during commute, walks, doing dishes, working out. turns dead time into reading time
* keep a book in my bag always. waiting for appointments, delayed flights, random free moments = reading opportunities
* read for 10 mins before bed instead of scrolling. better sleep + more books, win-win

the environment hacks:

* made reading more appealing than my phone. comfy reading spot, good lighting, put the phone in another room
* started going to bookstores/libraries just to browse. being around books makes u want to read them
* joined a book club (online one bc social anxiety). having to discuss books makes u actually think about them
* unfollowed book reviewers who made me feel bad about my reading choices. read what u want, not what's ""supposed"" to be good

the retention tricks:

* started keeping a reading journal. not fancy, just a few sentences about what i learned or thought about each book
* began taking notes while reading (especially non-fiction). kindle makes this super easy
* started telling people about books i'm reading. explaining stuff to others helps cement it in ur brain
* created a ""book graveyard"" list of books i didn't finish. helps me remember what didn't work and why

the advanced stuff:

* learned about different reading speeds for different content. skim self-help for main points, savor fiction for experience
* started reading book summaries AFTER finishing books to see what i missed. helps improve comprehension over time
* began choosing books based on what i'm dealing with in life. relationship issues? read about psychology. career stress? read about productivity
* discovered ""book sprints"" - dedicating a whole saturday to finishing one book. surprisingly effective for shorter books

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped setting yearly reading goals. pressure killed the enjoyment, made it feel like work
* started re-reading favorite books. repetition with favorites > constantly consuming new mediocre content
* began reading multiple books in the same topic area. reinforces concepts and gives different perspectives
* learned that it's okay to read ""easy"" books. young adult fiction counts, graphic novels count, everything counts

what didn't work:

* speed reading courses - just made me anxious and killed comprehension
* forcing myself to read before bed when i was exhausted - just made me hate reading
* trying to read only ""important"" books - boredom killed the habit before it started
* reading in noisy environments - couldn't focus, got frustrated, gave up

went from maybe 2-3 books a year to 50+ books. not just reading more, but actually enjoying it and remembering what i read. brain feels sharper, conversations are more interesting, and i have way more perspective on stuff.

curious what the biggest barrier is for most people. i fixed mine and read a lo this year. hoped you liked this post ",3,1752235632.0,lifehack,0,1.0,False
1lx55dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lx55dv/am_i_reading_too_much_into_this/,Am I reading too much into this?,"I’ve liked this guy pretty much since I met him, but another girl got to him first so I kept silent. I was a friend to him, but I’d see the smiles he’d give when she wasn’t around, the way his eyes sparkled when I drew on his arm, the jokes we’d crack at work, the way we’d check on each other after service. 

He would check me out at work, and at the apartment. But also when we were all hanging out and drinking that day as well as when we went to breakfast. 

He had been cold towards me for a while and I think Jackie and Eva would talk shit on me to him, and he didn’t want to go against what Jackie said so he believed her. 

He came down to see me, made out with me and touched me. He held me when I cried because of something he asked, went silent on me, then we started talking again between his birthday and mine. He came to the carnival with me two weeks ago, paid for me to play darts and I won a plushy, and he played two more games to win me two more. He picked me up when I cried, and made me get off my ankle for a while (I had hurt it at work earlier that day) and let me rest it on his legs. We held hands as we walked and he was so gentle with me, but then I got a text from him “Olaf pissed me off” and he’s been a bit distant since. I don’t know if it’s something I did or not, but I miss him and I want to see him

We all; me, him, and her, went bowling together after getting coffee for our friend’s birthday. While we were in his car, he kept stealing glances at me and I sang with him. She was hyping the two of us up and he kept giving me his vape without me asking for it. When we got to the bowling alley and started the game, he and I got competitive. It turned into playful banter between the two of us and when I said without thinking after a bad throw “ew, that was shit” and they both overheard me and her being the pick me she was, started saying it after every turn she took to get attention. I had started limping badly and he started bowling for me and glared at me until I got off my ankle. He wanted to carry me to his car but didn’t, and drove slower and avoided potholes so it wouldn’t jostle my ankle. He tried to carry me inside but I wouldn’t let him so instead he got me ice

I had a pretty bad accident back in February. I was emotional and in a dark place, and ended up hitting ice. I lost a bit of control, got it back and then lost it a second time worse than the first time. I spun, went up an embankment, and slid down a bit. I had hit my shoulder and ankle on my door, my glasses flew off my face, and my head hit my seat and my door. My side airbags had deployed and I didn’t know who to call, that could get there quickly, so I called him. He didn’t answer at first (which he later admitted to regretting) but by the time he did, I told him what happened and that I needed a ride. He met me where I crashed (I was in an ambulance getting checked out) and he brought me to his car (I was showing signs of a concussion so he helped me walk) and then drove me home. He had carried me inside (which had caused arguments between us previous times he wanted to carry me) and got me water and pain meds before giving me a hug and going home. A few days after that I had asked him to drive me an hour away to meet my mom at a store (I didn’t have a backup car at the time) and I ended up having a panic attack and he notices and rolled the window down, slowed down, talked me through it, and gave me his vape without me even asking for it. He had cracked jokes, sang with me, and made sure I was okay the entire drive. And when we got to the store, I told him I’d go in and wait for my mom and he said “I’m not leaving you here until I know she’s here”. And he also saw a dirty frozen Baja blast from Taco Bell and said “my dumbass thought Taco Bell started serving margaritas, it’s just a frozen baja blast with half and half”

One weekend I went to Shenandoah for the weekend with some DC-based playwright collective. This was the year after I graduated from my MFA in Creative Writing.

“What do you mean by that?” I asked.  
  
“It’s not my job to explain this to you,” she replied.  
(appropriation of a trending internet phrase spawned from Black Lives Matter).  
  
Then, the humor columnist Alexandra Petri showed up--the other white women were talking shit about her beforehand. When she arrived, she immediately sat in a loveseat sideways and started flipping through a magazine that had been on a coffee table. 

I introduced myself as “Colin,” and she said “thanks,” because she thought I had said, “nice column,” which to be fair I sometimes mumble. So, nothing against her, but it just added to the weirdness.

She listens in to my phone conversations which aren't loud and I've been brought up to never mention names or to talk about person information outside or in public places.

The irony is that if I wanted to curse her is that I would've looked at her and called her a Tw\*t which is the word that my family uses for someone like her.  I guess that she sees herself as a C\*nt.  I don't know but she continues to both slander and libel me.  Oh well.

I was scripting, visualizing, watching all the YouTube videos, doing 55x5s and second-guessing everything when results didn’t show up in 3 days 😅

Then I had one of those *click* moments.

I realized I wasn’t manifesting from belief. I was manifesting from **lack** — constantly checking, doubting, worrying.

So I shifted the focus.

Instead of trying to manifest *money*, I started focusing on the **energy behind it** — freedom, flow, support, ease.  
Here’s what I changed:

✨ Set one intention each morning: “How do I want to *feel* today?”  
💰 Did daily visualizations of already living that abundant life — not future me, but *now me*  
🙏 Practiced gratitude for money already in my life, even if it was just a free coffee or discount

And you know what? Things started flowing:

* Got 2 unexpected payments from old clients
* A friend gifted me a vacation stay (literally said “you deserve a break”)
* I *found* Rs. 500 in an old journal (that I had written off as empty lol)

I’ve been using a minimal app called [Manifest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-manifestation-journal/id1542250872) to keep this routine going daily — it’s helped me stay intentional without being obsessive. You could totally do it with a journal too — the consistency is what matters.

I’m 33m, she’s 36f. We met in college 10+ years ago through lots of mutual friends. Followed each other online since. 

Saw we’d both be visiting the same city a few months ago and asked her out; i was too shy to do so before. Best first date I’ve ever had. 3 hour morning coffee (couldn’t stop chatting) turned to a great dinner. She told me she wants to settle down and start a family. Made a reference to me meeting her parents. She asked for a pic with me to send her bff that i know. Have an insane amount in common. Easily the best person I’ve met in 10+ years. 

We were supposed to see each other in the same city a few weeks later, until she cancelled her trip. She lives abroad from me, but we both have the resources to travel anytime, anywhere. 

I asked for a FaceTime date and texted a bit but she seemed distant. Talked about it and told me she is definitely interested in me and I’m a special person, but she has a hard time developing a relationship over text/FT and wants to give it a fair shot when we can see each other in person, possibly when she comes back to the states in Sept/Oct; though we could keep in touch in the meantime. I texted yesterday for the first time since May to check in, but always slow to respond. 

Despite this I can’t help but wish she was still putting in more effort, probably because of my fairly low self esteem and knowing how hard it is to find someone like her. Also considering she is older and wants to start a family, it takes awhile to go from starting to date to kids, so i thought she might want to fast track it a bit. My optimistic take is that she does value me and doesn’t want to waste the opportunity when she knows it’s hard for her to develop something long distance.

1lx4vhv,https://i.redd.it/sxdv8jegh8cf1.jpeg,Crochet Two-Piece Sets: Why Every Woman Needs This Versatile Wardrobe Game-Changer,"Let's be real – finding the perfect outfit that's both trendy and comfortable can feel like searching for a unicorn sometimes. But here's where crochet two-piece sets come swooping in like your fashion fairy godmother. These aren't your grandma's doilies we're talking about (though honestly, grandma had some serious skills). Today's crochet sets are reimagining what handmade fashion can be, and trust me, you're going to want to jump on this trend.

## The Crochet Revival: From Cozy Corner to Fashion Runway

Remember when crochet was just something you did while binge-watching Netflix? Well, those days are long gone, my friend. The fashion world has embraced crochet with open arms, and **crochet two-piece outfits** are leading the charge. 

I'll admit, when I first saw these sets popping up everywhere, I was skeptical. Would they actually look chic, or would I end up looking like I raided someone's craft closet? Spoiler alert: when done right, these sets are absolute perfection.

The beauty of a **women's crochet 2-piece outfit set** lies in its versatility. You're getting two coordinated pieces that work together seamlessly, but here's the kicker – they also work brilliantly as separates. It's like buying two outfits for the price of one. Pretty genius, right?

## What Makes Crochet Two-Piece Sets So Special?

### The Comfort Factor

First things first – comfort. Have you ever worn something so soft and breathable that you forgot you were wearing clothes? That's the crochet experience. The **handmade crochet two-piece sets** especially have this incredible texture that feels like a gentle hug all day long.

The natural stretch of crochet fabric means these pieces move with your body, not against it. Whether you're reaching for that top shelf at the grocery store or dancing the night away at a festival, your outfit won't fight you. 

### Style Versatility That'll Blow Your Mind

Here's where things get interesting. A **crochet crop top and skirt set** can transform from beachwear to brunch outfit faster than you can say ""Instagram-worthy."" Throw on some sandals and a sun hat? Beach goddess. Add a blazer and heels? Office chic (well, depending on your office's dress code :)).

The **boho crochet two-piece outfits** are particularly magical for this. They capture that effortless, free-spirited vibe that's perfect for everything from music festivals to casual dinner dates.

[Check out these stunning crochet two-piece sets here](https://amzn.to/4kt2PG1)

## The Different Styles That Are Taking Over

### Beach and Resort Wear

Let's talk about **crochet beach cover-up sets** – these are game-changers for vacation wardrobes. Picture this: you're lounging by the pool, and your cover-up is so cute that people are asking where you got it. These sets typically feature:

- **Lightweight, breathable construction** that dries quickly
- **Elegant openwork patterns** that provide coverage while keeping you cool
- **Coordinated pieces** that look intentional and put-together

I've worn mine from the beach straight to lunch without changing, and nobody batted an eye. Try doing that with a regular swimsuit cover-up!

### Festival and Boho Chic

**Bohemian crochet matching sets** are having a major moment right now. These pieces often feature:

- **Intricate patterns** that showcase the artisan's skill
- **Flowing silhouettes** that move beautifully
- **Earthy tones** or vibrant colors that photograph amazingly

Ever wondered why these look so good in photos? It's all about the texture and movement. Crochet catches light in the most flattering way, creating depth and interest that solid fabrics just can't match.

### Casual Everyday Options

Don't sleep on **casual crochet two-piece sets** for your regular rotation. These aren't just for special occasions – they're perfect for:

- **Coffee dates** where you want to look effortlessly put-together
- **Shopping trips** that require comfort without sacrificing style
- **Work-from-home days** when you need to look professional on video calls

## How to Style Your Crochet Two-Piece Set

### The Art of Layering

Here's a pro tip that changed my whole approach to crochet sets: **layering is everything**. A simple camisole under a crochet top can take it from beach casual to dinner appropriate. Similarly, adding a denim jacket over a crochet set creates that perfect casual-cool vibe.

For **vintage crochet two-piece sets**, try layering with modern pieces to create an interesting contrast. A sleek leather jacket over a delicate crochet top? *Chef's kiss* – that's how you make vintage feel fresh.

### Accessories That Make the Difference

The right accessories can completely transform your crochet set. Here's what works:

- **Delicate jewelry** that won't compete with the texture
- **Structured bags** that provide a nice contrast to the soft fabric
- **Simple shoes** that let the crochet be the star

IMO, the key is balance. If your crochet set is busy with patterns, keep accessories minimal. If it's a simple design, feel free to add some statement pieces.

## Quality Matters: What to Look For

### Construction Details

Not all crochet sets are created equal, and trust me, you'll notice the difference. **High-quality handmade crochet two-piece sets** will have:

- **Consistent tension** throughout the piece
- **Secure seams** that won't come apart after a few wears
- **Even stitching** that creates a professional appearance
- **Proper finishing** with no loose threads or uneven edges

I learned this the hard way when a cheaper set I bought online started unraveling after one wash. Lesson learned: invest in quality pieces that will last.

### Material Considerations

The yarn used makes a huge difference in how your set looks and feels. **Cotton blends** are fantastic for everyday wear because they're breathable and easy to care for. **Bamboo yarns** offer incredible softness and natural antibacterial properties. **Linen blends** give that perfect casual-luxe vibe.

Avoid sets made with scratchy acrylic yarns – your skin will thank you. Life's too short for uncomfortable clothes, right?

## The Seasonal Approach

### Summer Styling

**Summer crochet two-piece sets** are practically mandatory for the season. The breathable nature of crochet makes these pieces perfect for hot weather. Look for:

- **Light colors** that reflect heat
- **Open stitch patterns** that allow airflow
- **Shorter hemlines** that keep you cool

I live in mine during summer months – they're like wearing air conditioning :)

### Transitional Seasons

Don't pack away your crochet sets when temperatures drop! **Fall and spring styling** just requires a bit more creativity:

- **Layer underneath** with fitted basics
- **Add cardigans or blazers** for warmth
- **Pair with boots** instead of sandals
- **Choose deeper colors** that feel seasonally appropriate

## Care and Maintenance

### Washing Your Crochet Sets

Here's where many people go wrong – proper care is crucial for maintaining your **crochet outfit sets**. Most quality pieces should be:

- **Hand washed** in cool water with gentle detergent
- **Laid flat to dry** to maintain shape
- **Stored carefully** to prevent snagging

I know hand washing sounds like a pain, but these pieces are investments. A little extra care goes a long way in keeping them looking fresh and new.

### Storage Tips

Proper storage prevents damage and extends the life of your pieces:

- **Fold gently** rather than hanging to prevent stretching
- **Use cedar blocks** to prevent moths (they love natural fibers)
- **Keep in breathable storage** containers

## Where to Find the Best Pieces

### Online vs. In-Store Shopping

**Online shopping** offers the widest selection, but it comes with sizing challenges. When buying online, pay attention to:

- **Detailed measurements** rather than just size charts
- **Customer reviews** with photos
- **Return policies** in case of fit issues

**In-store shopping** lets you feel the quality and try on pieces, but selection might be limited. Local boutiques often carry unique **artisan crochet two-piece sets** that you won't find elsewhere.

### Supporting Small Businesses

FYI, some of the most gorgeous crochet sets come from small businesses and independent artisans. These makers often offer:

- **Custom sizing** for the perfect fit
- **Unique designs** you won't see everywhere
- **Quality craftsmanship** that mass-produced items can't match
- **Personal service** and styling advice

## The Investment Factor

### Cost vs. Value

**Crochet two-piece sets** range from budget-friendly to investment pieces. While it's tempting to go for the cheapest option, consider the cost per wear. A well-made set that lasts for years and gets regular use is actually more economical than a cheap set that falls apart quickly.

Quality pieces typically range from $80-$200, while handmade artisan sets can go higher. But honestly? When you find a set that makes you feel amazing, it's worth every penny.

### Building Your Collection

You don't need to buy everything at once. Start with one versatile set in a neutral color that works with your existing wardrobe. As you discover what styles you prefer, you can add more pieces to your collection.

## The Bottom Line

**Women's crochet 2-piece outfit sets** aren't just a trend – they're a wardrobe revolution. They combine the comfort of loungewear with the polish of a coordinated outfit, giving you that effortless style that everyone's chasing.

Whether you're drawn to **bohemian crochet matching sets** for their artistic appeal or **casual crochet two-piece sets** for their versatility, there's definitely a style out there that'll make you feel like the best version of yourself.

The key is finding pieces that speak to your personal style and investing in quality that'll last. Trust me, once you experience the comfort and versatility of a well-made crochet set, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.

So go ahead, embrace the crochet revolution. Your wardrobe (and your comfort level) will thank you for it. And hey, if anyone asks where you got that gorgeous outfit, you can just smile mysteriously and say it's your little secret :)",1,1752234749.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False

We've all been there - that moment when your parent decides to absolutely DEMOLISH any remaining shred of your teenage dignity. But my dad? He's taken it to a whole new level.  
  
Picture this: It's a regular Tuesday morning. I'm just trying to get to school like a normal human being. But NO. Dad decides today is the perfect day to channel his inner rock god and treat the entire school car park to his personal Meatloaf tribute concert.  
  
Windows down. Volume UP. Air guitar in full swing. And of course - OF COURSE - the entire Year 9 class gets front row seats to this spectacular display of secondhand embarrassment.  
  
Even the teachers are getting involved now. Mr. Henderson's pity look will haunt me forever. And don't even get me started on the ""SLAY QUEEN"" moment. I think my soul actually left my body for a solid 30 seconds.

**Retirement Balance**: 
- Roth IRA: $40,000
- 401(k): $44,000
- HSA: $7,000
- Total: $91,000

I started investing in my Roth during my first job in college. I put in $50/month. This complemented the $10/week I gave myself for eating out or drinks. I had a philosophy professor my sophomore year who likely had a mid-semester mental break, and basically just spent 6 weeks talking at us about how important a Roth IRA was. I opened mine the next semester! Granted, I didn’t *invest* in any funds for another two months because Prof left that part out of his lectures lol. 

I accumulated about $3,000 in my Roth before law school, which I began in 2020. No earned income at all in 2021. 2022 I had my big law summer associate position, and so I was sure to sock away $7,000. And then 2023 I began work, and maxed my 2023 and 2024 contributions early in 2024. I’ve also maxed my 2025, and am saving enough per month to max my 2026 come Jan. 1. All years since 2024 have been backdoor roths. 

I got my first 401(k) in 2023 when I began working at my firm, and maxed it out for 2024 and will max it for 2025. No match. Such is law firm life. 

I count my HSA as retirement savings because I do not plan to touch this money until I’m well old enough. Triple tax advantage, baby. I’m also maxing that. My current firm matches our first $1,000, which is awesome! So I’m only investing $3,500 this year. 

**Equity if you're a homeowner**: no home. Renting. 

**Savings account balance**: $30k emergency fund; $35k in my Ally buckets for, eg, new car down payment, vacation, my cat, car maintenance, and to cover 1 year of medical deductibles. 

$20k in a brokerage for a house down payment. Please don’t lambast me for having this in a brokerage. I don’t plan to buy a house for at least five years, and because I have $35k in cash outside of my emergency fund, I feel more comfortable taking the risk of investing these funds. Money is fungible! An $80 - $120k down payment is the goal. 

**Checking account balance**: $4,500. Payday was June 30. I front load my credit card payments to the beginning of the month, since rent is paid at the end of the month (well, it’s paid for the month ahead. But it’s taken out on the 26th instead of, say, the 1st). And to be clear, I put 100% of my expenses on my credit cards, but I have never paid interest on a credit card. This is just a way to passively get points. I don’t churn or anything. 

**Credit card debt**: none  

**Student loan debt**: $7,788. I took out $35,000 in federal loans for my law degree, starting in 2020. I got a full ride+ to a state university for undergrad, and so was able to use my college fund to pay for some of law school (about $40,000 from a generous relative who had a professional degree and set all of their nieces and nephews up with UTMAs. It’s something I aspire to do as well). I also received about a 3/4ths scholarship for law school itself, so I was only funding part of tuition and my cost of living. 

I also received a $100,000 life insurance payout after my parent died a week before law school began, which I lived off of during school and did not look at, invest, or even think about. It was a poor way to handle a great gift, and I’m very remorseful. I just kind of… couldn’t think about it. Law school + covid + dead parent was too much all ready. It’s a big regret to “waste” a resource that the vast majority of people will never have. 

I’ve paid off roughly $28,000 since November of 2023 and plan to have it all gone by December of 2025. Interest rate on the sole loan is 4.05%. 

**Anything else that's applicable to you**: I live with my partner. He also has a professional degree, but not one that pays particularly well. Marriage is in our future, but for now finances are separate.  I tend to pick up the check since I make ~ 3x as much as him. This has never once bothered me. 

***Section Two: Income***

**Income Progression**: I've been working at a big law firm for 2 years; my starting salary was $200,00. I’d worked at law firms prior to law school, where I made $10/hour. 

I moved states and firms half way through my full first year, to be with my partner full time, and got a $25k raise (but the new state has income tax, so the bump didn’t do much). 

I moved a few months ago, and took off about 6 weeks to study for the new state’s bar exam. So some of my figures (eg my 401(k) contribution and Roth IRA cash savings) may seem high, but that’s because I’m on track to max them despite losing a few weeks in the spring. 

My income is likely to decrease in the fall. My firm paid nearly $30k to relocate me and another $6k on bar expenses which will need to be taxed. So I’ll be taxed on $36,000 in income at some point before 2026. 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home**: $11,300
- 401k deduction: $2,502
- HSA contribution: $304
- Health insurance deduction: $40 (amazing. I was paying $160 at my last firm). 
- Dental + vision deduction: $40

***Section Three: Expenses***

**Rent / Mortgage / HOA fees**: $1950. 

This is 100% of our rent for a 2.5 bed, 1 bath in a fixer upper and includes pet rent. Both of our names are on the lease, but it made no sense to me for my partner to pitch in, what, $500? No, I’d rather he take what he was spending in rent when we lived apart and put that towards retirement. He comes from an immigrant family and a country that doesn’t have our same investment vehicles, so he didn’t invest for the first 5 years of his career. The day he came to me and told me he bumped his 401(k) contribution up to 15% was a super proud day. He’s able to set himself (and us!) up better because I’m taking the brunt of the expenses for now. If I were to take a pay cut for whatever reason, this would be immediately reevaluated. 

**Renters / home insurance**: $8/month renter’s insurance. 

**Retirement contribution if you contribute more than what’s as already specified from the income / pre-tax section. Do not double count**: I’m saving $780/month in my HYSA so I can dump $7,000 in my Roth come Jan. 1. Then, I’ll begin saving $583 come Jan 2026 to save up $7000 for my 2027 contribution. 

**Savings contribution**: $2,600/month into a HYSA. 

As stated above, this goes into various buckets, with $900/month going towards the down payment on a new car. I’ve been driving my dead parent’s (lol that sounds so macabre. I promise I’m not this weird in real life, just trying to maintain a hint of anonymity) 2015 honda since law school, and would like to buy a car of my own at some point. I’m shooting for at least a $25k down payment and a monthly payment < $400 when the time comes. The savings figure also includes a few hundred towards a wedding and towards vacations. I get about $120/month in interest, which goes in my vacation bucket. 

**Investment contribution**: $2,500/month. Once I paid my GradPlus loans off, I gave myself some money to invest. I’ve upped this recently with the new job, as I have fewer expenses than when I lived alone. I treat this investment as my house down payment fund. 

**Debt payments**: $1,000/month. I have one remaining student loan; the minimum is $200/month. If something were to happen to my job, I could handle $200/month on a much lower salary, but I’d like to be rid of this anyways. As stated, goal is to be done by late 2025 or early 2026. I’m not too stressed about early payoff since the interest rate is at 4%. 

**Donations**:
- Planned Parenthood: $100/month 
- Local TNR group: $15/month 
- UNICEF: $18/month 
- NPR: $10/month (I started this in college after reading Peter Singer. This isn’t even my local station anymore but tbh I don’t know how to stop it and don’t feel the need to) 
- I give between $50-$500 to various go fund mes or fundraisers per month. For example, last month I gave $50 for my friend’s top surgery and a few months ago I gave $500 to my hometown theater after our state cut arts funding. There’s a little girl battling the same cancer my parent had who I follow on social media and to whom I donate ~$20 semi regularly. 

**Electric**: $0. Partner pays utilities. 

**Wifi/Cable/Landline**: $0. Partner pays utilities. 

**Cellphone**: $110/month, but my firm gives me a $50 reimbursement, so I count this as $60. My very first purchase, the weekend after I started work, was a new iPhone (my first ever) and my own phone plan. The phone plan was the last thing my parent was paying for, so I’ve been fully independent for 18 months. 

**Subscriptions**: 
- Amazon prime: $140/year. I’ve tried to stop this, but my parent uses this so much and it’s hard to say no to them. 
- Max: $190/year 
- Workout app: $200/year 
- Copilot: $90/year
- WSJ: $8/month ($96/year)
- Hulu, Disney plus, and youtube premium are included in my cellphone bills. 

**Gym membership** $0. Partner pays because he gets a work benefit. He’s paying $60/month for the Y for the both of us. Another reason I pick up the tab more. 

**Pet expenses**: $50-$200/month. Little baby had to get almost all of her teeth extracted last year which ran me $3000. Hence the Cat fund in my monthly savings. One of my only lifestyle inflations after getting this job was buying her wet cat food for dinner, so the cost above is the cost of cat food + any toys I’m convinced she needs. She is currently with her grandparent as I settle into the new state, so she won’t be making any appearances this diary. 

**Car payment / insurance**: no car payment. Insurance in my new state is great: $720/year!! I was paying $700 every six months in my old state. 

***Money Diary***

**Friday**

*7am*: Fourth of July! I wake up in my partner’s boss’s house. We’re dog sitting while they’re camping for the holiday. My partner, M, makes $50/day to feed a dying dog, Z. She’s 14 years old and physically can’t go on walks and can barely get down the front door steps. We’ve been here since last Saturday. It’s an easy $400 for M, and ingratiates him with his boss. 

I get out of bed, get dressed for our run, and take Z out. M is already on his run; he was out the door at 6am for his first 6 miles, and then he’ll loop around and grab me for a 5k. I grab some coffee M made and lazily check emails. He calls me when he’s around the corner, and I head out to meet him. The house is in a very lazy, quiet, one lane town. One of those where no one locks their doors because no one is nearby. We do a beautiful 3 mile run through the countryside together.  

*8:30am*: M makes breakfast while I shower. We lounge a bit, enjoying being in an “adult house” with more than 2 rooms. He then practices his guitar, and I spend a few hours getting ready for the day. 

*11am*: M has found a sugar cookie recipe he wants to try, and we have the boss’s KitchenAid we can use! We’ve just moved, so we want to bake cookies for our new neighbors as an introduction. We’ve spend the next few hours mixing, freezing, and then baking four dozen cookies. We each grab lunch somewhere in here. 

M also makes us sandwiches to sneak into the Fourth of July festivities later. We’re going to a gorgeous overlook for fireworks and wine, but they totally have you captured and charge $25 for a plate that you have to wait 30 minutes for. After buying a $30 ticket. No thank you! 

*3pm*: We get on the road and hit some wineries. We’re so lucky to live in Virginia wine country. I’ve been here for over four years, and can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been to the same winery. 

First winery, however, was a dud. We got a white wine flight, and didn’t like any of them. **$20**.

Second winery was much better! We got another flight here and actually enjoyed the wine, but it was a bit quiet for what we were looking for on the Fourth. **$18**

Finally, we ended up at a kitschy bar that we’d never seen before. We had a great time, and each got a couple of beers. **$25**

We went back to the house to take out and feed Z. We grabbed our sandwiches and drove the thirty minutes to the Fourth of July event where we’ll be meeting up with some friends. As mentioned above, the tickets were $30/each, but I bought those yesterday. 

*6pm*: We’ve successfully snuck in our sandwiches! This place is pretty lax, and M ultimately ends up buying a bottle + some small snacks, so I don’t feel guilty about our lil turkey sandwiches. He pays. We’re meeting up with a a few couple friends of ours, so every couple takes turns buying a bottle or an ice cream to split. 

*10pm*: After fireworks, we head home (well, the boss’s home), with a stop at a gas station where I pick up some Propels and a lil snack. **$8**. 

**Daily total**: $71. 

**Saturday**

*7am*: wake up, feeling pretty not great. M is totally fine. He was driving last night and didn’t drink like I did. He makes us breakfast, we take Z out one more time, and spend a few minutes tidying up the house so that the boss doesn’t come home to a mess. We leave them some cookies, and are heading back to our house by 8:30. 

*9am*: We’re still settling into our new place, so we spend the entire day rearranging the office and getting our entertainment room (the .5 in the 2.5 bedrooms) set up. 

*2pm*: I’m still somewhat hungover, so I go to Taco Bell and get my classic hangover food: bean burrito and cheese quesadilla. **$8.**

*5pm*: Back to 100%, we keep unpacking/rearranging. Last week, M found a great deal for a propane powered grill just a few blocks away. We don’t have a truck, but we do have a rolling cart! We drive to the college guy’s house and M pays him $40. I take the propane and some accessories in the car while M begins the half mile walk to our house with the grill. I drop the car off, and walk a couple of blocks to meet him and help him traverse the hills in our neighborhood. Success!  We now have a grill for our backyard. We make dinner, M making himself a salad and me making an egg since I had a big late lunch. 

*8pm*: We settle into our newly kinda finished entertainment room and watch Heads of State, which I heard about when Idris Elba was on Amy Pohler’s podcast (highly recommend!). We go to bed around 11. 

**Daily total**: $8. 

**Sunday**

*7am*: Can’t believe the weekend is still going. This is great. I’ve gotten almost no emails; the Fourth seems to be one of the few holidays that is truly seen as time off, unless you have a closing or client emergency. M makes us breakfast, and I get dressed for the day. 

*10am*: M goes shopping for the house. He does our grocery shopping nearly every week, and he’s been buying so much for the house itself. I send him with my card so that way he’s not covering 100% of our groceries for the month. He goes to Walmart where he gets groceries & items for the house. **$96**

*4pm* I’ve been doing other chores, like laundry, dishes, and lunch meal prep for the week. I’ve also spent about four hours outside working on our yard, mostly weeding. Lots of sunblock, a hat, and sunglasses! M has also been working outside, but he’s working on cleaning the new grill and getting the year old gunk off. Pretty sure the college guy didn’t clean it once but hey, a grill’s a grill. 

*6pm*: M had rented a carpet cleaner earlier today for the new house. We can’t pull up the carpet, but at least we can clean it. He had already paid the $30 to rent, so I didn’t owe anything when I returned it to the grocery store. I buy some small groceries that he had missed earlier. **$25**

8pm: We’ve had dinner, and settle in to watch trash TV. We unfortunately have work tomorrow, so we head to bed by 11. 

**Daily total**: $121 

**Monday**

*7am*: And, we’re back. Get up, get coffee that M brewed, grab breakfast (oatmeal) and at work by 8:30. M was at work by 7:30. My work is so close. I work in a satellite office of a big law firm, so we’re able to live very close to downtown while having a super reasonable rent. I don’t even need to pay for parking. The firm has a garage, but they charge $130/month for parking. That’s silly, when there’s all day street parking *right outside* the office. I paid for parking for two weeks and then stopped. I may pay again when the weather gets colder, but for now there are 0 reasons for me to pay that money. Instead, that can go towards a fun weekend a month for us! 

*10am*: Okay, this is why I wanted to make this diary. I’d seen a post over at r/30Rock and fell in love with the style of art. Sooooo I commissioned the artist to make one for my office, but of Liz Lemon. The artist would only ship it after I paid, so I venmo him $400 this morning after seeing the final product. That’s by *far* the most I’ve ever paid for… maybe anything? That’s not usable?  But I love the idea of it in my office and it brings me joy. I don’t spend on nails or a ton of clothes. I never got myself anything after passing the VA bar (I bought a briefcase after passing my first state), so I’m considering this a bar gift. Plus, artists should be paid their worth and I know he put 6+ hours into this. The time, material, and skills are well worth $400. **$400**

*Noon*: Lunch is the pasta and chicken prepped over the weekend. My partner’s birthday is coming up soon, and he’s been wanting a new set of glasses for his bar. I do some sleuthing on Reddit and find Riedel. lol they charge like $80 for one wine glass. I find some drink-specific glasses (that are cheaper than the sommelier glass) and go ahead and make the purchase. 6 glasses. He’s an artist at heart and I think he’ll really appreciate the craftsmanship of these. **$156**

*3pm*: Work is slow today. Most partners are still out for the holiday weekend. That’s great and all, but not super awesome when I’m evaluated on my billables and my bonus is based on hours billed as well. I’ve done some pro bono work (and the shopping..) and am now peckish. I head to the nearby drugstore and buy a drink and some snacks. **$8**

*4:30pm*: Well, nothing’s happening at this point, so I pop out early and head to the Y, which is about 10 minutes from work. I do 30 minutes of weights and 30 minutes of cardio, keeping my eye on my phone in case an email comes in. 

*7pm*: Home, showered. I make myself fried rice, M makes himself a salad. We never eat the same meal unless it’s a weekend and one of us has cooked. We find it easier to just do our own thing. 

*10pm*: We each want to get up early to workout tomorrow, so we head to bed around 10 and are asleep by 10:30. 

**Daily total**: $564 

**Tuesday**

*5am*: M wakes me up, as requested, as he’s out the door for his 8 mile run. I slowly get up, and am at the Y by 5:45. A client has something weird going on with an LLC we formed for them, so I shoot them an email while doing my cardio to try to clear it up. This is the first client I’m handling all on my own, so I don’t want anything to go wrong. 

*7:30am*: Home, shower, breakfast (oatmeal), makeup. M is already at work. 

*9am*: Things are picking up again, so I have some projects today. First up is completing a cap table for a client who’s selling soon. Lots of sleuthing and reading terms of agreements. Takes forever, especially when the client wasn’t particularly organized. 

*11am*: In between, M is sending me items for Amazon. I try *very hard* to not use Amazon. I push M to buy things locally. If it were up to me, I’d get rid of it completely. But there are some things that M would otherwise buy on Temu or Alibaba, so I pick my battles. He sends me items for the house—a new lamp, some kitchen items, items for the yard. I’m the one with Prime, so it makes sense for me to order. **$209**

*Noon*: I’ve been craving pizza. Plus we ran out of chicken after yesterday’s lunch. So, it’s pizza for lunch! I walk to a nearby to-go restaurant and get two slices. **$10** 

*4pm*: I get a fundraising call from Planned Parenthood. Since college, I’d been donating $10/month. After I started working, I raised that to $50/month. And now that I’ve gotten a raise at my new firm, it was a great time for them to call me. On the phone I increased my monthly contribution to $100/month. This isn’t enough, I know. 

*5pm*: The rest of the day goes by quickly. I work with some pro bono clients and keep working on the sell-side deal. Head home at 5pm. Because so much (AKA all) of my work is online, there’s no “face-time” requirement here. I leave at a reasonable hour, between 4:30-6pm every day, and keep working at home if needed. 

*7pm*: We’re meeting friends at a new bowling alley in town. M made dinner at home (and prepped more chicken for the week), but because of my pizza lunch I’m not incredibly hungry. Bowling is $10/person, and we order a few beers and some shareables. **$55**, including tip. 

*9:30pm*: I get home and crash. Those 5am wake ups are no joke. In bed and asleep by 10pm. 

**Daily total**: $274 

**Wednesday**

*7am*: Wake up and realize we forgot to get the trash out last night. This is our first time in a house, so we’re still getting used to trash day and not just a dumpster! I rush outside and pull the can to the curb. I see that other cans are still full, so we’re not too late. 

No gym for me this morning; I’ll go after work. I gained about 15 lbs since quitting my old job, and am working to lose it. The pizza and beer may tell you I’m not working incredibly hard, ha. Still, working out is important to my mental health so I get to the gym 4-6 times a week, and M runs or gyms the same amount. 

*9am*: At work, settled in. I’m still dealing with my client’s formation issue from yesterday. I also enter and release my time from the first half of the week. Nothin says “fun” like accounting for your entire day in 0.1 intervals!

*Noon*: Lunch is pasta, chicken, and salad. I limit eating out lunch to once a week, typically Fridays. This is generally about $20 for a salad or bowl. But I wanted pizza yesterday. So lunch will be pasta, chicken, and salad for the rest of the week. 

*4pm*: I’ve spent most of my afternoon on a diligence call with the sell-side client. We’re aiming to get the first draft of the disclosure schedules to Buyer at the end of the week. After my inbox slows down, I decide to head to the Y around 4 to beat the evening rush. 

*6:30pm*: After 30 minutes of weights and 30 minutes of cardio (and a 10 minute break to find an email for a Senior), I’m home, showered, and eating my breakfast-for-dinner. Then, it’s back to work. 

*10pm*: Turns out that our sell-side client has multiple entities that have been terminated because they’re no longer in good standing. Yay. So I spend a few hours chasing that down and working more on the disclosure schedules.  I reach a stopping point, and head to bed. I chat with M and he shows me some ideas for lighting in our front hallway closet. I also donate $50 to a friend’s family, who recently lost their young adult son in a car crash. I never met him, but I’m devastated for my friend. **$58** (includes coving GoFundMe’s costs)

**Daily total**: $58

**Thursday**

*5:30am*: M is up. We’re supposed to go to the gym together, him to a cycling class and me for my normal routine. However, I couldn’t sleep well last night because an assignment is due “early” this morning and I’m only about half way through. What’s early? 10am? 8am? Before start of day? No clue. So I send him to the gym and I get settled in our office to do some work in my PJs. 

*8:30am*: I run through a drive thru for a breakfast burrito; in my defense, I really didn’t have time for my typical oatmeal. I get to work, having completed 90% of the assignment, polish it, and send it off by 9am. That has to count as early, right? **$8**

*Noon*: Been running between one project and another. Having more than 4 hours billed before noon is great, though. I eat my pasta, salad, and chicken and wait for more emails. 

*2pm*: I head home during a lull. We got a wayfair package, and I didn’t want it to be on our stoop for too long. I quickly wash some dishes, and then back to work. 

*7pm*: Having gone to the gym, I’m home, showered, and had dinner. M mowed the lawn after work and he keeps tinkering around d the house. I do a few chores, like vacuuming and tidying up after dinner. M is a workhorse. It can be a bit of a challenge sometimes. He hardly ever just.. sits. He’s always doing something productive, even when I want to just hangout. This evening he rearranged our dining room, fixed a broken chest, removed tape residue from a piece of furniture, fixed a lamp, all on top of mowing the lawn after working a 10 hour day.  

*9pm*: I get comfy to relax. M is cleaning the bathroom (I told him I would do it tomorrow!). We chat about our days and are asleep by 10:30. 

**Daily Total**: $8

***Weekly Total***

Food + Drink: $149

Fun / Entertainment: $400 (I’m counting my Liz Lemon portrait as entertainment!)

Home + Health: $330 

Clothes + Beauty: $0

Transport: $0

Other: $214 (M’s birthday gift and the GFM)

Total: $1,084

**Lastly, reflect on your diary!**

This was *not* an ordinary week! I’ve never spent that much on a piece of art, and M’s birthday is only once a year. We’re also still settling in, so our house items won’t be this expensive for much longer. Just a note: I do not work in NOVA, so our COL is much lower than what you’d typically expect from an attorney in big law. However, I still get the NOVA salary. Pretty amazing. 

I thought I’d spent more. I really have tried to not let lifestyle inflation get to me. And okay, maybe my Liz Lemon portrait proves that it has. But we try to be economical in everything we do: we eat out maybe every two weeks (though breweries/wineries are basically weekly), I don’t pay for parking (neither does M), we don’t live in a $3000 luxury apartment, we know the absolute best happy hours when we do go out. 

I don’t expect this big law salary to last. In fact, I’d be surprised if it lasts another 2 years. So for now, I am trying to save. I live off of ~40% of my take home salary and save/invest the rest. I lost a lot of years in law school when I couldn’t save, and I didn’t have the income to save much prior to law school, so I’m trying to make up for lost time and front load my accounts in preparation for not being able to max them out. 

I’m very grateful for my income and for my lack of debt. I can absolutely see how golden handcuffs are real. And I’m not even talking lifestyle inflation. Once you save/invest $5,000 a month, it’s *really* hard to not see that in the future. That’s a security net that is concrete. But like I’ve said, I won’t be in big law forever and certainly not when I have kids. So I’m working on my mentality regarding money, trying to enjoy it while I have it and save for when I don’t. 

I probably spent too much on M’s gift. Six glasses for $160 is crazy and I wouldn’t do that typically. But cocktail making is a big hobby of his and he’s been wanting some glassware sets. I recognize I’m saying I spent too much on him when I also spent $400 on a portrait this week lol I promise I will take him out for a great birthday weekend!

Feel free to ask me about anything regarding law school, big law, etc. I won’t go into specifics about my location or firm, as it’s very identifiable.

What actually worked? **Small, consistent habits that felt almost too simple at first.**

Here are 3 daily habits that didn’t feel like much in the beginning, but looking back, they created a solid foundation for real change:

# 1. Setting an Intention Every Morning

Before checking my phone or diving into the day, I pause for a minute and ask,

>

# 2. Writing Down 3 Things I’m Grateful For

Even on bad days. Especially on bad days.  
It rewired my mind to focus on what’s going *right*, even if it's just coffee, a good sleep, or a kind message.

# 3. Moving My Body (Even Just 5–10 Minutes)

Not a full workout — sometimes it’s stretching, a walk, or a quick set of pushups.  
What helped me stay consistent was using the [Nike Training Club](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-training-club-wellness/id301521403) app — it has free short routines, no equipment needed, and feels super doable even on lazy days.

I also use a minimal app called [Manifest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-manifestation-journal/id1542250872) to track the first two habits — it helps me stay aligned with my goals and mindset each morning. Nothing fancy, but that little check-in really adds up over time.

What are your top 3 daily habits that made a difference — big or small?  
Would love to hear what’s worked for you 🙌

I've got a thing for this girl i met who's right on the cusp, cancer side. There's definitely lots of attraction here, physically, emotionally and mentally. I haven't been shy pursuing her, specially since she always seems really happy to see me and we end up talking for a long time through a huge range of topics whenever we bump into each other and its a warm vibe. Even her body language always seems welcoming towards me and there's plenty of suggestive comments. Butttt...both times I've invited her to actually make plans to hang out (not a date, just real casual), i feel she's a bit hesitant. Gave me her IG, and number, but wont text me back. Sad i know haha. But when I see her, all seems fine and we're sweet. Says she didn't see my DM on insta, but even when I text her phone asking if she'd grab a coffee with me during lunchtime, nothing. 

I'm just trying to understand from any natives or people with experience what these cuspers are up to! 

Just some extra info, we're NOT work colleagues or anything like that. 
I'm a Pisces-Aries cusp on the Aries side. 
She's 7 years younger than me.

I'm just confused why someone that shares a genuinely awesome vibe with is avoiding the idea of making plans to hang out, but still seems to love it when she sees me out in the wild.

1lx4g3s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx4g3s,"[Question] My first watch, needed repair, took it to the repair shop. What's next? No idea what to do.","Hey everyone, 

I recently picked up my first vintage watch (my first watch ever as well), an Oysterdate Precision 6694. It’s my entry into the watch world and I'm already loving it. Well, I was. I was showing my spouse how to wind a manual watch and she had a go at it but she was messing with it, implying she doesn’t care, saying things like ""oh it’s just a watch, just tells the time"" and was turning the crown quite hard and fast both clockwise and anticlockwise for like 10 to 20 seconds. It was some sort of joke... 

BUT A few days later, after winding it normally, I tried to pull the crown out to set the time and it actually came out completely with a thin pin, like the whole winding stem. I could still wind the watch but I couldn’t set the time anymore. It would just come out rather than stopping in the time-setting position. I asked GPT and it said it might be a simple lever screw issue inside, but would need a watchmaker to fix. 

I took it to a reputable local watch repair shop and they quoted **£365 + VAT** for a full service (I added the email in the photos). That includes cleaning, lubrication, gasket replacement, water resistance testing, and comes with a 1-year warranty. Sounds decent, but I'm not sure if I it needs servicing. Does it have to be serviced for the lever screw to be fixed? 

To be honest, I don’t know what a **full service** exactly is or if the watch had one before. Is it necessary? Why do people do it? Why not just fix the stem and leave the rest? Is that not a common practise? Or is it?

The second hand has some rust or oxidation on it. I’m personally okay with it I guess, I think it adds a bit of character. So I’d prefer not to replace the hands or dial. Maybe they can clean it a bit but I don’t want new parts thrown on unless it’s really needed. 

Also, they mention water resistance testing. Can a vintage 6694 actually be water resistant again? Or is that just checking seals and making sure it's safe from splashes? 

This is all new to me and I’m just trying to figure things out. Any advice would be really appreciated, especially from people who have owned similar watches or gone through a similar service. Should I ask some questions to the repair shop? And what would you do/ask them?

# Chapter 1 Friends No More - Pt.

“Ella, hurry up or you’re going to be late for school!” This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it’s going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven’t had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, and that’s the most messed up part. I’m eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I’m a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven’t always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn’t until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

“Honey! Are you coming down or not?” Once again, my mother’s voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, “Good morning, daddy.”

“Morning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?” His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I’ve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don’t complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

“No, daddy.” I don’t add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I’m a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I’m not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

“This is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,” Mom takes her place across from me, on my father’s other side, as she sips her black coffee, “Please don’t make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.”

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, “Behave, Ethan!”

I’ve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad’s chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it’s so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

“Oh! Before I forget,” Mom turns back to me, “I have a PTA meeting at Eli’s school this evening. I’ll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.”

“Sure, no problem.” My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. “Will you be home for supper, dad?”

“I’m not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don’t make it in time.” I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it’s no surprise when he doesn’t make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, “The train is leaving!” I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It’s the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she’s a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran’s song, Shivers, my sister’s favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can’t help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it’s times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I’m afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I’ll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

“Watch where you’re going, nerd!” Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.”

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.” She mimics and then shoves past me, “How about you accidentally jump off a bridge?” Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school’s dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I’m going to have. Kaylee doesn’t even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season’s fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend’s party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That’s when it all started; it’s when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything…you name it…our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn’t remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn’t drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn’t drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn’t sat well with me, because it wasn’t like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn’t find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn’t heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn’t want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What’s one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace’s bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn’t until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I’m so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don’t bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don’t.

Watching where I’m going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I’m yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I’m staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

“What do you want, Jace?” I tried to sound annoyed, but then my voice cracks at the end, giving me away.

“Where have you been hiding all day, Ella?” He crosses his arms in front of his chest and looks down at me. I stand about eight inches shorter than him, so I’m always having to look up.

I roll my eyes at him, “I wasn’t hiding. I just want to get to my classes on time.”

Next thing I know, Jace’s broad chest is right in front of my face, “Did you just fucking roll your eyes at me?” He sneers down at me, making my heart start to race.

Damn, I should have known better than to give him an eyeroll! He warned me last time what would happen, but would he really do it? I glance around the room, trying to find another way that I could possibly escape, and that’s when I see his two best friends standing only a few feet away, wearing identical smirks. Toby and Brandon are two of the school’s popular guys, and two of the biggest jerks as well. Jace started hanging with them shortly after he dumped me; what he sees in them, I will never understand. Now, he has become one of them.

“I’m sorry, Jace. I didn’t mean to.” I dip my head when I see him bring his arm up, thinking he’s going to strike me. Instead, he grabs my nape and walks me over to the nearest desk.

“I told you that you would be punished if you ever rolled your eyes at me, didn’t I?” He bends me over the desk until my cheek is pressed down against it, “Answer me, Ella. Did I not warn you?”

“Y-Yes, you did Jace, but…”

“No buts, Ella. If I don’t keep my word than you will never obey me.” He motions for his two friends to come closer, “Hold her arms, and make sure she stays in place.”

“Please, Jace…you don’t have to do this!” I beg, “I promise to obey you from now on…I swear!”

His hand comes down to caress my hair, “Oh Ella, I know you will obey me, because I’m going to show you what happens when naughty girls don’t listen.” His voice is calm as he speaks to me, but then he shoves my head into the desk even more as he moves away to stand behind me.

I can’t see or hear what Jace is doing behind me, but I can see Toby, who is holding my left arm and shoulder down, nod at whatever his friend is communicating to him. A tear drips from my right eye as I remain bent in this humiliating position while I wait for him to begin. I’m not sure  how much it’s going to hurt, but I do know that it isn’t going to feel good either.

I feel the sting of his hand before I even realize it was coming down. I go up on my toes to try and get away from him, but a hand presses into my lower back, keeping me from moving. The spot where is hand met my backside burns already, and that was only the first one.

“Count them out, Ella.” Jace commands, but I’m still too stunned to say anything. My head gets jerked back by my hair, and he leans in so close to my face that I can see the little golden flecks within the green of his eyes. Something passes as our eyes meet, but it was less than a second, and his eyes harden once more, “I said count!”

“O-One.”

He holds onto my hair for a few seconds longer before going back behind me. Bringing his hand down once more, I make sure I count each one. I falter on the fifth one because it was harder than the rest, but I quickly call it out. By the tenth smack, my butt is on fire and tingling, as numbness threatens to take over.

“Why Jace? Why do you hate me so much?” Tears are now falling down full force as I ask the one question that I have never gotten an answer to, “WHY?” I scream when he ignores me and brings his hand down once more.

“I don’t answer to you, Ella,” His breathing is heavy from spanking me so hard, “Just know that you did this, all by yourself!” His hand comes down in rapid succession, taking whatever aggression he has, out on my poor backside. When I start to scream, a hand covers my mouth, muffling the sound.

All of a sudden, everything stops, and I’m released, but I don’t move; I can’t move. I hear the click of the lock, and then the door closes. Still, I don’t move. I feel the burn that his hand left behind, but there is something else I feel as well. I don’t understand why I’m feeling this way after he did what he did. It feels both wrong and good at the same time. Is it normal to feel tingles deep inside? I now feel a need that I’ve only felt a couple of times before; a need that I have had to take care of myself.

A moan slips from my lips as I go to stand, which turns into a grunt when my punished backside bumps up against something. Whipping my head around, Jace is still standing behind me. I can’t read his face, and at this moment, I don’t want to. I just want to go home and hide under my covers until I no longer feel the humiliation that Jace and his friends just put me through. I don’t want to be punished again, though, so I ask before I just leave.

“May I go now?” I can’t find it in me to look up at his face any longer, so I bow my head.

“No, I’m not done with you yet, Ella.” His voice is calm now, even though there isn’t an ounce of emotion to it, “Unbutton your shorts and bend over the desk again.”

His words catch my attention, and my head whips up, “W-What?”

“You heard me, Ella. I’m not going to say it again.”

“But you can’t…”

He cuts me off with a grunt, “You obviously haven’t learned your lesson! Maybe a few more handprints will do the trick.” He spins me back around and pushes between my shoulder blades until my chest is flat on the desk, “Don’t fucking move until I say!”

The way he orders me to stay scares the crap out of me, so I decide to obey, even though I’m freaking out at what he’s going to do, “Please, don’t do this, Jace! I’m sorry…whatever I did in the past, I’m so sorry!” I can’t stop the tears from flowing once more.

I cry out when he yanks my jean shorts down just past my cheeks. Cool air from the air conditioner makes me break out in goosebumps, but it also feels good on my heated backside. I can hear Jace hunting for something in his bag just before I hear the sound of a cap popping open. My eyes widen with what I believe he is getting ready to do, and I try jumping up, but he’s there to block me.

“You really don’t listen, do you? I. Said. Don’t. Fucking. Move!” He shoves me back down, and this time, he keeps his hand between my shoulder blades. I feel a cold substance dribble on each cheek, “I shouldn’t even be doing this, “He starts to rub whatever he dripped on me, into my skin, helping to take the heat away, “but I got you good. Next time, obey me, and it will never be this bad.”

His hands feel good as they massage the gel-like substance into my skin. He’s being very careful as he switches back and forth from cheek to cheek. His hand then goes lower to where my sit spot is and keeps massaging. I don’t even think about what he may be able to see, all I can concentrate on is the feel of his big hands on me. I think I may have moaned, because he pauses a moment before I feel his fingers opening my cheeks.

# Chapter 4 Obey Me - Pt. 2

“Did you get off on my punishing you, Ella…or are my hands making you all wet?”

I’m too embarrassed to say anything, so I just shake my head back and forth. His finger dips between my folds and passes through the slickness a few times before Jace removes it. I hear him groan and then a wet popping sound comes from behind me, where he is standing.

“Mm…who knew your slutty pussy would taste this good?” Suddenly, his hand comes down on my already numb butt, “Don’t ever lie to me again. You got turned on by me spanking you!” He smirks.

I’m too scared to move; too afraid that my now really wet area will make a sound when I move, and it’s the last thing I want him to hear. Thankfully, he takes the initiative and pulls up first, my panties, and then my shorts. I take it as my cue to stand up and button my shorts up, but I refuse to look at him. I can only imagine what I look like after crying while wearing mascara, but he doesn’t care, he turns me towards him, and gripping my chin, he forces my head up.

“Damn, Ella. If I didn’t despise you so much, I’d say you look fucking beautiful with your mascara running down your wet face.” He gazes at me, taking in everything he can before a sadness crosses his handsome features, “I really wish things didn’t change between us, Ella. You could have experienced so much with me,” The hardness that I’m used to seeing takes hold once more, “Too bad I slutty girls don’t interest me.” He shoves my head away, and snatching his bag off the desk beside us, he heads towards the door, stopping before he opens it. Looking back over his shoulder, he looks me up and down, before meeting my eyes, “Obey me next time, and don’t ever hide from me, Ella, or next time you will be bared and then punished. You wouldn’t want my friends to see you like that, now, would you?”

He actually waits for my answer, so I hurry up and give it, “N-No, I don’t.”

“Yeah, well, we will see about that. Go home and clean yourself up. You look pathetic.”

I’m finally left alone to gather myself together. Moving over to the big sink where the students wash their hands after handling art supplies, I look at myself in the mirror above it, and gasp. I look horrific! Bending over, I quickly wash all the makeup from my face, removing all evidence that Jace made me cry.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Thank God I don’t have to drive my sister and brother home today, because I don’t know if I can keep it together being around anyone right now. As I pull into our driveway, I see Jace climbing out of his new jeep that he got for his eighteenth birthday. He smirks at me and then pushes the finger he used on me into his mouth and started sucking on it. I turn and run up the walkway, and into my house. I don’t stop running until I get to my room, slamming the door closed. I lean against it, panting as I catch my breath, but running all the way up here isn’t the only reason why I’m panting. Jace Palmer is what has me trying to get my heart rate down.

What he did to me in that empty classroom was humiliating and shameful, but deep down, I liked it. I liked it even more when his hands rubbed the gel into my heated skin that he caused with his own hand. To make matters worse, his finger almost had me coming all over! He never would have let me live that down. I’m already worried what he will tell tweedle dee and tweedle dum about what happened after they left the room.

Damn him! Why does he have this effect on me? I never had feelings for him until after he started bullying me. I have been crushing on my bully for two years, and now, he’s just made it worse. Knowing what his hands feel like when they touch my bare skin, will be burned into my soul forever. What did I ever do to deserve this, and why did he keep calling me slutty? He knew I was still a virgin when we were still friends, and then he went and scared everybody away, so even if I wanted to, there is no one in my age group that I could have lost it to.

I’m so frustrated! I wish I had someone to talk to, it would be so nice to be able to talk to my two best friends, but he even scared them off! I mean, they don’t hate and treat me badly like everyone else, if anything they pity me. I can see it in their eyes every time we cross paths, but they are unwilling to anger Jace by talking to me. I don’t understand how he can make a whole school scared of him.

Sighing, I head to my bathroom ensuite as I start pulling off my clothes. A bath is what I need right now; a bath and some music, because thanks to the bully next door, I have something that needs attention. I’m just about to step into the tub when I hear my phone ping with a text message. I go back to my room and grab my cell from the bed where I tossed it when I came in. My heart skips a beat when a name that I haven’t seen in two years, pops up. I open the text and read it, furrowing my brows.

JP: Do Not Touch Yourself!

Another text pops up.

JP: I mean it, Ella! If you touch that pussy, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!

“What the hell?” I say to myself. I happen to glance up, and there is Jace, standing at his bedroom window, staring straight into mine with an anguished look on his face. It takes me a moment, but then I realize that I’m standing here, completely naked. “OH MY GOD!!” Ripping the comforter off my bed, I wrap it around myself and then stalk over to the window and pull my curtains closed.

Sweet Jesus! I can’t believe he saw me naked! He’s never going to let me live it down, and he will make me the laughingstock at school! Slamming my bathroom door, I drop my comforter and climb into the steaming water. I lower myself slowly, not wanting to hurt my bottom any more than it already is. Once I’m all the way in, I sigh. The heat from the water relaxes my body as I close my eyes and my thoughts automatically take me back to the classroom, and the spanking that Jace delivered.

“Well, if anything, he is a man of his word.” I say out loud.

My thoughts are beginning to make my body react, and the last thing I need is for Jace to find out that I did what he commanded me not to do. I don’t think I can handle another punishment so soon after this first one, but where does he get off telling me what I can and can’t do? He doesn’t even like me, so what does it matter? Screw this, it is my body, and I am in charge of what I do to it! With that being said, I slowly start sliding my hand over my thigh, moving it up to where I’m desperately needing it. Just when I’m about to slide it between my thighs, a voice enters my head, his voice.

“UGH!” Frustrated, I pull my hand away and pull myself up and out of the tub. I now need to find something to occupy my time. “Chicken shit,” I mumble to myself as I dry my body off. Forgetting about my sore bottom, I run the towel over it roughly, cursing as the burn comes back full force. Yep, definitely made the right decision.

# Chapter 5 Our Little Secret - Pt. 1

Over the last couple of weeks, things have been back to normal, well my normal anyway. Jace is back to shoving me against lockers as he walks by or trying to trip me when he passes me in the halls. His two friends shoulder bump me, but that’s the extent to what they do to me; the rest is all Jace.

I’m standing at my locker with the door open, reading a text from my mom, when suddenly the door slams shut. It startles me, and I jump back. Kaylee is leaning against the locker next to mine with her arms crossed and a huge smirk on her face. I roll my eyes and go to reopen my locker, but she stops me by slamming her hand against my door.

I sigh heavily, “What do you want, Kaylee?”

“A little respect, for one!” she glares at me.

“I haven’t done anything to you. Believe me, I try to avoid you like the plague.” I say smugly.

“See! That right there…it’s disrespectful!” She points her long, pointed fingernail at me.

“You have to earn respect, Kaylee. You lost my respect when you decided to start treating me like crap for no reason.” I’m just so tired of being scared about who will do what to me. I need to start standing up for myself, “So, again, what do you want? I have a class to get to.”

She huffs, and then gets right up in my face, “Talk to me like that again, and see where that gets you!”

I don’t have time for this, so I put on the biggest fake smile for her, “Geesh, I’m so sorry, Kaylee. To what do I owe the pleasure?”

She gives me a squinty glare at my sarcasm, “I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of Jace throwing a party at his house tomorrow night, and that you are not invited.”

“What makes you think that I would even want to go to one of his parties?”

“Well, I just know how both your parents are close friends and they will probably expect you to go.” She copies my stance.

“Whatever, no worries. I definitely will not be there.” I decide to walk away before I get even more annoyed with the barbie wanna be. I hear her snicker as I pass her, but she doesn’t stop me. Why would she even think that I would expect to be invited?

“Hey, Ella…wait up!” My sister calls out as she jogs up to me, “What class do you have next?”

“History, why do you ask?”

“Oh, just wondering. Are you doing anything this afternoon?”

“Not as of right now, unless mom asks, why?”

“Well, I was wondering if you could take me to the mall and help me pick an outfit out.”

“Of course, I will! I love shopping with you.” I bring her in for a side hug as we walk down the hall.

“Thank you! I better get going, my class is all the way downstairs.” She chuckles.

I shake my head in amusement as my sister bounces away.

“Your little sister is turning into a hottie.” My body freezes at the sound of his voice. Spinning around, I come face to face with my bully.

“Please stay away from her.” I plead.

His hand presses against the middle of his chest, and he gives a fake gasp, “You hurt my feelings, Ella. I would never do anything to hurt an innocent girl like Elise.” He leans in, so the other students passing by don’t hear what he’s about to say, “She isn’t you. I’d never do to her all the things I want to do to you. I wouldn’t want to hurt her like I want to hurt you.”

Even though his words are hurtful, they send a tingle through me, making my core throb. I suck in a breath and take a little step back. When I glance up at his face, there is a look that has replaced the hardness that is usually there. Almost like a look that promises me that he will be doing exactly what he just said. We are only a few inches away from each other, the smell of his cologne tickles my nose. I know the scent well, because it’s still the same one that he started wearing when we were friends. It’s the one that I bought him; he’s never changed it after all this time.

I don’t dare say anything or try to move away. I wait for him to depart first, and when he gives me a sneer and stomps away, I blow the breath out that I hadn’t realized I was holding in.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

“Oh my God, that is so cute on you! I think you should definitely go with that one.”

I’ve been sitting down, flipping through an out-of-date fashion magazine while my sister tries on outfit after outfit. I really don’t mind, it’s not like I have anything else going on in my life. Living vicariously through Elise at least helps me keep up on life outside of home and school.

“You think so?” She turns in front of the full-length mirror, trying to decide, “I still think I should go with the green dress.”

My mouth drops open, “You mean the one wear your butt cheeks are peeking out of the bottom?”

“Don’t exaggerate, Ella.”

“Who are you going out on a date with anyway?” I slap her hand away as she tries to fold the already small crop top, up so it sits right under her breasts.

“Oh, I don’t have a date.”

I’m totally confused now, “So what was this important shopping trip for?”

Her eyes widen as she looks over at me, “Um, hello! It’s Jace’s very first party at his house! Aren’t you going?”

She leaves me speechless to where I just stand here gawking at her until she shakes me a bit.

“Earth to Ella! Did you hear me?”

“Uh, yeah, um…but no, I’m not going.” I tilt my head at her, “Why are you going? You never even talk to him.”

She shrugs, “He personally invited me this morning.” Cocking her hip and placing her hand upon it, she scrutinizes me, “You’re seriously not going? I mean, you two used to be inseparable and now I never see you guys talk. Is there something going on that you haven’t told men about?”

Elise has no idea of the hell that our next-door neighbor puts me through on a daily basis. He makes sure to be on his best behavior when she or any other family member is around. I don’t want her knowing, but I also don’t want her going to that party. Nothing good can come from him inviting my little sister; he’s up to something.

Putting one of my famous fake smiles on, I rub her arm, “There is nothing to tell. Friends grow apart, and parties are not my thing.” An idea comes to me, “Hey, why don’t you ditch the party and we can go hit up the next town, maybe check out that new hangout that everybody seems to be crazy about?”

She scoffs at me, “Seriously? Mom and Dad finally give me permission to go to a high school party, and you think I will pass it up?” Her head shakes, “Uh huh, not doing it.”

Feeling defeated, I go back to the chair I was sitting in, “In that case, wear this outfit. I don’t want any of those buttholes from school trying to feel you up, and they will try.”

“Fine. I will listen to my big sister’s advice.” She goes to enter the dressing room but then turns back to me, “I love you, Ella. If there is anything that you need to talk about, I’m here for you. All of your secrets are safe with me.”

I smile, “Thank you, Elise. Right back at you.”

She nods her head and sadly smiles back before closing the dressing room door. I need to talk to Jace before that party. I need to know what his plans are with my baby sister. Maybe if I tell her what he’s been doing to me for the past two years, then she won’t go. Biting my thumb nail, I contemplate on doing just that. In the end, though, I just can’t do it. I can’t tell her how much of a pussy her big sister is because she can’t stand up to the boy next door.

# Chapter 6 Our Little Secret - Pt. 2

I’ve just finished supper with my family when I excuse myself. I hurry to my room and glance out my window to see if Jace is home. His black jeep is parked in the driveway, so I pick up my cell and type out a quick text.

ME: Can we talk?

Hitting send, I wait. I get nothing back for at least ten minutes, and just when I think he’s going to ignore me, my phone pings.

JP: Why would I want to talk to you?

ME: Please, it’s important!

JP: What’s in it for me?

Seriously? What a douche bag! I sit back, biting my lower lip while I think about what to say. My phone pings again.

JP: I don’t have all night, Ella. Some of us have a life you know!

ME: Ok…I’m thinking!

JP: Did you just yell at me?

Oh shoot! What was I thinking?!

ME: No, I promise!

JP: Yelling & lying to me, tsk tsk, You’re in for it tomorrow.

ME: Please, Jace…I’m sorry!

JP: Oh, you’re going to be sorry! Now, what did you want?

ME: Can we meet up for a minute? It’s about my sister.

JP: Fine. Come over, but hurry, I have to be somewhere.

ME: Ok, thanks.

He doesn’t bother to respond back, so I quickly jump from my bed and hurry downstairs. There isn’t anybody around as I head straight for the door, and I’m thankful for thank, because then I’d have to tell them where I’m going. The last thing I need is my mom telling me to invite Jace over. She used to think of him as a second son and was sad when he stopped coming over.

As I step out the door, I stop for a moment. I’m about to enter my bully’s home, what am I thinking? I glance over and see that their garage door is open, and that Mrs. Palmer’s car is parked in it. I sigh in relief, I should be safe with his mom home, so I quicken my steps, so he doesn’t get angry at me for taking too long.

I press the doorbell and wait. My heartbeat quickens when the door opens and I see Jace standing there, shirtless. He’s holding a shirt in his hand, so I must have caught him as he was finishing up getting dressed. He glances up and down the street and then nods for me to come in. Is he embarrassed to have me in his house?

My eyes are still on his bare chest when his hardened voice gets my attention, “What the fuck do you need to talk to me about?” I almost frown when he slides his shirt over his head but cover it up right away.",1,1752233205.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1lx4cqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BecomingTheIceman/comments/1lx4cqc/for_the_person_that_asked_about_weight_loss/,For the person that asked about weight loss:,"I took half an hour writing a whole response and somehow I can’t comment because of a reddit error, so I hope you see this.😭

I was fat my whole life until I was around 19 years old and a switch just flipped. I lost 40KG in about a year and I’m 23 now at a stable and healthy weight. What changed it all for me was actually understanding food and how my body works, this changed everything.

Worst advice I’ve been given: “Just exercise more and eat less”

Best advice I’ve been given: “Track your macro’s” Honorabel mention: “Stop drinking your calories”.

Of course, eating less and exercising more taken at face value sounds great, but if you have no idea how your body or food works it’s not gonna get you anywhere and you’ll keep looping (eg, losing weight for a few months, bouncing back again, repeating the cycle). I can’t stress enough how important it is to understand how your body and how food works, it’s so essential.

Tracking your macro’s is the best thing you could do, ultimately losing weight (for most people) is as simple as consuming less calories than that you burn. You have a BMR, which is basically your metabolic rate. This is a number that differs per person, and this number is the exact amount of calories your body burns if you don’t do anything in a day (so in rest). For example, my BMR is around 1700. This means that if I lay in bed all day, I need to eat 1700 calories in order to maintain my weight. Below this number I lose weight and above this number I gain weight. Simple, right? Well, it’s a little more complicated.

Because you can manipulate this whole system by doing certain things. It’s really hard to change your BMR, though there is some things that’s scientifically proven to influence it. If you consume nicotine, drink a lot of coffee, take stimulant medication OR take regular cold showers for example, your BMR increases and you burn more in a rest and digest state. The contrary is also true by doing things such as eating a lot of junk food, not getting proper exercise, and being chronically stressed for example. Your current weight and diet also heavily influences your BMR, this is why you start getting less hungry over time when dieting and eating less. Your body literally adapts to the fact that it gets less food, and so it reserves it’s energy on the digestive side of things. This makes it so that your BMR drops because you are signalling your body that you’re starving. Essentially what it does is it’s making you starve slower because your body cannot know that you’re losing weight willingly and controlled. The contrary is also true with eating a lot of calories, your body gets more energy it needs to maintain itself and so it speeds up metabolism because it needs to get rid of the extra’s. This only goes so far as the rest of the calories is stored as fat, only for your body to have reserves for when you’re starving. The body is really build around surviving, it’s crazy stuff.

But discard all that I’ve said regarding BMR for now, because it’s advanced stuff that you can get into after a while. You first need to understand that you can increase what you burn by exercising! Your BMR is what you burn when resting, but what you burn outside of resting also counts towards your whole weight loss process of course. So, for example when taken an average man with a healthy weight, their BMR might be 1700, they have moderate daily activity without exercise and burn an extra 800 calories. This makes it so that your burned calories a day are 2500, so if you eat 2500 calories a day you maintain that weight. But, if you add exercise on top of that and burn say 500 extra calories doing cardio a day, you now burn 3000 calories but consume 2500 leaving you in a daily 500 caloric deficit. Now you lose weight.

The other side of the coin is that people really underestimate how much calories is in what, and a lot of people just refuse to count calories because it’s such a hassle. This is just plain bs in my opinion, especially nowadays when there is so many apps you can use that do just that for you, where you only have to insert what you consumed. I did this at the start of my journey for 6 months and ever since never counted my calories again because I now know roughly what I consume and am not losing weight anymore, so it’s an investment really. You can also just look at the packages and see how much calories is in there.

Sugary drinks back in the day were killing me and I didn’t even realise how much calories were in there, these days I never consume any drinks anymore containing high sugar or caloric content besides drinking alcohol on the weekends occasionally (which is also something you’ll have to watch when losing weight btw).

Once you get into a flow of what works after a few weeks, just stick with it. See what works for you, adjust to an extend that it’s manageable for you and it doesn’t feel dreadful everyday. Wanna eat a pizza once a week or having a few beers with friends on the weekends? That’s okay, just don’t go overboard and compensate for those calories. If you are in a caloric deficit of 500cal a day, your weekly deficit will be 3500cal, if you consume a 1000cal above your maintenance on the weekends, you’ll ultimately still lose weight. But you can’t just get away with not counting your calories at the start of your journey for even a day. Food and drinks are so calorie dense these days that 4000cal will feel like 1000cal, especially with junk food containing high amounts of processed sugar, hence keeping you hungry.

Then there is healthy eating, which is a completely different topic on itself. However, you can make your life so much easier by eating the right things. Eat foods with high volume, such as chicken breast, broccoli and potatoes. And avoid food that are high in processed sugar such as, well, you know. You’ll feel less hungry and will not feel as though you’re starving.

Some interesting things that might help you on your journey aswel:

1. Weightlifting increases your BMR the days after by keeping your body working. When you train hard enough your muscles will be torn and they’ll rebuild themselves over the course of the coming days, this costs energy and so it increases your BMR. It’s also necessary because our bodies tend to want to burn muscle first before fat if it’s not being used, if it is used however that dynamic changes and you’ll lose muscle way slower than otherwise, sometimes you can even gain muscle in a caloric deficit if you are new to weightlifting, have a minimal deficit of say 200cal and eat proper protein. This is also referred to as a body recomposition.

2. For multiple reasons also mentioned above, eat plenty of protein. It takes care of hunger and keeps you full and it also gives your muscles the resources to maintain and rebuild themselves. Aim to eat around 1g per pound of body weight a day of protein as a rule of thumb.

3. Carbs are NOT your enemy, refined sugar is. Carbs are an excellent source of energy that in my opinion your body needs in order to function properly. There is a huge difference between complex carbs and refined carbs. Complex carbs don’t spike your blood sugar, leading to stable energy levels throughout the day and no highs and lows often experienced by people who eat highly processed food diets. Especially when doing cardio, carbs will be needed. Your body needs fuel, but it needs REAL fuel.

There is so much more and I’m so into this topic, but for now I think these are the main pillars for weight loss. I’m sorry if it’s a bit much, but I wished someone would’ve layed this all out for me when I first started out. Hope this helps in any way and if you have questions let me know!

I now technically have two months 'experience' in working at a chicken shop and as a piano teacher, (as well as experience at a coffee shop a few years earlier); however my actual alotted work is few and far between. I think I'm being laid off from the chicken shop to be honest. The piano teaching job supposedly will pick up after the school term starts, but I'm unsure. Not having my AMusA is making it a lot harder, and also makes moving out a lot less viable for me. Most I do otherwise is a little grunt work for my mom's small finance company (Which currently could go under in this market; we're already looking a bit dire). 

I know that was all just a vent, but yeah I guess I wanted to establish context. I don't know what I should be doing. Is it important for my future career in psychology, whether I choose management or clinical or educational or whatnot, that I have lots of work experience now? Money is only slightly an issue; I do want to move out eventually though, as my family more often than not feeds into my poor mental state. And even then, what do I do? Like is a lack of employment experience going to just feed into itself? I know, yes, I'm privileged. Australia's standards of living are great. I shouldn't be complaining. But I feel empty.

I'm visiting Duke today (July 11st) with my family and would love to meet with a current undergraduate psychology student to chat about the psychology department and program. I'm especially interested in hearing about your experiences, what you think makes Duke's psychology program unique, and any advice you have for prospective students.

If you happen to speak some Chinese, that would be a bonus, as my parents would love to understand more about the conversation as well.

I'm happy to grab a coffee with you—my treat! Or, if you prefer, I'm also open to compensating you for your time.

1lx4a79,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx4a79,Biotech Stocks Set for Bull-Market Boom✅,"TWEEDLE TIMES—The biotech boom appears to be well underway after a three-year sabbatical. Biotech has been out of favor since its massive crash in June 2022, when investors like Cathie Wood lost as much as 90% in the sector.

Wood returned to the space this week with a $13.9 million bet on high-stakes/gene-editing biotech company, Beam Therapeutics (BEAM).

The IBB iShares Biotechnology ETF shows promise as a clear uptrend is now visible. But the rally could meet headwinds due to a 200% tariff tantrum targeting offshore manufacturing.

Luckily for CountryDumbs, aTyr Pharma is a Paul Schimmel company whose manufacturing base is in North Carolina, shielding it from any direct geopolitical tariff blowback.

Other macro concerns for the market are the escalating trade war, including a 35% tariff threat on Canada, 50% tariffs on copper and Brazilian goods (like coffee), and the possibility of 15-20% blanket tariffs across the globe.

The war in Ukraine shows no sign of cooling, and in the Middle East, Houthi rebels continue to target commercial ships in the Red Sea.

The group sunk two earlier this week.

Still, despite growing geopolitical concerns at home and abroad, inflation remains contained, interest rates and unemployment claims are stable, and bitcoin is making all-time highs—surging to more than $118,000.

Wall Street is closely eyeing the latest trade developments, but so far, investors have discounted any threats to the market as political theater.

“We’ve been climbing a wall of worry….” Wood said. “But these are the kinds of bull markets that I think are the most durable. When the market climbs through all of that controversy, it’s really signaling something.”

When I told Daxon Sterling I wanted to break up, he was still fiddling with his camera, taking photos of me.

""Just because I posted her on my Instagram?""

""Yeah.""

He squinted through the viewfinder, smiling as he asked:

""How long this time? A week or two? Don't drag it out too long, or I might actually forget about you.""

Eleven years of knowing each other, and he didn't believe for a second that I'd actually leave him.

But this time, I'd really made up my mind.

So, when he was assuming I'd go to NYU with him, I chose somewhere as far away as possible—Stanford University.

From here on out, we were to live completely separate lives, never crossing paths again.

...

In the coffee shop, the camera shutter clicked crisply. Daxon looked down at the screen, checking the shot he'd just taken of me, and chuckled softly.

""I'm gonna use these photos at our wedding someday. Already got the album title picked out: 'My Hot-Tempered Wife Who Broke Up with Me a Hundred Times.'""

I kept my face stone-cold, not in the mood for his jokes.

""Ugh, why can't I ever capture that vibe when I shoot you? The other day I casually snapped a few pics of Aria and they looked like magazine covers.""

He clearly wasn't taking my breakup seriously.

""I'm being serious this time.""

He looked up at me, the smile fading from his face.

""You're really gonna break up with me just because I posted her on Instagram? Come on, Skylar, isn't that a bit much?""

""No, it's not.""

Of course it wasn't too much.

Daxon had used the $3,000 Canon R6 I'd bought him to shoot graduation photos for our classmates, then posted them on Instagram—a whole carousel of nothing but Aria's close-ups.

Everyone was gushing about how he'd captured Aria looking so pure and ethereal, and he even hyped up her ""unique aura"" in the comments.

My photos? He didn't save a single raw file.

All because he thought I didn't have good camera presence, that I couldn't produce any standout shots.

""Okay, jealous much? How about I take a bunch more of you and post those on my Instagram too?""

His tone was like he was pacifying some unreasonable kid.

I took a deep breath.

""You don't get it. I don't want your Instagram posts.""

""Got it, got it. Look, I'll delete the post, okay? Problem solved?""

I shook my head, done with his whole ""playing dumb"" act.

""You're deleting the post? Could you maybe send me the raw files first?"" Aria had appeared out of nowhere at our coffee shop table, sliding into the seat next to us without even asking.

She immediately picked up on the weird tension and asked, ""What's wrong? Daxon, did you piss off Skylar again?""

Daxon pursed his lips but didn't say anything.

Aria jumped right into damage control mode.

""Skylar, don't be mad at him. It's totally my fault—I was the one who asked Daxon to take extra shots of me that day. I haven't had a proper photo shoot in forever.""

She tugged at Daxon's sleeve.

""You know what? Keep the raw files. Delete the Instagram post too, dude. No point in upsetting your girlfriend over something this small.""

I let out a bitter laugh. ""Something small? Having my boyfriend photograph you is small? Using matching phone cases with my boyfriend is small? Sneaking around and changing my boyfriend's wallpaper to your photo is also small? Aria, I seriously don't get it—how is it that every single 'small thing' that pisses me off has you right in the middle of it?""

""Since you're so into my boyfriend, he's all yours.""

Aria bit her lip, tears welling up in her eyes.

""I'm sorry,"" she said, reluctantly taking off her phone case. ""You're misunderstanding Daxon. We're really not what you think. I don't have parents anymore, no family left. Daxon's family is all I have.""

She set down the phone case as tears started streaming down her face.

Daxon shot me a reproachful look.

""If you've got beef with me, take it up with me. She didn't do anything wrong. Why are you taking it out on her?""

Looking at him pick up the phone case and stuff it back into Aria's hands, even reluctantly giving her hand a little squeeze—

I suddenly felt completely over it all.

Chapter 2

I got up and left the coffee shop. I didn't want to stick around and listen to Daxon comfort her.

Never thought there'd come a day when even our breakup would feel this half-assed.

That night, friends had organized a murder mystery game. I didn't want to make things awkward for everyone because of the breakup, so I sucked it up and went.

When I got to the door, I was a few minutes late. I could hear my friends inside complaining about me.

""Is Skylar gonna bail because she's pissed again? What did you guys even fight about this time?""

""Same old thing—that Instagram post.""

Someone laughed dismissively. ""She's seriously mad about that? You're president of the photography club at our school. What's the big deal about taking some photos and posting them? Skylar's being way too petty.""

""Right? Last time we played murder mystery, Daxon got paired with someone else for the couple's storyline and she got so pissed we couldn't even finish the game.""

""If I were looking for a girlfriend, I'd want someone sweet and chill, not someone who's always blowing up. Like, Aria's perfect.""

Daxon sighed.

""Can't help it, that's just how she is. Guess I've been spoiling her too much.""

Someone laughed. ""You keep spoiling her like that, and she'll get so bratty no one else will want her. Then she'll be stuck with you forever. Let's see how you handle that.""

A soft, gentle voice drifted from inside the room.

""Skylar's so lucky though. If someone pampered me like that, I'd never want to fight with them.""

So Aria was there too.

Daxon's friends immediately started egging them on. ""Well then, let's give you two the couple's storyline tonight.""

""Really? Can I pick one where Daxon confesses to me and we have all those cute interactions?"" she asked playfully.

Then I heard Daxon respond with a laugh in his voice.

""Alright!""

Then Daxon warned everyone:

""You guys better not go blabbing about this, or my little jealousy queen will throw another fit.""

I let go of the door handle and walked away.

The laughter from the room behind me sounded so sharp and piercing.

Daxon knew perfectly well that I had a problem with him playing romantic storylines with other girls.

He'd pay lip service to worrying about me getting mad, but he never actually turned other girls down. Simply because he was dead certain that no matter how angry I got, I'd never actually break up with him.

This time though, he was wrong.

That night, Aria posted on Instagram.

\[First time playing murder mystery—turns out growing old together is such a romantic thing. Thanks for healing me tonight with just one evening. I used to think there was nothing left in this world worth living for, but now I have a dream I want to chase.\]

The photo was a group shot—in an inconspicuous corner, two hands were interlocked.

I scrolled through the screen and saw Daxon's comment.

\[Don't be so pessimistic. There's still so much beauty in this world waiting for us.\]

I locked my phone and knocked on my dad's office door.

""Dad, I want to apply to Stanford University.""

He stopped working, closed his laptop, and gestured for me to sit down and talk.

""What made you suddenly change your mind? I thought you were set on going to NYU with that Sterling boy.""

""Dad, isn't your firm expanding to Palo Alto? I want to be closer to you. Also, I really love beaches there.""

Dad could see the disappointment written all over my face, but he didn't call me out on it.

""I support you completely. Putting your future first is never wrong. I was actually worried about you being so far from me for the first time in your life—wasn't sure I could handle it. Now I'm totally at peace with it.""

Looking at my dad's adoring expression, I knew I was making the right choice.

Chapter 3

The day after SATs results came out, I submitted my application online and quickly got an interview notification for the end of the month.

It wasn't until I got the text reminder that I remembered I'd bought tickets to the Daido Moriyama photography exhibition—Daxon's favorite photographer.

He hadn't managed to snag tickets when they went on sale, so I'd quietly bought two at marked-up prices online.

I'd planned to surprise him after graduation, but now there was no point.

So I took a photo and posted on Instagram: \[One ticket to give away, first come first serve.\]

An avatar I'd never talked to before popped up.

""These tickets were so hard to get! Could I have it?""

It took me a while to remember that it was Kieran Wilde from Daxon's photography club. He had a great physique and was always being used as a model by the club members.

An hour later, I met Kieran in person at the exhibition entrance—he was really tall, with deep brown eyes and curly hair, looking pretty sweet.

Several girls walking by kept turning back to look at him, some clearly working up the courage to ask for his number.

He didn't talk much, but when he encountered pieces he liked, he couldn't help sharing insights about Moriyama's style and the background of various works.",1,1752232833.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Today, i get up at 11:45 am spitting on my bed.it's so funny becoz in my dream,i swallowed something disgusting by accident (i don't remember what it is) and i'm spitting in my dream. But what happened is i'm really spitting in real life.Maybe it's becoz dream is too real for me.And then i ate my breakfast and taught my cousin GED Science.She's ill and can't respond what i was teaching very well.So i only taught for an hour. She told me she wants to eat sandwich but doesn't have money so i give pocket money through kpay. I don't have kpay account .so i created a kpay account. What's strange is i reach Kpay level 2 immediately.Mostly,it takes one day or two days to reach level 2. After creating a kpay acc,i drink coffee. Usually i don't drink coffee in the evening but when i saw my father drinking coffee, i can't resist the urge to drink coffee.but i don't have sugar so i went outside to buy sugar. I saw water level is increasing in some areas. Some villages near my home are experiencing river flood right now but it's not something serious or dangerous becoz water level is only around 2 to 3 inches right now(but it can vary a little based on areas)
It's still rising .So water can reach my home after one week.I bought sugar and return home and in my way back,i saw the man who helps me two days ago. He doesn't recognize me at first. After 3 seconds looking my face, he remembered me.Two days ago, I went Kyaw Ywa village and my motorcycle ran out of fuel.

Satoshi Would’ve Abandoned Bitcoin in 2025 And Here’s the Proof No One Dares Talk About

Let’s talk honestly about what happened to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Isn’t Freedom Anymore It’s a Rigged Game for Billionaires (And You’re the Exit Liquidity)

Bitcoin was never supposed to end up like this. I’ve been around long enough to remember what it was like when Satoshi was still posting when Bitcoin was about decentralization, freedom from institutions, and peer-to-peer money for the people.

Now? It’s been captured. And you need to see the truth.

Satoshi left in 2010–2011, right as the network started attracting press, power, and politics. He made it clear that trust was the enemy:

> ""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required."" – Satoshi

He feared centralization of mining, dev control, and middlemen creeping back in. And it happened anyway.

Let’s look at where Bitcoin is now in 2025:

- **Fees are sky-high**. Basic transactions can cost $10–$30 or more during congestion.
- **Throughput is stuck at 7 transactions per second** — slower than a dial-up modem in the age of AI.
- Core developers REFUSED to scale Bitcoin’s base layer. They shut down any proposal for bigger blocks or higher throughput in 2017 during the block size war.
- The result? Bitcoin got locked into permanent scarcity — but not in a good way. It’s now so expensive and slow that it’s unusable as money.
- So they pushed everyone to the Lightning Network — an off-chain system that’s now dominated by a few custodial hubs.

If you use Lightning today, chances are you’re trusting a middleman — a company like Strike or Wallet of Satoshi — to hold and route your funds. That’s not peer-to-peer. That’s PayPal with extra steps.

> Bitcoin is no longer what Satoshi envisioned. He wanted *trustless money*, not a coin that requires centralized apps to function.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin is being absorbed by the same institutions it was meant to disrupt:

- BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard now control massive BTC exposure through ETFs
- MicroStrategy owns 1%+ of all BTC
- The US government holds 200k+ BTC from seizures

This isn’t people’s money anymore. It’s become **an elite store of value**, hoarded by the rich, inaccessible to the average person for everyday use.

If you think Bitcoin’s future is about freedom — ask yourself this: when was the last time you bought coffee with BTC?

You didn’t. Because the fees are too high and the settlement is too slow. And unless you’re using a custodial Lightning wallet, it’s too complicated for 99% of people.

Let me be clear:

✅ Bitcoin might survive as a **digital reserve asset** for institutions and governments.  
❌ But it will NEVER become global money for the people unless the protocol changes — and devs refuse to do that.  

It’s already become the exact thing Bitcoin OGs were warning about in 2012.

Satoshi would never have supported this version of Bitcoin, not when it’s slower than Ethereum, less scalable than Solana, more centralized than XRP’s validator list, and controlled by Wall Street.

Bitcoin today is a beautiful lie. And unless you face it, you’re just a holder of a digital gold coin built for billionaires, not people.

Ask the hard question: **What if Bitcoin never fulfills its promise — because it was intentionally held back?**

The Truth Bitcoin Maxis Can’t Admit is XRP Is Closer to Satoshi’s Vision Than BTC Ever Will Be.",1,1752232686.0,NextCryptoMoonshots,0,1.0,False

The last time we argued, I stormed out during a downpour, furious and reckless. I ended up falling into a river, and when I woke up, my memory was a mess.

At the hospital, he looked relieved—like a weight had finally been lifted. He pointed casually at a terminally ill patient and said, “That’s your real brother.

“Get it straight. Don’t bother me again.”

The pale-faced man walked over, gently stroked my head, and said softly, “Come on, I’ll take you home.”

After that, I went to great lengths to save this so-called “brother.” I braved a snowstorm to find a specialist, stayed up countless nights to watch over him.

I even risked my own life for him.

Then, one day, my real brother stood in the freezing snow and blocked my path, his voice shaking in panic.

“You really… don’t remember me?”

The doctors had warned of memory confusion. I’d just woken up in the hospital.

Falling from such a height into the river had given me a severe concussion. I’d been in a coma for over two weeks.

Two weeks ago, I had a huge fight with my brother, Charley Lyons.

Right before slamming the door behind me, I shouted, “I’d rather die than have you clean up after me!”

His face twisted in fury, and behind me I heard his cold, mocking laugh.

“Then I hope you get your wish.”

But now, two weeks had passed-and I was still alive.

When I opened my eyes, the soft winter sunlight streamed through the hospital window.

It took a while for my vision to clear, and then I started to hear things.

Outside the room, I could make out the voices of the doctor and Charley.

“Trauma to the head, extended coma-

“memory loss or confusion is very likely,” the doctor said.

“It’s not just about forgetting friends and family. In some cases, they forget who they are entirely…”

I forced myself out of bed, wanting to explain that my memory was fine.

I hated hospitals.

I didn’t want this diagnosis to become another reason to keep me trapped here.

Just as I reached the door, I heard Charley’s low voice.

There was something in it-cold, yes, but also strangely pleased.

“This might actually be for the best,” he said.

As if trying to prove the doctor’s point, he added, “She woke up briefly last night, looked at me, and asked who I was.”

He wasn’t lying. I vaguely remembered that moment.

But I’d only asked because I wasn’t fully conscious, and everything had been a blur-I couldn’t even make out his face.

My hand froze on the doorknob.

The doctor tried to offer reassurance.

“There’s no need to jump to conclusions. We’ll know more once your sister wakes up.

“And even if there is memory loss, we can work on recovery…”

But Charley cut him off.

“No. It’s better if she forgets. Don’t try to bring it back.”

I could even hear the trace of joy he didn’t bother to hide.

So that’s what he really wanted? For me to forget him?

After everything… after all the fights since Mom and Dad passed… he’s the only family I have left.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

But now that I’d survived, I just wanted one more chance to talk to him.

I pulled open the door.

Our eyes met-his filled with surprise, then quickly turning cold and distant.

I’d been unconscious too long.

When I spoke, my voice was hoarse, “I actually…”

Charley’s brows knit together, disbelief flashing across his face.

But then, almost like trying to convince himself, he made up his mind.

He assumed I was confused-mistaking someone else for him.

In the hallway, people came and went, oblivious.

It was like he couldn’t wait to get rid of me. Without even looking, Charley reached out, pointed randomly at a patient walking by, and said, “That’s your brother.”

For a moment, I thought I must have misheard him.

I stared at him, stunned. “What?”

Something flickered in his eyes-hesitation, maybe even guilt-but it vanished almost instantly.

We’d been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how much he hated or resented me, I couldn’t believe he’d push me toward a total stranger while I was still bruised, broken, and barely back on my feet.

Right then, I thought-maybe we really needed to talk. Really talk.

I opened my mouth, ready to put the bitterness behind me.

But he cut in again, his tone sharp and final, “I said, that’s your brother.

“Don’t call the wrong person again. And stop coming to me.”

This time, he’d made up his mind.

When he motioned again to the man who had stopped nearby, his face showed no trace of doubt-just cold determination.

The doctor had already slipped away, probably not wanting to get involved.

People flowed through the hallway, slowing down to glance at me-curious, uncomfortable.

To them, I probably looked like a girl who’d gone off the deep end after nearly drowning-so out of it I couldn’t even recognize my own brother.

The man Charley pointed to stood quietly across the hall, leaning against the wall.

Tall, well-built, with striking features-but pale. Deathly pale.

Anyone else would’ve been angry to be dragged into something like this.

But he wasn’t. He simply looked at Charley, then at me. Calm. Silent.

Like he was waiting to see what would happen next.

Charley spoke again, voice colder than ever, “I’m just a friend of your brother’s. I came to check in out of politeness.

“If you want to talk to him, go find him yourself. Whether he accepts you or not-that’s up to you two.”

And with that, he turned and walked down the hall, never looking back.

My hand, hanging at my side, started to tremble.

I kept telling myself-it’s fine. He’s hated me for years. This shouldn’t be a surprise.

So what if I lost a brother who never wanted me? It’s not like we ever really got along anyway.

But my eyes still burned, and I couldn’t stop the tears from rising.

Shock. Shame. Anger. Frustration.

The emotions crashed into each other until I couldn’t even form a single word.

I watched him walk away, the world tilting slightly as I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself.

A loud ringing filled my ears. For a long time, I couldn’t pull myself back together.

Then, the man who had been silently watching finally moved.

He let go of the wall and slowly walked toward me.

For a second, I thought he might come over and scold me-accuse me of faking, of making a scene.

Now that Charley had left, I was the only one left to blame.

I instinctively tried to take a step back.

But maybe I’d been in bed too long. Maybe my emotions had drained every last bit of strength.

My body didn’t move.

Then, before I could even process what was happening-

A hand gently landed on my head.

At first, it felt almost like a scolding tap-but there was no force behind it.

Just a soft, almost tentative touch. A pat.

It was a long moment before he finally spoke.

His voice was tired, but gentle. “Come on. Let’s go. I’ll take you home.”

How many years had it been since Charley last called himself my brother?

Too long. So long I’d forgotten what it felt like.

I looked up at him, dazed.

We’d been fighting for years.

Ever since our parents died.

Maybe I really had gone crazy.

Because I stared at this complete stranger-a man I’d never seen before in my life-and still, I nodded.

“Okay.”  
Chapter 2

I followed a stranger back to a home I’d never seen before.

The place was spotless-so clean, it felt cold. Lifeless.

Not a speck of dust anywhere. No signs of anyone actually living there.

It reminded me of him-his pale, expressionless face. Too still. Too quiet.

Years ago, a place like this might’ve scared me. But now, life or death didn’t matter much to me anymore. There was nothing left that I’m afraid of.

I glanced around the room. On the coffee table were several small white pill bottles. I recognized them instantly-they were the same kind I’d once tried to collect.

But doctors were always cautious.

No matter what excuse I gave-stress, insomnia, anxiety-they never gave me more than a few at a time.

I’d spent six months saving them up and still barely managed to get a dozen.

Now, looking at all those full bottles, I almost laughed.

And surprisingly, I felt a flicker of envy.

That many pills… more than enough to die.

Next to the bottles sat a photo.

It was strange-black and white, about a foot wide.

The man in the picture looked straight into the camera. Calm. Blank. Completely emotionless.

It stood out so much I couldn’t help but stare.

Then I glanced at the man standing beside me-his face practically a mirror of the one in the photo. Same expression. Same stillness.

Even after he saw me notice the pills and the photo, his face didn’t change.

Without a word, he calmly walked over, gathered them up, and tucked everything into a drawer.

Then he turned to me and said gently, “Sit down. I’ll make you something to eat.”

So he really believed it. He thought my head was so messed up I couldn’t even recognize my own brother.

That thought pulled me back to reality.

Lying to someone already standing on the edge-it didn’t sit right with me.

I wanted to tell him the truth. Then leave.

But the image of that photo, those pills… they stayed with me.

And suddenly, I was curious. What had he been through that pushed him so close to the edge? Just like me?

Where did he even get that many pills?

Before I knew it, I’d sat down.

He went into the kitchen. Said he was going to cook. But for a long time, I didn’t hear a thing.

I got up and walked to the kitchen door.

He was standing there, staring blankly into the open fridge.

It was as empty as the rest of the apartment.

Not a single ingredient. Not even a bottle of water.

Clearly, no one had cooked here in a long time.

The stovetop was bare-no pots or pans, just a single ceramic jar. The kind used for boiling medicine.

He stood there for a while before finally snapping out of it.

He shut the fridge and turned to look at me.

His voice was soft, almost apologetic. “Sorry. I forgot to buy groceries. I’ll go out and get something.”

Over the years, I’d looked at myself in the mirror and thought, I’m alive, but I don’t feel it. Like I’ve become some hollow soul, floating outside my own body.

But standing there in that kitchen, I realized-

There was someone else out there who looked even more like the dead than I did.

He walked past me and headed toward the door.

And I realized-I couldn’t hear his footsteps. Couldn’t even hear him breathe.

It suddenly occurred to me-maybe this stranger, someone I’d just met today, wasn’t planning on coming back.

Just like that night… after my fight with Charley. When I fell into the river.

Charley and the doctors had both insisted it was an accident-that the rain was too heavy, the bridge too slick.

That I’d slipped.

But I knew better.

He was already at the entryway, hand on the door, just about to step out.

I looked at his back and said, without thinking, “I like fish.”

He froze.

Stiffened slightly, then slowly turned to face me.

His expression unchanged-calm, pale, unreadable. “What?” he asked.

I met his gaze and repeated, “I said, I want fish.

“For dinner. Can you make that for me?”

The front door was still ajar.

Cold wind blew in-late autumn, almost winter.

It rushed through the apartment, tugging at the hem of his coat and messing up his already disheveled hair.

Against the wind, his face looked even more bloodless. Almost ghost-like.

His fingers, hanging by his side, gave the slightest twitch.

After a long pause, he nodded. “Okay.”

I watched him walk out. The door clicked shut behind him.

Maybe just maybe-he’d actually come back.

The thought made me laugh at myself.

I was someone who’d been ready to end it all.

And yet here I was… worrying about whether a stranger might not return.

I sank back into the couch and closed my eyes. The same images came rushing back.

My parents-who should’ve been alive and well-crushed beneath the rubble.

And me, pulled out alive, surviving by stepping over the lives of the two people who loved me most.

The scene shifted-Charley’s face filled with rage, his voice sharp and bitter.

“Erma, you’re the one who should’ve died. That would’ve been justice.”

“After all these years, do you really sleep with a clear conscience?”

No. I didn’t.

That was why I hadn’t had a single night of real rest in years.

I slipped into a nightmare again-and it took a while to drag myself back out.

When I opened my eyes, they landed on the closed drawer beneath the coffee table.

My hand moved before I could think. I slid the drawer open, reached inside, and pulled out the pill bottles.

I’d never stolen anything in my life. The moment my fingers closed around one of them, my palms were instantly damp with sweat.

But I’d done my homework. I knew the dosage.

If I took half and left the rest for him-well, that’d be enough for both of us to disappear.

My thoughts were hazy. I told myself this was reasonable. Fair.

My fingers trembled as I unscrewed the cap of the first bottle.

Then, out of nowhere, the phone on the coffee table rang.

The sound tore through the silence like a gunshot.

I jumped, nearly dropping the bottle.

My heart thudded.

Csiltily, I set the pills down and grabbed the phone.

I hit ‘Answer” before realizing-it wasn’t mine.

He must’ve forgotten it when he left.

The call connected.

And immediately, a furious voice exploded through the line.

“Listen to me, Nolan-over 200 million dollars! You really think you can walk away without giving me a dime? Not a chance!

“I might not have raised you, but I sure as hell gave birth to you!

“That little sister of yours died for you-and as your father. I have every right to inherit from a dying son!

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever feel like you’re on a never-ending treadmill of hustle, running faster and faster but not really getting anywhere? I totally get it—there’s a badge of honor in grinding hard, right? But here’s a plot twist: **what if doing less could actually lead to more?** 

Let me share a story about a high-performance coach I know (let’s call her Coach Lisa). A few months back, she pulled the ultimate “I'm done” move and stopped hustling. Like, actually. Here’s how she reclaimed **20 hours a week** and increased her productivity without burning out. 

**1. The Power of Saying NO**  
This one’s HUGE. Coach Lisa started saying no to everything that didn’t align with her goals. It might sting at first—like saying no to that extra project or social outing—but it created so much space for what really mattered.  
- 🔑 **Tip**: Consider your priorities. What can you say no to this week?

**2. Time Blocking Like a Boss**  
Instead of trying to fit everything into the day, she began blocking out time for specific tasks. It’s like scheduling a date with productivity!  
- 🗓️ Take a good look at your week. What are your “non-negotiable” blocks of time?  
- **Bonus**: Include breaks! They’re not just for snacks; they’re for recharging those brain batteries.

**3. Ditching the 'Always-On' Mentality**  
Coaching is demanding, but Coach Lisa learned that being “always on” doesn’t equal effectiveness. She started practicing mindfulness and found herself actually more focused when she returned to work. Crazy, right?  
- ⏳ Experiment with short meditation sessions or simply take a walk to clear your head. How much better do you feel afterward? 

**4. Embracing Imperfection**  
Let’s be real: striving for perfection is exhausting. Coach Lisa started focusing on progress rather than perfection.  
- 🌟 Do you have projects you’ve been putting off because they aren’t “perfect”? What if you just hit submit and moved on? 

**How About You?**  
I mean, who knew that stepping back could lead to stepping up? Coach Lisa reclaimed those 20 hours and used them for things she loved—like reading more books, cooking, and even trying the latest coffee shop in town! ☕ Imagine what you could do with that time. 

Maybe it's time to rethink what hustling means? Is it about quantity of work or quality of life? 🤔

1lx447m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lx447m,"✨ What To Do After a Tarot Reading, 5 Tips for Integration & Reflection ✨","So you've just had a reading maybe it brought clarity, maybe it cracked something open emotionally, or maybe you're still sitting with some big energy. Either way, here are some gentle suggestions for how to make the most of the messages that came through.

📝 1. Journal what has stuck with you
I really see tarot as a form of spiritual therapy. If your session was full of insight, truth, or things spirit needs you to work on, it's in your best interest to write it down. What stood out? What stung a little? What felt like confirmation? Even just scribbling a few keywords can help you track your growth later on.

🌿 2. Let the message sit with you
Don't rush to ""figure it all out."" Instead, take a few days to internalize the reading. Often, the bigger “aha!” moments come after the reading when you're walking, in the shower, mid-conversation, or when you least expect it. Let spirit speak to you softly, in layers.

🕯️ 3. Take one inspired action
You don’t need to overhaul your whole life after a reading but what’s one small thing you can do to honor the message? Maybe it’s setting a boundary, reaching out to someone, lighting a candle with intention, or simply resting. Action makes energy real.

💌 4. Revisit the reading later
Especially with voice notes or written readings, going back after a week or two can be powerful. Things that felt fuzzy might suddenly click. You’ll hear things you missed the first time and it reminds you how spirit speaks in layers, not all at once.

🔮 5. Be open to synchronicity
After a reading, your awareness is heightened. Pay attention to signs, numbers, dreams, random song lyrics, or things people say in passing. Spirit loves to confirm and expand on what was said through symbols in your everyday life.

# Chapter 1 Leaving

On the other end of the line, Victor Powell's father, Albert Powell, asked, ""Seri, are you sure you want to terminate the agreement and divorce Victor?""

Serena Powell held her phone calmly. ""I'm sure.""

""Even if Leon's custody goes to the Powell family, you're still leaving?""

""Yes. I believe Leon would rather stay with his dad. The Powell family can give him the best education. He doesn't need me anymore.""

Albert's voice was low. ""Alright. As for the divorce agreement, you can talk to Victor yourself.""

""Okay,"" Serena replied.

Albert didn't hang up right away. ""To be honest, I've been satisfied with how Victor's been these past few years with you around.

""So, as a reward, I'll arrange for you to join the design team in Glonia you've always wanted. In a week at most, you'll be out of the Powell family.""

Serena thought, 'A reward? Rich people really do live in a different universe. In their world, even feelings come with a price tag.'

She agreed. After she hung up, her phone screen was still frozen on a recent Instagram post from her husband, Victor.

Victor had been posting bits and pieces of his daily life for over a month now, but this was the first time Serena had seen them. He had never accepted her friend request on his private account—until now.

In the newest video, their son Leon Powell was playing happily with another kid around his age. The ironic part was, everyone in the comments thought Serena was the one who filmed it.

Someone commented: \[Your wife's really good with the camera. Your son looks so happy.\]

Victor's reply stood out like a slap: \[Yeah.\]

Serena thought, 'Yeah? Is he praising Eliza Stone, his childhood sweetheart, for her camera work, or is he just letting people assume she's his wife now?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Serena grew up in an orphanage. Seven years ago, when she was still in college, Albert suddenly approached her and offered her three million dollars—to buy seven years of her life.

To pay for surgery for the orphanage director who had been kind to her, Serena reluctantly agreed.

Back then, she had already heard the story of Victor and Eliza. Both of them came from powerful families, grew up together as childhood sweethearts, and were deeply in love. But the year they graduated college, Eliza suddenly vanished without a trace.

When Victor found out Eliza had gone abroad for an arranged marriage, he completely lost it. He started drinking, smoking, and pushing himself to the edge, spiraling into serious psychological issues.

The psychiatrist once said only emotional healing could cure a wounded heart.

To save his nearly deranged son, Albert found Serena, who looked strikingly similar to Eliza, and had her care for Victor to heal his emotional wounds.

From then on, Serena began to get close to Victor on purpose, relentlessly pursuing him. She had that rare mix of innocence and allure. And with a face that looked just enough like Eliza's, she made sure to stay in Victor's sight every single day.

When he was down, she would cheer him up. When he got sick, she stayed up all night to look after him. And when his depression hit, she was the only one who ever reached into the darkness and pulled him back.

With time, Victor gradually got used to having Serena around.

Until one day, Serena caught him in the middle of a breakdown, about to slit his wrists. She grabbed the sharp blade with her bare hand and forced it out of his grip.

Her hand was sliced open, the cut deep and long, bleeding uncontrollably. The doctor said if it'd gone any deeper, she would've lost the use of her hand. Because the wound was so severe, even after it healed, a jagged scar remained across her palm.

That was the first time Victor hugged her. ""Seri, let's get married. Okay? Let's go to city hall tomorrow,"" he said.

Serena stood frozen, thinking it was her sincerity that had moved him. But later, when she found Eliza's wedding invitation tucked in a drawer, she realized it had all happened on Eliza's wedding day.

Less than two years after they got married, Serena gave birth to Leon. During those two years, Victor wasn't particularly affectionate, but he treated her with respect. Also, Leon was very close to her—he clung to her more than he did to Victor.

Serena had feelings, after all. She had already come to see this place as her home. She loved both Victor and Leon deeply. It wasn't about the black-and-white contract anymore. She truly wanted to be with them for the rest of her life.

So for the sake of her family, Serena gave up her dream of being an accomplished designer and became a full-time housewife.

During the day, she cleaned the house. At noon, she brought lunch to Victor. In the evening, after picking Leon up, she cooked dinner for him. At night, she still had to meet Victor's needs in bed.

She was like a machine that never stopped working year-round, quietly and tirelessly taking care of her husband and son for five straight years.

Serena used to think things would just continue like that. But a month ago, Eliza came back. She was divorced and brought her son with her.

When Victor found out, he rushed to the airport without an umbrella, ignoring the heavy rain. He could even forgive everything Eliza had done in the past, as if none of it mattered anymore.

He thought Serena didn't know. But she knew everything. Over the past week, Victor had grown more and more impatient with her. He started treating her like a servant, barking orders at her. Even Leon had become cold and harsh toward her.

Serena had argued with them and fought back, but they called her ungrateful and narrow-minded. Then, in the next moment, they gave all their tenderness to Eliza.

Serena only found out about this through Instagram. Ironically, Victor never posted on Instagram. Even back when they got married, he refused to let her announce it on the app, saying it was their private life and he didn't want outsiders to know.

But ever since Eliza came back, Victor's Instagram had been full of pictures of the four of them—him, Leon, Eliza, and her son. They all looked so warm and loving, as if they were the real family.

That was how Serena learned that when she was sick, Victor and Leon were out shopping with Eliza. When she was heartbroken, Victor and Leon were celebrating Eliza's birthday.

Even yesterday, on their wedding anniversary, Victor and Leon ignored the dinner Serena had spent the whole day preparing and walked out the door—just to be with Eliza. When Serena tried to stop them, they told her she was being dramatic.

Serena thought, 'I should've realized it a long time ago. There's no place for me in this family anymore. I actually believed I could move beyond that contract and stay with them forever—I was being delusional. It's time to wake up and leave.'

She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes with a cold hand.

Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from outside. Victor and Leon were back, the chill of the wind and rain still clinging to them as they came in.

""Seri, Leon fell and got hurt. Take care of his wound,"" Victor said, his voice low and steady, calm as always, automatically slipping into that usual commanding tone.

""I don't want her to do it. She never shuts up and nags the whole time."" Leon's brows were furrowed tightly, his face full of annoyance. ""I want Eliza to do it. I want to call Eliza.""

""The weather's too bad. Eliza can't make it,"" Victor answered, stepping inside indifferently, his voice flat. ""Be good. Let your mom handle it.""

""Okay, fine."" Leon looked disappointed and reluctant, his head drooping as he slumped onto the couch.

When he looked up and saw Serena still hadn't brought the first-aid kit over and was actually turning to walk away like she hadn't even heard them, his temper exploded. He shouted impatiently, ""Can you hurry up? What's with you today? So slow and annoying.""

# Chapter 2 Out Of Character

Serena turned to look at Leon, her eyes filled with coldness. ""That's how you talk to your own mother?"" she questioned.

Leon was startled by her reaction, completely thrown off. This was the first time Serena had ever spoken to him like that.

Even Victor paused and looked over, a trace of surprise in his eyes.

Leon shouted, ""What's your problem? You're the one who's standing there doing nothing. If it weren't raining and Eliza couldn't come, I wouldn't even need you—""

Serena cut in, ""Fine. Since you adore Eliza so much, then wait for her to take care of it.""

Leon froze, staring at Serena in disbelief as she walked away.

In the past, whenever he got hurt, Serena would panic, fuss over him, hug him, comfort him—but today was completely different. She just left.

Victor was a little surprised too, but didn't think much of it. He frowned at Leon and said, ""Leon, you need to learn how to handle difficulties in life without letting your emotions get the best of you.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the bathroom, Serena stared blankly at the toiletries on the sink.

For the past few years, neither Victor nor Leon had ever had to squeeze their own toothpaste. She always got up a few minutes earlier to adjust the water temperature just right and lay out all their toiletries ahead of time.

She still remembered one time when the water had been too hot, and Victor snapped at her, ""Can't you even get something this simple right?""

Serena looked away. After taking off her clothes, she turned on the shower and let the hot water pour down on her, as if it could wake her up, again and again.

After a long time, she finally turned off the water. The look in her eyes grew more and more resolute. From now on, her life would no longer revolve around her ungrateful husband and son. She was going to live for herself.

When she came out of the bathroom, Leon was in his room. Victor was sitting on the couch, watching that ""family"" video on his phone. The corners of his mouth lifted without him even realizing, a clear sign of how pleased he was.

Serena let out a mocking laugh and walked over to the drawer. She then pulled out the divorce agreement and walked toward Victor. ""Victor, let's get divorced.""

Victor kept his eyes on the video playing on his phone and mumbled, ""Okay.""

Serena placed the divorce papers on the table. ""I'll walk away with nothing. You can have full custody of Leon too.""

Victor was still staring at his phone, seemingly absorbed in the comments under that Instagram post.

""If you don't have any objections, just sign it,"" Serena said.

""Okay."" Victor took the pen Serena handed him. He paused for a second, just as a notification popped up on his phone. Without even glancing at the agreement, he signed his name on the agreement.

Serena asked, ""Victor, did you even hear what I just said to you?""

""What?"" Victor shot her an impatient look, tossed the pen on the table, and leaned back on the couch. ""Isn't it about buying insurance for Leon? Just buy it.""

Serena realized he really hadn't heard a word. All his attention was on his phone. Ever since Eliza came back, she had gotten used to him being like this.

Just then, Victor's phone started ringing. It was a call from Eliza. He quickly turned around and stepped out onto the balcony to answer it.

Serena looked at the signed divorce papers on the table and let out a cold snort.

All it would've taken was one glance—he would've seen it had nothing to do with insurance. But he didn't. His mind was filled with nothing but Eliza. He couldn't see anything else.

Serena put the divorce papers away and went back to the bedroom to pack her things.

Just then, the doorbell rang. When Serena opened the door, she was met with a delicate, innocent-looking face. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest.

It was Eliza. Even though Serena had only seen her profile in Victor's Instagram posts, she recognized Eliza instantly.

""You must be Mrs. Powell, right? Sorry to bother you this late,"" Eliza said. Standing next to her was her son, Oliver Stone, each of them holding a suitcase—one big, one small.

Serena remarked flatly, ""What do you need?""

""Is Victor home?"" Eliza asked.

""Yeah."" Almost the second he heard Eliza's voice, Victor rushed out from inside. ""I told you I'd pick you up. Why'd you come on your own? Come on in before you catch a cold.""

Eliza let out a dry laugh and didn't come in right away. Her eyes landed on Serena as she spoke, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm having some property issues back in the country, so I'll need to stay here for a few days.""

Serena smiled and thought, 'Stay here? Out of everywhere else, she has to move into her ex-boyfriend's house when he's already married? What is this supposed to be, taking over my place already? Making herself at home?'

Before Serena could say anything, Leon came running out of the house, cheering happily. ""Eliza, Ollie, you're finally here,"" he giggled.

He pushed past Serena, excitedly trying to welcome Eliza and Oliver inside.

Eliza greeted Leon but still didn't come in. She kept looking at Serena and asked cautiously, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm really sorry. I don't have many friends back home, so I had no choice but to turn to Victor. You don't mind, do you?""

Serena sneered, ""And if I do mind? Does that mean you're not coming in?""

Eliza clearly hadn't expected Serena to say that. Eliza froze, and before she could say anything, a young voice cut in ahead of her.

""What's your problem?"" Leon immediately stepped in front of Eliza to shield her. ""It doesn't matter if you mind. This is Dad's house.""

Eliza's expression changed. ""Leon, you can't talk to your mom like that. Your dad and your mom are married. That makes this her home too. She's the one who raised you. It hasn't been easy for her, and you should try to understand her.""

""Okay."" Leon lowered his head. Normally, he'd argue back for every word Serena said. But now, because of Eliza's words, he suddenly quieted down. ""I got it.""

Victor went ahead and picked up Eliza's luggage without waiting for Serena's response. ""Come in,"" he remarked.

Eliza looked at Serena apologetically and kept saying, ""Thank you.""

Serena just stood there quietly, watching them. Compared to the rest of them, she felt like she was the outsider here.

Serena scoffed a cold laugh in her heart. She wanted to go back to her room and pack her things, but Leon suddenly stopped her, saying, ""Where are you going? Hurry up and make dinner. Ollie and Eliza probably haven't eaten yet.""

""No, it's fine,"" Eliza said softly, trying to remind him. ""Leon, that's not appropriate.""

""No need. I'll cook today."" Victor was in a good mood and got up from the couch.

Eliza quickly grabbed his arm, then immediately pulled her hand back with a clear sense of boundaries. ""Don't trouble yourself. You guys just go on with what you were doing. I already ate before I came.""

Serena felt nothing but sarcasm inside. She'd known Victor for years. She could count on one hand how many times he'd stepped foot in the kitchen, let alone cooked.

She had always thought Victor simply didn't know how. But now it seemed he just didn't think Serena was worth the effort.

""All right, then I'll help you carry your suitcases to your room,"" Victor said. Since Eliza really didn't want to eat, he didn't insist. His eyes swept toward the bedrooms upstairs, and a trace of hesitation flickered in the depths of his gaze.

There were four bedrooms in the house. One belonged to Leon, one had been turned into a storage room, and the remaining two were his and Serena's.

A year ago, Victor had already suggested that he and Serena sleep in separate rooms.

# Chapter 3 Letting Go

That was why there wasn't any room in this house for Eliza at all.

Just then, Leon suddenly waved his little hand. ""Dad, let Eliza have Mom's room. It's big and bright—perfect for Eliza and Ollie.""

Victor paused for a second.

Eliza immediately caught the subtle shift in his expression and rushed to speak before he could say anything, ""No, that's not okay. If there's really no space, I'll take Oliver and find somewhere else to stay. I'm so sorry for bothering you.""

""It's no bother,"" Leon said, suddenly pouting. He turned his head and looked at Serena with urgency and grievance, raising his voice. ""Say something. What, you lost your voice today?""

Serena looked into Leon's eyes, full of blame. ""If Eliza takes my room, then where am I supposed to sleep?"" she questioned.

Leon puffed out his cheeks, clearly indifferent, his face turning red as he shouted like it was the most obvious thing in the world, ""The storage room has a bed. Just sleep there.

""You should be glad you even have a place to stay. Why are you being so picky?""

Hearing that, Eliza looked troubled. She stepped forward slightly, her eyes full of sincerity and apology.

She looked at Leon as she spoke gently, ""Leon, I'm a guest. Your mom is the host. How could I take the host's room? I'm already thankful she's letting me stay here. Oliver and I aren't going to be picky.""

Eliza turned to look at Oliver, who had been quiet the whole time. ""Right, Oliver?""

Oliver gave a calm nod.

""Well, Ms. Stone, you really know your place,"" Serena replied evenly, going along with her. ""So you all can figure out another plan for the room.""

Serena had swallowed her pride for years. She wasn't going to back down anymore.

Hearing that, Leon was furious. ""You're such a wretch. I knew you didn't really want Eliza to stay. You're so annoying.""

He put his little fists on his hips. ""But don't even think about kicking Eliza out. I'll just sleep with Dad, and Eliza and Ollie can have my room.""

Victor's eyes lit up. ""That works. It's settled then.""

Leon happily pushed the suitcases toward the elevator, and Victor led Eliza and Oliver to Leon's room.

Once again, Serena was the extra one. She was used to it. She went back to her room and started packing.

Not long after, Eliza came in with a cup of hot coffee in her hands. ""Mrs. Powell, may I come in? Are you packing for something? Going out?""

Serena didn't respond. She couldn't exactly tell Eliza she was leaving.

Eliza said, ""Leon poured this coffee for you. He may be little, but he's got a lot of pride. He was too embarrassed to bring it in himself.""

Serena didn't believe for a second that Leon had poured that coffee for her.

If Eliza hadn't shown up, maybe Serena would've believed it. But the Leon now hated Serena too much to even get her a cup of coffee.

Serena said, ""Ms. Stone, you don't need to smooth things over between me and Leon. The four of you living happily ever after is better than anything else.""

Even though Eliza had played innocent ever since she walked in—and had even stepped in a few times to help correct Leon—Serena didn't believe that was her true colors. Serena's instincts told her Eliza was far from simple.

Eliza bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Mrs. Powell, did I do something to make you misunderstand me?""

She walked over to Serena anxiously. Seeing Serena folding clothes, Eliza quickly reached out and grabbed her hand.

Eliza said, ""Mrs. Powell, if you don't want me to stay, just say it. I can leave. But please don't get the wrong idea about me. I never meant to sabotage your relationship with your family. I really didn't—""

Serena cut in coldly, ""Let go.""

""I'm begging you, please don't misunderstand me, okay? I'll leave, alright?""

""I said let go.""

Serena had no idea what Eliza was trying to do. Seeing her stubbornly clinging on, Serena yanked her wrist free.

Before Serena could say anything, Eliza, who had been standing just fine, suddenly fell. The hot coffee in her hand spilled onto Serena's skin, instantly turning a large area red.

""Ow!"" Eliza's sharp cry pierced the air.

""What happened?"" Leon and Victor rushed over the moment they heard the noise. The moment they saw the scene in front of them, their expressions suddenly changed.

Victor rushed forward, his eyes tinged red with panic. ""Ellie, are you okay? Are you hurt?""

Eliza raised her hand pitifully. Her delicate skin was now marked with a small red burn. ""Victor, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come today. I upset Mrs. Powell. Please don't blame her.""

Victor turned to glare at Serena, his eyes filled with anger. ""Why did you do this? Ellie's just here to stay for a couple days.

""It was already bad enough how you kept giving her a hard time, but now you actually laid hands on her?""

Instantly blamed for something she didn't do, Serena was shaking with rage, knowing full well she'd just been set up. But her mind went blank. She blurted out the truth, ""She fell on purpose.""

Serena had thought Victor still had some ability to tell right from wrong. But not only did he lack that now, his face darkened even more.

He yelled, ""Serena. How can you be so cruel? Why would Ellie fall on her own for no reason? You did it, just admit it. You've really let me down.""

He scooped Eliza into his arms and rushed to the living room to apply medicine to her burn.

Even Leon pointed at Serena's face and cursed her out, screaming, ""You're such a wretch. I hate you. You're evil and disgusting. You don't deserve to be my mom. Just die already. Stop ruining things between Dad and Eliza.""

Serena shoved him away, her breathing heavy. ""Leon Powell, you little brat, say that again.""

Leon lost his balance and fell to the floor, tears welling up in his eyes. ""You wretch, I don't love you anymore. I hate you."" With that, he took off running.

Serena's fingers trembled. It was the first time she had ever spoken harshly to Leon, but she didn't regret it. She took it as her last lesson to him as his mother.

Just then, a dull pain throbbed on the back of her hand. Serena lowered her eyes and looked at the large burn across it, then laughed.

Eliza had only gotten a few drops on her and Victor was already that worked up. But Serena was hurt far worse, and no one cared.

Serena's throat moved with a deep swallow as she walked alone to the bathroom to run cold water over her hand.

The water was colder than usual, and the twisted, jagged scar in her palm seemed even more noticeable now.

Outside, she heard Leon's cheerful voice. ""Yay. We're going out to eat. Daddy's the best. Ellie's the best too. I wish every day could be like this,"" he laughed.

""Victor, are you sure Mrs. Powell won't be upset we're not taking her?"" Eliza asked.

Victor said, ""She won't be. And even if she is, she'll get over it by the time we're back.""

Serena turned the faucet up to full blast, drowning out their voices from the living room.

After a long while, she suddenly shut off the water with a loud clack and walked straight into the bedroom, her steps firm and unwavering.

Serena thought, 'I'll get over it? No, Victor. You're never going to see me again. I'll let you guys be together.'

# Chapter 4 Misunderstood

""Today was so much fun. Eliza, I want to go again tomorrow,"" Leon said excitedly, tugging Eliza's hand as they walked into the living room.

Eliza reached out to pat Leon's head, her smile bright. ""Of course, Leon. If there's something you want to do, I'll definitely take you. But everything I let you eat today was just the kind of stuff Oliver eats all the time. Nothing special.""

Leon pouted and started complaining, ""My mom never lets me eat those things. Eliza, you don't even know how jealous I am of the other kids. Their moms are way better than her.""

Serena had just come out of the bathroom and heard the entire conversation. She walked down from the second floor, and the moment she looked up, she saw the ketchup still smeared on the corner of Leon's mouth.

Serena asked sharply, ""If you knew I don't let you eat that stuff, why did you still eat it?""

Leon looked up at the sound of her voice. The moment he saw Serena, his face turned sour.

Eliza spoke up, sounding apologetic, ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I didn't know you don't usually let Leon eat that kind of stuff. But it's really no big deal once in a while. Oliver eats it too.""

Serena snorted, ""Fast food is junk—loaded with fat and salt. It causes weight gain. Leon has a sensitive stomach. What makes you think it's no big deal? Or do you just assume everyone's like you people?""

Eliza's expression stiffened slightly.

Leon shot back, ""I've never eaten fast food before. It's just this once because Eliza brought me along. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Don't take it out on her.""

Leon's automatic defense of Eliza made Serena feel bitterly ironic. After everything Serena had done to take care of him, all it took was one fast food meal from Eliza to win him over.

Eliza explained patiently, ""Mrs. Powell, I understand how you feel as a mom. I'm a mom too. It's normal that kids like fast food. It's not like they eat it all the time.

""Plus, Leon is fine right now. I just think maybe sometimes you don't need to be so strict with him.""

Serena sneered, ""Really? And if something did happen, would you take responsibility?""

""Eliza would never be as stingy as you. Ollie eats this stuff all the time and he's fine. You just can't stand seeing me happy."" With that, Leon wiped his tears angrily and ran upstairs.

Seeing Leon run upstairs, Victor lost his temper and snapped, ""Serena, was it really necessary to blow up over something so small?

""Ellie was just being kind. If you didn't keep telling Leon what he can and can't eat, he wouldn't crave junk food so much.""

They all acted like it was Serena's fault. She didn't bother arguing and turned to leave. She thought, 'Since Victor, as Leon's father, doesn't care, why should I go out of my way to cause trouble for myself?'

Back in her room, Serena packed up her things and thought, 'Just a little longer. Once I get through this, I won't have anything to do with this family ever again.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Early the next morning, just as Serena was waking up, she heard a knock at the door. Before she could respond, the door was already pushed open.

Eliza walked in with a smile, holding a glass of milk. ""Mrs. Powell, Victor took the kids out. He asked me to let you know you don't need to prepare any meals for us today.""

Serena didn't even glance at her. She turned and sat down at the vanity, calmly taking off the bracelet from her wrist.

""I'm not interested in any of that. You don't need to tell me. And Ms. Stone, didn't anyone ever teach you to knock and wait for permission before entering someone else's room?"" Serena remarked.

Eliza's fingers tightened slightly around the glass, her knuckles turning pale. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I wasn't thinking. I just felt like maybe there's been a misunderstanding between us.

""When I had issues with my house, Victor invited me to stay here. I didn't think too much at the time. But don't worry. Once my place is fixed, I'll leave with Oliver right away.""

Serena could hear the provocation in Eliza's words. ""Eliza, there's no one else around right now. You don't need to keep pretending. Do you think that act of yours still works?"" Serena turned and looked her straight in the eye.

""Mrs. Powell, I'm not sure what you mean,"" Eliza said as she sat down on a stool across from her. She set the glass of milk on the table, rested her chin on her right hand, and put on a troubled expression.

She continued, ""I thought you were smart. When you saw me come back, I figured you'd know better and leave.

""I know the Powell family has a lot of money, and you want to stay a bit longer to get a bigger cut. But think about it—do you really believe someone like Victor would give you anything?""

Now that Eliza had dropped the act, Serena smirked coldly. She had no interest in the Powell family's money. But now, she was genuinely curious about why Eliza had come back to the country.

Serena asked, ""Eliza, if you chose to leave Victor back then, why come back now? Is it because your ex-husband's broke?""

Eliza's face darkened. Her hand clenched slightly, but after a pause, she let out a breath. ""Serena, stop trying to get a read on me. It won't be long before Vic divorces you. You'd better start thinking about how you're going to live after that.""

As she spoke, the smile on her face grew wider. ""I've only spent a few days with Leon and he already adores me this much. There's no way he'll choose you.""

It felt like a sharp knife stabbed straight into Serena's heart. She thought, 'If even the son I gave birth to prefers another woman, then so be it. I don't want anything anymore.'

Sensing the shift in Serena's emotions, Eliza got an idea. She stood up, walked over, and snatched the emerald bracelet Serena had just put away.

The emerald bracelet was high-quality, clearly expensive, and easily worth millions of dollars. Eliza hadn't expected the Powell family to give Serena something this valuable.

""You're not allowed to touch that."" Serena reached out to take it back, but Eliza dodged her and stepped away.

Eliza turned the emerald bracelet over in her hands, clearly amused. ""So this bracelet's enough to make you lose control. No wonder you're clinging to the Powell family like your life depends on it. Let me help you out.""

Eliza's expression shifted instantly as she suddenly hurled the emerald bracelet to the floor. Even with carpet underfoot, the bracelet still snapped apart.

Serena's expression changed. She rushed over in a panic, picked up the broken emerald bracelet from the floor, and looked it over carefully. Only when she saw that it was still salvageable did she calm down.

With proper jewelry repair, it should be possible to restore it. When Serena returned it later, at least she'd have something to show for it.

Eliza stood there, looking down with open disdain and contempt in her eyes. ""You really are pathetic. Sorry. But since it's already broken, I'll throw it out for you.""

Caught off guard, Serena let Eliza snatch the bracelet away.

The emerald bracelet was only broken into two pieces—there was still hope to get it repaired. But if Eliza damaged it further, there would be no way to fix it.

Today I went back to an Authorized service centre that I trust from their really good customer service.

I really hope this goes through and I can finally continue to use my laptop again as my finals r coming up.

i used to be relatively addicted to it, and very tolerant of its effects on my body. i could slam 2-3 energy drinks in a day (horrific, i know) and still be able to go to sleep when i got tired. but a little less than a year ago i had a truly opposite and horrifying experience to what i had dealt with for my entire life.

now what im about to say is completely stupid and i should have known better, but i was working an overnight shift and bought 2 energy drinks to keep myself moving for the night. and i, being stupid, drank them both within the first couple hours of my shift. this led to (at the time) one of the most intense panic attacks i'd ever had. i had to clock out for the night and i sat in the break area shaking so hard i couldn't speak or stand for about 3 or 4 hours. the next day was exactly the same except i did not have any caffeine. 

this was incomprehensible to me at the time, since i had done the same thing plenty of times before. ever since that experience my anxiety has multipled x100 in like... every area of my life? that night genuinely changed everything i thought i knew and everything went downhill FAST. i lost my job within 4 months of that experience, and my home within 8-9 months.

im leaving out a *lot* here, i know the caffeine wasn't the sole cause of my life falling apart. i have PTSD and a plethora of other things psychologically wrong with me, but i assume the caffeine was a catalyst in unleashing a terror like ive never known before. 

for example, i have always had excessive anxiety (put on SSRI's at the start of middle school) but not on a *primal* level like i do now. i was in the ER for relentless hyperventilation in january of this year (couldn't breathe, my arms and legs went fully numb, my hands curled up, tongue was locked, torso was numb + tense for over an hour) and had to get an ativan shot. every single part of my day to day life is different now.

now, i avoid that crap like the actual PLAGUE. i gave up soda, chocolate, coffee, and tea *entirely.* i don't even touch anything coffee or chocolate flavored. i obsessively check the labels of any carbonated drink to the point where i pretty much just don't drink those anymore either, i only drink water, milk, and sometimes apple/cranberry juice. 

TLDR; do you let yourself have any caffeine? if so, how do you not immediately panic and feel all of your internal organs wiggling around in your gut? i don't wish to consume it ever again for as long as i live, but im curious to know if anyone else with severe debilitating anxiety can do it without feeling like your blood is going to spontaneously combust.

A few things about me: I'm 33, based in the UK, I love anime, K-pop, going to concerts and live music, reading (or collecting books to be put on my tbr pile) and watching movies especially horror ones, even though I 100% hide behind a pillow during the scary bits. I'm also a sucker for coffee, long walks, and the sea. bonus points if you love deep convos by the water.

I'm a bit introverted and awkward at first, but once I warm up... get ready for clingy texts, random thoughts at all hours, and lots of quality time energy. If you're someone who loves silly banter and deep chats about life and doesn’t mind chatting away all day, we'll probably vibe.


I don’t mind the location but I think being on the same timezone is easier (what of I love seeing good morning and goodnight messages lmao). Also please be above 25 or something. So! Wanna keep each other company for the next 10 days or hopefully more?",0,1752231520.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

Chapter 1  
  
I leaned against the wall, carefully cradling my six-month bump as I waited for my prenatal checkup.  
  
Once the scheduled examination was done, I planned to visit my husband Aiden—maybe we could head home together.  
  
After all, the rain was coming down hard outside. The rideshare app showed nearly 200 people ahead of me in the queue, and my phone signal kept cutting out sporadically.  
  
Aiden wasn't scheduled for specialist clinic duty today, but one of his team's doctor colleagues had called in sick last minute. So he'd been forced to cover a half-day shift.  
  
The heavy smell of disinfectant in the hospital corridors mixed with the damp scent of the downpour outside, making me nauseous.  
  
The waiting area was packed. Children crying, anxious inquiries, nurses trying to maintain order—all the sounds blended together into a headache-inducing chaos.  
  
I found an empty spot on the bench outside the obstetrics office and had just settled down when I spotted Aiden's tall figure emerging from a consultation room.  
  
He wore his crisp white coat, pressed to perfection, his face still bearing the exhaustion from last night's surgery.  
  
But his gaze swept across the crowd with that familiar sharpness and... intensity. This was the Aiden I knew—calm, efficient, completely intolerant of chaos or rule-breaking.  
  
As one of the youngest deputy chief cardiologists at a top New York hospital, his professionalism and strict adherence to protocol were practically carved into his bones.  
  
I'd always considered this a strength.  
  
Just as I was about to call out to him, I saw a figure skillfully weaving through the queue, heading straight for Aiden's office.  
  
That silhouette... was that Vera?  
  
I frowned. Vera was an intern who'd joined the department just over a month ago. Young, pretty, always flashing that sweet smile.  
  
My first impression of her at the hospital had been positive—a breath of youthful energy.  
  
But here was the problem: she shouldn't be anywhere near Aiden.  
  
Or more precisely, she shouldn't be appearing in such a... privileged way.  
  
Because Aiden had a habitual ""rule""—to avoid unnecessary complications and distractions, all the interns and assistants he worked with were exclusively male.  
  
This wasn't something he'd actively demanded, but after several young female doctors had tried to ""get close"" through various methods—""accidentally"" spilling water, messing up reports, asking for ""guidance"" until late at night—Aiden had had enough.  
  
He'd requested that the training office only assign male interns to his team.  
  
Over time, it became an unspoken understanding within the department.  
  
Even the administrative assistants knew to simply leave documents on his desk—avoiding any accidental contact with Dr. Aiden.  
  
So what was Vera doing here?  
  
""Aiden!"" Vera's voice carried that deliberately soft sweetness. ""Sorry to bother you, but my stomach pain is really severe...""  
  
Aiden turned slightly. I couldn't even catch the change in his expression before I saw him raise his hand to pull open the consultation room door, gesturing for Vera to enter.  
  
Then, facing the patients and their families who'd been waiting outside for ages, he said flatly: ""Please wait. Handling an emergency.""  
  
Complaints erupted immediately.  
  
""Are you kidding me? We've been waiting all morning!""  
  
""Emergency? That girl looked perfectly healthy just now.""  
  
""Yeah, isn't Dr. Aiden supposed to be the most by-the-book guy here? Line-cutting?""  
  
Aiden's expression didn't budge an inch, as if those voices simply didn't exist.  
  
He was about to close the door when his gaze inadvertently swept across the crowd and landed on me in the corner.  
  
For a split second, I saw surprise flash in Aiden's eyes. Then it shifted into something almost imperceptible... annoyance?  
  
But he said nothing. With a sharp ""bang,"" he shut the consultation room door, blocking out everyone's stares.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My heart plummeted. Ten minutes? Twenty minutes? The consultation room door remained firmly shut.  
  
The complaints outside grew louder, nurses tried to calm people down, but it was no use.  
  
An icy sensation spread through my limbs. Not from the air conditioning—but from knowing that behind that closed door lay territory I, as his wife, rarely set foot in, yet another young woman had effortlessly claimed.  
  
Even with Aiden himself breaking the rules.  
  
Finally, the door opened. Vera emerged holding a payment slip, her cheeks flushed, eyes bright—showing absolutely no signs of the ""severe abdominal pain"" she'd mentioned earlier.  
  
She walked toward the payment counter with light steps.  
  
As she passed by me, she even shot me a look that carried triumph, almost defiant in its smugness.  
  
Aiden followed, his expression restored to its usual calm, as if he'd never broken any rules at all.  
  
He looked at me, not giving me a chance to speak: ""Almost off duty.  
  
Finished with your checkup? I still have a few patients—after that I'll drive you home. Too much rain outside, rideshares are impossible.""  
  
I said nothing.  
  
The crushing disappointment and sense of betrayal left me heartbroken. I followed Aiden silently to his break room to wait.  
  
Every minute of waiting felt endless.  
  
The break room still carried the faint scent of jasmine perfume—Vera's fragrance from earlier.  
  
I stared at the neatly arranged files on Aiden's desk and the no-smoking sign beside them, remembering that argument from a month ago.  
  
I'd just finished throwing up from morning sickness and felt suddenly hungry.  
  
When I went to see Aiden, I brought only the mildest lemon water—I knew how sensitive he was to strong smells.  
  
But when I took a sip in his office, Aiden said coldly: ""Tina, this is a hospital, not a coffee shop. That smell will linger for hours—it could affect my clinical judgment. Please don't eat or drink anything in here again.""  
  
Just one sip of water. Aiden had used such harsh, cold phrasing as ""affecting judgment.""  
  
And now, Vera, merely an ""intern,"" had not only broken Aiden's rule about working with female interns, but had also been privileged enough to skip the crowded clinic queue and enter his consultation room because of a ""stomach ache""?  
  
Yet her lingering jasmine fragrance—wouldn't that affect his ""professional judgment""?  
  
When Aiden returned after seeing his last patient, I was standing by the window, watching the storm outside. ""Let's go."" He grabbed his car keys. ""I parked in the basement garage, no need to get soaked.""  
  
The underground garage felt somewhat damp from the storm's penetration. Aiden's black SUV sat in the spacious parking spot.  
  
When I reached the car, Aiden didn't immediately unlock it, instead looking toward the passenger side.  
  
I followed his gaze and saw the passenger door open.  
  
Vera poked her head out, her face a picture of ""surprise"" and ""apology"": ""Tina? Oh my God—I'm so sorry! Earlier, Aiden saw I couldn't get a ride and with this terrible rain, he offered to drop me home... I didn't mean to intrude. Aiden, maybe I should sit in the back?""  
  
She pretended to unbuckle her seatbelt to get out, but Aiden simply unlocked the rear doors and said to me: ""Get in.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Then Aiden turned back to Vera, his tone noticeably softer, carrying a hint of reassurance he probably wasn't even aware of: ""It's fine, stay put. You're soaked out there.""  
  
Vera sweetly said ""okay"" and settled back into her seat. Her face still wore that apologetic expression, but her eyes betrayed her current smugness.  
  
I supported my bump and awkwardly maneuvered into the back seat. The car started up and smoothly pulled out of the garage. We drove into the storm.  
  
The car shut out the wind and rain, but it couldn't shut out the silence inside. Aiden broke it first, his voice calm: ""Vera's apartment is pretty far. We'll drop her off first.""  
  
I said nothing, and the last shred of hope in my heart completely vanished. From the hospital to our home was normally a ten-minute drive. But Vera's apartment was in the complete opposite direction—this ""far"" was definitely not just a little out of the way.  
  
I watched their silhouettes. Vera seemed a bit cold, arms wrapped around herself. Aiden immediately reached over to turn up the heat near the passenger seat.  
  
Vera said something quietly. Aiden tilted his head slightly, actually smiling, and responded in low tones. I clenched my fists, my body trembling involuntarily. Aiden was completely ignoring me.  
  
The warm air from the heater mixed with Vera's jasmine scent, wafting back toward me in waves. Pregnancy had made my sense of smell acute—in that moment, it made me nauseous.  
  
Instinctively, I cracked the window open slightly. A blast of cold, rain-laden air immediately rushed in. ""Ah!"" Vera let out a shriek from the passenger seat, dramatically hunching her shoulders. ""So cold!""  
  
Aiden glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes showing displeasure: ""It's pouring. Close the window! Getting the car wet makes it smell worse.""  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed by a giant fist. Three days ago, just because I'd taken that sip of lemon water in his office, he hadn't spoken to me since. But now?  
  
Vera could sit in his passenger seat wearing perfume, enjoying the heat he'd turned up for her. Just because she complained about being cold, Aiden immediately blamed me for opening the window.  
  
Principles? Rules?  
  
Apparently they only applied to me.  
  
A wave of nausea surged from my stomach, the baby kicking hard—maybe sensing my emotional turmoil.  
  
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the cold air streaming through the window, forcing myself to stay calm. Then I expressionlessly rolled the window back up.  
  
The car returned to its enclosed warmth. But Vera's mood hadn't immediately recovered. She began complaining softly: ""This weather is awful. I should have grabbed a jacket before leaving.""  
  
""Are you hungry?"" Aiden suddenly asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. The car happened to be passing a brightly lit convenience store.  
  
Vera hesitated: ""Well... a little. I always seem to get hungrier when I'm not feeling well...""  
  
Aiden immediately put on his turn signal and smoothly pulled into the convenience store parking lot. Without looking at me, he unbuckled his seatbelt: ""Wait here.""  
  
Rain hammered against Aiden's umbrella as he got out, instantly soaking half his pant legs. He didn't seem to care, heading straight into the store.  
  
A few minutes later, he returned with dampness clinging to him and water droplets on his clothes. He handed Vera a hot cocoa and a paper bag containing a warm cinnamon roll.  
  
""Eat it while it's hot,"" his voice was low and caring. ""Warm your stomach.""  
  
Sweet, buttery, rich cinnamon scent immediately filled the small car interior. I watched Aiden's soaked sleeves and shoulders, watched the concern in his eyes as he handed Vera the food.  
  
In that instant, I gave up completely. I thought of countless late nights when Aiden came home exhausted after surgery, how I'd tiptoe around, not daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing his rest, because he'd said he hated being bothered most of all.  
  
I thought of all his prohibitions: the cleanliness of private spaces, the ban on eating in his office, the strict boundaries in personal relationships... I'd spent nine careful years maintaining all of Aiden's principles.  
  
Turns out, every rule could be broken.

1lx3v1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lx3v1s/does_the_keurig_kclassic_coffee_maker_live_up_to/,Does the Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker Live Up to Its Single-Serve Hype?,"For the past few weeks, I’ve been brewing my coffee daily with the Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker, model K-50, to see how it measures up. As someone who values convenience and the promise of a consistently good cup of coffee, I wanted to dive deep into this device’s features and quirks. Here’s everything I’ve learned from my hands-on adventures with this single-serve coffee machine.

**Convenient Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the machine looks sleek in its black finish, fitting effortlessly into my kitchen’s countertop lineup. At about 9.8 inches deep and 13 inches tall, it balances compactness with functionality. The 48-ounce removable water reservoir is a lifesaver for someone like me who doesn’t enjoy repeatedly refilling during a busy morning routine. You can make about six cups before needing a refill, a feature that’s perfect for households or even small offices. I’m also a fan of how lightweight it is at just 9 pounds—it’s easy to reposition when I rearrange the kitchen or clean.

Modern simplicity was clearly a goal here. The button controls are intuitive—even someone like my mom, who’s not the most tech-savvy, had no problem operating it. It doesn’t overcomplicate coffee-making, but that also comes with limitations I’ll touch on later.

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker deserves applause for its simplicity. Brewing with K-Cup pods is as easy as it gets. My routine of popping in a pod, selecting my brew size (6, 8, or 10 ounces), and waiting less than 60 seconds for a fresh cup fits seamlessly into even the busiest mornings. The 6-ounce option, I must say, delivers a richer and bolder cup for those bleary-eyed mornings. You can even use the Keurig Classic Series My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter to enjoy your own ground coffee—a feature I loved when experimenting with a locally roasted Ethiopian blend.

**[Ready to buy Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker K-50? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b018uq5ams/)**

**Key Benefits**  
- Removable 48-ounce water reservoir makes clean-up and refill simple.  
- Multiple brew sizes adapt to different preferences for strength and sip size.  
- The automatic cleaning and descaling process increases longevity.  
- The auto-off feature saves energy by shutting down after 2 hours of inactivity.  

**Flavor Consistency and Performance**  
For a single-serve drip coffee machine, the flavor consistency surprised me. Whether I stuck to popular pods from Green Mountain Coffee or opted for something bolder from Starbucks, the machine extracted smooth and balanced notes across the board. I even tested it with tea and hot cocoa pods with great results. While it doesn’t reach the intensity of a dedicated espresso machine, the convenience alone won me over.

Noise was minimal during the brewing process, a stark contrast to the droning whine of my old automatic coffee maker. However, one small hiccup I noticed was that some pods occasionally felt under-extracted, especially when I ventured into non-Keurig brand options. This required adjustments, like trying different brew sizes, to achieve the desired taste.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Cleaning can feel tedious despite the auto-clean function needing occasional manual attention for residue buildup in the needle area.  
- Limited to three brew size options (6, 8, and 10 ounces), which might not satisfy hardcore customization enthusiasts.  
- It works exclusively with K-Cups unless you purchase a separate reusable filter.  

**Auto Features and Energy Savings**  
The auto-off feature is a godsend for forgetful coffee drinkers like me. On busy mornings, when the coffee buzz takes over, I’ve definitely walked out the door leaving machines on in the past. Knowing the Keurig shuts off automatically after two idle hours is a bonus not just for safety but for energy efficiency too.

**Competing Products**  
In the sea of single-serve coffee makers, the Keurig K-Classic faces stiff rivals like the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The former scores higher in terms of brew strength and espresso shots, while the latter offers brilliant versatility by working with both K-Cups and ground coffee without needing an extra adapter. Compared to these, Keurig holds its ground with its user-friendly design, extensive pod compatibility, and larger water reservoir.

However, if espresso shots and a higher-end, barista-style experience are your priorities, Nespresso might be your go-to. For customization lovers, the FlexBrew offers more options, though its design doesn’t feel as polished as Keurig’s. The K-Classic is positioned more as an accessible, workhorse coffee maker that delivers consistent results without breaking the bank.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering the features packed into this machine, I’d say the value proposition is strong. While it’s not for coffee connoisseurs chasing espresso perfection, the Keurig K-Classic is fantastic for casual drinkers wanting convenience and decent taste without investing excessive time or effort. Its longevity could even save you money in the long run compared to daily café runs.

**Lyla Monroe**

“What the heck!?”

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

“Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.”

“Yes, Mr. Steele.”

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

“Hello?” I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.”

My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?”

She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.”

I waited.

I'd love hear people's hotel (and restaurant) recommendations based upon their real life experiences. 

What we like:
Central location and easy to get around.  We'll be flying in from London and only staying 2-3 nights.

Great breakfast experience - service, food, coffee

Rooms - anything with classic style and Italian flare - bathrooms with double sinks and walk in shower.  I cannot bare staying in expensive hotels and then having a shower head over a bath.

Social areas - some hotels appear to have terraces over the canal, sitting drinking an aperol spritz in the sun on the hotel terrace is right up our street.

Im currently looking at the St Regis, the Venice Venice and the Gritti Palace.

When I first started this subreddit, it was because I couldn’t find a space where people were openly talking about what it’s really like to live on Social Security alone. That space just didn’t seem to exist, so I created one. And to be honest, I’ve been a little overwhelmed (in the best way) by how many of you have shown up, shared, helped each other, and made this grow into something real. I’m grateful and excited every time I see how much it resonates.

Part of what’s come out of this is the wiki, which I update monthly. It’s a lot of work, yes, but also a labor of love. Based on comments and messages, it seems like folks are finding it helpful, which makes it absolutely worth the effort.

That said, I’ve had a few people ask if there’s a way to chip in. I've always hesitated to bring that up because, well, this community is *literally* about living on less. A paywall or subscription model doesn't feel right at all. But maybe something simple like a Buy Me a Coffee link in the sidebar or wiki could make sense? Not as a push or a pitch, just an option.

I’d love your take. Does that feel helpful and fair, or out of sync with what this space is about?

Dunno if there’s still hope for rekindling,"You can check my post history at r/lostafriend for context. But basically it’s been over a month since an argument between my friend from work and I. While he reached out after 2 weeks from that, he went back to ignoring me again and we haven’t really talked at all except for work-related things. 

I had somewhere to go earlier and it was near his place. Took my shot and texted him with zero expectations. 

Me: heyy good morning. Are you working from home today or at the office?

Him: Good Morning. I’m off work today.  Any concerns? (Assumed it’s about work). I may reply at 2pm if that’s okay. 

Me: oh I’m sorry to bother you. I didn’t know you were off duty. Will you be free from 2pm onwards or are you busy? 

Him: not sure, i’m at the hospital today. I have some tests to do at 1:30pm. Is there something you need from me? (Still assuming it’s work related)

Me: Hey are you okay? (In response 

I just wanted to ask if you’re free to meet up since I’ll be there near your place later. We can have coffee or dinner. Oh and I also have tea! 

Don’t overthink it haha, we’re just going to eat and catch up. Lemme know if you’re down. Hit me up. (I wanted to reassure hulim we won’t be talking about the argument and I just really wanted to catch up)

Get well soon and take care! (Wasn’t hoping for anymore replies but surprised he still responded) 

Him: I’ll have to check. I’m having migraines and I still have to do some tests.

Me: What happened if you don’t mind me asking? 

Him: dunno, my migraine has been there for days. 

He proceeds to tell me about his health.

My last text was asking him about something health related which he didn’t reply to anymore. I also didn’t send a follow up text anymore even though I was concerned about him. 

I was low key hoping he’d accept my invite and I waited and waited but got disappointed that he probably didn’t want to see me. 

Still, I was happy that he was at least responsive. I thought he blocked me. But I still don’t know where things stand between us since our convo was so formal. 

I am really concerned with what he shared and want to ask him about his test results but I’m not sure if that’s okay or I should wait a day or two to check in on him. ",1,1752231253.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

# Chapter 6 Replace Her

The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.

When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.

The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.

Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""

Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""

Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""

Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue—but his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.

Athena understood then—he was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.

She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.

Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""

He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away—and truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.

""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""

Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""

Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""

Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""

""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""

""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.

Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone—very discreetly—to suggest replacing her in the engagement.

Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.

Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""

She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp—her reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.

Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off… They just want to marry someone else instead.""

Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.

It all made sense now.

Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.

But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow—pure, innocent Willow—would be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.

Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation—yet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.

No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them—she wouldn't give them that satisfaction.

""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""

Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.

""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.

Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.

But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""

At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.

Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.

The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made—so she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'

Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""

But she knew in her heart—Michael had been the best they could hope for.

With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.

Margaret felt a stab of grief—her precious Athena had endured too much.

But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""

""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""

She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.

Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.

As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""

Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""

""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.

Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly—Michael was standing right in front of her.

Backlit by the sunlight, he looked like a cold shadow descending upon her.

""Athena,"" he said, coming to a halt in front of her. His tall frame instantly blocked the sun.

The chill that radiated from him made her shiver. Even after three years, being this close still left a dull ache in her chest.

Suddenly, Michael seized her thin wrist, his voice low and icy. ""This engagement was settled years ago. You don't get to walk away from it.""",1,1752231193.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Daisy and Carter traveled up the colossal tower through the elevator. Daisy could tell that her beloved was still a bit nervous as she saw him vigorously rubbing his chin. But as she gently took his hand, it cleared up, replaced by a smile feeling her familiar touch. However, the elevator soon stopped, forcing her to release him as the door opened, revealing Gancelot in his armor, still concealing his face underneath his helmet.

“Greetings, Damara, General Carter.”

“Good to see you again, vice-commander Gancelot,” Daisy said.

“And the same to you. Please follow me to the meeting room.”

The couple followed behind Gancelot, allowing him to guide them through the corridors. They soon arrived in the meeting room, joining their new colleagues, the other three United Planets generals. It was a circular chamber at the very top of the tower approximately three hundred square feet in diameter adorned with glass windows, giving the golden sunlight passage in. The generals sat around a round table in the center of the room. Orion stood at the head of the table with Gancelot beside him.

Daisy quickly took note of their three new comrades. Each of the generals was a different species native to the varying corners of the United Planets. Immediately, Orion’s words about his and Everton’s friendship echoed through her mind. With Carter from Earth, a planet on the Northern end of the territory, they had representation from all four cardinal directions. She quickly surmised that it must have been a symbolic and practical gesture. Orion wanted the best fighters, drawing from all their people to show that everyone was equal and worthy of protection, promoting unity in the face of a malefic threat.

Lev, twenty-four, hailing from the southern planets, was a female flora with pink skin. She flapped her giant butterfly wings on her back excitedly, seeing them.

""Good, you’re both here. General Carter, how was the trip? I know how space travel still doesn't agree with you humans.""

Carter drew a seat around the table for Daisy before taking one for himself, and Lev watched intently as she sat on it.

""You kidding? It was the best trip of my life,"" Carter said.

Lev cracked a smile as she saw them.""I see.""

Favian, twenty-four, hailing from the western planets, was a male aquis with blue skin and a muscular body. Favian Jumped out of his seat, seething, his blue diamond-shaped bug eyes glared at Carter.

""Enough with the pleasantries. The last time I checked, we were at war. Am I the only one who takes the future of his kind seriously?""

Carter and Lev gave Favian scowls, and the former prepared to open his mouth for a tirade. But Daisy stopped him with a single glare as the words readied to leave his lips. Orion readied to say something to quell the fight. However, he stopped as the remaining general, Róngyù, stepped into the Fray.

Róngyù, twenty-seven, hailing from the eastern planets, was a male Huǒ with red fur and a muscular body. He hurried to Favian, gently sitting his comrade back down. And even as Favian shared glares with Carter, Róngyù's friendly, smiling feline face sent a ceasefire he couldn't ignore.

""I apologize for losing my temper.” Favian took a deep breath. “Thanks for stopping me before I made a fool of myself, Róngyù.""

""Fear not, friend. We're all under the same pressure. I venture to say it would be odd if it didn’t get to one of us.""

""Indeed, now let us proceed with the meeting,"" Orion said.

Róngyù strolled back to his seat, and as Orion saw him seated, he pressed a button on the table. A giant holographic map of the galaxy appeared in front of them. Purple covered a massive portion of it.

""This is a map of the known parts of our galaxy. And the purple segments are everything the enemy controls,"" Orion said.

""Good god,"" Daisy said.

""The combination of Zola's technology and Mavor's dark powers have proven devastating over the centuries. And the shadow hand, of course.”

“Shadow hand?” Daisy asked.

“Mavor’s top five subordinates. Morana, Cymbeline, Zola, Nobunaga, and the youngest member, Evelyn,” Róngyù said.

“But with you, Damara, we finally have a lead. If only a narrow one. So we must decide what to do.""

Favian raised his hand, and as Orion saw him, he signaled for him to speak.

""Orion, we currently control several vital strategic positions. I propose we use Damara's power to fortify defenses and slowly move into the enemy territory.""

""Favian, you can't be serious,"" Lev said.

""And why not?""

""We've discussed this before. We'll never win this war playing defense. We should take Damara's powers and assault the strategic positions the enemy already possesses. We can retake the map far quicker that way.""

""Do you not understand the number of casualties that would come from a move like that?""

""Of course I do. But wars are won by making tough choices.""

""Enough."" Orion turned his gaze to Róngyù, looking at his comrades. ""Róngyù, you haven't voiced your opinion yet.""

""I honestly don't know what to say, Orion. But I think I favor Lev's plan better. As much as I loathe heavy casualties, ending this war as swiftly as possible must take precedence.""

""Let us vote. Those in favor of Favian, please raise your left hand. But those in favor of Lev, please raise your right hand.""

The generals swiftly raised their hands in the air. Lev and Róngyù raised their right hands. But Favian and Carter raised their left hands. And Favian looked at Carter, words caught in his throat as he saw him supporting his strategy.

Róngyù let out a deep sigh.""We have a tie. But if there is one thing we all agree on, we need Damara for our plans. So what does she say?”

All the eyes in the room went to Daisy, waiting for her answer. As she saw them, the gears of her consciousness went into overdrive. Again, being a farmer by birth and a seamstress by trade, she had only the barest knowledge of the delicate matter. Still, she could tell there was truth to both sides of the argument. But the image of Everton's dead body flashed in her mind, and her answer came with it as the frown Carter knew too well at this point returned to her face.

""All of you know far more about war than I ever can. But I think what would be worse than defeat is a Cadmean victory. So I support General Carter and General Favian.""

As Orion heard Daisy, he turned his gaze to Lev, waiting for her response. But she gave him a nod of acceptance.

""It seems we have reached an agreement. Now, let us move on to other important matters,"" Orion said.

\*\*\*

Sarah and Lucas hopped off a hover bus and quickly continued towards Lucas's village, Yasai. The two traversed the grassy field, jogging to the village on the horizon. The field was a vast sea of the most emerald, sweet-smelling grass. Still, as they closed the distance, only a few meters away they stopped, Lucas first followed by Sarah.

“Lucas, what’s wrong?”

Lucas looked at his village, scanning it intensely. “It’s just been so long.”

Sarah grabbed his arm, pulling him forward. ”And it’ll be even longer the more you’re a baby about it.”

“Okay, okay. Let go of me.” Lucas pulled his arm away from Sarah. “And thanks.”

Lucas broke away from Sarah, returning to his jogging, and as he went Sarah fought a smile.

The two entered Yasai together. It was an idyllic and fruitful land, dreamlike similar to the fairytales of long ago. The scent of fruits and vegetables wrapped around Lucas like a hug from an old friend he hadn’t seen in years. The Hachiko’s houses were comprised of either wood or stone bricks. They had farms of varying sizes on every corner but weren’t industrialized. Yasai was a small utopia, resistant to the ravages of modernity, captivating in its rustic splendor.

The Hachiko dashed left and right until they spotted Lucas. As he and Sarah walked through the village, the many inhabitants sprinted to their old friend. Giving him a hero's welcome as joyous cheers filled the air, celebrating his contributions to the war against the Nemesis empire. Never before had someone from their region, let alone village, made it so far in wider galactic society.

Sarah grew a smile. ""Enjoying this, hometown hero?""

""Well, I certainly don't mind.""

The cheering swiftly stopped as a beautiful Hachiko woman approached Lucas.

""Welcome home, Lucas Fortis. Everyone in the region was abuzz when word came out that you were returning.” The woman gave Lucas a sealed envelope. “Not every day our kind produces a war hero.""

""Thanks. But I'm just a good pilot.""

""And modest. It's such an honor to give you that gift certificate. Business in the pleasure district will boom with you as a patron. Plus, our women are bound to be overjoyed meeting you.

Sarah and Lucas shared a look, their eyes widening as they heard the woman.

""P-pleasure district? You mean the place where they-""

Sarah grabbed Lucas by his shirt collar, forcing him to look her in the eye as she glared. 

""If you dare accept this lady's offer, I will rip off your ability to enjoy yourself.” Sarah cracked her knuckles. “If you catch my drift.""

""Sarah, let go of me. I'm not that type of man. And frankly, I don't know what to say since you think I am.""

A look of shame swept Sarah's face, and she quickly released Lucas. As he was free, Lucas returned the envelope to the woman.

""Thanks, but no thanks.""

Lucas swiftly walked away from the crowd, but Sarah followed close behind.

""Lucas, I'm so sorry. I honestly don't know why I'm always so angry.” Sarah took a deep breath. “It's like someone else controls my body.""

""Apology accepted.""

Sarah grew a large smile as she heard Lucas. But the two quickly reached his old house and saw his mother, Lucy. And Lucas’s spine stiffened like a board as he saw her. It had been two years since they last met, and the war kept him from calling her often. Lucy tilled the land of their home alone until she saw her son. She dropped her hoe and hurried over to Lucas. As she reached him, Lucy hugged her son with an iron grip, and he swiftly reciprocated. They only had each other with no other living family, and now, after what felt like an eternity, they were reunited.

Sarah broke down crying, loudly sobbing, seeing the display of love from a mother and her child.

Lucy looked at Sarah, drawn over by the sound of her crying. ""Hello there. Sorry, I didn't notice you.""

""Mother, this is a friend from the army, Sarah Fortitudo.""

""Glory to the lawgiver. Lucas, your friend, is quite pretty. Good boy."" Lucy playfully winked her eye at Lucas.

*""Mother,""* Lucas shouted red-faced.

As John Doe finishes his coffee and donut, he notices a dusty folder under a pile of letters. It reads ""Fraudulent misrepresentation in connection with a commodity transaction.""

""Hmm,"" John mutters as he dusts off the folder and starts to read its contents.

His eyes begin to widen as he realizes the significance of what he's about to do. John walks to the front of the office and shouts across the floor, ""Ladies and gentlemen, as of today we will be notifying Tether that they will need to fully comply with an audit carried out by both ourselves and a third party. These so-called attestations they have been providing are wholly unacceptable.""

Fast forward one month later, and it's everything we all expected. The CFTC holds a press conference together with the SEC and DOJ with their message:

""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is John Doe, and I am the principal fraud investigator at the CFTC. I am joined today by my esteemed colleagues from the SEC and DOJ. Today we have some information that we feel needs to be shared with the public. After a full investigation into the crypto company known as Tether, we have concluded that Tether is not fully backed. It has misled investors and engaged in fraud. As a result of this, we will be freezing assets and suspending trading in the U.S. effective immediately.""

Suddenly, USDT starts trading at $0.90, then $0.80, then lower. People rush to redeem for real dollars, but the redemption process gets delayed or blocked. Exchanges raise fees, slow down withdrawals, and halt redemptions. Panic sets in.

People holding Bitcoin now want to escape into something real - USD. To get real money, they sell Bitcoin for Tether, as this is what most exchanges use, then try to redeem the Tether. But if redemption fails, they sell Bitcoin for anything else, causing BTC to crash.

This is forced liquidation on a massive scale. It's not just retail - hedge funds, traders, and exchanges are all caught up in the dumpster fire.

Exchanges that held Tether as reserves instead of actual dollars now can't pay customers. Withdrawals get frozen. Insolvency spreads. Trust is obliterated. People flee the entire crypto system.

Cymbeline and Mavor strolled through the castle. Inside the structure was comprised of numerous stone bricks, making the various chambers of its space, and illuminated by both torches on the walls and electronic lights above their heads. Their footsteps echoed loudly throughout the twenty-foot-tall corridors, passing through the castle staff and the slaves of various species. But finally, they neared their destination behind the tall wooden doors at the end of the corridor, the throne room.

Behind the doors stood the throne of Placentia, standing alone in the room’s ten square feet of space. There was a time long ago when the world didn’t have a sole monarch, but those times were gone. Now, the natives of the world had to submit to one king and one king alone, Mavor Morningstarr.

Mavor sat on the massive throne as Cymbeline stood before him. A slave, a flora woman, quickly entered the room with a golden tray and cover. She presented the tray to the emperor, bowing her head and removing the cover. It revealed a glass and a bottle of wine ready for Mavor to consume.

“Emperor, before we talk business, would you give me the pleasure of sampling our wine?”

“May I ask what kind it is?”

“Oku wine, sir.”

“One of the United Planets bread basket worlds. But our forces in that area-“

“I ordered my soldiers to grab several dozen units of their vineyard seeds and their winemakers during the occupation on the planet.” Cymbeline groaned. “Before that vile pestilence, Damara forced us out.”

“I assume you will have a sufficient supply ready for the Genesis festival next year.”

“Of course, and more. We had significant financial plans for the world, but we’re trying to do more with less.”

Mavor took the glass and bottle from the slave girl, pouring the wine into the glass. And the slit to his hideous mouth opened. ”Delicious.” As he consumed the wine.

“Thank you, sir.” Cymbeline turned his gaze to the slave girl, scowling. ”Begone.”

The slave girl quickly heeded Cymbeline’s orders, running out of the room, knowing even being a second too slow to comply could cost her life.

""Cymbeline, you have served me well. Under your command, our colonies have flourished. It is time I grant you a long overdue reward.""

""Emperor, do you mean-""

""Yes, take your army and Morana to the western planets. In my name, ensure nothing remains of the lesser beings but ash and fire."" Mavor interrupted.

""Many thanks, emperor. B-but who will run the colonies while I lay waste to the vermin?""

""Don't worry, Evelyn will take care of it. As young as she is, she has served me just as well.""

""I see. I will prepare my forces at once.""

\*\*\*

At Morana's mansion, her slaves dragged a lifelike statue of Daisy to the balcony of her bedroom. They hurriedly ran away the moment they placed it in the correct spot. As they left, morana shot her icy death beam at it, encasing it in ice before it exploded into thousands of pieces.

*""If you don't wanna be next, get me a new one now.""* Morana glared at her slaves. 

They ran off to carry out her orders as swiftly as possible. Tripping and stumbling over each other, knowing their lives depended on their swiftness. But as her slaves left the room, Morana hopped into her bed and lay down face-first, nursing a migraine, rubbing her temples.

""The slave girl was a jinx. After I got her, one bad thing after another kept happening. The United Planets have earth after I worked so hard to conquer it. Damara is now a thorn in our side. And worst of all, I've been humiliated.""

Morana covered her head with one of her pillows as she released a monstrous roar.

In the corridor, her roar shook the ground, making one of her slaves trip and fall. He struggled to stand up, and as he tried, he gazed in horror at Evelyn. She was a beautiful Nemesis with long snow-white hair, a small beauty mark on the corner of her mouth, and a slender, curvy body. As Evelyn stood over the slave, she reached out to him. Her hand got closer and closer, and the slave shook intensely, preparing for retribution. But instead, Evelyn gently helped him back to his feet.

""Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?""

Still gripped by terror, the slave didn’t open his mouth. But he instead nodded no to her questions.

Evelyn grew a smile.""That's good. Why don't you go to your job before she gets angrier.""

The slave heeded Evelyn's words and dashed off at top speed. As he left, she hurried to Morana's room. And she quickly found her comrade sulking in her bed.

""Morana, I came to see how you were doing. With everything that happened, I was worried.""

""Well, thanks for the sentiment, but I'm doing terrible. I've served the emperor well for years, but after Earth, he doesn't trust me with conquering the Western planets. Now I have to play second fiddle to Cymbeline.""

As Evelyn heard Morana, she took a deep breath. ”It’s not that bad.” And she sat on her bed, opening her arms for a hug.

Morana accepted it. ”Really?”

""We all have our string of bad luck, my friend.”

""You're like the little sister I never had, Evelyn. Oh, and before I forget, congratulations on the promotion.”

""Thanks, I-""

An exquisite item on Morana's bed drew Evelyn's attention. It was a strapless red dress of unmatchable quality. Created by Daisy during her enslavement, its beauty mesmerized Evelyn, and Morana soon noticed.

""You know if you want the dress, you can have it.""

“I-I couldn't. It's too lovely.”

“Kid, take it. I have over a dozen more.”

Evelyn heeded Morana’s words and slowly reached for the dress. And as she got it, she marveled at its beauty, gripping it tightly in her arms.

“Gorgeous. Please, take care of whoever made this.”

Morana grew a cold, dead gaze, her mind filling with images of Daisy’s bloody death. ”Rest assured, I will.”

\*\*\*

The day of departure quickly came. Cymbeline had spared no expense, preparing his forces for the coming battle. However, several final checks still needed to be done for the invasion. He walked through the castle with his assistant, scanning his legion of personnel for the slightest flaw as they worked. He knew they were only as strong as their weakest link. But on that day, he wouldn’t tolerate any weak links.

“Shelia, the weapons?”

“The inventory report shows everything’s accounted for.”

“Medicine?”

“Same.”

“Diagnostics on the fleet?”

“Completed this morning, sir. Everything looks good.”

“General Morana?”

“She should be here within the hour.”

“Well, good. But now-“

Like thunder, a crashing sound traveled through the air. Cymbeline and Shelia quickly ran over to learn what was the cause. When they arrived, they saw a caucasian male human slave on the ground, collapsed next to a pile of supplies.

“What the chaos happened here?” Cymbeline asked.

A soldier ran to Cymbeline. ”We’re not sure, sir. The slave just collapsed out of nowhere.”

Another human slave ran over, going to the man and helping him stand. She was a slender caucasian woman of twenty-nine with long raven hair.

“It wasn’t out of nowhere. You worked this poor man to near death.”

“He’s a slave. He works, or he dies. And the same goes for you.”

“You took the words right out of my mouth, soldier,” Cymbeline said.

“I won’t do anything else until you give this man food and rest.”

*“I repeat, work or die,”* Cymbeline shouted.

“You wouldn’t dare.”

Eager to prove his threats had teeth, Cymbeline angrily called upon his dark powers. He summoned a fireball of forty meters in diameter, preparing to throw it at the two slaves. The other slaves in the chamber bellowed terrified screams as they saw him, the heat of his attack already stinging the flesh. But even as she was moments away from becoming ash, the woman stood fearless. And their salvation came as Shelia went in between them.

*“What are you doing?”* Cymbeline asked.

“I just ran the numbers, General Cymbeline. If you kill them, our workforce won’t be at full capacity.”

“We can’t order more slaves?”

“It would take too long. The mission would suffer delays.”

Cymbeline extinguished the fireball. ”Fine. Get the human food and water.”

“Don’t expect a thank you.” The human woman scowled at Cymbeline.

Cymbeline pointed at the human woman. “But in return, you woman will go two shifts without either.”

Him: not sure, i’m at the hospital today. I have some tests to do at 1:30pm. Is there something you need from me? (Still assuming it’s work related)

Me: Hey are you okay? (In response 

I just wanted to ask if you’re free to meet up since I’ll be there near your place later. We can have coffee or dinner. Oh and I also have tea!

Get well soon and take care! (Wasn’t hoping for anymore replies but surprised he still responded) 

Him: I’ll have to check. I’m having migraines and I still have to do some tests.

Me: What happened if you don’t mind me asking? 

Him: dunno, my migraine has been there for days. 

He proceeds to tell me about his health.

My last text was asking him about something health related which he didn’t reply to anymore. I also didn’t send a follow up text anymore even though I was concerned about him. 

I was low key hoping he’d accept my invite and I waited and waited but got disappointed that he probably didn’t want to see me. 

Still, I was happy that he was at least responsive. I thought he blocked me. But I still don’t know where things stand between us since our convo was so formal. 

I am really concerned with what he shared and want to ask him about his test results but I’m not sure if that’s okay or I should wait a day or two to check in on him. ",2,1752231095.0,lostafriend,1,0.75,False

# A Zomato driver

# Somewhere in Bangalore

*What?*

A horn blared right behind me as I noticed that the signal had turned green. The shouts of people stuck in traffic for the last few hours filled the atmosphere as an auto or two tried to force their way past me, having no patience. 

I revved my bike, quickly trying to make up for everyone’s lost time by veering to the side and letting the rest of the people pass. 

Moving over to the side of the road only led to me driving straight into a puddle of water which splashed into nearby pedestrians**.**



Hey! Get your head in the game.

The truth is, I was distracted. I was confused. The last 30 minutes of my journey caught me by surprise and I was clueless on how to react. 

Rain splattered on my face, making it difficult to drive fast. I needed to hurry to HQ, but an accident at this stage would only compromise me too. 

I needed to drop off the package. Where was it then? Would I tell HQ that something was wrong? If there was a mole, that would only make things worse. Better to act like everything is fine. But depositing an empty package would surely raise a few questions, so I had to come up with something fast. 

Wha-

Another horn, as I nearly hit a truck that suddenly braked, its rear lights a mere red haze in the rain. I fumbled with the button for the high beam. It was getting difficult to see in the rain. I had to leave quickly as another round of people swearing their faces off at me started. But one cry was more authoritative and louder than the rest - “Stop your vehicle now!”.

I groaned. A police officer. I slowed down and looked in the mirror. Luckily, it was only a single officer. A 5 minute delay at max. 

“What, driving like a movie star?”, he asked, his voice slick with sarcasm. I stayed silent, trying not to make him angrier than he needed to be. “Licence *yelli*?” he said in kannada, his voice official and stern. I quickly gave it to him and looked around**.** After staring at it for what seemed like an eternity, he eyed me up and down. “Raj?"". I nodded. ""Where’s the food being delivered to?” he asked in kannada, when he saw the huge ZOMATO sign on my bag. I told him the deliveries for the day were over and I was heading home. The lie was as fat as his bulging belly. 

The raindrops fell harder on my eyes, making it hard to look at anything. Driving anywhere would be tough.

Wait a second. Didn't I have a h- 

“Ay, where's your helmet?”The realization hit him at the same time. But I *DID have a helmet on the way to the house.* Where did it go? Dammit. I must have left it at the last pickup point, too distracted about the non-existence of the package. 

I gave him a sheepish smile, hoping a fine and a slap on the wrist would ensue, giving me time to go back, get the helmet and find a fake package to deliver at HQ.

“How much do I pay?” 

I gambled with that question. Bribes were not uncommon, and it would be better to prevent my name from getting in their system. Big mistake, I realized 5 minutes later, with an empty wallet. *Don't ask people who want money how much money they want. Who would have known?*

# MAHA BARBER SHOP

# Bangalore



“AYYYY, VIJAY!”

“What's up, girl?”

“All good here. How’s the family?”

“Kids have been asking me to get rid of the beard.” he replied with a smile. It was a visibly forced one, with a bead of sweat falling from his forehead. I laughed loudly, signalling him to sit in the only empty seat in the shop.

“A trim it is, then. Want a massage to go along with it? It’s gonna cool your nerves - I can’t imagine having eight-year-olds running around in your house will be too good for them.”“I wish I could, but I’m running late for an important… meeting.” Vijay stared at me intently, the gaze burning through his overworked-IT-guy glasses while he said this. The message was clear. *Quit the introduction. This is important, and I don’t have time.* 



“All right, *banni bega*.” I pointed him to his seat again and called my assistant over to work on my previous customer, to her dismay. I looked at her slightly annoyed face and said, ""Its a rush madam! Who knew everyone's hair would grow twice as fast normal this time?"" A couple of waiting customers laughed, easing the slight tension. I couldn't blame the lady for being angry though. The weather was keeping everyone on their toes. *The rain! Feels like the sky is cutting onions.* 

It honestly was unusually crowded for salon in a weekday afternoon. An HQ worker appearing in this time was rare too, especially with this weather.I started by spraying some water on his dry hair. As I was doing so, I debated how I would take things forward this time. There were innocent customers right beside his seat - no taking chances with that. *Slow and steady.* I adjusted the bangles on my hand.

“So, you know I went to a wedding recently. The groom had this clean fade I gave him, made him look 5 years younger than he was.”

“Hmm.”

The smell of clippers and hair wash filled the air as I waited for any sort of response.

“Remind you of anything?” I gave him a slight kick.

“Oh yeah, my own haircut. Your hands work magic, *akka*.”

“That’s right, they do.”

He sat up straighter. “Where are they living? The newlyweds.” I caught on to his tactics.

“Oh, you know, near 2nd cross. That road with that… Orchard Park, I think it's called. It's a nice house, sir. 30x40.”

“Oh, wow. You know, I was thinking of buying a plot.” 

“Where, sir?” *The location.*“Near that Qwik Mall. It’s a nice house. Bright blue in colour, with a large garden in front of it.”

Noted. 

“Oh really? The colour seems interesting.”

“Yeah, I’ll go there at around 5 in the evening today.”

“It looks like it’s going to rain today. Are you sure about that?”

“It’ll be fine. I’ll order some zomato for dinner in case it gets late.”



A zomato driver as a cover - for whoever is going to pick it up. The usual, then.

# THE ZOMATO DRIVER - RAJ

The rain was easing off slightly as I returned to the house. I tried remembering if the instructions I had received last night from the HQ guys were any different than normal. “The blue house beside the hardware store in the road behind Qwik Mall- be there at 5 in the afternoon, no later.”, that was about all I could recall. I saw the hardware store and slowed down. There was no mistaking it; the house was bright blue, standing out in the dull neighborhood like a birthday hat in a funeral. 

*Why was there no package?*

Whoever was providing the packages had never missed a deadline in my 6 years of working. And turning up empty handed to HQ would only set a target on my back for no reason.

I pulled over, thinking about where I would have left the helmet if I had forgotten it. I opened the gate and entered the front yard. The house was not just weird in its colour, but in design too. It looked small and lonely from a distance, only to realise it was quite the opposite when inside. There was a huge garden with plants so fresh it was clear they were cared for, a verandah with 2 chairs beside a coffee table, with a newspaper(now wet) half open on it. There were more plastic chairs stacked on each other close by. This was a lively place, used by a lot of people. Maybe there were regular meetings held here, a lot of people coming and going. Hardly the type of place one would associate with secret drops and pickups. *This might just be the worst Spot I’ve ever been to.*

As I walked through, I spotted my helmet hung on the edge of a single wooden chair just sitting in the middle of the garden. I must’ve been so preoccupied with the absence of a package that I forgot to notice the unusual position of the chair, let alone remember setting my helmet down on it. I quickly walked to the chair when I saw it.

The visor. It was open. And there was something inside.

*Shit.*  

# THE BARBER



I looked over at the clock. 4:45. When would the delivery boy come? I looked at the people waiting intently for their turn and smiled.

I finished Vijay's cut quickly and showed him the QR code for the payment. How were we going to end this? There was still that one piece of information I needed.

“Oh sorry *akka,* I need to go to the ATM to withdraw some cash for this. I don't have any change right now. I’ll pay you at around 5:15.” 

*Done.* I nodded and signalled one of the customers to come. I had half an hour for the pickup then. Half an hour and a whole bunch of anxious customers with horrible hair. 

Looks like I’ll have to rush this. Sorry, customers.

“Short *ah?”*The new customer, a middle-aged man, had a patch of grey hair which was fighting a devastating battle with the black. The bald patch on top of his head told me they would both eventually lose. 

“Yeah, short.”, he replied. 

I looked over as I was picking the scissors to see Vijay leaving. He seemed a little more tense than normal this time. *Must be some important package.* 

I went back to my customer and was about to start the process of trying to salvage something from his disastrous acne-filled mane when I heard a horn and a crash.

People’s screams filled the hallway as the waiting, bored customers unglued themselves from their phone screens to look at what had happened. 

“Someone dragged him off!”

“*Ay, kidnapping ah? Yeno idu?”*

My short stature was hardly ideal to be seen or heard in a situation, so I had to do it the silent way. I quickly ran upstairs to the old dirty warehouse. Coughing and covering my nose, I peered through the window, moving my hair out of the way of my eyes. The outside scene blurry due to the rain. 



All I saw was a hatchback driving quickly out of sight, almost crashing into some pedestrians as it briefly entered the sidewalk before returning to the road and driving away. Vijay was nowhere to be seen.

1lx3q13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1lx3q13/any_advice_on_my_gut_issues/,Any advice on my gut issues?,"
I am a 31 male. For last 5 years, I have had on and off gut and stool issues. Typical symptoms are gas, smelly gas, and yellow - loose stool. 

I saw a GI doctor almost 3 years ago and they did bloodwork and stool test - where everything came back normal. I even got a colonoscopy where they found nothing - not even a polyp.

So fast forward to this past May, I started to develop worse and worse gas, pretty consistent loose and yellow stools, gurgling in intestines after eating, and intestinal cramping that flares up and fades randomly through out the day. I have tried switching from coffee to tea (usually have caffiene on empty stomach when I’m fasted in morning), going to a low fiber diet, eating lots of kiefer and yogurt, avoiding foods that give me terrible gas like Brussels sprouts, onions, and oats - and have tried to make my stool look normal. Nothings helped that much and I am having so much gas cramps and looser stools. I feel as if there’s some bile acid malabsorption happening which is causing the loose stools. Sometimes I’ll eat blueberries or something at 9pm and will be pooping it out the following morning. Possible fast transit time? I don’t know. I have no pain after eating or any intestinal pain, just cramps. 

I went to my family doctor yesterday and they have sent me a referral to a GI doctor again but then also ordered at ton of tests. Full blood count, organ blood work, hepatitis check, auto immune disease check, and then checking for a host of other things for a stool test like c diff, parasites, fatty stool, and more. 

Last, she ordered an abdominal X-ray which I don’t want to do or understand why I need one? She knows I have just had a colonoscopy and I’m not constipated. For financial reasons I’d prefer to wait for xray once all my blood and stool results come back. 

One - do you think it’s wise to hold off on xray until results? And two - anyone have any ideas of what could be going on with me. I just had blood work done in March and everything came back normal for a routine/yearly physical check up. ",6,1752230949.0,Microbiome,9,1.0,False

One night, It was the next night after I went to a party. Apollon and Poseidon, unprompted out of nowhere, made their presence known. Pretty much a reminder that they are still there watching over me.

So after this, I had decided to wear some stuff that honors them, especially when I go out. A few days ago, a mouse got in the house. Only my dad saw it and it peed in his coffee filters and then left. No where to be found and I get this strong sense that Apollon had his hand in it. I wouldnt be surprised though based off of the past I have with him.

So yesterday, I found this Artemis bust in a place that only carries Christian stuff when it comes to that type of decor and I didn't know it was her until after I bought it. My first thought was Artemis but I didn't fully know until I googled at home. It was odd that I found her, because I was looking for Apollon just to see if maybe by chance there would be something there.

So last night, I gave Artemis and offering under the full moon. I shared my green tea with honey with her. I didn't usually drink it because it was so bitter to me. But I left some of it in the cup and put it back in the fridge over night. (It was already cold when I offered it to her. I also cold brew my tea.) So, this morning I go to drink the rest of it and when I did it tasted sweeter. Maybe she accepted my offering!! ",2,1752230934.0,Hellenism,0,1.0,False

Trains, street names, shortcuts, I’ve got it. At least… I thought I did.

One day, I was walking downtown during lunch break, sipping my iced coffee and pretending I had my life together. A guy walks up to me, definitely a tourist. Backpack, camera, full “I’m not from here” vibe.

He goes, “Hey, sorry to bother you! Do you know how to get to Central Market?”

I don’t even hesitate. I point across the intersection like some confident urban guide and say, Yep, two blocks that way, take a right, you’ll see it.

He thanks me, walks off all trusting… and I strut away feeling like a local hero.

Here’s the problem:  
About 10 minutes later, I passed *Central Market*.  
It was in the complete *opposite* direction.

I stood there like.

Now I’m just picturing this poor man walking several blocks, probably confused, wondering if I was just a jerk or if “Central Market” was code for some secret entrance to Narnia.

I considered chasing him down to correct myself, but I had already committed to the bit, and I was also tired and mildly embarrassed.

Moral of the story?  
Sometimes confidence is just very loud, very organized wrongness.  
Also, I no longer give directions unless I can *see* the location from where I’m standing.

1lx3kie,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1lx3kie/a_view_from_the_other_side/,A view from the other side,"Howdy folks. I wanted to talk about my perspective on tipping culture. I've spent years in the industry in a city that has a tipping expectation, and I think I have a reasonable take on it. I would like to hear your perspective.

The tip culture is inherently inhospitable, and I think it needs a bit of a change in perspective from the customers, employees, and business owners. But I think the role it plays in the industry is valuable and should not be overlooked. That being said way too many businesses are offering tip prompts when they really shouldn't be. Takeout pizza slices? Fancy groceries? That's too far. (But I'll always tip well for a good coffee, because most people make terrible lattes)

Let's get into the issues and I'll share what I think is a reasonable solution. 

Issue #1 is the labour costs already nearly bankrupt restaurants. Even busy ones. And if you were to pay wait staff a living wage regardless of business that would make it even harder to stay afloat. Restaurants have a huge failure rate as is. And I don't want to see them disappear, they offer something valuable to the community. Often times the ones that are most loved by the locals are most at risk of closing down. 

#2 is tipping is inherently inhospitable. People should leave feeling good. It's an awful song and dance. Customers shouldn't have to think about that. 

#3 guests usually have no idea what good service is. And should not be in a position to judge that. At the same time most servers also have no idea how to serve well, and also aren't in a position to define how much they deserve. It should be a managers/owners responsibility to maintain that standard. 

#4 Even if restaurants could afford to pay a good flat wage, that offers no incentive to employees to work busy nights. People definitely deserve to be rewarded for hard work. And I would hate to work at place where people fight over who gets the slower shifts. 

#5 Servers are expected to tip out a portion of their earnings to the team. Typically 5-8%. Which makes tipping almost mandatory. 

My solution is a commission on sales. With some of that value going directly to the salesperson, and some of that pooled with the whole team. Priced into the menu with no surprises. Acting pretty much identical to a tip in pay structure. Business can remain open on slower days this way. Guests don't feel compelled to owe anyone anything in addition. Servers make an identical living to what they make now. I understand some of you think servers make too much money, and maybe in some cases they do. But there is a high turn over rate for a reason. Even people earning over 6 figures without any formal education sometimes quit suddenly because it's an extremely stressful job. Its long hours on your feet, sometimes very late into the night/morning. And you have to manage dozens of variables in a timely fashion without displaying stress. 

The only way restaurants are going to be able to remain unique and high quality is if labour costs don't go up. And I want these restaurants in my community.

The only way to keep quality staff in the industry long term is if they make a competitive wage. I want a higher standard of service, and not a bunch of young junkies offloading responsibility to support staff. As we too often see.

The experience that customers deserve should not include them having to awkwardly determine how good or bad the service is. Good service is usually invisible. Less inturuption is the goal. If you're food, drinks and tableware arrive at the appropriate tempo for the speed you're eating at its because a server is managing their section well. But the guests shouldn't have to think about that. They should get to enjoy their company, and chill out. They should also know that if they left feeling happy and everything went smooth then they have nothing more to ask from wait staff. They're not entertainers. And they don't owe you better manners than you show them. If things didn't go well you should feel welcome communicate that with the Management. It should be their job to make sure guests are getting their money's worth out of the service. There are way too many awful entitled servers, and way too many awful entitled guests. We deserve better from one another, and we deserve to have exciting and creative restaurants in our neighborhood. The financial model should reflect that with wage flexibility, standardized rates, and better training and education. 

Does this seem reasonable and fair?

* Port Klang and KLIA provide excellent export capacity

Here’s why that fails:

❌ Wrong language tones (Bahasa Malaysia vs. Indonesian)  
❌ Missed keywords in **Manglish**, Mandarin, or Tamil search  
❌ Misunderstood buyer psychology (Malaysians love reviews and FREE shipping)

# 🛠️ The Winning Formula to Sell Online in Malaysia

**🔑 Product-Platform Fit:**  
What works on Shopee may not work on TikTok Shop. Tailor your offer.

**🔍 Keyword Localization:**  
Don’t just translate—**tropicalize** your listing (yes, that’s a thing).

**📦 Fast Fulfillment:**  
Use regional warehouses for same-day delivery in Klang Valley or J&T Express for nationwide coverage.

**📱 Social Proof & Influencers:**  
Malaysians trust KOLs (key opinion leaders). Use TikTok + Instagram short videos.

It will be a long post. Sorry for my eventual mistakes as English is not my 1st language. I'm posting this from a throwaway account.

**I would like to introduce some of my background.**

I am a straight male in my mid 20s. I was born and spent my childhood and teen years in one of the Eastern European countries. I miss the place when I was born, it was my home. However, generally speaking, it wasn't a good place to live a normal and happy life. The society wasn't healthy, many people around me were cruel and insensitive. A lot of families were deeply traumatized by communism times and by WW2. There were many issues unfamiliar to most Westerners.

My parents were raised in even more cruel and toxic conditions. They were trying to survive and make sense of life, and they found their comfort and answers in church. I believe, religion really helped them when they were young. So, I was a child of Christians. I knew the whole Bible story, and it seemed to be very real and normal for me since my very early childhood. I think I had some sort of ""relationship with Jesus"". It definitely played a role in my emotional self-regulation. It is good to know that you have eternal life. However, I didn't really feel that church was my home and the outside world wasn't.

I wasn't extremely sheltered like many Christian kids. I attended a regular school and later went to university (except for my first four years of education, which I spent in a Christian elementary school). My parents weren't anti-intellectualists or bigots, they actually were (and are) pretty open-minded about many things. But I cant's say that in my childhood they were progressive Christians. I was introduced in some weird and harmful ideas. They were a part of Evangelical world, and they definitely absorbed a lot of its theology and culture. It had a massive impact on my childhood, my teen years, and my entire life.

My family was in some way dysfunctional. There were certain features of authoritarian parenting. I wasn't assured enough that I am unconditionally loved, that I am a complete and normal human being. I wasn't taught many of necessary social skills, or how to take care of myself, how to process emotions, how to resolve conflicts, etc. Not to mention such things as sex education. There weren't enough playing, learning with open mind and gradually given freedom to me. My main motivation, probably, was to survive and please my caregivers. Corporal punishment definitely traumatized and damaged me. My parents often argued with each other and with me. It seems that my father suffered from depression for years.

I heard some devastating statements from my parents. The one that was repeated pretty often was about my supposed ungratefulness to them. Once, when I was around 13-14 years old, they told me, that, probably I was their greatest mistake. They told me that, because as a teen I was already so depressed, anxious and dissociated, that I was spending hours playing video games. They didn't recognize that my issues and my mental state weren't my conscious choice, but a result of surrounding my life difficulties, my traumas, and their parenting style.

I know they loved and love me, and I believe they did their best. We discussed many things, and they absolutely recognize their mistakes now. Our relations are good enough at the moment. They understand me, and I understand and love them.

My grandparents were really dysfunctional, they were not religious, but they were extremely difficult and dysregulated persons. The amount of emotional abuse they did to my parents and me is difficult to overestimate. They had, mostly, a negative impact on my development as a child. I know it may sounds crazy, but I loved them, and I believe they loved me too. They just were deeply damaged persons.

I was heavily bullied at school as a kid. It seems that I couldn't fight back because I was afraid of physical pain (because of spanking as discipline?) and also I was afraid of punishment as a consequence of my actions, I was afraid to brake the rules of good behavior - good Christians (or just good kids) do not fight. Maybe I was involved in some fight once and got punished, and after that I just tended to run away or to ask my bullies to left me alone. I also was pretty thin and not too strong physically. It resulted in quite a devastating experience. It made me an anxious and lonely teen with a low self-esteem and a lot of insecurities. I had trust issues and difficulties to find friends. It took me many, many years to actually realize what had happened to me, to name it, and understand how painful and damaging it was. I am realizing now that I have spent tens and hundreds of hours to think, read, and research about almost any of my issues, but not about school bullying. It was just to shocking and unbearable, that my consciousness probably just numbed the memory about that.

My early romantic experiences also were not very successful. I had painful rejections. I wasn't popular among girls, so I mostly lived in my dreams instead of going and asking someone out. As a teen I felt very little confidence, most of girls that I liked seemed to be ""out of me league"". Those experiences weren't really encouraged by my parents. However, it seems that they were motivated more by their anxiety about me and their own insecurities than by the religious dogma on dating, sex, etc.

I have never really been interested in girls and women in church, they always seemed to be too naive, too ""good behaving"", lacking of their own personalities, none of them were sexually attractive to me. At the same time I felt that it is pointless to approach girls ""from world"" because this part of life was strictly controlled be church (date only Christians, date only if you are planning to marry this person, no sex before marriage). It just wouldn't be accepted by people that had control over my life at that time.

It is so strange when I am trying to remember my past, or to clearly verbalize what actually happened to me, or what is wrong with me. **This pain, this suffocating feeling has been present with me for as long as I can remember, but at the same time it is so difficult to say what was wrong or when it has started.** I remember feeling ashamed, guilty, anxious, defective, constantly bored, unworthy of anything good. I remember being powerless, unnoticeable when I needed attention, left alone with my struggles. I hated myself and often hated others. I had been feeling this since my earliest years, but I only began to understand and name those things when I was around 18-20 years old.

At the same time I remember, that despite all of the burden, I was able to have fun as a kid, I wanted to live, and generally I felt comfort in my family. **This strange mix of being in hell and being a normal child was (and still is) so confusing.** As a kid I was so excited every time I was watching a movie or if I saw an airplane in the sky. Now I feel like I have to consciously force myself to feel good. A few years ago, I had a powerful experience with cannabis, that gave me that pure and warm feeling of child trill and being present at the moment, the opposite feeling of dissociation and emotional numbness. It reminded me that it’s possible to feel good again, to feel normal.

Somehow, my life turned that way, that I spent the last several years in a small, pretty cult-like church. Because of different reasons my social circle was gradually limited to the church members, and I developed a kind of friendship with the pastor. He told me once that the most dangerous thing to a young man like me is a non-believing ungodly woman. I also saw him naked several times, when he was changing his clothes being in the same room with me (he did not ask me if it is ok, and I did not give him my consent). Lol.

Now I think, that being exposed to church doctrines and living inside its subculture made my healing process almost impossible. It was very unhealthy place, especially for a vulnerable and traumatized person which I had become in a relatively young age.

A lot has happened in the world over the past several years - the Covid pandemic, the rise of Christian nationalism and the political right, the war in Europe, etc. The way that conservative, ""Bible believing"" churches reacted to those events was quite shocking. I also did a lot of my ""homework"", trying to understand why some people believe and some don't. I started answering the questions that had disturbed me for years. I began reading Bible as an every other book and I noticed some insane stuff there. I couldn’t unsee what I had seen in the church. Bigotry, black and white thinking, controlling behavior - after many years of moderate to severe discomfort and feeling of ""being not in the right place"" it became unbearable. I felt imprisoned, robbed from my autonomy, unable to heal and live my own life the way that I decide how to do that. I could not anymore associate myself with those people, their beliefs and lifestyle. I left the church. It was a great relief.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Now I am in my mid 20s, I recently came to the US. In some sense I am starting my life over again,** I actually sometimes feel like a ""born again"" (shoutout Born Again Again podcast!). Now I definitely fill more free and ""at home"" in this world. I also realized that, most likely, I have only one life and that I am the only one responsible for it.

However I still feel very confused, insecure, ""robbed"" from my childhood and teen years. I have a chronic physical condition that affects my everyday life (it was so misunderstood by my former church fellows because it is a kind of invisible illness), I also struggle with my mental health and unresolved traumas (both religion and non-religion related). I suffer from loneliness and lack of emotional and physical intimacy. I worked with a counselor on many things and it helped a lot, but it is still present - grief, anger, insecurities, there are a lot of things to work on. 

It seems that a typical faith deconstruction story involves moving out from a small conservative place to a large liberal city. In my case it was kind of opposite. I lived in large cities before, and because of belonging to church I constantly felt that I am missing out my life, fun time, my development as a complete person. Now I live in a pretty low populated area. It is not very small place, but it is far from a diverse megapolis with countless opportunities to make connections. It is difficult to make friends and date someone here not just because of my background, but also because there are not too many options. However I have reasons to stay here at least for the next several years.

**I met one girl at some community event.** She seemed to be an interesting person, she was attractive, confident and she seemed to be genuine. We didn't talk a lot because it was more like a group activity, so we just learned our names and had a good time with a group. 

Some time later I unexpectedly met her at one coffee shop. She worked there. We talked a bit, smiled, and I felt like it was a pleasant conversation for both of us.

I am not extremely confident person, but compared to my childhood and teen years my social skills and emotional intelligence are way more developed now. Probably I learned to appreciate and accept myself at least partly, despite being bullied during my school years and despite all the religious ideas (a person's worthlessness as a sinner, external validation by a perfect, all-powerful being, etc). But the wounds are not healed completely. It is still painful to remember bulling (nightmares about that haunted me for years), I still have a lot of confusion about relationships, dating and sex. Because of the fact that my romantic and sexual experiences are small and not very exciting or healthy, I do not feel good as a man. I think there is nothing bad in being alone or in celibacy if it is a person's conscious choice, but in my case it is just suffering from loneliness.

I went to the coffee shop again, we talked, we were nice to each other, and it seemed that we again enjoyed our small talk. I decided to do what I have been avoiding for years. I texted her and communicated that I am interested in her. She answered politely that she recently ended her long-time relationship and she wants to be alone. I said ""ok, that is fine"", and I actually felt this way at that moment. Her answer didn't make me feel bad. I was happy that I approached her. I felt confident and was really grateful for this small, but pleasant and uncommon for me experience. 

Probably I should have taken her answer more seriously and left her alone, but I went back again. I explained that by telling myself that there is the best coffee in town, and that I had been going there before I met her (which is completely true). We talked, smiled and laughed, and I felt like she was flirting with me, but very slightly and innocently. Probably she did it not intentionally, if she did at all. I felt like I was getting mixed signals.

I went there again. We exchanged our Instagrams. She mentioned having coffee together. I asked her to clarify the coffee part, and she said that we can have coffee together as friends. I think, I misread her messages. I should not interpreted her flirting, or her ""being friends"" or ""coffee together"", as a sign of her romantic interest in me or as a real desire to continue talking, meeting, etc. I probably haven’t fully learned the American cultural norms yet. Words and actions can mean different things in different languages.

At that moment I started doing questionable things. I was super excited, full of hopes, and I felt very alive. That was the first time in many years that I liked someone so much, probably because I let myself to feel that way. I obviously became obsessed with her, or better to say with my imagination about her. I just did what I felt right to do, and there wasn't any controlling institution over me. I also, maybe for the first time, didn't feel any confusion about the sexual part - I felt attracted to her both romantically and sexually, and I didn't feel any shame or fear about that. I felt like a normal human being.

I texted her the same day, trying to show my outstanding sense of humor (not sure if she appreciated that), giving compliments, etc. Her replies were pretty slow and distant. I again communicated that I like her. She responded as politely as the last time, and said that we can be friends. 

Something clicked in my brain. I remembered how I was friend-zoned as a teen, and how I developed romantic interest in some of my female friends. I decided that being her friend and seeing how she dates someone in future will be too painful for me. So, I said that I am actually not ok to be just friends. Did I misunderstand the meaning of ""being friends""? Was it just a polite way to say ""thank you, goodbye""? She responded that she understands me.

I felt confused, I couldn't think about anything or anyone else. After several days I texted her, apologizing about my eventual pressure, and saying that actually I am happy to be friends. I should have stopped doing awkward things and accepted the fact that she was not interested in me. But I have already developed some emotional fixation. I just wanted to see her, and I went to the coffee shop again. She was polite but definitely distant. Some time later I texted her a question, but she didn’t respond.

I went there a few times later, she always was nice but all her expressions lacked that warmth and openness like before. She seemed to be confident and in control, I felt silly and dependent on her. I think one of the reasons I liked her so much was that initially I felt noticed by her. I allowed myself to have an external source of validation which I adored, and it felt so good and so rare for me.

I messaged her again once, but she didn’t respond. I hate ghosting, and I think it’s disrespectful in most cases - not sure what kind of case this was.

I decided to stop going there and bothering her. It was too evident that I was behaving like someone who didn’t respect her, but first of all - who didn't respect himself. I imagined myself being in her place - being at work and unable to avoid someone's unwanted attention. I felt quite disgusted with my behavior.

Despite my energy and emotions being drained, despite the ""hangover"" or the harsh return to reality after that experience, I'm still kind of glad that I had it. I felt alive, and it seemed like normality is possible for me.

I am worried about one important thing. Maybe I am overthinking that, but maybe I am not. I mentioned that I live in a pretty low-populated place. I have an impression that many people know each other here, and it is difficult to be ""invisible"" or ""start over"" at this place. I don't think that I have done something unforgivable, and I don't feel very ashamed right now. However I am sure, that at some point I made that girl feel very uncomfortable. **I am worried about my reputation.** I wouldn’t want to be seen as a creep or a stalker, or just a guy who can’t respectfully walk away, even though I understand I might have given that impression.

I am not sure what should I do and think at this moment. I definitely have some things to reflect and work on.

I still think about her. She still takes a space inside my mind and heart, that no one else can take right now. That experience drained me. I’m not sleeping well, I’m eating less, and I think I’m having a depressive episode.

Thank you very much for reading my story. Feel free to comment it or give any advice if you have one. I wish you all peace and comfort in your lives. Love and be loved!",3,1752230132.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

# Chapter 1

Liora and Carmen were a famously toxic couple, known as bitter enemies across every pack.

Though destined mates, they hated each other’s guts, and yet their mate bond kept pulling them back together.

In the first year after sealing the mate bond, he strutted around with an Omega stripper in public. She responded by smashing his million-dollar luxury car into pieces immediately.

In the second year after sealing the mate bond, he locked her in the pack kitchen’s walk-in freezer for an entire day. She retaliated by shoving him, who couldn’t swim, into the pack house’s pool.

In the third year after sealing the mate bond, he stayed out all night, stirring up scandals. She roamed bars all night long, dragging him back home.

By day, they cursed and insulted each other. By night, they were unrestrainedly intimate in bed. Every second, they seemed to be praying for the other to die.

And in their fifth year, Alpha Carmen’s wish came true.

Liora died.

She died on her birthday, stabbed thirty-three times by a rogue wearing a mask who burst into her house.

The agony tore through every inch of her body as her consciousness began to fade.

She tried to scream, but all that came out was a soft whimper.

“Carmen…”

She whispered his name, trembling fingers reaching for the phone that had fallen nearby. Summoning every last ounce of her strength, she dialed his number.

He didn’t answer the first time, so she called again. Still no answer, she dialed a third time.

She didn’t know how many times she called before he finally picked up.

“Cam…”

She had barely spoken the first syllable when his voice cut through the line, cold and annoyed.

“Liora, have you lost your mind? Do you have to keep calling? I don’t have time to fight with you today. Evelynne’s back, I’m going to pick her up.”

“Beep. Beep.”

The line went dead with a busy signal. Carmen had already hung up and completely powered off his phone.

Just like that, with that same unbearable impatience he always had with her, he ended the call. And the last thing Liora ever wanted to say to him died in her throat.

“Carmen… I… I’m dying. Just this once… can we not fight?”

The phone slipped from her fingers and clattered to the ground. Its screen dimmed slowly. She let out a bitter laugh, and her hand fell limp.

When she regained consciousness, she found herself standing at the Bridge of Echoes, a mystical place much like the River Lethe. Crossing it would erase all memories of the past.

Beneath her flowed a deep, swirling river that seemed to swallow everything whole.

The Moon Goddess stood before her, holding a bowl of potion.

“Drink it, then you can forget your past and start anew.”

Liora took the potion and drank it all in one go.

But nothing changed. Her memories remained, sharp and vivid.

She drank a second bowl. Then a third, all the way to the tenth. But she still hadn’t forgotten a thing.

“Moon Goddess, did you water this stuff down?” she asked with a bitter smile.”

The Moon Goddess sighed. “Your obsession runs too deep. What is it you just can’t let go of?”

What couldn’t I let go of?

Liora closed her eyes, and they began to tremble.

She, Carmen, and Evelynne had grown up together.

She and Evelynne had both been childhood sweethearts to Carmen. But Carmen had only ever loved Evelynne. He believed she was his true mate.

He stayed by Evelynne’s bedside when she had a fever, watching over her all night.

He would sneak out of the pack in the middle of the night just to buy her favorite strawberry ice cream.

Whenever he looked at Evelynne, his eyes brimmed with deep, lingering affection.

But Liora wanted Carmen’s attention too.

So, to catch his eye, she constantly butted heads with him.

Over time, they became bitter enemies.

Even though they were fated mates, they just couldn’t get along.

Then Luna Emery, Carmen’s grandmother and the former Luna, forced Carmen to make Liora his mate by threatening her own life.

Carmen fought it, but in the end, he had no choice but to obey.

He never understood why.

Until the night of their mating ceremony, when he accidentally discovered Liora’s diary, filled cover to cover with love notes written only for him.

Only then did he realize the truth. She had truly loved him. So she refused to accept his rejection.

From that moment on, he convinced himself she was behind it all, that she had used his grandmother to force the bond and ruin his chance to choose his own mate as his Luna.

And from that moment on, he hated her with all his heart.

But what he didn’t know was this that after he had been attacked by a rogue and left in a coma, the pack doctor diagnosed and warned he might become a vegetable and never wake again.

Hearing the news, his beloved Evelynne left the pack immediately.

Only Liora stayed. Even though she had no idea whether he would ever wake, she came to the pack doctor and cared for him, wipe his face, talk to him even when he couldn't respond.

Her devotion moved his grandmother so deeply that the moment he woke, she rushed to have them seal the mate bond, terrified he’d miss his chance at a mate who loved him truly.

Liora had wanted to tell him the truth so many times.

But every time she looked into his eyes, those eyes filled with hatred, she couldn’t say a word.

And those who couldn’t let go of their past are not allowed to reincarnate.

The Moon Goddess shared in her memories and sighed.

“Your obsession has trapped you. You can’t enter the next life. So, I’ll give you another chance. You may return to the living world for five days. If, in that time, you can make Carmen say the words ‘I love you’, you may live again. If not… you must let go and move on.”

Liora froze.

Her lips parted, about to speak, but the Moon Goddess had already snapped her fingers.

A cool breeze swept over Liora. Everything went dark and her consciousness faded again.

When she opened her eyes again, she was back in the familiar pack house.

The floor was soaked with blood. And on it lay her own body, cold and lifeless. She died with unfulfilled wish as her eyes wide open.

Liora’s heart clenched. She crouched and tremblingly reached out to touch the familiar face. The moment her fingertips brushed against the icy skin, she jerked her hand back.

Her throat felt choked, breath coming with difficulty.

She had spent her whole life trying to get Carmen to say “I love you.”

Now she only had five days.

How could she possibly make it happen?

But deep within her, a faint voice struggled.

It was her wolf, Lena, persuading her, “What if? What if he really does say it?”

Now was not the time for self-pity.

She had to deal with the situation before her.

First, she bent down and dragged her own corpse to the wardrobe, step by agonizing step.

The weight of her body nearly suffocated r, but she dared not stop.

Not until she had shoved it inside the wardrobe and shut the door.

Only then did she finally breathe.

Then she fetched a bucket of water, knelt on the floor, and began carefully scrubbing the bloodstains away with a rag.

Every wipe sent a fresh stab of pain through her heart.

The bloodstains on the floor felt like the wounds between her and Carmen, impossible to erase and deeply etched in her memory.

Just as she finished wiping away the last trace, a voice rang out from behind, cold and full of contempt.

“Liora. What the hell are you doing?”

Her whole body went rigid. The rag slipped from her hand and dropped to the floor.

She turned around slowly and saw Carmen standing in the doorway.

He was dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit that made him look even more noble and aloof.

But his eyes were full of disgust and impatience.

Liora stared at him, feeling as if a lifetime had passed since she last saw him.

Her throat moved, but no sound came out.

Because Carmen was not alone. Behind him stood Evelynne.

Dressed in white, blonde curls cascading over her shoulders, she looked gentle and elegant.

But the moment her eyes landed on Liora, her face turned ghostly pale, eyes wide with terror.

She even instinctively took a few steps back as if she’d seen something dreadful.

It had only been a few years, Liora couldn’t understand why Evelynne made such an extreme reaction.

Evelynne’s behavior was unusually abnormal.

Even Carmen seemed to notice something was wrong.

Afraid she might fall, he hurriedly reached out to steady her. “Evelynne, what’s wrong?”

Evelynne clutched his arm tightly, trying to keep herself composed.

“It’s nothing… I just smelled blood. It made me a little uncomfortable.”

Carmen immediately turned his gaze to Liora, his disdain deepening.

“Liora, don’t you feel restless unless you’re causing trouble every day? It’s been five years. When will you finally calm down? What will it take for you to finally stop causing trouble?”

Liora stood still, looked him in the eye calmly, and answered, word by word,

“If you want me to stop, Carmen, then say one thing to me. Say ‘I love you.’ ”

# Chapter 2

Liora’s voice was soft, barely audible, yet it seemed it had taken every ounce of strength she had. Her eyes shimmered with hope.

But Carmen merely let out a cold laugh, the corners of his mouth curling into a mocking sneer.

“I love you? Do you think you're worthy of that?”

Then he turned to Evelynne. “Evelynne, you’re the only one I love.”

Evelynne stood behind him, a shy blush rising to her cheeks.

“Carmen, don’t say that. It’ll hurt Liora’s feelings.”

But Carmen didn’t care in the slightest. His voice remained cold and sharp. “If she really cared about feelings, she wouldn’t have forced me to seal the mate bond with her in the first place.”

With that, he took Evelynne’s hand. “Don’t bother with her. Come on. Let me show you around. You can have any room in the pack house you like.”

It felt like someone had stabbed Liora right through the chest. Her heart twisted painfully, making it hard to breathe.

She suddenly stepped in front of them, her voice trembling. “What are you doing?”

Carmen stared at her with icy indifference, not a trace of warmth in his tone. “Evelynne just returned to the pack. Her old place is still being cleaned, so she’ll be staying here for a few days. And you, Liora, stop pretending to be the Luna. Don’t forget, if it weren’t for your manipulations, that title would’ve been hers.”

The color drained from Liora’s face instantly, as if she had just been slapped.

In the past, she would’ve shouted, argued, fought him tooth and nail. But now, she just felt tired.

All she could do was stand there and watch as Carmen walked past her hand-in-hand with Evelynne, like she was nothing more than a stranger.

At dinner, Carmen and Evelynne sat close together, acting intimate, as if Evelynne were the true Luna of the pack house.

They whispered and laughed, and Liora was completely ignored.

She sat quietly, lowering her head, mechanically lifting food to her mouth. But everything tasted like ash.

Carmen’s scornful laugh and Evelynne’s delicate giggles echoed in her ears like needles stabbing her heart. The pain was suffocating.

Later that night, as she was about to go to bed, Liora accidentally overheard Evelynne speaking on the phone in the hallway.

“Didn’t I tell you to kill her? Why is she still alive, perfectly fine?”

Liora froze. Her heart plummeted. The glass of water in her hand slipped and shattered on the floor with a sharp crack.

Startled by the sound, Evelynne turned around, her face instantly pale.

“You were the one who hired that rogue?” Liora’s voice trembled. Her eyes were wide with disbelief. “How could you do that? We were friends once…”

Evelynne’s lips parted, about to explain, but then her eyes caught something over Liora’s shoulder, and her expression shifted. Without warning, she threw herself to the floor, letting out a pitiful cry.

Carmen came running at the sound immediately.

He saw Evelynne on the ground, Liora standing over her, and fury surged through him. He shoved Liora aside.

“What the hell are you doing?”

Evelynne grabbed his arm, her eyes welling with tears. “Carmen, don’t blame her. Maybe… maybe she was just upset because you told me you loved me earlier. If it helps her feel better to take it out on me, it’s okay… I’ll be fine.”

Hearing that, Carmen turned a seething glare on Liora, as if he were staring at his greatest enemy.

But in front of Evelynne, he restrained himself, not wanting to scare her. Instead, he bent down, gently scooped her up in his arms, and said softly, “Let me get you some medicine.”

Liora stood frozen as she watched them disappear down the hallway. Bitterness churned inside her.

She returned to her room in silence and pulled out the first aid kit, quietly tending to her wounds alone.

There was a deep gash on her wrist, from where Carmen had shoved her earlier. Since she had returned from death, her wolf natural healing powers had vanished. Now, her wounds healed slowly.

The disinfectant stung, but not nearly as much as the ache in her heart.

Just as she finished dressing the wound, Carmen pushed the door open and walked in.

His expression was dark with anger, and his tone carrying accusation.

“You can’t go a day without stirring up trouble, can you?”

Liora looked up at him, her eyes red. “Yeah. So what are you going to do about it?”

Carmen didn’t answer. His eyes darkened, flickering with a dangerous gleam.

Liora recognized that look.

It was the prelude to every night of their passionate intimacy for countless times.

Sure enough, the next second, he stormed toward her, seized her wrists, and shoved her down onto the bed.

He tore at her clothes, hands rough and unfeeling, treating her like nothing more than an outlet for his rage.

Liora winced in pain, her brows furrowing, but she gritted her teeth, refusing to make a sound.

Her body was trapped beneath him, completely under his control. She couldn’t move, couldn’t fight back, could only endure as he thrust and take what he wanted.

His breath grazed her ear, his voice cold and cruel. “Liora, don’t ever dream of getting my love.”

Liora shut her eyes. Silent tears slid down her cheeks.

As it was nearing the end, her voice rasped, barely more than a whisper.

“Carmen… I love you.”

Carmen buried his face in her neck, but when he heard her words, he paused for a moment, and then he let out a cold laugh.

“But I hate you.”

With that, he stood up and walked into the bathroom, leaving her lying alone on the bed, cold and desperate.

# Chapter 3

When Liora opened her eyes again, there was no one beside her.

But her first thought wasn’t what a beautiful morning, it was, this is day four of the countdown.

Time was the Sword of Damocles to her, ready to drop at any moment and push her into the abyss for good.

She threw off the covers and headed into the bathroom. The splash of cold water on her face cleared her mind slightly.

As she stepped out of her room, the soft clinking of silverware came from the dining hall. Following the sound, she saw Evelynne seated at the table, enjoying breakfast.

Evelynne looked up and smiled gently. Her tone was sweet.

“Liora, you’re awake? Carmen’s out. He was going to skip the pack meeting to accompany me to the auction today, but I didn’t want him to neglect his pack duties just for me. It took a lot of convincing to finally get him out the door.”

She paused, then added with a subtle lilt in her voice, “I need someone to go with me. Why don’t you come with me instead?”

Liora frowned, instinctively wanting to reject.

But Evelynne seemed to see straight through her and slowly set down her coffee cup.

“If you don’t come with me,” she said lightly, “I’ll just call Carmen and tell him you pushed me down the stairs on purpose.”

Liora’s fingers curled into fists, her nails digging deep into her palms. Her wolf growled low in her chest.

She knew what Evelynne was capable of, and she knew just how much Carmen trusted her. If Evelynne really said that, he’d believe her without a moment’s hesitation.

Liora didn’t have the time to explain, let alone argue. She still needed Carmen to say those three words, “I love you.” She couldn’t afford a confrontation with him now.

So she forced herself to nod coldly. “Fine. I’ll go with you.”

The car sped down the road to the auction house. Liora sat in silence, while Evelynne sat beside her, occasionally glancing at her phone with a faint, unreadable smile tugging at her lips.

Suddenly, the car screeched to a halt.

A black van had swerved in front of them, blocking the road.

Before they could react, several masked men rushed over, yanked open the doors, and dragged them out. They were thrown into the van with no explanation.

Darkness closed in.

Liora could only hear Evelynne’s shrill screams and the heavy breathing of the kidnappers. Their scent was unfamiliar. They weren’t from any pack in this territory.

Ropes soaked in wolfbane bound her wrists tightly, the sting of it burning her skin and making her wince in pain.

The van bumped along for what felt like forever before finally coming to a stop. The two of them were dragged out and hauled to the edge of a cliff.

The leader pulled off his mask, revealing a cold face.

Liora immediately recognized him. It was Alpha Robert from the bluemoon pack, the Alpha who Carmen had just taken down recently.

“Robert?” Liora frowned. “What are you trying to do?”

Robert let out a cold laugh, hatred burning in his eyes.

“What am I trying to do? Carmen swallowed up my pack. Now I’ll make sure he loses the one he loves.”

Liora’s heart sank suddenly. “Robert, calm down. There’s still room to fix this. This doesn’t have to end like this.”

“Calm down?” Robert’s voice rose sharply. “I can’t calm down! Carmen destroyed everything I had. I’ll return the favor.”

After that, with a wave of his hand, a few kidnappers immediately shoved Liora and Evelynne toward the cliff’s edge.

The sea below roared in black waves, crashing violently against the rocks. It looked like a giant, gaping maw, waiting to devour everything.

Then Robert took out his phone and dialed Carmen’s number.

“Alpha Carmen,” he said once the call connected, “I’ve got your two women. You’ve got one hour. Pick one. The other goes into the sea. Remember, you only get to save one.”

There was silence on the other end for a moment.

Then came Carmen’s voice, cold and sharp. “Robert, if you lay a hand on either of them, I’ll make sure you wish you were dead.”

Robert laughed darkly. “You’re not in a position to threaten me anymore. One hour, Carmen. I’m waiting.”

He ended the call.

Liora’s heartbeat pounded in her ears.

She knew exactly Carmen would choose Evelynne.

She had already accepted being the one left behind. But even so, the ache that swelled in her chest couldn’t be stopped.

One hour later, Carmen appeared at the cliffside.

His gaze swept past Liora and Evelynne, then locked onto Robert. His voice was cold.

“Robert, let them go.”

Robert sneered. “I told you, Alpha Carmen. You only get to save one. Choose. Time’s almost up.”

Carmen’s gaze shifted between Liora and Evelynne.

Finally, he said coldly, “I’m not choosing. Because I’m taking them both. I’m not leaving anyone behind.”

Liora froze in place, stunned.

Even Evelynne’s eyes widened in shock, as if she couldn’t believe what she’d just heard.

# Chapter 4

“You hate me, don’t you?” Liora couldn't help but speak, her voice trembling slightly. “Then why didn’t you leave me behind?”

Carmen glanced at her coldly. “Yeah, I hate you. But right now, you’re still my Luna. I’m not like you. I wouldn’t stoop so low as to ignore someone’s life just to make a point.”

Liora’s heart clenched, as if something sharp had stabbed straight through it.

Liora opened her mouth, but nothing came out.

Robert, enraged by Carmen’s refusal to choose, suddenly shoved Evelynne toward the edge of the cliff.

“Pick one! Or I’ll throw them both off!”

Carmen’s eyes turned glacial. He took a step forward, voice low and threatening. “Robert, if you lay a finger on either of them, I’ll make sure you wish you were dead.”

The standoff hung in tense silence, until the sound of sirens suddenly echoed from the distance.

Robert’s expression shifted. He hadn’t expected the Pack enforcers to arrive so quickly.

Gritting his teeth, he lunged forward, aiming a blade straight at Carmen’s heart.

“Carmen!”

Without thinking, Liora threw herself in front of him, taking the blow herself.

The blade sank into her shoulder. Blood gushed instantly, soaking through her clothes. She let out a muffled cry before collapsing.

Carmen caught her in his arms, a flicker of panic flashing through his eyes. “Liora!”

Liora’s consciousness began to fade, and the only thing she could still hear was Carmen’s panicked voice.

She wanted to say something but no words came out.

Darkness swallowed her whole.

When she woke again, she found herself lying on the ground beside the pool.

Carmen stood in front of her, but instead of concern, his eyes were full of hatred.

“Liora,” he said coldly, “why did you stage that whole scene with the kidnappers? Did you really think I’d say ‘I love you’ because of it?”

Liora stared at him, stunned. She had no idea what he was talking about.

Carmen went on, voice sharp with accusation. “Evelynne told me everything. You planned the whole kidnapping with Robert just to hurt her. How could you be so vicious?”

Her heart dropped.

It hit her then.

Somehow, Evelynne had pulled some kind of trick and twisted the truth, but she’d actually convinced Carmen that it was all her scheme.

“It wasn’t me. I didn’t…”

But before she could finish, Carmen cut her off, his gaze growing even colder. “I know you’re spoiled. You always pull these stunts to get under my skin so as to get my attention. But you crossed a line. You can mess with me all you want, but not with Evelynne. She’s everything to me.”

Then, without another word, he turned to his warriors and ordered them to tie Liora to a heavy stone and sink her into the pool.

“Car… Carmen… it wasn’t… me…”

But her protests were drowned by the icy rush of water engulfing her body. The heavy stone dragged her straight to the bottom of the pool.

Her breathing grew more and more labored. The world before her eyes was blurring into darkness.

Just as she was about to lose consciousness, Carmen finally ordered someone to pull her out of the water.

But she barely had time to breathe before they shoved her back under again.

Over and over, they drowned her. The pain was unbearable. It felt endless.

She didn’t know how many times they repeated it. By the end, soaked and shivering, she was dragged ashore like a dying fish.

Carmen crouched down and grabbed her by the chin, forcing her to look at him.

His voice was frigid. “Remember this, Liora. If you ever hurt Evelynne again, I won’t let you off this easy.”

With that, he turned and walked away, his warriors following close behind, never once glancing back at her.

# Chapter 5

On the third day of the countdown, Liora received an invitation to a formal banquet.

It came from a neighboring pack’s Luna, an old friend and mutual confidante, who had specially invited both her and Carmen to attend.

Holding the invitation in her hands, Liora spun around in place, giddy with excitement.

“This is perfect!” her wolf cheered inside her mind. “Finally, you got a chance to be alone with him. Maybe tonight… he’ll say ‘I love you.’”

Liora couldn’t stop the smile from blooming across her face.

“Hurry up and pick a dress!” her wolf urged. “That blackish green slip dress, the one Carmen likes best, remember?”

Of course, she remembered.

She’d worn that dress once when she walked past the training grounds. Carmen had been deep in conversation with his warriors, but the moment he turned and saw her, he froze.

But in the next moment, too proud to admit anything, he’d turned away, awkwardly muttering, “You… you wouldn’t even look that good if you weren’t wearing that dress.”

The memory of his arrogant tone made her laugh softly.

She dashed to the closet in an instant, pulled out the blackish green slip dress, and slipped it on. Then came the makeup—a delicate, glowing touch, long lashes, and a soft lipstick that brought warmth to her usually pale complexion.

She even curled her hair and put on the emerald necklace Carmen had once given her.

He had claimed it was “just something he picked up,” but Liora knew better. Carmen didn’t give gifts to anyone.

Staring at her reflection in the mirror, her eyes sparkled with hope.

“Tonight, it has to work,” she murmured softly.

Meanwhile, Carmen was waiting at the door.

He wore a perfectly tailored charcoal-gray suit. The open collar of his jacket revealed a sliver of skin, making him look regal and distant, as if he were the center of gravity at any event.

But he wasn’t moving. He just stood there, seemingly waiting for someone.

Seeing him, Liora smiled unconsciously and quickened her pace down the stairs.

Then someone appeared at his side.

It was Evelynne.

She wore a white off-the-shoulder gown, her long hair curled elegantly, makeup flawless. She slipped her arm around Carmen’s effortlessly, smiling up at him like she was his Luna.

Liora froze halfway down the stairs.

Her eyes fell on Carmen. There was a brief flicker of pain in her eyes but she quickly buried it deep inside.

She forced a smile and said coolly, “What’s this, Alpha Carmen? Are you taking Evelynne to the banquet?”

Carmen shot her a cold glance. His tone was filled with undisguised contempt. “Evelynne is my date. Do you have a problem with that?”

Liora’s fingers curled around the hem of her dress tightly, nails digging into her palm.

“No problem,” she said flatly. “Just a reminder, Alpha Carmen, we’re still bound by the mate bond. Aren’t you worried about the gossip you’ll cause when you show up with another woman?”

Carmen scoffed. “Liora, do you really think I care what people say? You’re just a prop. Don’t flatter yourself.”

With that, he turned and walked out with Evelynne on his arm, not sparing Liora a single glance.

Liora stood frozen, watching their retreating figures. Bitterness beyond words surged in her chest, and even her wolf whimpered softly in her mind.

The banquet was dazzling. The chandeliers sparkled like stars, and the hall was filled with werewolves from various packs.

When Carmen and Evelynne arrived, all eyes turned toward them.

Carmen seemed to be deliberately trying to humiliate Liora, showering Evelynne with attention throughout the banquet.

He pulled out Evelynne’s chair, poured her wine, draped his jacket over her shoulders during the fireworks display. He even leaned in close, whispering things into her ear, drawing curious stares and hushed whispers from the surrounding guests.

“I heard Carmen and Liora are fated mates but hate each other. It looks like it’s true.”

“Yeah. Look how gentle Alpha Carmen is with Evelynne. Meanwhile, he doesn’t even look at Liora.”

“Poor Liora. She’s supposed to be his Luna, but she looks like a complete outsider.”

Liora heard every word, each one slicing into her like a blade.

She clenched her wine glass so tightly her knuckles turned white, but she didn’t say a word or take a step forward.

She knew too well if she showed she cared, Carmen would only become smugger.

But the worst wasn’t over yet.

Midway through the banquet, Evelynne suddenly stood up and excused herself, saying she needed the restroom. Carmen nodded gently and watched her leave with a warm smile.

A short while later, however, Evelynne returned in a panic.

Her dress was disheveled, hair a mess, eyes brimming with tears.

“Carmen, help me!” she cried, throwing herself into his arms. Her voice trembled with panic and despair. “I was in the bathroom when Liora… she brought a group of rogues. And they tried to… tried to rape me!”

# Chapter 6

The moment Evelynne’s accusation fell from her lips, the entire hall erupted.

All eyes turned to Liora, some filled with shock, others with scorn, and a few with barely concealed glee because of gloating.

“My god, did Liora really do something like that?”

“Alpha Carmen won’t let her off the hook this time!”

Sure enough, Carmen shot to his feet, eyes sharp as they locked on Liora.

He grabbed the wineglass from the table and hurled it to the floor. The glass shattered with a piercing crack, red wine spreading across the white carpet like blood.

“Liora! What did I tell you last time?” he roared. “If you lay another finger on Evelynne, I wouldn’t spare you!”

Liora didn’t flinch. She stood still, meeting his fury with unsettling calm. Her voice, though soft, dripped with sarcasm.

“I didn’t hurt her.”

Carmen’s expression darkened even further. He strode toward her with barely restrained rage.

He barked, “Would she really make something like that to frame you? Besides, you’re a repeat offender!

Liora’s fingers trembled slightly. Pain flashed through her eyes, but she lifted her head, her voice hoarse and full of despair.

“Then what do you want from me?!”

“You have to kneel and apologize to Evelynne.”

Liora’s pupils contracted sharply. She clutched the hem of her dress, her wolf growling low and furious in her mind.

Her dignity was being ground into the floor like worthless dirt.

Through clenched teeth, she spat out, “Never.”

With that, she turned to walk away.

But Carmen’s face twisted into something vicious. He took a step forward, and kicked her hard in the knee.

“Ouch!”

The sudden blow sent her crashing to the ground, her knees slamming against the floor with a sickening thud.

“Apologize!” Carmen demanded, his tone leaving no room for resistance.

Liora felt her dignity being torn apart bit by bit, as if she’d been stripped bare and exposed under everyone’s watchful eyes.

She defended herself, eyes red, “I told you I didn’t do it! It wasn’t me! I won’t apologize!”

Carmen sneered and waved his hand toward the warriors behind him.

Two warriors immediately stepped forward, gripping her shoulders and forcing her head toward the floor.

“I’m your Luna!” she shouted, struggling against them. “How dare you treat me like this?”

“Forgive us, Luna,” one of them muttered. “But it’s Alpha’s command.”

Liora writhed and resisted, but she was no match for their strength. Her forehead hit the floor with a muffled thump.

The whispers around her grew louder and louder, like countless blades cutting into her heart.

“Look at that. Liora finally got what she deserved.”

“Alpha Carmen doesn’t show mercy, even to his own Luna.”

“Serves her right. She’s always picking on Evelynne anyway.”

“Liora, are you still refusing to admit it?” Carmen’s voice rang out, laced with impatience.

Kneeling there, Liora felt her pride completely crushed. As she looked down at the dress she had so carefully chosen, a wave of unspeakable despair washed over her.

Then, with every ounce of strength she had left, she ripped herself from the warriors’ grasp, staggered to her feet, and slapped Carmen across the face hard.

The sharp crack echoed through the stunned silence of the banquet hall.

“Carmen!” Her voice trembled with tears, and at last, she could no longer hold them back. “I said I didn’t do it! Is it that everything she says is true, but anything I say must be a lie? You love her, I know, but I’m your Luna! Your fated mate! Your true Luna! What am I to you, huh?! What the hell am I?!”

Her voice trembled with raw pain and despair, as if she were pouring out every ounce of aggrievance and injustice she had kept bottled up.

It was the first time she had ever cried in front of Carmen.

And the first time she had shown him her vulnerability.

Carmen stood frozen. He had never seen Liora like this.

She had always been proud, unyielding. But now she looked like a creature cornered at last, eyes filled with grief and despair.

A strange, unfamiliar feeling stirred in his chest, as if something deep inside him was beginning to crumble.

He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came.

Liora looked at him through a veil of tears, her voice hoarse and broken.

“Remember this, Carmen. I never owed you anything.”

After saying that, she turned and walked out of the banquet hall without looking back.

Carmen stood rooted to the spot, the sting of her slap burning hot across his cheek, finally snapping him out of his daze.

He stared at her retreating figure, and something strange and indescribable rose inside him.

# Chapter 7

On the second day of the countdown, it was the anniversary of Liora’s parents' death.

She rose early that morning, dressed in simple black, and prepared to leave for the cemetery to pay her respects.

But just as she reached the door, Carmen called out behind her.

“Liora, I’ll go with you,”

She paused in her tracks, then turned to glare at him coldly.

“What for? Are you planning to have your warriors pin me down and make me kneel and knock my forehead against the floor to Evelynne again?”

Carmen’s face darkened instantly.

He had intended to ease the tension between them, but her words instantly reignited the anger he had just barely suppressed.

“You were the one in the wrong yesterday. Are you going to keep dragging this out?”

Liora sneered, pushing past him toward the door.

But as she approached the car, she saw Evelynne sitting in the front seat, smiling gently at her.

“Liora,” she said sweetly, “Carmen told me you were visiting your parents today. I wanted to come too.”

Liora’s rage exploded like a lit fuse.

She spun around and stared at Carmen, voice trembling with fury.

“Carmen, this is my bottom line. She is not allowed at their grave!”

Carmen frowned. “Liora, you’re being unreasonable. Evelynne means well. Don’t be so ungrateful.”

“She means well?” Liora’s eyes dripped with sarcasm. “Have you forgotten what day it is, Carmen? This isn’t your date night, it’s the day my parents died!”

Evelynne let out a soft sigh.

“Liora, why do you hate me so much? Weren’t we close before? Why are you always targeting me?”

Liora let out a cold laugh, her gaze icy as she stared at Evelynne. “You know why I hate you!”

Carmen stepped forward, unable to watch any longer. He grabbed Liora by the wrist and pulled her toward the car.

“Enough, Liora. Stop making a scene. Get in.”

She struggled against him, but couldn’t break free from his grip.

The car sped toward the cemetery. Liora didn’t want to look at the two behind her, holding flowers as she hurried toward her parents’ grave.

She squatted down before the gravestone and placed the flowers down with care, her fingertips brushing the cold marble, pain flickering in her eyes.

“Mom… Dad… I came to see you.”

Without Liora noticing, Carmen had silently followed and stood behind her, eyes fixed on the gravestone with a complicated expression.

“Mom, Dad,” he said quietly, “I don’t like Liora, but I’ll take care of her for life.”

Liora’s body stiffened.

For a long moment, she said nothing. Then, her voice came out through clenched teeth,

“I don’t need you to take care of me. I just want you to say that you love me.”

Carmen’s face turned frosty in an instant.

“Not happening, Liora. Don’t push your luck. I told you I will never love you.”

Her chest tightened, a sharp ache slicing through her, but she said nothing more.

When the visit ended, Carmen turned and left with Evelynne at his side. Liora lingered, speaking softly to her parents, reluctant to leave.

Some time passed and she was just about to head out when one of the cemetery guards, a werewolf named Ben, stopped her.

“Luna… there’s something we think you should know.”

Liora frowned. A flicker of unease twisted in her gut. “What is it?”

Ben lowered his head, guilt heavy in his voice. “Actually… Evelynne ordered us to dig your parents’ coffin up and burn the remains. They were turned into fireworks.”

Liora’s pupils contracted violently. She could hardly believe her ears.

“What did you say?!”

Ben sighed. “A few days ago, Evelynne forced us to dig up your parents’ coffin. We refused, but she threatened us, saying she’s Alpha Carmen’s favored she-wolf and the future Luna of the pack. If we disobeyed, the Alpha would make things unbearable for us. We didn’t want to do it. But we had no choice. But our conscience wouldn’t let us keep it from you.”

Liora’s mind went blank, her ears buzzed with static.

By the time she snapped out of it, she was already sprinting out of the cemetery.

After a few frantic inquiries, she rushed to the bar where Carmen and Evelynne were.

Inside the bar, the lights were dim, music blared.

She burst in just as Carmen and Evelynne sat on a couch playing “Truth or Dare.”

Evelynne had lost and, according to the rules, was supposed to kiss Carmen.

She blushed, lowering her head and slowly leaned toward him.

Just as her lips were about to touch his, Liora rushed over, grabbed a bottle from the table, and smashed it hard against Evelynne’s head.

“Crash.”

Glass shattered. Evelynne screamed, collapsing onto the floor, blood streaming down her forehead.

Screams erupted everywhere, most people couldn’t process what was going on.

Only Carmen rose to his feet and, without hesitation, slapped Liora across the face.

“Liora! Have you lost your mind?!”

A trace of blood seeped from the corner of Liora’s mouth, but she seemed completely numb to the pain.

“I’ve lost my mind? No, she’s the one who’s lost her mind!” Her voice cracked with anguish. “Do you even know what she did to my parents?!”

Carmen’s expression darkened instantly. “Your parents are dead. What could she possibly do to them now?”

“They left behind a coffin and ashes!” Liora’s voice trembled, tears spilling uncontrollably. “She put their ashes in the fireworks and set off them!”

“The fireworks from the banquet the night before, that was their ashes!”

Carmen froze. His eyes flickered with a trace of shock.

Evelynne, however, was already crying, her voice trembling with innocence.

“I didn’t… I didn’t do that… Liora, why are you making up such terrible things to frame me?”

Carmen seemed to recall something. His face darkened instantly. “Liora, have your tricks to slander gotten this pathetic? Your parents adored Evelynne since you were kids. How could possibly she do such a thing? You’re just mad because you saw us almost kissing and wanted to cause trouble, aren’t you?”

“Let me make one thing clear, Liora. Evelynne and I didn’t kiss. Even if we did, if you so much as lay a finger on her, I won’t let you off.”

Liora stood frozen, tears clouding her vision.

She stared at Carmen protecting Evelynne so fiercely, and something inside her finally snapped.

She suddenly lifted her head and laughed.

She laughed and laughed until the tears came streaming down.

“You’re such a fool, Carmen. And so am I. That’s why both of us are destined to lose the ones we love.”

And with that, laughing bitterly, she turned and walked away. Her figure was thin and lonely, and yet her steps were unwavering.

# Chapter 8

The final day of the countdown arrived, and Liora still hadn't heard those three words—""I love you"" from Carmen.

Calmly, she picked up a knife and headed to the tallest rooftop in the town near the pack territory. Once there, she sent Carmen her location.

Then, she tossed her phone aside and quietly waited.

News of her suicide attempt spread like wildfire across the pack. The pack members and townsfolk gathered nervously beneath the building, surrounding it entirely,

They all craned their necks, all eyes fixed on the silhouette standing at the edge of the rooftop. They were buzzing with gossip.

""Why isn’t Alpha Carmen here yet? If he doesn’t come soon, Luna might really jump!""

Finally, Carmen arrived.

They're simple. They're effective. And the best part? You don’t need a fancy gym membership or a ton of time. You just need your body, a pair of comfy sneakers, and a little motivation.

But if you're someone who hates the idea of going outside when it's too hot, too cold, too rainy, or just *too people-y*, I’ve got a game-changer for you: the [Walking Pad](http://walkingpad.pxf.io/Vmq1XR).

We'll get to that in a second. First, let’s break down the basics.

https://preview.redd.it/fb43cmdo18cf1.jpg?width=1184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea8848a940e6f565e0d48dda2f7323a2a1dfafab

  
**Walking: Underrated but Powerful**

Walking might not feel like a ""real workout"" to some people, but science says otherwise. It burns calories, boosts your mood, and supports heart health — all without crushing your knees or leaving you breathless.

**Benefits of walking:**

* Low-impact and easy on joints
* Great for beginners or those with injuries
* Helps reduce stress and anxiety
* Boosts metabolism, especially when done consistently
* Perfect for multitasking (yep, you can totally walk while binge-watching Netflix)

The key? **Consistency**. A 30-minute brisk walk five days a week can do wonders for your overall health and weight loss goals.



# Running: The Calorie-Torching Cardio King

Now, if you’re looking to push things a little further, **running** steps in with a serious calorie burn and cardiovascular boost.

**Benefits of running:**

* Burns roughly double the calories of walking
* Builds endurance and cardiovascular strength
* Boosts mental health with those famous ""runner’s highs""
* Strengthens muscles in your legs, core, and even upper body
* Helps shed fat faster when paired with proper diet and rest

If you’re new to running, start slow. Try intervals — walk for two minutes, jog for one. Gradually increase your pace and time as your stamina improves.



# So, Which Is Better?

Honestly? Both are great. It’s not about which one is better — it’s about which one fits into your lifestyle, your body, and your goals.

If you’re just starting out or have joint pain, walking is a solid choice. If you’re short on time and want to break a sweat fast, running is your go-to. And hey, no shame in doing a mix of both — *fitness is not one-size-fits-all*.



# The Secret Weapon: The Walking Pad

Okay, now let’s talk about something that can level up your walking and running game — especially if you’re someone who works from home, hates the gym, or just wants the convenience of exercising without leaving your living room.

# Enter: [The Walking Pad](http://walkingpad.pxf.io/Vmq1XR)

This compact, foldable treadmill is basically the modern person’s dream fitness tool. Think of it as the treadmill’s cool, minimalist cousin.

**Why people are obsessed with the Walking Pad:**

✅ **Fits in small spaces** – perfect for apartments or tiny home offices  
✅ **Foldable & portable** – just slide it under your couch or bed when you're done  
✅ **Walk while you work** – put it under your standing desk and get your steps in during Zoom calls  
✅ **No excuses** – rain, snow, or 100-degree heat? You’re still crushing your cardio

Whether you're power-walking while rewatching *Stranger Things* or lightly jogging to your favorite Spotify playlist, the Walking Pad makes it ridiculously easy to stay active without changing your whole routine.

# Tips for Getting Started

1. **Set a goal** – 10,000 steps a day? 3 miles a week? Make it realistic.
2. **Create a playlist or podcast queue** – Music and entertainment make the time fly.
3. **Pair it with daily habits** – Walk during your morning coffee time, or jog before your shower.
4. **Track your progress** – Seeing your numbers go up is oddly satisfying.
5. **Start slow, stay consistent** – It’s better to walk daily than to run once and burn out.

# The Verdict: Walk, Run, or Both – Just Get Moving!

At the end of the day, movement is what matters. Whether you're walking around your neighborhood or jogging in place on a [Walking Pad](http://walkingpad.pxf.io/Vmq1XR), you're doing something amazing for your health, your mood, and your future self.

So ditch the guilt, forget perfection, and take that first step — literally.

I am in the process of dissolving my marriage after my husband has suffered from mental illness for years, so I am exhausted and very deeply sad, but am cautiously hopeful that I can start to heal myself now after feeling depleted for so long. I didn’t want to make this choice but it’s needed for my health. 

I adore traveling and wanted to give myself something to look forward to. I love:
- Good food and coffee!
- Books. 
- History and beautiful architecture. 
- Nature, beautiful parks in the city or just being in nature and hiking. 
- Walking—in a new place my favorite thing is to just walk and walk all day, taking in the sites and eating as I go. Bonus is I can walk off my stress from normal life and feel pleasantly tired at night. :)
- Safety is obviously important. I am brave and very aware of my surroundings, but sensitive to feeling on edge. 

Not into:
- Drinking (I’ll have one drink in a safe setting).
- Nightlife/Partying.
- Dating—I need healing time first. 
- Probably would prefer to not have to rent a car on this trip—one less thing to worry about. 

I have traveled to Portugal and Scotland previously and enjoyed both; Portugal in particular. I have traveled solo to NYC and Portland, Oregon before and felt comfortable. Budget is limited but I have a bit set aside for this trip. I have talked about going to Merida, Mexico and I have plane tickets there (nothing else booked) but am double guessing myself. I want a relaxing, rejuvenating trip but I also know I have trouble lazing around and relaxing for hours at a time if there’s not much to do. 

I am aware that my indecisiveness and restlessness is more a product of my current situation, but I really want a trip to look forward to for me and I know I love travel, just having trouble deciding. Grateful for any ideas, advice, or validation! 

I’ve also considered:
- Portugal again (Lisbon or Madeira)
- Mexico City
- Savannah, Georgia 

(Other dream trips on my life list are Vienna, Prague, African safari, Quebec City, Italy, France, Ireland, Vancouver Island, London, Croatia…)

1lx3d2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/1lx3d2z/why_does_everyone_keep_saying_the_grad_job_market/,Why does everyone keep saying the grad job market is “cooked”?,"Hi all,

I'm a penultimate-year Software Engineering student, and I've been hearing a lot about how ""cooked"" the graduate job market is — especially for tech. At first, I was really worried because I kept reading online that it’s super saturated and grads are struggling to find work.

But recently, I’ve been doing coffee chats with software engineers from a range of companies, and the impression I’m getting is a bit different. It seems like it’s mostly the Tier 1 companies (e.g. Canva, Atlassian, AWS) that are more competitive right now, but Tier 2 companies like banks, telcos, etc., are still hiring at normal levels.

From what I’ve gathered:

* Most recent grads I’ve spoken to said the majority of their cohort found tech jobs, with only a few struggling more due to increased competition.
* Tech grad roles are generally easier to get than other grad roles, for e.g at places like telcos and banks where they take \~200 tech grads vs \~30 finance grads.
* Many non-Tier 1 tech roles don’t even have technical assessments — just behavioural questions.
* When I speak to these software engineers they never really felt for them it was super competitive to land their role (software engineers in banks, medium sized companies, telcos, e.t.c)

So… is it just that expectations have shifted (i.e., people can't go straight to top-tier anymore), or is there something I’m missing? I’m genuinely trying to understand — not saying it's easy, but it seems like a lot of the panic online may be a bit overstated?",4,1752229609.0,cscareerquestionsOCE,10,0.67,False
