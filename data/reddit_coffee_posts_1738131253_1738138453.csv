1icp2hp,https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bruu/id6661024887,bruu - new specialty coffee app,"Hey fellow coffee nerds,

I am Max and I fell down the coffee rabbit hole about 5 years ago and two years ago decided to build an app for it. 
Today I want to introduce you to bruu, my idea for an app to improve your and everyone’s specialty coffee game. It’s now available on the AppStore to download (and soon in the Play Store as well). 

With bruu you can 
- Search for roasters and their beans
- Check the taste profile and origin information of beans
- Find similar tasting beans to your favourite ones
- Rate beans and reviewing them including the taste notes you got from them
- Create and share recipes for how you brew your coffee
- Get updates for newly released beans from roasters
- Check what the best reviewed beans and roasters are 
- Follow other users to stay up to date with what they are brewing
- Share what grind setting you used 
- Translate other people’s grind settings to the grinder you are using
- And more in the future

As I am a solo developer and not a developer for mobile applications by training (nor is it my daytime job) I would really appreciate if you could download my app and give me feedback about it. That would really help me further improve it further and catch bugs. 

Also as of know the list of roasters that I have in the app is maintained by me. So if you have suggestions for specialty coffee roasters that aren’t in the app yet but should be, I would really appreciate your input and I will see if I can add them to the app.

My intention for this app is to put the taste and origin of coffee more at the center. In a similar direction in the future I want to make the producers of coffee also more visible to us the consumers to value the work that they are doing. I already have some ideas like for every bean showing other beans that come from an origin that is geographically close, but more to come in the soon. That being said I think most of you will understand that I do not plan to add “commercial”/non-specialty coffee roasters to the app. 

So please try out my app and let me know what you think of it ✌️

PS: To make it available in the Play Store I need some people willing to test it on Android phones. So if you do please reach out to me via DM and send me your Playstore account email address to get access.",1,1738138332.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I am just looking for a subreddit where I can just post even one thing about how hard it is to be taking care of my mom. She has dementia, sometimes she seems okay for a few hours, but it always deteriorates. Every night she says she needs to go home, she wants to go home, she gets lost in her apartment, doesn't know where she is, wants to know where her children are, where her husband is. I am her daughter, both my dad and my brother have passed away. I wouldn't ever say that, I'm sure it would devastate her and make the situation worse. When she is this bad, I feel very caring and patient just trying to get her calm and content. 

I am with her 24/7. I never get to leave, not even to go to a grocery store. Everything is delivered. I am separated from my husband but he is very involved as he has power of attorney over her finances, medical, etc. I wanted to hire a caregiver to be a companion and a support who understands memory issues. My husband decided this was not affordable, as is her current apartment in a retirement village. We will be moving her to our house (to which I still own half it's value) I suppose, it will at least be a familiar environment for her. But I will still need to be with her all day, at least until he gets home. I'm hoping that he will be able to be present for her so I can get out and see friends, get coffee, anything. 

Please don't think I do not care. I love her and want to take care of her, because she's always loved me no matter what and it's the very least I can do. But she nods off to sleep all the time during the day and then by evening, she is in her state of confusion and I need to be here, as she will call out for me, literally from hallway and say she is lost.  By the time I get her back to the sofa, she sometimes doesn't know who I am...again, where she is, where are the people she loved. I am torn up by loving her so much that I can't imagine life without her...to wanting a life for myself to do something I love, to work again, to have a friend. 

I just want to find a place where I won't be judged. Other people who are maybe going through the same thing...",1,1738138271.0,CaregiverSupport,1,1.0,False

1icowvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1icowvg/just_need_to_vent/,Just need to vent,"So I started this job and I have a coworker who I find attractive and there’s no other reason that I like her besides her looks. I’ve been working at my job for about three weeks. And I usually spend half of the morning with her and we talk. Granted it’s still kind of early for me to pick up on any signs and also don’t think she is into me like I am to her. But I would say she has shared some personal things with me maybe not super personal but I think it’s personal enough to where it is something you don’t share with someone you just met. 

Our conversations are okay but I feel like I am the one who initiates more often than she does. But she will keep the conversation going sometimes but not always. We usually have maybe 10 - 20 minutes of not talking. But when we are at the office we rarely talk mostly because we work in a small office and I would rather not talk about things there. But for example my first week there she kind talked bad about one of co-workers and basically how sometimes he annoys her because he won’t do certain task and just puts it off or gives it to her I don’t know if she trust me or she just really didn’t think about it too much. And like for example, yesterday she was just talking to me about her best friend getting cheated on by her boyfriend and stuff like that and she was just kinda talking about it to me and I take it as something. 

You don’t really share unless she just doesn’t really think about it. And then she started talking about her problems with her roommate then then she just started going on about the issue that they had and then she had asked me for my opinion and asked me if she was in the wrong for assuming that she drank a coffee that she was going to give to a friend and usually how I take it as a when girls ask for your opinion it’s because they care about what you think at the same time I could be reading too deep into the lines today, we start talking about people cheating and stuff like that and I had brought up my friend used to do it, but doesn’t anymore and then she had asked me if his wife ever suspected him doing it and I said probably not at the same time. 

I think she is aware of what he is capable of because when he had a girlfriend, she cheated on her what does current partner and then she asked me if I would ever do that be OK with dating a girl who had a partner and I said no because that’s just really shitty and it’s just not my thing and then she had told me that she actually did date someone who had a girlfriend thinking about it now she said I was kind of shitty and so I was thinking to myself that that type of information you never share with a coworker unless she’s really trusting so I don’t even know if she kinda likes me or not or just feels comfortable enough to tell me things so I don’t even know because the best way I can describe her conversations is that it is warm it’s not bad but it’s not great. 

I guess we do have deep conversations sometimes at the same time it just feels like I am the one who is always asking questions, but also I don’t really remember off the top of my head if she’s ever asked me anything sometimes she will ask me questions like for example, today she had asked me if I think that the videos that people post on TikTok asking random people at the mall questions and they get it wrong if they are staged or actually real. But because of what I said, what do you guys think is somewhat into me or not?",0,1738137614.0,Crushes,0,0.5,False

FINALLY getting a new dosage, how fast will I see improvement? Why is getting treated so hard?!","What am I doing wrong? After two years of begging, my endo finally raised my dosage back up to 125. It’s a trial, we’ll see. But it sounds like they don’t think this will stick and we’ll lower it back down again. I’m so nervous! Now we wait. Any chance I’ll feel the difference in a few days? Or is it generally always weeks? 

Tsh has been hovering above 2.5 up to 2.8 so they had me at 100mcg for the past two years. But I’m exhausted all the time, achey all over, cold all the time (even though everyone else is warm at 70+ degrees,) I’ve been slowly gaining weight 1-2 lbs every month or two for a total of 15lbs in two years. Can’t seem loose weight and it’s a constant fight to maintain even on a low carb, high protein, non-fried food diet (no gall bladder.) I feel like if I even think about a cupcake, I gain 3 lbs. I’ve been 250-280lbs now for the past 5 years or so, after gaining about 60 lbs one year ten years ago in one year, they chalked it up to stress, pcos and hypo. I’ve had such a hard time losing, let alone maintaining, it’s a struggle. But I felt like I could maintain better and even lose some albeit slowly when my tsh was closer to 1. 

I was at 137mcg four years ago, felt my best at 1.0 tsh or lower. But my tsh dipped way down to zero/non-detectable a few weeks postpartum so my endo decreased the dosage straight to 100mcg and I felt like crud. They told me that’s normal/postpartum etc. And I haven’t been able to get anyone to raise my dosage since. (Until today.) I’m just frustrated and second guessing everything at this point. I am tired. Getting okay sleep. I drink a lot of water, not a coffee drinker. 

Between the two doctors (same team office) I’ve seen this last couple of years, one says my symptoms have nothing to do with hypothyroidism. The other one says it’s obvious I have hypothyroidism but insists that 2.8 - 3 tsh is fine, regardless of how I’m feeling. They’ve been telling me I’m just tired from chasing a bunch of kids around, probably in peri-menopause, you need more sleep and water, etc. always something I’m doing or not doing enough of. When I ask for my dosage to be increased/adjusted they tell me no, this is fine. 

I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism as a child almost 30 years ago. (Hypo runs in the family.) I was treated with synthroid for years, then labs were normal enough they took me off of it and just watched it until my twenties. Diagnosed again with hypo, but plus PCOS and IBS. It’s been so hard to find a doctor that will even discuss hypo let alone treat. Why is this so hard? It’s not like these meds are controlled substances like pain meds or something? But it makes such a huge difference in quality of life. 

My old doctor (retired) called my needing the higher dosage “optimized” and said we had to go by symptoms too not just tsh. He also used to check t3 and t4. But this new Dr team I’ve been seeing only checks tsh and gets upset if use the word optimize. I can’t really switch doctors, the waiting lists are years long or they aren’t accepting new patients. And I feel like even the lower dosages of Levo is better than nothing. 

What am I missing here? I left the office today with a higher dosage (125mcg) to try finally but I just feel like want to cry. I’m so stressed. Am I crazy? Or not saying the right things? I feel like I’m walking through pudding most days, just absolutely fatigued and they’re like that’s normal. But I feel like it doesn’t have to be. I felt so much better at the higher 137 dosage five years ago.",1,1738137458.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

just wanted to let everyone here know that collagen peptides really work for some people. I (45m) wasn't expecting much when I bought a kilogram from amazon (30 Euro per kilogram) late last year. I started taking a scoop per day (around 15g) in early December 2024. I take it first thing in the morning, dissolved in hot water alongside a B-complex pill and 3grams of magnesium bisglycinate (no other supplements). 

**Results so far:**

\-Skin looks less wrinkly, more shiny and healthy (not that I care much about that)

\-Nails and hair seem to grow faster

\-My joint pain is gone!!!! I have been suffering from a bad shoulder for many many years, limiting my strength training quite badly. Also, my low grade and chronic elbow tendonitis disappeared and my knees feel like I am twenty again! I even started bench pressing again and there is hardly any pain in my left shoulder. That pain was an annoying constant in my life for a decade or so. 

\-My mild but chronic stomach issues (inflammation, slight pain after fatty meals or lots of coffee) got much better. Also, my mild and chronic diarrhea is completely gone. Used to go to the loo several times per day, now it is one toilet visit in the morning. 

**Side effects:** 

\-Mild flatulence, I definitely fart a bit more often that I used to

Overall, collagen peptides seem to have a profound effect on my digestive health (why? it doesn't make sense, does it?) and a very beneficial effect on my joints. I can't believe that my shoulder pain is gone, this is such a great effect! I wouldn't be surprised if the effect on the gut and the effect on the joints/tendons are somehow linked? The collagen peptides somehow reduce stomach, gut and joint/tendon inflammation? ",1,1738137415.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

1. I currently live with my parents - my mother has spontaneous demands and guilt trips if you do not comply (ex she wants to go for coffee, or shopping etc). 
2. My work is people-oriented and I live far away from the main offices, so all co-ordination/follow-up is via the phone, and work is largely dependent don't he workforce. 
3. I love cooking but have lost the zest for it since I am on a diet myself. I love eating different foods and have random cravings, but my mother gets irritated with this as the cook is not full-time. I have stopped requesting for different foods to avoid arguments.
4. I have a kitten that my parents agreed to let me keep, but I have allergies to her and looking for homes. The allergy makes me tired 24\*7, I wake up exhausted, and have brain fog throughout the day and it wears down my willpower. I am currently on medication for it.
5. I have watched so many movies and shows over the past few months that I am absolutely sick of it so I have started reading instead

I am currently midway through Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking, and have internal rationalisation on why my mindset is incorrect. But would love some community support - anyone else feeling the same? How do you tackle it?

First off: I am relarively new to Espresso (just started with the Gaggia E24) and am loving the journey so far, all to say that I am no pro.

So I have been reading up a lot and doing some research and, as far as I get it and as far as it seems intuitive to me, time shouldn't be bothered with in detail since there are too many variables that may affect it (let alone your own tastebuds).
But I get the idea of some rule of thumb, some range that is for most scenarios (especially  for beginners ) the correct range.

What bugs me about this is: Why doesn't Dose, or bed-depth or however you refer to the amount of coffee you put in your basket, highly affect the range that one commonly finds in articles etc?.It's pretty much 20-30s (or narrower) wherever I check. Not 18-23 for 7g, 23-27 for 14g, etc (numbers are made up).
 See, a 7g basket and a 30g basket end up in 14 vs 60gr of liquid in a 1:2 ratio. No way you would want both to run in the same time as a rule of thumb right? The amount of sollubles you extract, your grind size, all would change and make time your first variable which as far as my understanding of coffee and physics go would make no sense.

Okay so, I've been having this job for a year now. This new girl (f25) started working in my same office a couple of months ago.

  
Now, my job is kind of particular. We essentially have a campus with a huge amount of buildings and offices (around 30 I think), so when I say ""my office"" I mean my building and the desk that she shares is somewhat close to the one of my colleagues (which I personally use when they are away). We sit close when one of my two colleagues isn't in the office, essentially.

  
At first I didn't really care about her. She was cute, but I was taken, so it wasn't very important.  
After a couple of weeks I introduced myself to her while she was talking with some colleagues of mine and oh boy, she was weird. I loved it.

  
Fast forward to around the beginning of january. I break up with my partner and I move on.  
Meanwhile I get to know the girl a bit better and, I mean, she's fun and cool and cute and smart. The whole package. We start to chit chat everyday and that was kind of it, we became friends.  
After a week she invited me and some other colleagues over to her place to eat some pizza, so we went there.

  
I live far away from my office, and when I told her she said I could come to her place while we waited for the time to get dinner. So after work we went to her place, got some coffee, and went outside to get some stuff for the evening.  
We sang throughout the entire drive and it was real fun!

  
When we came back we started talking and I discovered some more stuff about her. She is seeing some guy who lives in her hometown (about three hours from where she is now). She told me that the last time he came over to her place to stay for the weekend he brought one of his friends and they didn't really talk ""tete a tete"" like they usually do, and she wanted to sort it out the following weekend because she needed to understand where that situationship was heading.  
The night was good, everyone had fun, nothing special happened.

  
The next day, friday, we talked like usual. That thursday and friday our bosses weren't around, so we spent most of our work day chatting and laughing. Completely unprofessional, but really fun.  
At the end of friday I sent her a message telling her good luck on the discussion with the other dude and asked her to update me (I was curious, you know?) on sunday.

  
That weekend (which by the way, was last weekend) we didn't text each other at all. I told her that I wouldn't have done that, I wanted to give her some space. We ended up texting a bit. On sunday we decided to have a call and chat instead of hanging out because she was very tired.

  
We talked up until 1am, and told me that the situationship was over. He was using her, he didn't really care about her at all, and he was an asshole. You know, the usual. 

  
The next day, monday (yesterday!) we had organised some after work hangout with some colleagues to say goodbye to a colleague of ours. I sent her a text (she was working from home) asking her if she wanted to hang out a bit earlier than the rest of the group. She said she couldn't, but invited me over while we waited to hang out with the rest. So at 5pm I went out of work, went to get a couple of pastries and went to her place.

  
When she opened the door, she was in ""working from home"" mode: clothing that weren't pajamas but really looked liked it, no makeup and ponytail. Seeing her like that made me feel a bit special. Who knows how many of her colleague friends saw. her like that other than me.  
We drank some coffee, chatted a bit, ate the pastries, laughed.

  
When it was time to go I put on my shirt (I wanted to wear something nice) and asked her something like ""Don't you think I look like a snack?"" (yikes). She said ""You look older. You could probably hit on someone older than you."". I don't know if it was random or if it was something like ""if you know, you know"".

  
We went together with my car to the place where the other colleagues were waiting for us. We sat close to each other and we talked just me and her for almost the entirety of the evening. There was chemistry, there were sparks.

  
A colleague of mine told me that everyone noticed that. I don't know if that ""everyone"" was generic or if literally everyone did notice it, but still. We even stole a beer glass together!!  
I took her home and asked her if she wanted to hang out this saturday (she wanted to buy a plant for the glass we stole), she said yes, but would let me know about when exactly because this friday she had a party and didn't really know when she would get back.

  
Today, again, I sat next to her. And for the entire morning we talked. Absolutely zero work done.  
When my boss came back, I had to go to the other office to get some proper work done, so I thought it would have been nice to write on a piece of paper something while she was away. So I ripped a piece off of my notebook and wrote something on the lines of ""now we actually have to work :("" plus a couple of inside jokes from the earlier night.

  
After an hour I asked her to go outside to smoke a bit together and we did.

  
When we came back, my boss was gone so I sat close to her once again. I asked her if she threw away the little note and she told me that it made her laugh and that she kept it (have no idea where though). Allegedly, she also kept the wrapping plastic of a chocolate I brought her last week after lunch. Maybe she was kidding, but who knows.

  
Before my boss went away, she started drawing some stuff on my notebook. She wrote a title (""page for Name Surname, 28 Jan 2025""). My boss noticed it and asked her ""hey isn't that OP's notebook?"". She could have said literally anything, and she decided to say ""Yea, he actually takes a lot of notes. Very organised too"". I don't exactly know why, but when my other colleague (who was somewhat close to her when that happened) told me that in front of her, it felt very sweet. I was a bit incredulous about the situation but I said ""thanks"" and I kind of saw her smile while she was still drawing some shapes.

  
It feels... good. It feels intimate. The story with the guy? She told me every detail, but when some other colleague/friend asked her about it she just said ""it went horribly"" and changed topic.

  
She invited me over (with just me and her) twice over the span of ten days.

  
We constantly talk and laugh together. When we smoke, she feel comfortable to let me smoke from her own vape.

  
She felt comfortable enough to share with me all the medicine that she takes and asked me a couple of times to remind her to take them after lunch (which I still do, just in case).

  
I mean, she just broke up from a relationship which wasn't very serious, but that she cared about. But I can't be imagining all of this, right? There is something beneath all of this, right?

  
We don't know each other very well yet, but we talk a lot and I haven't laughed this much with a person for a long time. Knowing that thursday I will see her in the office again makes me feel good.

  
How would I go about this? I was thinking about flirting like I am right now, having fun and casual chit chat with some flirt sprinkled on top and not a lot more of it.

It was a free event and there was a lot to do. Of course there was tea and snacks, but there was also a handpan to play on (very calming and fun) and calligraphy. You could also watch a movie or play Mahjong but I didn't do that (maybe next time?).🀄

I tried five different teas, not sure what exact teas they were but in chronological order:

• Some kind of red tea. Don't remember much of it because I only drank the last 1 or 2 steeps and it was the first one. We also broke a fortune cookie.🥠

• Bulang ripe pu'erh: I liked this one a lot. It was kind of bitter but in a coffee/dark chocolate kind of way so that was nice. I usually gravitate towards sweeter shous but I liked the woody, fruity, spicy notes on this one. It wasn't fishy either which is nice! I did a mini review in my tea journal on this one.📝

• After a calligraphy break and learning the Chinese characters for 'tea' and 'year' and 'snake' I came back to taste some fuding white tea. This one was lovely! Quite sweet and flowery I guess? Nice mouthfeel too. I decided to buy some of this tea to enjoy at home and share with friends and family. 🖌️

• Another red tea. Some special type of Dianhong. This one was very strong. A bit bitter, sour and mostly seaweed notes, but I liked it. 😊

• Last but certainly not least, I treated myself to a soft, sweet (but not overly sweet), fudgy red bean mooncake, which is apparently a traditional snack. I paired this with a tieguanyin, which was a sweet, grassy, fragrant tea. I usually don't drink a lot of oolong but this one was great 🥮

I originally intended to go there with some people I know/drank tea with before but I could only be there during the afternoon. This meant I went there by myself, encouraging me to interact with people I didn't know yet. But immediately I felt welcome and connected because we were all here for the tea and the calm vibes. There were a lot of nice conversations and I made some new tea friends. I also learned a couple of new things regarding traditional etiquette and processing of ripe pu'erh.

Also the coffee scenario was so unnecessary. 
Example… I manage a restaurant and one of my servers the other day was nice enough to offer to get us coffee from dunkin, she came back with a hot coffee for me instead of iced (I wanted iced) what did I say to her? “Thank you that was really nice of you to do that” 
Set it in a freezer, got some work done, then poured it over ice after 30 minutes of cooling. 

This was after I only had 3 hours of sleep, didn’t eat a damn thing and was freezing my whole ass off because the heat in the building was being sucky that day (I prefer drinking cold in any weather personally)
It’s not that hard to not be an asshole. Girly was filming while on a vacay with her man, friends and family. It was not even that deep. It’s free to be a decent person lol 

Just be happy with the opportunity maybe?

Crazy ass concept lmfao 

Also the fears she has, she just falls into them and flexes them like they make her edgy and relatable. I almost got offed in a damn car wreck and made sure I got over my fear of driving BECAUSE I HAVE TO DRIVE. If you want to be “bI cOaStAl” you should probably work on that. I’m sure she’s better with it now but leaning into a fear only makes the shit worse. It’s like rotting your brain on purpose tf. Like be an adult. All of us have fears here.

With the help of a good friend and neighbour I have managed to exit the relationship in October. 

I'm at a place now where I'm feeling a little confused and not sure what to do! I've moved into my own place, I've got a decent job and I'm able to function day to day but I'm feeling a little empty. I always wanted to go to uni but when we were 20 he guilt tripped me into dropping out, do I go back now being almost 30 years old or has my time come and gone?
 
I come from a Muslim background but have never practised so things with family were hard and because of the controlling aspect of the relationship there it a huge distance between my family and I so we barely speak. I do have a handful of friends who I've been able to lean on through this but I want to be strong and independent and start my life again but I'm also secretly panicking everyday. 

I also get this really uncomfortable feeling around men; like I'll stand in line for a coffee or be at the gym and when a guy comes too near what I think is my personal space (it's just them going about their day and not invading my space at all) I get into an internal panic. I'm at a point where I'm not running off to my car and breaking down in tears over it anymore but the nervousness and anxiousness around other guys is still there. 

What were the next steps for some of you who went through a similar situation and is there any advice for me? I'm sorry in advance if this is wrong place to ask but I would really appreciate any help ❤️

Have a lovely day xx

1icoiwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheerTerror/comments/1icoiwm/something_was_watching_us/,Something was watching us,"The story of what happened began in 2009, a year my family would never forget. Back then, we were a large family. My grandmother, with her seven children, had built a rapidly growing dynasty. Each of her children had at least two kids, except for my aunt, who never had children, and my mother, who only had me. In total, we were eleven grandchildren. Every year, during the holidays, it was our tradition to gather and travel as a family. But the year 2009 would be different.

My uncle Alejandro, a man with an adventurous spirit, had bought a farm in a rural area with a warm and temperate climate. The farm seemed like something out of a dream: a white house on top of a small hill, with two floors and balconies in every room, from which you could see the entire valley. At the bottom of the hill, there was a large parking area, and a little further away, a big, lonely one-story house hidden among trees. The landscape was so beautiful that sometimes we felt as if we were in another world, one where time stood still.

But what impressed me the most were the sounds. The whisper of the wind through the trees, the singing of geese and ducks in the small lake, the distant neighing of the horses. It was a place that, although seemingly perfect, had something in its stillness that I couldn’t quite understand. Something I couldn’t name, just like when a child feels fear but can’t explain why—it’s just… instinct.

My uncle Alejandro invited us to spend a few days at the farm. We were all excited. My cousins and I played and laughed nonstop. We swam in the pool, explored every corner of the property, and the fresh morning air was the perfect refuge for our endless games. Everything seemed idyllic, almost unreal.
But after those days of fun, we had to return to the city. 

The children had to go back to school, and the adults to their jobs. My uncle, due to his commitments, couldn’t be there all the time, so he decided to hire someone to take care of the farm and the animals in his absence. Mr. Ramón, a sturdy man with a deep voice, arrived with his wife—a woman with an expressionless face—and their two children, Esteban and Sara. Esteban, a boy of about nine or ten years old, had a sad look in his eyes, as if childhood laughter had slipped away from him too quickly. Sara, his sister, was a mystery. Though she was about our age, her behavior was more like that of someone much older—quiet, distant, lost in thoughts we couldn’t understand.

Mr. Ramón’s family stayed at the farm whenever my uncle wasn’t there. But when we or other guests arrived, they moved to a set of rooms my uncle had built especially for them, a place separate from the main house. Even so, we shared the kitchen and the rest of the farm, and although it was sometimes difficult to ignore the fleeting glances or the awkward silence of Mr. Ramón’s wife, the adults acted kindly, as if everything was fine.

For us children, it seemed like the perfect situation—so much freedom, so much space to play and explore. During that year’s holiday season, when the whole family gathered at the farm again, we ran excitedly toward the pool, laughing and chatting. We invited Mr. Ramón’s children to join us, but their response was less enthusiastic than we expected. Esteban was shy, but his eyes sparkled with the curiosity of someone who wanted to belong but couldn’t. Sara, on the other hand… she always seemed miles away, as if her body was at the farm, but her mind was elsewhere, in another time. Most of the day, we saw her sitting alone in a quiet corner or staring at the horizon.

What unsettled me the most was the relationship between Sara and her mother. The woman was always cold and distant with us children. Never a smile, never an invitation to play. Her attitude was entirely different when she interacted with the adults—then she became a charming, warm woman who made everyone laugh. But in the presence of children, her face would turn blank, as if she didn’t know how to interact with us. It wasn’t just my imagination; my mother and my aunts noticed it too, though they never spoke about it openly.

Night came quickly, as it often does in remote places, where the sun sets without a trace. We were exhausted, gathering in our rooms to sleep, while the adults stayed outside on the terrace, surrounded by the murmurs of the night. They laughed, shared cold beers and snacks, but something in the air, something in the stillness of the farm, made me uneasy. I, gripped by an inexplicable curiosity, got out of bed without knowing exactly why. I just felt an urgent need to get closer, to hear more. Maybe I wanted to ask my mother for something, but as I approached the balcony, something in the air made me stop. Instead of stepping forward, I stayed hidden in the shadows, unnoticed.

That was when I heard the conversation. Mr. Ramón, with his deep voice, was talking to my uncle Alejandro and the other adults. Something in his words made my skin crawl. Apparently, before our arrival, the farm had been rented out to a parish or a center that organized spiritual retreats. During one of these retreats, a group of nuns and young novices—women preparing to enter the convent—had arrived, hoping to find peace and tranquility in that remote setting. But things hadn’t gone as expected.

Mr. Ramón recounted that the nuns hadn’t even spent a single night at the farm. Just hours after arriving, they began packing their belongings in a hurry, their desperation palpable. They rushed to the entrance and, between nervous whispers and hurried prayers, demanded to leave immediately. Mr. Ramón, surprised, tried to stop them. He explained that the road to town was long and that he couldn’t drive them, as his truck wasn’t available at the time. But the women, visibly terrified, refused to stay another minute in that place. They called someone, though Mr. Ramón never knew who. The only thing he remembered was that, after hours of waiting, a young man arrived in a truck—the kind used to transport crops or livestock.

The nuns climbed into the vehicle as if the ground beneath them was burning, afraid to touch any part of that land. At that moment, the mother superior approached Mr. Ramón and, before getting into the truck, told him something that left him paralyzed:

—“Leave this place. Your family is being watched.”

The weight of those words left Mr. Ramón speechless. He had never noticed anything strange in his family, though his eyes had been clouded by the routine of tending the farm, and no one in the family had mentioned anything unusual. But that warning from the mother superior kept echoing in his mind—something didn’t add up. And later, when our family arrived, things began happening that he could no longer ignore.

My mother and my uncle’s wife, Estrella, had noticed something strange about Mrs. Ramón’s behavior and her daughter, Sara. The way she looked at us children—that coldness, that detachment—and how Sara always seemed absent, as if she lived in another world. It made them uneasy, and they decided to speak to Mr. Ramón, to share their concerns. That was when he started to remember, to connect the dots, and realized that something deeper, something darker, was happening at the farm, something hidden until that moment.

Then, I heard Mr. Ramón ask the adults about some crosses. Crosses? What crosses? His face was tense with worry. He described finding crosses in different parts of the farm—some buried, others partially visible, as if they had been deliberately hidden. In places we had never noticed before: near the fountain, between the two houses, behind the hilltop house, among the trees, by the geese’s lake, near the horse stable, even by the main entrance.

Who had put them there? And why?

A heavy silence settled over the night, as if something unseen was lurking in the shadows. Then, in a low, almost whispering voice, Mr. Ramón asked my uncle Alejandro:
—“Has anyone else been here when we weren’t? Has someone entered without us knowing?”
My uncle, with a furrowed brow, shook his head, but there was a spark of doubt in his eyes. He didn’t know how to respond because he, too, had noticed something strange. It wasn’t just the presence of the crosses but something in the air—something intangible and invisible, yet everyone could feel it.

It was my mother who finally broke the silence, looking at Mr. Ramón with a serious, almost sorrowful expression.

—“That’s not normal. We haven’t placed crosses on the farm, and we hadn’t seen them before. And now, suddenly, they appear. What’s going on here?”

But there were no answers. No one knew what to think. We only knew that something was out of place—something we couldn’t comprehend.

The next day, I was no longer myself. I couldn’t behave normally after that conversation. My eyes wandered everywhere; I needed to confirm the presence of the crosses. I managed to find the ones in the garden, the one among the trees near the lake, and the one behind the main house. They were very rudimentary crosses, made of branches with a very dark hue, almost ebony, tied together with twine or some type of rope. I couldn’t bring myself to approach them—something told me I shouldn’t touch them. But at least now I knew they were real.

That same night, the air was thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself were breathing over us. Outside, the adults continued searching with their flashlights for something no one could see—whispers and uneasy glances as they tried to decipher the source of a noise that had broken the night’s silence on the farm. I watched from the half-open door, my heart pounding in my chest. That’s when I saw her.

Sara.

She passed in front of us without making a sound, as if floating in the shadows. Her dark hair was tied in a braid. I could see that her gaze was fixed on a point beyond, a destination invisible to everyone except her. She walked with unsettling confidence—without hesitation, without even glancing at us.

—“Why is she going to the lake?” my little cousin Andrés whispered, his voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. It didn’t make sense. It was too late, the night was dense, the farm was immersed in almost complete darkness… and yet, Sara walked as if she knew every inch of the ground beneath her feet, as if something were guiding her.

My eyes instinctively turned to Mr. Ramón’s wife. She remained standing at the doorway, holding her flashlight unlit in her hands. She made no move to stop her daughter. She didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to follow her. She just stood there, motionless. And the most terrifying thing was her expression. There was no fear in her eyes, no concern… only resignation.

A chill ran down my spine.
My body urged me to act, to call her name, to run after her… but something—something I couldn’t explain—kept me anchored to the ground, as if interfering would be a mistake.

—“I’m going to tell my mom,” I whispered, and without waiting for an answer, I ran upstairs.

My mother was lying down, but when I told her what I had seen, her expression changed immediately. She got up and said she would go tell Mr. Ramón. I clung to her arm as I followed her, but I never knew if she actually did.

The next morning, breakfast at the farm took place in tense silence. Amid the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, I heard something that made me shudder. Someone would come to take care of the crosses.

My uncle Alejandro said it with firm resolve, as if it were the only possible solution. His wife, Estrella, looked at him with reproach and concern. My mother and my aunt simply averted their gazes and continued eating, avoiding the topic. I, on the other hand, felt immense helplessness. It seemed like I was the only child who couldn’t ignore what was happening on the farm. My little cousins remained silent, avoiding any contact with Ramón’s family. And Sara… I never saw her again.

Her absence also unsettled my mother, who asked Ramón’s wife about her daughter. The woman responded with a kind, serene smile:

—“She’s sick, but she’s recovering.”

As she spoke, she took my mother’s hands in hers with a tenderness that made no sense. She seemed so genuine, so empathetic… but when I looked closely, I knew she was lying. The truth wasn’t in her smile—it was in her eyes. You always have to look at people’s eyes; that’s where their real thoughts hide.

The next day, we left the farm and went to the town. We needed a distraction, to get away from that suffocating atmosphere. We walked through the plaza, visited the church, and bought some traditional pastries. For the first time in days, everything seemed fine. But when we returned, night had already fallen over the farm, and the first thing we noticed was the light on in the house on the plain.

—“Ramón and his family left this morning for his parents’ house,” my uncle Alejandro said, frowning. “No one should be here.”

We stopped in front of the house, staring at that single illuminated window in the darkness.

—“Ramón must have forgotten to turn off the light,” he tried to reassure us.

Without hesitation, he walked towards the house, determined to check that everything was in order. My aunt Carla, for some reason, took out her camera and snapped a picture of the scene. Minutes passed before my uncle returned.

—“There’s nothing strange, just a light left on,” he said naturally, as if there was nothing to worry about.

But my aunt didn’t reply. She was staring at her camera screen, her expression turning to pure horror.

—“Oh my God…” my mother whispered, covering her mouth with a hand.

I moved closer, trying to see what they were looking at. In the photo, in the lit window, there was a clear silhouette of a man—or something resembling a man. He was sitting sideways, his profile barely outlined by the light. But the most disturbing thing was his abdomen—it protruded unnaturally, swollen or deformed.
Silence fell over us. My uncle Alejandro checked the image and shook his head.

—“There was no one there… I went in, I checked every room. There was no one.”

But the image didn’t lie. Fear took hold of the adults. They grabbed our hands and hurried us into the main house. That night, no one slept alone. They pulled mattresses onto the floor, brought blankets and pillows, and we all stayed in the same room, with the lights on and the adults keeping watch. No one mentioned the photo. No one spoke of the shadow in the window. And I don’t know why we simply didn’t leave that very night.

By morning, the decision had been made. They woke us before dawn, everything was packed and ready. We had a quick breakfast, and without looking back, we left the farm. The journey back to the city was long and silent. But once home, everything seemed to return to normal—or so we thought.

A few days later, my aunt Carla was reviewing the photos she had taken during the trip. She connected her camera to the TV to project them. Only she, my mother, and I were in the room, watching the screen. The first images were normal—us playing, exploring, laughing at the farm. But then, something changed.
Spots appeared in the photos.

Circles—some dark, others whitish, like shadows floating in the air. At first, we thought it was a camera glitch. But as we kept looking, the spots became clearer. If you stopped and looked closely… if you got close enough… you could see human features in them.

Eyes.
Mouths open in anguish.
Figures that hadn’t been there when the photos were taken.

My aunt Carla turned off the screen immediately.

A year later, my uncle put the farm up for sale. It wasn’t easy to sell. More than a year passed before someone showed interest. And during that time… more things happened. But that’s another story.
The truth is, we never found out what really happened.

What were those crosses?

What was that figure in the window?

And what were those dark and white spheres?",1,1738135820.0,SheerTerror,0,1.0,False

They laughed, shared cold beers and snacks, but something in the air, something in the stillness of the farm, made me uneasy. I, gripped by an inexplicable curiosity, got out of bed without knowing exactly why. I just felt an urgent need to get closer, to hear more. Maybe I wanted to ask my mother for something, but as I approached the balcony, something in the air made me stop. Instead of stepping forward, I stayed hidden in the shadows, unnoticed.

That was when I heard the conversation. Mr. Ramón, with his deep voice, was talking to my uncle Alejandro and the other adults. Something in his words made my skin crawl. Apparently, before our arrival, the farm had been rented out to a parish or a center that organized spiritual retreats. During one of these retreats, a group of nuns and young novices—women preparing to enter the convent—had arrived, hoping to find peace and tranquility in that remote setting. But things hadn’t gone as expected.

Mr. Ramón recounted that the nuns hadn’t even spent a single night at the farm. Just hours after arriving, they began packing their belongings in a hurry, their desperation palpable. They rushed to the entrance and, between nervous whispers and hurried prayers, demanded to leave immediately. Mr. Ramón, surprised, tried to stop them. He explained that the road to town was long and that he couldn’t drive them, as his truck wasn’t available at the time. But the women, visibly terrified, refused to stay another minute in that place. They called someone, though Mr. Ramón never knew who. The only thing he remembered was that, after hours of waiting, a young man arrived in a truck—the kind used to transport crops or livestock.

The nuns climbed into the vehicle as if the ground beneath them was burning, afraid to touch any part of that land. At that moment, the mother superior approached Mr. Ramón and, before getting into the truck, told him something that left him paralyzed:

—“Leave this place. Your family is being watched.”

The weight of those words left Mr. Ramón speechless. He had never noticed anything strange in his family, though his eyes had been clouded by the routine of tending the farm, and no one in the family had mentioned anything unusual. But that warning from the mother superior kept echoing in his mind—something didn’t add up. And later, when our family arrived, things began happening that he could no longer ignore.

My mother and my uncle’s wife, Estrella, had noticed something strange about Mrs. Ramón’s behavior and her daughter, Sara. The way she looked at us children—that coldness, that detachment—and how Sara always seemed absent, as if she lived in another world. It made them uneasy, and they decided to speak to Mr. Ramón, to share their concerns. That was when he started to remember, to connect the dots, and realized that something deeper, something darker, was happening at the farm, something hidden until that moment.

Then, I heard Mr. Ramón ask the adults about some crosses. Crosses? What crosses? His face was tense with worry. He described finding crosses in different parts of the farm—some buried, others partially visible, as if they had been deliberately hidden. In places we had never noticed before: near the fountain, between the two houses, behind the hilltop house, among the trees, by the geese’s lake, near the horse stable, even by the main entrance.

Who had put them there? And why?

A heavy silence settled over the night, as if something unseen was lurking in the shadows. Then, in a low, almost whispering voice, Mr. Ramón asked my uncle Alejandro:
—“Has anyone else been here when we weren’t? Has someone entered without us knowing?”
My uncle, with a furrowed brow, shook his head, but there was a spark of doubt in his eyes. He didn’t know how to respond because he, too, had noticed something strange. It wasn’t just the presence of the crosses but something in the air—something intangible and invisible, yet everyone could feel it.

It was my mother who finally broke the silence, looking at Mr. Ramón with a serious, almost sorrowful expression.

—“That’s not normal. We haven’t placed crosses on the farm, and we hadn’t seen them before. And now, suddenly, they appear. What’s going on here?”

But there were no answers. No one knew what to think. We only knew that something was out of place—something we couldn’t comprehend.

The next day, I was no longer myself. I couldn’t behave normally after that conversation. My eyes wandered everywhere; I needed to confirm the presence of the crosses. I managed to find the ones in the garden, the one among the trees near the lake, and the one behind the main house. They were very rudimentary crosses, made of branches with a very dark hue, almost ebony, tied together with twine or some type of rope. I couldn’t bring myself to approach them—something told me I shouldn’t touch them. But at least now I knew they were real.

That same night, the air was thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself were breathing over us. Outside, the adults continued searching with their flashlights for something no one could see—whispers and uneasy glances as they tried to decipher the source of a noise that had broken the night’s silence on the farm. I watched from the half-open door, my heart pounding in my chest. That’s when I saw her.

Sara.

She passed in front of us without making a sound, as if floating in the shadows. Her dark hair was tied in a braid. I could see that her gaze was fixed on a point beyond, a destination invisible to everyone except her. She walked with unsettling confidence—without hesitation, without even glancing at us.

—“Why is she going to the lake?” my little cousin Andrés whispered, his voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. It didn’t make sense. It was too late, the night was dense, the farm was immersed in almost complete darkness… and yet, Sara walked as if she knew every inch of the ground beneath her feet, as if something were guiding her.

My eyes instinctively turned to Mr. Ramón’s wife. She remained standing at the doorway, holding her flashlight unlit in her hands. She made no move to stop her daughter. She didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to follow her. She just stood there, motionless. And the most terrifying thing was her expression. There was no fear in her eyes, no concern… only resignation.

A chill ran down my spine.
My body urged me to act, to call her name, to run after her… but something—something I couldn’t explain—kept me anchored to the ground, as if interfering would be a mistake.

—“I’m going to tell my mom,” I whispered, and without waiting for an answer, I ran upstairs.

My mother was lying down, but when I told her what I had seen, her expression changed immediately. She got up and said she would go tell Mr. Ramón. I clung to her arm as I followed her, but I never knew if she actually did.

The next morning, breakfast at the farm took place in tense silence. Amid the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, I heard something that made me shudder. Someone would come to take care of the crosses.

My uncle Alejandro said it with firm resolve, as if it were the only possible solution. His wife, Estrella, looked at him with reproach and concern. My mother and my aunt simply averted their gazes and continued eating, avoiding the topic. I, on the other hand, felt immense helplessness. It seemed like I was the only child who couldn’t ignore what was happening on the farm. My little cousins remained silent, avoiding any contact with Ramón’s family. And Sara… I never saw her again.

Her absence also unsettled my mother, who asked Ramón’s wife about her daughter. The woman responded with a kind, serene smile:

—“She’s sick, but she’s recovering.”

As she spoke, she took my mother’s hands in hers with a tenderness that made no sense. She seemed so genuine, so empathetic… but when I looked closely, I knew she was lying. The truth wasn’t in her smile—it was in her eyes. You always have to look at people’s eyes; that’s where their real thoughts hide.

The next day, we left the farm and went to the town. We needed a distraction, to get away from that suffocating atmosphere. We walked through the plaza, visited the church, and bought some traditional pastries. For the first time in days, everything seemed fine. But when we returned, night had already fallen over the farm, and the first thing we noticed was the light on in the house on the plain.

—“Ramón and his family left this morning for his parents’ house,” my uncle Alejandro said, frowning. “No one should be here.”

We stopped in front of the house, staring at that single illuminated window in the darkness.

—“Ramón must have forgotten to turn off the light,” he tried to reassure us.

Without hesitation, he walked towards the house, determined to check that everything was in order. My aunt Carla, for some reason, took out her camera and snapped a picture of the scene. Minutes passed before my uncle returned.

—“There’s nothing strange, just a light left on,” he said naturally, as if there was nothing to worry about.

But my aunt didn’t reply. She was staring at her camera screen, her expression turning to pure horror.

—“Oh my God…” my mother whispered, covering her mouth with a hand.

I moved closer, trying to see what they were looking at. In the photo, in the lit window, there was a clear silhouette of a man—or something resembling a man. He was sitting sideways, his profile barely outlined by the light. But the most disturbing thing was his abdomen—it protruded unnaturally, swollen or deformed.
Silence fell over us. My uncle Alejandro checked the image and shook his head.

—“There was no one there… I went in, I checked every room. There was no one.”

But the image didn’t lie. Fear took hold of the adults. They grabbed our hands and hurried us into the main house. That night, no one slept alone. They pulled mattresses onto the floor, brought blankets and pillows, and we all stayed in the same room, with the lights on and the adults keeping watch. No one mentioned the photo. No one spoke of the shadow in the window. And I don’t know why we simply didn’t leave that very night.

By morning, the decision had been made. They woke us before dawn, everything was packed and ready. We had a quick breakfast, and without looking back, we left the farm. The journey back to the city was long and silent. But once home, everything seemed to return to normal—or so we thought.

A few days later, my aunt Carla was reviewing the photos she had taken during the trip. She connected her camera to the TV to project them. Only she, my mother, and I were in the room, watching the screen. The first images were normal—us playing, exploring, laughing at the farm. But then, something changed.
Spots appeared in the photos.

Circles—some dark, others whitish, like shadows floating in the air. At first, we thought it was a camera glitch. But as we kept looking, the spots became clearer. If you stopped and looked closely… if you got close enough… you could see human features in them.

Eyes.
Mouths open in anguish.
Figures that hadn’t been there when the photos were taken.

My aunt Carla turned off the screen immediately.

A year later, my uncle put the farm up for sale. It wasn’t easy to sell. More than a year passed before someone showed interest. And during that time… more things happened. But that’s another story.
The truth is, we never found out what really happened.

1icoini,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1icoini/something_was_watching_us/,Something was watching us,"The story of what happened began in 2009, a year my family would never forget. Back then, we were a large family. My grandmother, with her seven children, had built a rapidly growing dynasty. Each of her children had at least two kids, except for my aunt, who never had children, and my mother, who only had me. In total, we were eleven grandchildren. Every year, during the holidays, it was our tradition to gather and travel as a family. But the year 2009 would be different.

My uncle Alejandro, a man with an adventurous spirit, had bought a farm in a rural area with a warm and temperate climate. The farm seemed like something out of a dream: a white house on top of a small hill, with two floors and balconies in every room, from which you could see the entire valley. At the bottom of the hill, there was a large parking area, and a little further away, a big, lonely one-story house hidden among trees. The landscape was so beautiful that sometimes we felt as if we were in another world, one where time stood still.

But what impressed me the most were the sounds. The whisper of the wind through the trees, the singing of geese and ducks in the small lake, the distant neighing of the horses. It was a place that, although seemingly perfect, had something in its stillness that I couldn’t quite understand. Something I couldn’t name, just like when a child feels fear but can’t explain why—it’s just… instinct.

My uncle Alejandro invited us to spend a few days at the farm. We were all excited. My cousins and I played and laughed nonstop. We swam in the pool, explored every corner of the property, and the fresh morning air was the perfect refuge for our endless games. Everything seemed idyllic, almost unreal.
But after those days of fun, we had to return to the city. 

The children had to go back to school, and the adults to their jobs. My uncle, due to his commitments, couldn’t be there all the time, so he decided to hire someone to take care of the farm and the animals in his absence. Mr. Ramón, a sturdy man with a deep voice, arrived with his wife—a woman with an expressionless face—and their two children, Esteban and Sara. Esteban, a boy of about nine or ten years old, had a sad look in his eyes, as if childhood laughter had slipped away from him too quickly. Sara, his sister, was a mystery. Though she was about our age, her behavior was more like that of someone much older—quiet, distant, lost in thoughts we couldn’t understand.

Mr. Ramón’s family stayed at the farm whenever my uncle wasn’t there. But when we or other guests arrived, they moved to a set of rooms my uncle had built especially for them, a place separate from the main house. Even so, we shared the kitchen and the rest of the farm, and although it was sometimes difficult to ignore the fleeting glances or the awkward silence of Mr. Ramón’s wife, the adults acted kindly, as if everything was fine.

For us children, it seemed like the perfect situation—so much freedom, so much space to play and explore. During that year’s holiday season, when the whole family gathered at the farm again, we ran excitedly toward the pool, laughing and chatting. We invited Mr. Ramón’s children to join us, but their response was less enthusiastic than we expected. Esteban was shy, but his eyes sparkled with the curiosity of someone who wanted to belong but couldn’t. Sara, on the other hand… she always seemed miles away, as if her body was at the farm, but her mind was elsewhere, in another time. Most of the day, we saw her sitting alone in a quiet corner or staring at the horizon.

What unsettled me the most was the relationship between Sara and her mother. The woman was always cold and distant with us children. Never a smile, never an invitation to play. Her attitude was entirely different when she interacted with the adults—then she became a charming, warm woman who made everyone laugh. But in the presence of children, her face would turn blank, as if she didn’t know how to interact with us. It wasn’t just my imagination; my mother and my aunts noticed it too, though they never spoke about it openly.

Maybe I wanted to ask my mother for something, but as I approached the balcony, something in the air made me stop. Instead of stepping forward, I stayed hidden in the shadows, unnoticed.

That was when I heard the conversation. Mr. Ramón, with his deep voice, was talking to my uncle Alejandro and the other adults. Something in his words made my skin crawl. Apparently, before our arrival, the farm had been rented out to a parish or a center that organized spiritual retreats. During one of these retreats, a group of nuns and young novices—women preparing to enter the convent—had arrived, hoping to find peace and tranquility in that remote setting. But things hadn’t gone as expected.

Mr. Ramón recounted that the nuns hadn’t even spent a single night at the farm. Just hours after arriving, they began packing their belongings in a hurry, their desperation palpable. They rushed to the entrance and, between nervous whispers and hurried prayers, demanded to leave immediately. Mr. Ramón, surprised, tried to stop them. He explained that the road to town was long and that he couldn’t drive them, as his truck wasn’t available at the time. But the women, visibly terrified, refused to stay another minute in that place. They called someone, though Mr. Ramón never knew who. The only thing he remembered was that, after hours of waiting, a young man arrived in a truck—the kind used to transport crops or livestock.

The nuns climbed into the vehicle as if the ground beneath them was burning, afraid to touch any part of that land. At that moment, the mother superior approached Mr. Ramón and, before getting into the truck, told him something that left him paralyzed:

—“Leave this place. Your family is being watched.”

The weight of those words left Mr. Ramón speechless. He had never noticed anything strange in his family, though his eyes had been clouded by the routine of tending the farm, and no one in the family had mentioned anything unusual. But that warning from the mother superior kept echoing in his mind—something didn’t add up. And later, when our family arrived, things began happening that he could no longer ignore.

My mother and my uncle’s wife, Estrella, had noticed something strange about Mrs. Ramón’s behavior and her daughter, Sara. The way she looked at us children—that coldness, that detachment—and how Sara always seemed absent, as if she lived in another world. It made them uneasy, and they decided to speak to Mr. Ramón, to share their concerns. That was when he started to remember, to connect the dots, and realized that something deeper, something darker, was happening at the farm, something hidden until that moment.

Then, I heard Mr. Ramón ask the adults about some crosses. Crosses? What crosses? His face was tense with worry. He described finding crosses in different parts of the farm—some buried, others partially visible, as if they had been deliberately hidden. In places we had never noticed before: near the fountain, between the two houses, behind the hilltop house, among the trees, by the geese’s lake, near the horse stable, even by the main entrance.

Who had put them there? And why?

A heavy silence settled over the night, as if something unseen was lurking in the shadows. Then, in a low, almost whispering voice, Mr. Ramón asked my uncle Alejandro:
—“Has anyone else been here when we weren’t? Has someone entered without us knowing?”
My uncle, with a furrowed brow, shook his head, but there was a spark of doubt in his eyes. He didn’t know how to respond because he, too, had noticed something strange. It wasn’t just the presence of the crosses but something in the air—something intangible and invisible, yet everyone could feel it.

It was my mother who finally broke the silence, looking at Mr. Ramón with a serious, almost sorrowful expression.

—“That’s not normal. We haven’t placed crosses on the farm, and we hadn’t seen them before. And now, suddenly, they appear. What’s going on here?”

But there were no answers. No one knew what to think. We only knew that something was out of place—something we couldn’t comprehend.

The next day, I was no longer myself. I couldn’t behave normally after that conversation. My eyes wandered everywhere; I needed to confirm the presence of the crosses. I managed to find the ones in the garden, the one among the trees near the lake, and the one behind the main house. They were very rudimentary crosses, made of branches with a very dark hue, almost ebony, tied together with twine or some type of rope. I couldn’t bring myself to approach them—something told me I shouldn’t touch them. But at least now I knew they were real.

That same night, the air was thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself were breathing over us. Outside, the adults continued searching with their flashlights for something no one could see—whispers and uneasy glances as they tried to decipher the source of a noise that had broken the night’s silence on the farm. I watched from the half-open door, my heart pounding in my chest. That’s when I saw her.

Sara.

She passed in front of us without making a sound, as if floating in the shadows. Her dark hair was tied in a braid. I could see that her gaze was fixed on a point beyond, a destination invisible to everyone except her. She walked with unsettling confidence—without hesitation, without even glancing at us.

—“Why is she going to the lake?” my little cousin Andrés whispered, his voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. It didn’t make sense. It was too late, the night was dense, the farm was immersed in almost complete darkness… and yet, Sara walked as if she knew every inch of the ground beneath her feet, as if something were guiding her.

My eyes instinctively turned to Mr. Ramón’s wife. She remained standing at the doorway, holding her flashlight unlit in her hands. She made no move to stop her daughter. She didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to follow her. She just stood there, motionless. And the most terrifying thing was her expression. There was no fear in her eyes, no concern… only resignation.

A chill ran down my spine.
My body urged me to act, to call her name, to run after her… but something—something I couldn’t explain—kept me anchored to the ground, as if interfering would be a mistake.

—“I’m going to tell my mom,” I whispered, and without waiting for an answer, I ran upstairs.

My mother was lying down, but when I told her what I had seen, her expression changed immediately. She got up and said she would go tell Mr. Ramón. I clung to her arm as I followed her, but I never knew if she actually did.

The next morning, breakfast at the farm took place in tense silence. Amid the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, I heard something that made me shudder. Someone would come to take care of the crosses.

My uncle Alejandro said it with firm resolve, as if it were the only possible solution. His wife, Estrella, looked at him with reproach and concern. My mother and my aunt simply averted their gazes and continued eating, avoiding the topic. I, on the other hand, felt immense helplessness. It seemed like I was the only child who couldn’t ignore what was happening on the farm. My little cousins remained silent, avoiding any contact with Ramón’s family. And Sara… I never saw her again.

Her absence also unsettled my mother, who asked Ramón’s wife about her daughter. The woman responded with a kind, serene smile:

—“She’s sick, but she’s recovering.”

As she spoke, she took my mother’s hands in hers with a tenderness that made no sense. She seemed so genuine, so empathetic… but when I looked closely, I knew she was lying. The truth wasn’t in her smile—it was in her eyes. You always have to look at people’s eyes; that’s where their real thoughts hide.

The next day, we left the farm and went to the town. We needed a distraction, to get away from that suffocating atmosphere. We walked through the plaza, visited the church, and bought some traditional pastries. For the first time in days, everything seemed fine. But when we returned, night had already fallen over the farm, and the first thing we noticed was the light on in the house on the plain.

—“Ramón and his family left this morning for his parents’ house,” my uncle Alejandro said, frowning. “No one should be here.”

We stopped in front of the house, staring at that single illuminated window in the darkness.

—“Ramón must have forgotten to turn off the light,” he tried to reassure us.

Without hesitation, he walked towards the house, determined to check that everything was in order. My aunt Carla, for some reason, took out her camera and snapped a picture of the scene. Minutes passed before my uncle returned.

—“There’s nothing strange, just a light left on,” he said naturally, as if there was nothing to worry about.

But my aunt didn’t reply. She was staring at her camera screen, her expression turning to pure horror.

—“Oh my God…” my mother whispered, covering her mouth with a hand.

I moved closer, trying to see what they were looking at. In the photo, in the lit window, there was a clear silhouette of a man—or something resembling a man. He was sitting sideways, his profile barely outlined by the light. But the most disturbing thing was his abdomen—it protruded unnaturally, swollen or deformed.
Silence fell over us. My uncle Alejandro checked the image and shook his head.

—“There was no one there… I went in, I checked every room. There was no one.”

But the image didn’t lie. Fear took hold of the adults. They grabbed our hands and hurried us into the main house. That night, no one slept alone. They pulled mattresses onto the floor, brought blankets and pillows, and we all stayed in the same room, with the lights on and the adults keeping watch. No one mentioned the photo. No one spoke of the shadow in the window. And I don’t know why we simply didn’t leave that very night.

By morning, the decision had been made. They woke us before dawn, everything was packed and ready. We had a quick breakfast, and without looking back, we left the farm. The journey back to the city was long and silent. But once home, everything seemed to return to normal—or so we thought.

A few days later, my aunt Carla was reviewing the photos she had taken during the trip. She connected her camera to the TV to project them. Only she, my mother, and I were in the room, watching the screen. The first images were normal—us playing, exploring, laughing at the farm. But then, something changed.
Spots appeared in the photos.

Circles—some dark, others whitish, like shadows floating in the air. At first, we thought it was a camera glitch. But as we kept looking, the spots became clearer. If you stopped and looked closely… if you got close enough… you could see human features in them.

Eyes.
Mouths open in anguish.
Figures that hadn’t been there when the photos were taken.

My aunt Carla turned off the screen immediately.

A year later, my uncle put the farm up for sale. It wasn’t easy to sell. More than a year passed before someone showed interest. And during that time… more things happened. But that’s another story.
The truth is, we never found out what really happened.

What were those crosses?

What was that figure in the window?

And what were those dark and white spheres?",4,1738135764.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1icoi8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1icoi8o/something_was_watching_us/,Something was watching us,"The story of what happened began in 2009, a year my family would never forget. Back then, we were a large family. My grandmother, with her seven children, had built a rapidly growing dynasty. Each of her children had at least two kids, except for my aunt, who never had children, and my mother, who only had me. In total, we were eleven grandchildren. Every year, during the holidays, it was our tradition to gather and travel as a family. But the year 2009 would be different.

My uncle Alejandro, a man with an adventurous spirit, had bought a farm in a rural area with a warm and temperate climate. The farm seemed like something out of a dream: a white house on top of a small hill, with two floors and balconies in every room, from which you could see the entire valley. At the bottom of the hill, there was a large parking area, and a little further away, a big, lonely one-story house hidden among trees. The landscape was so beautiful that sometimes we felt as if we were in another world, one where time stood still.

But what impressed me the most were the sounds. The whisper of the wind through the trees, the singing of geese and ducks in the small lake, the distant neighing of the horses. It was a place that, although seemingly perfect, had something in its stillness that I couldn’t quite understand. Something I couldn’t name, just like when a child feels fear but can’t explain why—it’s just… instinct.

My uncle Alejandro invited us to spend a few days at the farm. We were all excited. My cousins and I played and laughed nonstop. We swam in the pool, explored every corner of the property, and the fresh morning air was the perfect refuge for our endless games. Everything seemed idyllic, almost unreal.
But after those days of fun, we had to return to the city. 

The children had to go back to school, and the adults to their jobs. My uncle, due to his commitments, couldn’t be there all the time, so he decided to hire someone to take care of the farm and the animals in his absence. Mr. Ramón, a sturdy man with a deep voice, arrived with his wife—a woman with an expressionless face—and their two children, Esteban and Sara. Esteban, a boy of about nine or ten years old, had a sad look in his eyes, as if childhood laughter had slipped away from him too quickly. Sara, his sister, was a mystery. Though she was about our age, her behavior was more like that of someone much older—quiet, distant, lost in thoughts we couldn’t understand.

Mr. Ramón’s family stayed at the farm whenever my uncle wasn’t there. But when we or other guests arrived, they moved to a set of rooms my uncle had built especially for them, a place separate from the main house. Even so, we shared the kitchen and the rest of the farm, and although it was sometimes difficult to ignore the fleeting glances or the awkward silence of Mr. Ramón’s wife, the adults acted kindly, as if everything was fine.

For us children, it seemed like the perfect situation—so much freedom, so much space to play and explore. During that year’s holiday season, when the whole family gathered at the farm again, we ran excitedly toward the pool, laughing and chatting. We invited Mr. Ramón’s children to join us, but their response was less enthusiastic than we expected. Esteban was shy, but his eyes sparkled with the curiosity of someone who wanted to belong but couldn’t. Sara, on the other hand… she always seemed miles away, as if her body was at the farm, but her mind was elsewhere, in another time. Most of the day, we saw her sitting alone in a quiet corner or staring at the horizon.

What unsettled me the most was the relationship between Sara and her mother. The woman was always cold and distant with us children. Never a smile, never an invitation to play. Her attitude was entirely different when she interacted with the adults—then she became a charming, warm woman who made everyone laugh. But in the presence of children, her face would turn blank, as if she didn’t know how to interact with us. It wasn’t just my imagination; my mother and my aunts noticed it too, though they never spoke about it openly.

Night came quickly, as it often does in remote places, where the sun sets without a trace. We were exhausted, gathering in our rooms to sleep, while the adults stayed outside on the terrace, surrounded by the murmurs of the night. They laughed, shared cold beers and snacks, but something in the air, something in the stillness of the farm, made me uneasy. I, gripped by an inexplicable curiosity, got out of bed without knowing exactly why. I just felt an urgent need to get closer, to hear more.

1icohwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1icohwx/nutrition_consciousness_nhi_a_macro_look/,"Nutrition, Consciousness & NHI: A Macro Look","I have had several people reach out to me regarding nutrition and NHI/UAP so I wanted to put this out there to those of you who may be wondering as well.

For a little context:

When I first got in contact with them I had lost 91% of the functionality of my fascial structure and system. The fascial adhesions started to constrict my organs and impact the fascial lines in the vessel which are very important for filtration. Without looking at the structural changes I had to go through, to get back to 100% functionality, the first step was my nutrition. This helped improve my connection with them, as well as my ability to manage inflammation and my own consciousness. Our vessel is not what we think it is. There is a hidden functionality to it. From the 4th dimensional functionality perspective it is a GRAVITATIONALLY BASED VIBRATIONAL FILTRATION SYSTEM and when your fascia goes, everything goes. There is a quantum component related to its functionality which is what allows us to connect with them (think body chills) at a very basic level. More to come on fascia.

Now why is nutrition so important?

This was discussed by Jake Barber but I want you to understand why the nutrition part is so important, and how that impacts your consciousness and the functionality of your vessel. He is correct that most of the food we eat is actually slowly killing us AND IS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS OUR HIGHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION. Anything processed (read preservatives) is basically like you are eating plastic. It is why you will see food lasting way longer then it should from fast food restaurants. The vessel is organic in nature which means that we need to feed it real food. The other problem is that most of what we are consuming is actually designed to get us addicted to it a well. So if you are not consuming fresh vegetables, fruit, and just FRESH food in general then you are eating, more or less, plastic that is designed to get and keep you addicted to it. They have ""hacked"" one of our survival mechanisms to achieve this (dicks).

What does this have to do with consciousness?

Inflammation  is where we start. These heavily processed  foods lead to inflammation which reduces the functionality of the vessel because there is less space for energy to flow. Remember, the vessel from their perspective is a vibrational filtration system and ""vibes"" are a very real thing. If we are inflamed, we are at a lower vibration. One of the true functions of the vessel is our ability to tap into higher cognitive function and inflammation impacts the functionality of the brain as well. The Amygdala is where our fight or flight response comes from and this becomes over active when we have inflammation in the vessel. We, as a species, are still very basic cognitively  relating to baseline survival mechanisms. When our fight or flight response is  in over drive we are in a never ending stress-inflammation-cortisol loop which can lead to a weakened immune system and higher levels of inflammation. All of this impacts the functionality of the brain or consciousness.

Interacting with NHI/UAP contains multiple components, but coming from a place of love  (high vibration)  and mitigating the idea of fear (low vibration) is critical. With that in mind think about the impact this food is having on the vessel. I did not even dive into the addiction side of this as it is a sensitive issue, but I think you can see how poor nutrition can have a negative impact on your consciousness.

Make sense?

Now let's talk about nutrition:

First, talk to a wholistic nutritionist before you start. That is my disclaimer. Remember, nutrition is not about ""food"" it is about nutrients using whole foods as the delivery mechanism. There is also an internality to this for everyone. Your genetics and cultural heritage are going to play a major role in what you can eat, and more specifically what animal proteins you should consume taking into account inflammation and food allergies. Regarding what to eat, your general rule of thumb is to avoid the aisles of a grocery store and stick to the outside walls, where all the real food is. Gut health is critical and should be a focus in general (hot sauce is your friend). Pistachios are a natural cleanser for the digestive track, and when you eat them shelled offer a little dopamine hit. Think minimal to no processed foods. No processed condiments but honey, hot sauce(s), red wine vinegar, and olive oil all great and you can make a lot of your own using just those ingredients. Honey is actually an amplifier for the delivery of nutrients in the vessel. Turmeric and ginger are great for inflammation. This was a big one, no creamer if you drink coffee as you are basically coating the inside of your body with plastic which impacts nutrient absorption. No seed oils as they lead to more inflammation. Hydration is also key, and the higher the PH level the better. Simply put if you can not understand what the ingredients are then try to avoid them. Coffee and tea are fine in moderation.

This is a macro view of nutrition. Eating healthy does not have to be expensive, but you will need to break habits and addictions to food you have developed through known and unknown emotional eating habits. Remember to be gentle on yourself if you start this journey. You are never looking for perfection, just progress. I will share more in the future but because of the questions I was receiving I wanted to throw this out there. Remember: Take care of your vessel, live authentically, and help other people. If you genuinely want to connect to Higher Consciousness then your nutrition is the first place to start, the second is breath work but that is a conversation for another time...

I’ve lived in Toronto all my life and recently relocated to Calgary for work. I’m not much of an extrovert but I will need to make new friends if I want to stay sane while I’m here. 

I heard there’s plenty of Toronto folks who’ve recently made the move to Calgary. If you’re one of the lucky ones to have found your way here, how has your experience been making new friends? If you’ve been in Calgary forever, lucky you, but can you share some insight on how us newbies can make new friends in your city? 

A bit about me: 
- I’m quite shy at first, but will be bubbly once we get to know each other a bit
- I enjoy going out for coffee, playing board games and wandering around the mall. This is as extroverted as it gets.
- I’m an corporate slave so I am basically non existent on weekdays 
- when I’m not working, i usually spend my time mindlessly scrolling through Reddit, IG, YouTube, etc 
- I’m a female in my late 20s, and I have a bf living in Toronto.

He wore the standard Gas ’n Go uniform—polo shirt, slacks, slightly smudged nametag reading Barry - Happy to Help!—but there was something about him that didn’t quite settle right. Maybe it was the way he stood too still when listening, or how his thinning hair seemed carefully arranged, as if he'd considered each strand with great intent. Or maybe it was his smile, a little too wide, a little too patient, like he was waiting for something no one else could perceive.

Frank, the manager, gave him the rundown in the break room while stirring his cup of coffee into a sludge-thick whirlpool. He didn’t seem to notice Barry hadn’t blinked in a while.

“Don’t bother me unless something’s on fire, the pump explodes, or you see a cryptid,” Frank said. “And even then, don’t.” He shuffled toward his office without waiting for a response.

Barry watched him go, then stepped out onto the main floor of the Gas ’n Go.

A single fluorescent light flickered overhead, making the space feel both overlit and strangely dim at the same time. The shelves stood in uneven rows, packed with off-brand sodas, dusty snack cakes, and an entire section dedicated to air fresheners shaped like pine trees. The rotating hot dog rollers whined softly in the background, their contents glistening under the heat lamps.

Tina stood behind the counter, sipping from a Styrofoam cup of gas station coffee. She wore the same uniform as Barry, but hers looked more like a suggestion than a requirement—shirt untucked, nametag missing, expression locked in perpetual apathy.

“So,” she said, barely looking up. “You’re the new guy.”

Barry’s smile didn’t change. “Yes.” His voice was calm, even. Unhurried.

Tina took a slow sip of her coffee, eyes scanning him like she was trying to figure out why he gave her a weird feeling but deciding she didn’t care enough to investigate. “Cool. Just don’t make my day worse.”

“Understood,” Barry said, though ""worse"" was a relative concept he thought.

The bells above the door jingled as the first customer of the morning entered. Conspiracy-theory Chad shuffled in, moving like a man who expected snipers in the rafters. His oversized camouflage jacket swayed with his steps, and his eyes flicked around the store as if the gas station might suddenly reveal itself as a government surveillance outpost.

Chad stopped in front of Barry, squinting. “Who’s this guy?” he asked Tina. “New hire? Corporate spy? Government plant? Skin walker?""

Barry inclined his head slightly. “Barry. Happy to help.”

Chad’s frown deepened. He stared for an uncomfortably long time, his gaze jumping between Barry’s eyes, his uniform, and seemingly past him at something only Chad could see.

After several seconds of intense squinting, Chad slowly nodded, as if reaching some kind of private conclusion. “Right,” he said, grabbing a bag of pork rinds. “But I’m watching you, buddy.”

Barry only smiled.

The day passed in slow, sleepy shifts, the kind where time bent strangely, stretching long and thin in places, then snapping forward in sudden jumps. Customers drifted in and out, some speaking, some silent. The smell of old coffee and synthetic citrus from the air freshener aisle created an almost dreamlike haze.

Barry busied himself with small tasks. He stacked cans, rearranged candy bars, cleaned the windows with almost unnerving precision. No one noticed when the clock above the counter hesitated mid-tick before continuing backward for a full minute. Or when the hot dog rollers slowed, then sped up in perfect unison, as if following some unseen tempo.

Tina didn’t comment when the candy display, which had been in neat rows earlier, was now arranged into strange, swirling patterns. At one point, she frowned at it, tilting her head slightly like something about it felt wrong, but ultimately shrugged and went back to her coffee.

By the time Frank emerged from his office, the store looked more or less the same. Tina was still at the counter, ignoring the world. Conspiracy Chad had returned to argue with a trucker about fluoride in tap water. And Barry, the new hire, was sweeping the floor in long, methodical strokes, his expression unreadable.

Frank rubbed his temples. “Barry, you good?”

“Better than ever,” Barry replied.

Frank gave him a long, blank look, then sighed and went back to his office.

Barry’s sweeping slowed slightly. He glanced toward the front window, watching as gray clouds hung low in the sky, the streetlights flickering despite it being midday. His reflection in the glass lingered just a little longer than it should have when he turned away.

So two weeks ago at the rock climbing gym, I climbed with a 29F girl that I see every other week and I asked her if she wanna get coffee after the session. She said sure. I picked a table, asked what she was getting, paid for both of us, and began chatting away. I asked what she does for fun, we talked about our jobs, climbing shenanigans, and etc. Since she’s a teacher, I asked if she’s got a favorite student or what made her get into teaching etc. I kept her doing most of the talking but there was a couple of silence times here and there. I ended it after 30 mins and she thanked me for the coffee. 

Like wow I can’t believe this was my first ever coffee with a girl. I think it could’ve been longer but I felt anxious. 

Anyways it’s been two weeks and we haven’t contacted each other. She hasn’t initiated anything. Gotta be honest here I wanna secure the “bag” but I don’t want to be an asshole or needy.

1icocxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1icocxd/nutrition_consciousness_nhi_a_macro_look/,"Nutrition, Consciousness & NHI: A Macro Look","I have had several people reach out to me regarding nutrition and NHI/UAP so I wanted to put this out there to those of you who may be wondering as well.

For a little context:

When I first got in contact with them I had lost 91% of the functionality of my fascial structure and system. The fascial adhesions started to constrict my organs and impact the fascial lines in the vessel which are very important for filtration. Without looking at the structural changes I had to go through, to get back to 100% functionality, the first step was my nutrition. This helped improve my connection with them, as well as my ability to manage inflammation and my own consciousness. Our vessel is not what we think it is. There is a hidden functionality to it. From the 4th dimensional functionality perspective it is a GRAVITATIONALLY BASED VIBRATIONAL FILTRATION SYSTEM and when your fascia goes, everything goes. There is a quantum component related to its functionality which is what allows us to connect with them (think body chills) at a very basic level. More to come on fascia.

Now why is nutrition so important?

This was discussed by Jake Barber but I want you to understand why the nutrition part is so important, and how that impacts your consciousness and the functionality of your vessel. He is correct that most of the food we eat is actually slowly killing us AND IS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS OUR HIGHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION. Anything processed (read preservatives) is basically like you are eating plastic. It is why you will see food lasting way longer then it should from fast food restaurants. The vessel is organic in nature which means that we need to feed it real food. The other problem is that most of what we are consuming is actually designed to get us addicted to it a well. So if you are not consuming fresh vegetables, fruit, and just FRESH food in general then you are eating, more or less, plastic that is designed to get and keep you addicted to it. They have ""hacked"" one of our survival mechanisms to achieve this (dicks).

What does this have to do with consciousness?

Inflammation  is where we start. These heavily processed  foods lead to inflammation which reduces the functionality of the vessel because there is less space for energy to flow. Remember, the vessel from their perspective is a vibrational filtration system and ""vibes"" are a very real thing. If we are inflamed, we are at a lower vibration. One of the true functions of the vessel is our ability to tap into higher cognitive function and inflammation impacts the functionality of the brain as well. The Amygdala is where our fight or flight response comes from and this becomes over active when we have inflammation in the vessel. We, as a species, are still very basic cognitively  relating to baseline survival mechanisms. When our fight or flight response is  in over drive we are in a never ending stress-inflammation-cortisol loop which can lead to a weakened immune system and higher levels of inflammation. All of this impacts the functionality of the brain or consciousness.

Interacting with NHI/UAP contains multiple components, but coming from a place of love  (high vibration)  and mitigating the idea of fear (low vibration) is critical. With that in mind think about the impact this food is having on the vessel. I did not even dive into the addiction side of this as it is a sensitive issue, but I think you can see how poor nutrition can have a negative impact on your consciousness.

Make sense?

Now let's talk about nutrition:

First, talk to a wholistic nutritionist before you start. That is my disclaimer. Remember, nutrition is not about ""food"" it is about nutrients using whole foods as the delivery mechanism. There is also an internality to this for everyone. Your genetics and cultural heritage are going to play a major role in what you can eat, and more specifically what animal proteins you should consume taking into account inflammation and food allergies. Regarding what to eat, your general rule of thumb is to avoid the aisles of a grocery store and stick to the outside walls, where all the real food is. Gut health is critical and should be a focus in general (hot sauce is your friend). Pistachios are a natural cleanser for the digestive track, and when you eat them shelled offer a little dopamine hit. Think minimal to no processed foods. No processed condiments but honey, hot sauce(s), red wine vinegar, and olive oil all great and you can make a lot of your own using just those ingredients. Honey is actually an amplifier for the delivery of nutrients in the vessel. Turmeric and ginger are great for inflammation. This was a big one, no creamer if you drink coffee as you are basically coating the inside of your body with plastic which impacts nutrient absorption. No seed oils as they lead to more inflammation. Hydration is also key, and the higher the PH level the better. Simply put if you can not understand what the ingredients are then try to avoid them. Coffee and tea are fine in moderation.

This is a macro view of nutrition. Eating healthy does not have to be expensive, but you will need to break habits and addictions to food you have developed through known and unknown emotional eating habits. Remember to be gentle on yourself if you start this journey. You are never looking for perfection, just progress. I will share more in the future but because of the questions I was receiving I wanted to throw this out there. Remember: Take care of your vessel, live authentically, and help other people. If you genuinely want to connect to Higher Consciousness then your nutrition is the first place to start, the second is breath work but that is a conversation for another time...

1icobii,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1icobii/dark_chocolate_ice_cream_review_of_available/,Dark chocolate ice cream - review of available recipes,"# Intro

I've been thinking recently a lot about *""Dark Chocolate Ice Cream""*. This is my favorite ice cream style. At some point I started comparing recipes and they turned out unexpectedly different. I wanted to share the comparison with you.

# What is dark chocolate?

Before we get to ice cream, what is ""dark chocolate""? Reddit is a multi-cultural place after all and the definition that I'm used to may not be universal. While writing this post I did some research and it seems that the worldwide reality is...complex.

* I used to think that ""over 70%"" cocoa solids is considered dark,
* A few countries have labeling requirements for that, they all say that chocolate must have ""at least 35% cocoa solids"". Others don't have requirements specific to ""dark"", so ""dark"" chocolate equals ""chocolate"" there. It often means that the requirement is even weaker,
* I've seen various people expressing their own definitions ranging from 50% to 100%.

I will keep using my definition but without pretension of it being more or less right than any other. I like it and it's not far from many others so it may mislead some...but few.

# What is dark chocolate ice cream?

To me, the intuitive definition would be *""ice cream that tastes like dark chocolate""*.  
But...I've tried a few chocolate ice creams. I've tried a few dark chocolates. These experiences don't match. Every chocolate ice cream recipe that I've tried is sweet. Dark chocolate is either barely sweet or not at all. Furthermore, most dark chocolate ice cream recipes call for milk ingredients, which is rare (but not unheard of) in the world of dark chocolate.

This discrepancy has led me to a thought that it would be useful to look at the sweetness-bitterness balance. In simple chocolate that is just cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and sugar, the balance is easy and correlates well with cocoa content. Knowing cocoa content we can have a good idea of how sweet a chocolate is (as long as there are no additives like milk). What if we calculated the sweetness-bitterness balance of ice cream? And from the balance, calculated back to ""as sweet as X% chocolate""? Would that be a useful as an ice cream parameter? I think that it won't work as well as with chocolate, but nevertheless I feel it is the best single parameter that comes to my mind. I will now call this sweetness-bitterness balance ""Theoretical chocolate %"".

# How to calculate Theoretical Chocolate % ?

First, sum up cocoa-solids-nonfat (CSNF) of the cocoa and chocolate products in your recipe. Express that as % of the total recipe weight.  
Then calculate sweetness as % of sucrose.  
From my ingredients database it seems that typical chocolate has 46% CSNF and 54% cocoa butter, calculated as a percentage of cocoa solids (not as a percentage of the entire bar). I use that for the theoretical chocolate.  
With that, the theoretical chocolate percentage = (100/46\*CSNF)/(sweetness+(100/46\*CSNF))\*100

BTW, I did not correct for the fact that we tend to eat ice cream cold and chocolate at room temperatures. This affects sweetness perception. Temperature alone will make ice cream feel less sweet than chocolate of equivalent %. I would like to make this correction but I don't know how to.

# What other properties affect ice cream taste?

Dark chocolate ice cream recipes differ in more than just sweetness-to-bitterness ratio. A few other significant properties are:

* Amount of cocoa. Or precisely, cocoa solids nonfat (CSNF) which is the flavoring ingredient. You can have ice cream that's very sweet and very chocolatey at the same time. At the extreme, chocolate ice cream can taste far more chocolatey than chocolate itself (due to faster spread of cocoa solids in the mouth). Some like this effect (I do). Most prefer their ice cream to be milder.
* What exact chocolate and cocoa do you use...but this is typically your choice, not the recipe author's.
* Amount of milk ingredients. It's a big deal as well, there are sorbets with no milk at all and ice creams that are indeed very milky. I am not sure whether all milk ingredients matter to the same extent. I decided to focus on milk-solids-nonfat (MSNF) as its a close analogy to CSNF. But maybe it would be better to think about milk-solids-including-fat instead? I don't know. Anyway....I decided to look as a MSNF-to-CSNF ratio as it has more impact on taste than MSNF alone.
* Other flavoring ingredients. Vanilla, nuts, chilli, coffee, cherry, banana, raisins, salt, cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, rum, rosemary, mustard, smoke, garlic just to name a few. That's too much to cover for me, so I will mostly ignore this topic now.
* Fat percent, total solids affect mouthfeel. The former also affect flavor release (higher fat ice cream will be less intense but the flavor will last longer). Am I missing something important?

# The recipes table

In the table below you can see a summary of a few recipes that I selected. I focused on the ones labelled dark and the ones that just have a lot of cocoa in them, but I didn't limit myself to them. Similarly I focused on the recipes that I've seen recommended, but I did not limit myself to them. One caveat of this table is that the recipes are not pure math as the ingredients have some variability. One notable decision is that unless the authors were precise in the chocolate % recommendations, I assumed that dark chocolate meant 90%, bittersweet 70%, semisweet 50%. YMMV. Don't treat this table as absolute truth, more like a ballpark.

# Some high level summary:

* Judging by sweetness-to-bitterness, I will call the darkest ice cream recipes I've seen bittersweet. I haven't seen a single one I would classify as dark.
* Regardless of what property you look at, the range of values here is very high. There are huge differences between recipes and recommendations mean little in the sense that I suspect that whatever recipe you  take, some will consider it awful. If you're a newbie to chocolate ice cream making and make a random recommended recipe, you may hate it. If that happens, don't worry. There are surely others that you will find more appealing and the table above may guide you in the right direction.

# Comments about recipes

1. Underbelly has a couple of recipes, one based on cocoa powder and the other on chocolate with added cocoa. These recipes are the darkest by the sweetness-bitterness ratio. Sweetness is relatively low, cocoa content is relatively high but both parameters are far from extreme. One thing that surprised me was that they are very different from each other when it comes to milk content. I have no idea why.
2. Max Falkovitz's ""The Darkest Dark Chocolate"". Oh boy, this guy can write. But if I see a promise of ""the darkest chocolate"" for ""the hardcore chocolate fans"", I expect it to be like...dark chocolate. And not just just barely dark but close to 100% dark. This one doesn't seem dark. Not even barely dark, just bittersweet. Max, you have disappointed me. That said, this recipe is quite unique in that it uses cocoa brew (it cooks cocoa nibs in milk and them removes them). I am unable to predict the extraction yield as well or amount of milk removed with the nibs, that's why you see a range. I have a hunch that the actual numbers are closer to those on the left. Another noteworthy feature is the amount of salt. Max likes his chocolate salty.
3. David Lebovitz's sorbet is...interesting. Extreme amount of cocoa. No milk to make it milder. But also extreme sweetness. Overall, very intense bittersweet flavor.
4. Katie Bracco made a recipe that became popular in the ninjacreami sub. I was unable to calculate its properties reasonably well. But for a variant made by ihavetities I could. And I did. It turned out as having extremely low fat and solids content (no wonder for a low calorie recipe). Not much cocoa, but not much sweetness either which made it indeed relatively dark.
5. Jeni's ""The darkest chocolate in the world"". For me, it's a fascinating recipe. Fascinating, because the name is very misleading, it's not dark by any measure that comes to my mind but nevertheless it's recommended a lot. And people indeed say it's dark. Are used to very mild chocolates or is there an element of suggestion? I don't know. Regardless, there are 2 noteworthy features. It uses cream cheese as emulsifier, a technique that Jeni pioneered and others picked up. It is also relatively low fat, more like gelato than ice cream from the USA.
6. Morgan Bolling's ""Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream"" is the most extreme chocolate ice cream by so many metrics. The highest sweetness, by a significant margin. The highest total solids. The highest fat content. And the lowest amount of cocoa. If I didn't calculate it I wouldn't believe people make ice cream with so much sugar and fat. And I wouldn't believe they call them ""dark chocolate"". But apparently they do.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1icoa18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1icoa18/nutrition_and_nhi_a_macro_look/,Nutrition and NHI:  A Macro Look,"I have had several people reach out to me regarding nutrition and NHI/UAP so I wanted to put this out there to those of you who may be wondering as well. 

For a little context:  
  
When I first got in contact with them I had lost 91% of the functionality of my fascial structure and system. The fascial adhesions started to constrict my organs and impact the fascial lines in the vessel which are very important for filtration. Without looking at the structural changes I had to go through, to get back to 100% functionality, the first step was my nutrition. This helped improve my connection with them, as well as my ability to manage inflammation and my own consciousness. Our vessel is not what we think it is. There is a hidden functionality to it. From the 4th dimensional functionality perspective it is a GRAVITATIONALLY BASED VIBRATIONAL FILTRATION SYSTEM and when your fascia goes, everything goes. There is a quantum component related to its functionality which is what allows us to connect with them (think body chills) at a very basic level. More to come on fascia.  
  
Now why is nutrition so important? 

This was discussed by Jake Barber but I want you to understand why the nutrition part is so important, and how that impacts your consciousness and the functionality of your vessel. He is correct that most of the food we eat is actually slowly killing us AND IS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS OUR HIGHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION. Anything processed (read preservatives) is basically like you are eating plastic. It is why you will see food lasting way longer then it should from fast food restaurants. The vessel is organic in nature which means that we need to feed it real food. The other problem is that most of what we are consuming is actually designed to get us addicted to it a well. So if you are not consuming fresh vegetables, fruit, and just FRESH food in general then you are eating, more or less, plastic that is designed to get and keep you addicted to it. They have ""hacked"" one of our survival mechanisms to achieve this (dicks). 

What does this have to do with consciousness?

Inflammation  is where we start. These heavily processed  foods lead to inflammation which reduces the functionality of the vessel because there is less space for energy to flow. Remember, the vessel from their perspective is a vibrational filtration system and ""vibes"" are a very real thing. If we are inflamed, we are at a lower vibration. One of the true functions of the vessel is our ability to tap into higher cognitive function and inflammation impacts the functionality of the brain as well. The Amygdala is where our fight or flight response comes from and this becomes over active when we have inflammation in the vessel. We, as a species, are still very basic cognitively  relating to baseline survival mechanisms. When our fight or flight response is  in over drive we are in a never ending stress-inflammation-cortisol loop which can lead to a weakened immune system and higher levels of inflammation. All of this impacts the functionality of the brain or consciousness.   
  
Interacting with NHI/UAP contains multiple components, but coming from a place of love  (high vibration)  and mitigating the idea of fear (low vibration) is critical. With that in mind think about the impact this food is having on the vessel. I did not even dive into the addiction side of this as it is a sensitive issue, but I think you can see how poor nutrition can have a negative impact on your consciousness.   
  
Make sense? 

Now let's talk about nutrition:

First, talk to a wholistic nutritionist before you start. That is my disclaimer. Remember, nutrition is not about ""food"" it is about nutrients using whole foods as the delivery mechanism. There is also an internality to this for everyone. Your genetics and cultural heritage are going to play a major role in what you can eat, and more specifically what animal proteins you should consume taking into account inflammation and food allergies. Regarding what to eat, your general rule of thumb is to avoid the aisles of a grocery store and stick to the outside walls, where all the real food is. Gut health is critical and should be a focus in general (hot sauce is your friend). Pistachios are a natural cleanser for the digestive track, and when you eat them shelled offer a little dopamine hit. Think minimal to no processed foods. No processed condiments but honey, hot sauce(s), red wine vinegar, and olive oil all great and you can make a lot of your own using just those ingredients. Honey is actually an amplifier for the delivery of nutrients in the vessel. Turmeric and ginger are great for inflammation. This was a big one, no creamer if you drink coffee as you are basically coating the inside of your body with plastic which impacts nutrient absorption. No seed oils as they lead to more inflammation. Hydration is also key, and the higher the PH level the better. Simply put if you can not understand what the ingredients are then try to avoid them. Coffee and tea are fine in moderation. 

This is a macro view of nutrition. Eating healthy does not have to be expensive, but you will need to break habits and addictions to food you have developed through known and unknown emotional eating habits. Remember to be gentle on yourself if you start this journey. You are never looking for perfection, just progress. I will share more in the future but because of the questions I was receiving I wanted to throw this out there. Remember: Take care of your vessel, live authentically, and help other people. If you genuinely want to connect to Higher Consciousness then your nutrition is the first place to start, the second is breath work but that is a conversation for another time...

1ico9pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ico9pw/munch_with_mattmia/,@munch_with_Matt&Mia,"“Come munch with Matt and Mia!” My boyfriend and I chant into my phone.

I take a bite of my salted-caramel-popcorn brownie, “Mmmh … this is amazing!” 

“So chocolate rich!” Matt holds up his double-choc-avocado-walnut brownie, a chunk flying out of his mouth as he speaks. 

While I might have been a little apprehensive when Matt suggested I join his flopping foodie Instagram account - I have zero regrets. A year later and I am literally paid to eat mouthwatering treats from all around the US. Is it possible to complain about that? 

Matt and I wrap up the review - ‘Greyston Bakery’ brownies are an 8.3 out of 10 by the way. We log on to Instagram to check out our latest post.

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

Matt grabs my phone to mute the audio and hops into the comment section. 

“How tf does Mia stay so skinny,” he reads aloud, deadpan, “Mia, is your full name Bulimia.” 

“What the fuck!” I snort into brownie crumbs.

“They don’t bother you?” Matt asks.

“Does it matter?”

Matt shrugs. I stand up from the couch and head to our bedroom. I’m exhausted. 

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I work hard to match my usual chirpy tone. I’m so hot and sweaty today, not to mention tired. I’m wearing a crop top in January! 

I pause to adjust the strap slightly - angles are important - before biting into my red-velvet-white-choc cookie with forced gusto. A little bit of cream cheese icing sticks to my nose.

“Hmm,” Matt frowns at the camera, “This is pretty dry,” he gestures at his cinnamon-swirl-pecan cookie. “How’s yours babe?”

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I scroll through our old videos mindlessly, lying on the couch. I am not looking my best here, I think, flicking through videos a couple months back. 

‘Her face is so puffy.’ A comment reads. 

‘Hellooo weight gain. It had to happen at some point.’

I bite my lip anxiously at a gif of a cartoon fat boy rolling down a hill. God, I better not ever pack on weight like that again. I’ll lose followers, I’ll lose deals - I’ll lose everything! Except fat, ha. Social media is a savage world and if my body changes - so does my brand. One moment I’m the hot chick getting invited to sponsored posts and launches - the next I’m just another chubby babe eating cookies alone. 

“Hey Matt,” I call across the room to my boyfriend, “Did you notice how fat I was back in August?”

His face appears in the hallway. He muses for a moment, “Yeah you definitely put on a few. Makes sense with all the treats we were eating. But you dropped it off really quick. New workout routine?”

I frown at my phone, watching my puffy face bite into a lemony muffin. “No - nothing like that.”

“Come munch with Mia and Matt!”

Today my hands are cold and clammy, I swear my heart is pounding more vigorously than usual. But I bite down on my churros like nothing is wrong. I can’t afford to present anything but perfection to my followers - one wrong move and they’ll scroll right past, click straight onto the next pretty influencer. 

“I have been craving these so bad!” I tell my camera. 

“Oh my god,” Matt closes his eyes, “10 out of 10!” 

I definitely recommend ‘Churromania’ if you’re wanting a cookies-and-cream-Starbucks-Frappuccino flavoured churros. It helps that I am ravenous. I actually force Matt to go back and order me another. And this man - I swear he’s such a keeper - is more than happy to oblige. I haven’t been the one to order or pick-up the food since we started!

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!” 

My phone blasts on unexpectedly loud audio - I almost drop it down the toilet.

“Fuck,” I say out loud, “Wasn’t I supposed to get my period, like a week ago.”

I wipe my sweaty forehead - I’m hot again today - and try to remember when I last had a proper cycle. I can’t. 

“Mia!” Matt yells from wherever he is, “I’m back with the ‘Cinnabon’!”

“Coming!” I shout back hastily but find myself too tired to move. Good lord, I am dizzy. 

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I barely get my words out before delving into my strawberry-cheesecake-chunk-stuffed donut. 

“Wow!” Matt laughs, “You’ve been so hungry lately!”

“Well look at it!” I break the donut into two, showcasing the cheesecake filling to the camera, “Absolutely stunning!”

“And I’ve got the Jamaican-chocolate-and-orange,” Matt bites his masterpiece, “9.4 out of 10!” 

Once Matt turns the video off I turn to him, serious.

“Matt, I’m not kidding, I’ve been starving recently. Eating like constantly!” I inform him. “But I swear, I’m losing weight. Look!”

I stand up, showing him where I’ve held my jeans together with a pin, “This can’t be normal.”

Matt examines me frowning. “Mia, I’m going to need you to be honest,” he says worriedly, “Are you purging?”

“No!” I jump back, stung. “No I’m not! How can you accuse me? You’re no better than all of them!”

I snatch my phone away from him and run from the room. Tears cascade down my cheeks, staining my face with mascara. 

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I look up after hours of doom scrolling as Matt lies down on the bed next to me.

“I’m so sorry,” I tell him, “I know you were just caring about me.”

“You’re fine,” He replies. “I love you babe.”

I lean into him for a cuddle. “But Matt, I’m kind of worried. I’ve missed my period, I keep getting hot and then really cold. I’m losing weight and getting hit with mood swings.”

“You’re fine,” Matt repeats, his voice edged with the tone that always makes me second guess myself. “Don’t stress so much.”

But as I gaze up at the ceiling, I can’t drown out the suspicion that something is wrong. Very wrong. 

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

Matt leans over and pauses the video. “Sorry babe,” he grabs my pistachio-blueberry-cream croissant out of my hand, “I forgot something.”

I frown as he dashes back into the ‘Butter and Crumble’ bakery. What could he possibly of forgotten? I jiggle my legs together as I wait - god I’m so hyperactive today. It feels like I’ve poured ten litres of caffeine down my throat but I swear I’ve only had one coffee. I clench my knees together and distract myself by admiring my thigh gap. 

Matt arrives back at the car with the identical croissants and waves around a plastic drink bottle.

“I needed water!” He explains, grinning slightly too wide. Matt switches the camera on before I can reply. 

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

We clink our half-pound ‘Buckeye’ brownies together. I stuff my apple-pie-shortbread-crust brownie into my mouth as I’m hit with a sudden crash of exhaustion. 

Matt frowns at me as I slump down on my seat. “Babe?”

“Pause the video,” I have time to murmur before my eyes close.

I wake up to my boyfriend leaning over me. “You good babe?”

I sit up from where he’s laid me on the floor and try to ignore the wave of dizziness. 

“When you feel up to it, we’re gonna have to reshoot that,” Matt smiles, “Can’t have you collapsing in tomorrow’s reel!”

“Ugh,” I reply, attempting to form words, “Matt, I don’t know. I swear that brownie was what did it. I took one bite and felt so sleepy.”

He laughs - a little too hard for indignant me. “Babe don’t be silly! It’s not Snow-White’s poison apple! You’ve been tired all week. You’re staying up way too late, we need to fix our editing schedule.” 

“Yeah, I guess,” I smile, even though I’m slightly miffed, “You’re right.”

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I bite into my pumpkin-cake-glazed-old-fashioned doughnut and immediately spit it out. 

“Mia!” Matt yells as I spray his car seat with goop. 

I retch and throw the doughnut back into its box. “No! Matt this isn’t right!”

I gesture wildly to the doughnut. “I take one nibble and I swear my heart rate soared!”

“Are you going fucking crazy?” My boyfriend’s voice cracks slightly, a little too sharp. “That sounds like you were just enjoying it!” 

“Wait…” I stop screaming and narrow my eyes at his face. He’s turning red, flushing purple - out of anger? Or out of GUILT? 

I place my head in my hands and my mind races backwards through all my strange behaviour. The weight loss, the food cravings, feeling exhausted, suddenly hyper, too hot then freezing. The final piece slides into place and I feel sick to my stomach. 

Matt is always the one to collect our food. Matt dismissed my concerns when I told him I was losing weight. Matt pretended it was normal when my temperature flashed and mood swung. Matt was who forced me to shoot videos even after I passed out. Matt. Matt. Matt.

I look up at him and my voice shakes, “What. Did. You. Do?”

“Come munch with Matt and Mia!”

I smile at my boyfriend as we scoff down this week’s  ‘Crumble’ cookies together. 

“Delicious!” I proclaim as I sink my teeth into a hotchocolate-woodfire-toasted-smores delight.

An overwhelming blast of faintness punches me but I chew, unfazed. 

When Matt admitted he’d been spiking my treats with a metabolism enhancer it hit me as a low blow. But once I understood that it was the secret to maintaining my slim figure? 

I gesture at my massive cookie and moan delightedly, “10 out of 10!”

I [23M] broke up with my now ex [22F] of 10 months just about a month and a half ago. I loved her dearly and saw a long future with her, but unfortunately it broke me.

She would raise her voice/change to an aggressive tone during arguments. After expressing how that made me feel, she understood, but resolutions that began as late apologies became ""well you caused me to be this way"" and then, ""well you deserve to feel that way"". She would frequently say things like, ""I'm so terrible, how could you love someone like me?"" When things got tense, she sometimes said ""I don't see a future together"" or something along those lines. Very confusing since all other times with her pointed very confidently at the future. I once walked out when she said this thinking she'd broken up with me and she proceeded to ask me why ""I could leave so easily"" and how she ""just wanted me to disagree"" (everything I had said to her already explicitly said I didn’t feel that way). She felt that me spending less on a Christmas gift than her indicates that I'm not trying hard enough. She was convinced that I hated all her friends (I did not, but many did so some questionable things) and/or had interest one of them (I did not). She told me I made her feel like she wasn't good enough when I said I wish I could also see a friend of mine before I underwent a surgery I was nervous for.
She told me that before me she was a totally secure person and not insecure at all, and that I was the one who caused it. She told me she would swallow all disagreeing feelings in the future in order to maintain homeostasis, despite me assuring that I want to listen and resolve all issues.

We met a last time to exchange items and she asked me if I'd ever love her again, told me she'd wait for me, she'd make changes, and that even her parents wanted us to make it work. I even got a call from her father (to my knowledge, unbeknownst to her) 2 weeks later asking to meet w/ him and talk things out (I said no out of respect for her). He is a great guy whom I'd considered a mentor so that was especially tough. To add, I was out w a friend of mine at a coffee shop recently [23F] and my ex’s coworker spotted me. The thought of my ex finding out I’ve “moved on and am dating” sickens me. I hate that these thoughts of her plague my mind.

Luckily I have so many friends/family/therapy around me that have supported me since, who agree that I probably made the best decision. But they don't know how amazing it felt to be me in all those great moments. It has all been so hard. The highs of that relationship (I know, not listed) were far better than anything I’d ever had and from what I see in relationships around me. I know I made the right decision to leave. But I fear I will never come even close to finding that great that I found in her ever again. I will meet people, but I am so scared of being forever dissatisfied and wondering what could have been.

TLDR: I left an emotionally abusive relationship and am confident that it was the best choice for me. The great in that relationship was so good though that I fear I will go on dissatisfied and unwilling to be emotionally intimate with anyone else.

Can’t work, No energy nothing just lie in bed.

The energy tends to come back by 3 pm till 6 after that I feel sleepy.

 Considering this never happened with my old routine of working the night. Also the fact I wake up fully energized what could be the cause??",1,1738134511.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

I’m 5’10”, 260lbs, dirty blonde hair, and blue/green eyes. I’ve got my BS and MS in computer science.

I’m looking to find my person. I’m a hopeless romantic and I’m ready to find the right person that I can spend my life with. I enjoy checking out events and exploring the area, but I don’t like to do it alone. Coffee is wonderful, so a coffee shop date sounds perfect. I also enjoy playing video games to socialize with friends. Other than that, I like music and play guitar and sing. Currently in the process of sorting out my life.

For transparency, I quit my job this past month to relocate down to Palm Harbor, FL from Pittsburgh, PA. I’m not yet in Palm Harbor, but will be within the next couple of weeks. I’m in the process of selling my house, finding a job, and trying to figure out what to do financially. I won’t lie, I’ll be living with my parents while I get back on my feet.

I know things in my life don’t sound perfect, but I’d still love to meet someone, go on dates, and start a family eventually.

While I know I’m not the most interesting person, I love to love and be loved. I want to share that with someone and have a good time in life. If you’re interested in learning more and seeing where things go, feel free to message request me!",2,1738134507.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Got to Port Campbell roughly 1:30? I stopped quite a few times, Lorne, Apollo Bay etc. just to have a coffee, eat some breakfast have a rest etc. 

Once I had lunch and a beer at the pub in Port Campbell, I skipped the GOR and rode through Beech Forest to Sugarloaf Beach. Stayed the night there in a glamping tent at an old monastery. 

This morning rode back to Apollo Bay for some breakfast, then left there back up the coast to BellBrea Estate winery for lunch then got home few hours ago. 

GOR Traffic - was surprisingly good. I managed to miss almost all busses and caravans and most cars pulled into the slow lane when I was behind them to let me past, of course there were a couple pissers (mostly NSW) plates that didn’t understand the concept of pulling over, but I was in no rush. 

GOR road conditions - right after the GOW gateway they’re doing work there, on the way back today I got stuck there for maybe 10 minutes as they’d put it to one lane. Also parts of the road itself are pretty cooked, terrible jobs at filling lot holes, and parts of the road that just look melted and effed. Parts where if you hit it going fast it’s game over. 

All in all, was a great quick getaway, although life was put into perspective after riding past a fatal accident in Princetown, where a collision happened head on because one car was on the wrong side of the road.

I'm excited to share [LinguaLearn](https://lingualearn.ai), a new language learning tool that focuses on natural conversation practice using audio courses generated on the fly.

It's similar to the FSI / Pimsleur / Michael Thomas methods but is revolutionary in the following areas:

🗣️ Generate unlimited conversation practice in any scenario you want (ordering coffee, job interviews, making friends, etc.). It can actually be a lot of fun - I recommend themes such as ""Falling out of a plane and meeting Amazon women"", or ""Life as a Japanese Salaryman"". This also means you can generate an infinite number of lessons!

🌍 Practice in 30+ languages including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and more

🔄 Learn any language from any language (e.g., learn Korean from Spanish, or Japanese from German)

🎯 Choose your difficulty level (A1-C2) and get conversations perfectly tailored to your skill

📄 Get full transcripts of every conversation to review the words that you are speaking (when necessary)

🎧 Listen to high-quality audio and practice speaking along

📱 Free to try - get 5 lessons/month on the free plan

Note that this is currently in beta so essentially I'm looking for beta testers and any feedback would be appreciated, or if you find any bugs please let me know. This is literally my first time sharing this anywhere so there will probably be many bugs and I might have to interrupt the server at times to make changes. Also the servers can be rate limited due to heavy load, I have a solution in mind but will wait and see if I get any active users first and what peoples feedback is like.

Also please if you try it let me know about lesson length. I have it set to about 10-11 minutes, which I like because they are fast paced (in this way it differs from FSI/Pimsleur). I find the fast pacing really helps my pronunciation improve.

Lastly I assure you that if you practice these lessons you will learn a lot! Oh and I'm a real person not a bot so please feel free to ask me anything (related to language learning or the app lol).",0,1738134353.0,languagelearning,0,0.33,False

I loved her dearly and saw a long future with her, but unfortunately it broke me.

She would raise her voice/change to an aggressive tone during arguments. After expressing how that made me feel, she understood, but resolutions that began as late apologies became ""well you caused me to be this way"" and then, ""well you deserve to feel that way"". She would frequently say things like, ""I'm so terrible, how could you love someone like me?"" When things got tense, she sometimes said ""I don't see a future together"" or something along those lines. Very confusing since all other times with her pointed very confidently at the future. I once walked out when she said this thinking she'd broken up with me and she proceeded to ask me why ""I could leave so easily"" and how she ""just wanted me to disagree"" (everything I had said to her already explicitly said I didn’t feel that way). She felt that me spending less on a Christmas gift than her indicates that I'm not trying hard enough. She was convinced that I hated all her friends (I did not, but many did so some questionable things) and/or had interest one of them (I did not). She told me I made her feel like she wasn't good enough when I said I wish I could also see a friend of mine before I underwent a surgery I was nervous for.
She told me that before me she was a totally secure person and not insecure at all, and that I was the one who caused it. She told me she would swallow all disagreeing feelings in the future in order to maintain homeostasis, despite me assuring that I want to listen and resolve all issues.

We met a last time to exchange items and she asked me if I'd ever love her again, told me she'd wait for me, she'd make changes, and that even her parents wanted us to make it work. I even got a call from her father (to my knowledge, unbeknownst to her) 2 weeks later asking to meet w/ him and talk things out (I said no out of respect for her). He is a great guy whom I'd considered a mentor so that was especially tough. To add, I was out w a friend of mine at a coffee shop recently [23F] and my ex’s coworker spotted me. The thought of my ex finding out I’ve “moved on and am dating” sickens me. I hate that these thoughts of her plague my mind.

Luckily I have so many friends/family/therapy around me that have supported me since, who agree that I probably made the best decision. But they don't know how amazing it felt to be me in all those great moments. It has all been so hard. The highs of that relationship (I know, not listed) were far better than anything I’d ever had and from what I see in relationships around me. I know I made the right decision to leave. But I fear I will never come even close to finding that great that I found in her ever again. I will meet people, but I am so scared of being forever dissatisfied and wondering what could have been.

TLDR: I left an emotionally abusive relationship and am confident that it was the best choice for me. The great in that relationship was so good though that I fear I will go on dissatisfied and unwilling to be emotionally intimate with anyone else.

1ico5l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ico5l5/dear_double/,Dear Double,"From the moment we met, it felt like we gravitated towards each other like two galaxies colliding. Every day after I dropped you off at work, I cherished the anticipation of the next time I’d see you. You made me so happy. Every time I looked at you, I smiled because I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. You were everything I wanted, and I saw such a beautiful future with you.

I miss everything about you: making you laugh, holding and cuddling for hours, waking up beside you each morning, asking about your day and listening to your sweet voice, cracking those tough-to-open pistachios, dancing and singing to our favorite music, and so much more.

Those moments meant the world to me, and I thought we were building something real together. I wanted to play board games with you and solve puzzles together. I wanted to make your coffee every more before work. I wanted us to cook dinner together every night and watch 90s cartoons before bed while I rubbed your back. We could have traveled the world together. I still remember your In-N-Out order. These are just some things that make me not want to let go of us.

We got along so incredibly well. We flirted like a bunch of high school kids, and we were playful and silly when talking to Uber drivers (Steveen with two E’s). We would hold hands, touch each other's waists, and give little hugs and kisses in public. It was so cute and perfect. We spent every night together for two weeks. I have never experienced that level of intimacy before. Then, you would cuddle into me and fall asleep in my arms. These are some of the things that made what we had feel so special.

That’s why this has been so painful. I’ve been struggling to process everything that happened, and I don’t understand how we got here. I cared for you deeply, and I believed in us. But now, I feel shut out, left with more questions than answers. Did I mean something to you? Did what we shared matter to you the way it mattered to me? I don’t expect a reply, but I needed to share this to move forward with clarity and peace.

I know relationships are complicated. No one is perfect, and I never expected perfection. I have my flaws, too. But I did hope for understanding, respect, and care—even when things got hard. I just wanted an honest conversation, clarity, and maybe even a second chance. However, I also recognize that relationships require two people willing to work through challenges together.

If this is indeed the end, I need to accept it. I must find peace knowing I loved you wholeheartedly and gave my best. As much as I miss you, I also have to take care of myself. I can’t hold onto something that isn’t being held onto in return. 

I hope you find happiness. If our paths ever cross again, I hope it’s with kindness and understanding.

1ico2zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ico2zx/the_coffee_shop_stalker/,The coffee shop stalker,"I first saw her on a cold November evening, walking home alone through the dimly lit streets. She moved with a quiet grace, oblivious to the world around her. Her long coat billowed slightly in the wind, her hair catching the glow of the flickering streetlights. I don’t know what it was about her that caught my attention, but in that moment, something shifted inside me.

At first, I told myself it was curiosity. Nothing more. I had no intention of getting close, no real reason to watch her beyond that fleeting interest. But as the days passed, I found myself searching for her without realizing it. I adjusted my routine to match hers. I knew what time she left for work, what time she came home. She had a habit of stopping by a small coffee shop on the corner of Lexington and Pine, always ordering the same drink—a vanilla latte with exactly one sugar.

She was beautiful in a quiet, unassuming way. Not the kind of beauty that turned heads on the street, but something softer, something you had to really look at to appreciate. And I did look. I watched her from a distance, my presence as invisible as the breath in the night air.

The first time I followed her home, it wasn’t planned. She left the coffee shop, the steam from her cup rising into the cold air, and I just… walked behind her. Not too close, not close enough to be noticed. Her apartment building was old, bricks weathered with time, the windows slightly fogged from the heat inside. I watched her unlock the door and disappear.

I should have left it at that.

But I didn’t.

It became routine. A ritual. I lingered near her apartment, just out of sight. I listened to the sound of her footsteps in the hallway, memorized the way the light in her bedroom flicked on at the same time every night. I could see her silhouette through the curtains, moving about her room, completely unaware that I was watching.

It felt good, knowing her without her knowing me.

One night, I got bolder. The lock on the building’s front door was old, easy to force with just a little pressure. I stepped inside, the warmth of the hallway wrapping around me like a blanket. The air smelled like dust and something faintly floral. Her perfume, maybe.

I stood outside her door, listening. The soft hum of a television, the occasional rustling of fabric. My fingers twitched, itching to turn the knob. Just to see if it was locked. Just to know how easy it would be to slip inside.

But I wasn’t ready. Not yet.

I took a step back, forcing myself to leave.

That night, I dreamt about her. About what it would be like to stand beside her, to reach out and touch her hair, to whisper her name even though I didn’t know it. I woke up with my heart pounding.

The need grew stronger after that. Watching wasn’t enough anymore. I wanted more.

I started leaving little things behind. A single flower on her doorstep. A note tucked into her mailbox with no words, just a blank page. A button from my coat placed carefully on the windowsill outside her apartment. I wondered if she noticed. If she felt the weight of my presence the way I felt hers.

Then something changed.

She started looking over her shoulder when she walked home. Pausing before unlocking her door. Lingering by the window, peering into the darkness as if she sensed me there.

She knew.

She didn’t know who—but she knew someone was watching.

I should have stopped. I should have disappeared from her life before she could find out the truth. But the fear in her eyes only made me want her more.

One night, I found her standing outside the coffee shop, phone pressed to her ear, speaking in hushed tones. I stayed in the shadows, listening.

“I think someone’s following me,” she whispered. “I don’t know, it’s just… a feeling. Like someone’s always there, just out of sight.”

The person on the other end said something I couldn’t hear.

“No, I haven’t seen anyone,” she said. “But I know I’m not imagining it.”

She was scared. It made my pulse race.

I had to be more careful. More patient. If I wanted this to last, I couldn’t rush.

That night, I stood outside her building longer than usual, staring up at her window. The light was off, but I could see a faint outline of her curled up in bed. I imagined slipping inside, standing at the foot of her bed, watching her sleep.

I wanted to know what she looked like up close, the details I couldn’t see from a distance. The curve of her lips, the shape of her hands, the way her eyelashes fluttered against her skin when she dreamed.

It wasn’t enough to watch anymore.

The next night, I waited until she was asleep. I forced the front door open as quietly as before, my footsteps light on the stairs. Her apartment door was locked, but I had planned for that.

I had been studying her for weeks. I knew she kept a spare key hidden in a potted plant beside the door. It took less than a second to retrieve it, less than a breath to slide it into the lock.

The door opened with a soft click.

The apartment smelled like her. Warm and sweet, with a hint of something deeper beneath it. I stepped inside, closing the door behind me. The glow from the streetlights seeped through the curtains, casting long shadows across the room.

She was asleep. Her chest rose and fell in slow, steady breaths. Her lips were slightly parted, her hair a dark halo around her face.

I stepped closer.

My heart pounded so loudly I was sure she would wake up and hear it. I reached out, my fingers inches from her cheek. I could feel the warmth of her skin even without touching it.

And then she stirred.

I froze.

Her eyelashes fluttered. A soft sigh escaped her lips.

I took a step back, slipping into the shadows before she could wake fully. My heart was racing as I crept back to the door, locking it behind me as I left.

I barely slept that night.

I had been so close.

And I knew—soon, I wouldn’t be able to stop myself.

The thought sent a shiver down my spine.

Because the truth was, I didn’t want to stop.",5,1738133890.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

For example, imagine doing a cheating roleplay with characters from Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi’s acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It’s shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj’s wife. It’s a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya’s girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother’s old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film…

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi’s hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya’s back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi’s chest a couple of times. He wanted more…

1ico1xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ico1xi/how_to_call_it_off_with_new_friend/,How to call it off with new friend,"I met someone through a Meetup group last year and we started hanging out in the last few months of 2024, right around the time I ended a decades long friendship (it’s in my posting history). 
Perhaps it was an sign  from the Universe about the life change with the end of a significant friendship 🤔 

Anyways I have gotten to know this person (she’s 20 years younger than me at 38) and as I’ve started to get to know her this past while, I’m starting to get weird deja vu vibes. She has mentioned mental health issues (not to judge - she’s seeing a therapist and likely taking meds) and she kind of reminds me of an ex flaky friend (not the long term friend I severed ties with) with her issues. I’m aware that I should not compare the new friend with previous ones.. but I still get an odd vibe from her. 

She calls me ‘my girl’, not in a romantic way, rather as a good friend. That makes me uncomfortable as she really doesn’t know me (she admits to diving into friendships head on in the past) and honestly, I’m not there to truly trust as I’m still grieving the loss of my long time friendship. 

Plus she’s Christian and our political leanings are different.. I respect her belief and don’t discuss politics with her and at the same time, I’m feeling I cannot be my true self with her - not a good omen 

It will be obvious if she’s the only one reaching out.. my thought is that the next time we text or chat, I’d suggest meeting for coffee and being honest with her that I’m not there to pursue a friendship where I’m investing time and energy.. 

I don’t like the idea of ghosting… 
Any other ideas on how to gracefully back away from this friendship?

Dont remember if i even had any coffee in that time, i also forgot i was still awake. It was finals week at university so after the first 24hrs i just forgot that days started and ended.

Ive always been bad at cardio and gym in school bc i had a lot problems with the bones in my legs (shocker...no one believed me) and lack of energy from the insomnia (again...no one believed me) now i struggle to just stand in the kitchen to make breakfast. Takes me 3 hours to get some pancakes and an omlet bc i have to sit down.

But my brain? Fucking vibing. Like metal in a blender, listening to that all day every day for 25 years is bound to make someone go crazy, i get angry now when my brain has a thought that i didnt put there and it feels like metal in a blender. I am fucking exhausted by 4pm and ready to start MMA at 2am, no training.

Sometimes i think my body falls asleep but my brain is running in the background like it's an old windows pc screen saver, but the little square NEVER touches the corner.

And I've worn those fitness watches for tracking sleep (even for a paid school reserach study so it was a real tracker) and they ALWAYS show me ""being asleep"" at times I KNOW i was awake because i could see the time on the clock.",3,1738133663.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

Could it be that Walt is reveling in the fact that he ""won"" over him? Or perhaps it's suggesting that Walt feels some modicum of remorse, so he's appreciating what Gale left behind? Or perhaps something totally different - I'm not sure.

We’re not super close, but she’s part of our friend group and we went to the same school. She’s dating James, one of my closest friends who attends the same university as I do. When James first expressed his feelings for Lily, I encouraged him to pursue her and was happy when they got together. 

Recently, during a study session with James he said that he and Lily are struggling and on the verge of a break up. He said they fight a lot, Lily initiates most of the arguments, and their intimacy is off. (She says that she’s tired or just doesn’t want to). He seemed heartbroken but still expressed that he loves her and wants to make it work.

Last Friday, at a party hosted by my friend I saw Lily kissing another guy. Later, in the evening I wanted to confront her about it, but before I could say anything, she broke down crying, clearly very drunk, admitted to cheating, and blamed James, saying he doesn’t love or appreciate her. She ranted for hours about how unhappy she is in their relationship and just doesn’t have enough strength to break up. 

The next day, she called and begged me not to tell James. She said she’d confess to him soon and I shouldn’t meddle in someone else’s business. I told her I couldn’t promise that and that it was wrong of her to ask me to keep this from him. After contemplating this decision for a few days I decided to tell James. We met for a coffee and I straight up told him what I saw and how Lily reacted. He looked shocked and hurt. The day after Lily called me in shambles and tears, cussed me out and told me that if I would keep my mouth shut none of this would happen.

This is a bit nerve wrecking but here it goes. I'm not really sure what to say so I'll just be honest. I've been feeling unusually blue and down lately after a missed connection / misunderstanding with someone I met here that I grew very fond of. And for someone who is an empath and usually prefers the company of higher frequency beings like animals, trees, and sunshine I do find myself wanting the comfort of a warm hug from a kind soul.  I don't usually put myself out there, but even the strong need someone to lean on from time to time, yes?

I'm always growing and transforming, I keep pretty busy between work and a program I'm currently enrolled in, and have always been strong, resilient, and independent. I have good intuition, am typically introverted and enjoy my solitude despite being well socialized and friendly in group settings. I'm usually the one people gravitate towards when they have some heaviness they need to unload, and I've been the keeper of many a dark secret, but now I find myself the one wanting to find comfort in the presence of another. I usually find animals, poetry, my journal, and music to be the safest to turn to, in all honesty, and I spend my days working with dogs, which is amazing and wonderful, but I'm still human despite being deeply attuned to the etheric realm, and it would be lovely to meet someone of the two-legged variety that has the capacity to provide safe, compassionate, comfortable quiet moments, without the expectation of anything sexual. I'm open to ages 25+ and looking for someone that is mature and grounded with enough life experience to understand the value of presence and authenticity, who is naturally caring and kind, and does not have a fragile ego. Humor and whimsy are also good and will be much appreciated. I am a 4w5 so I'm very comfortable with uncomfortable feelings, I don't need saving. Just companionship.

I'm equal parts left and right brained, can talk about any topic with greater interest in broader humanitarian causes and social justice, or things related to personal growth and self improvement, than politics per se. I have a degree from a fancy college despite my ACEs, first in my immigrant family to graduate, mentally and financially sound and responsible. I don't partake in drugs of any sort, nor shrooms, and don't drink though I don't mind if others around me occasionally do. When I'm not out walking/hiking or grocery shopping, I enjoy cooking at home, making eggs and pancakes and coffee for breakfast, and just putzing around my place tidying up, or sitting outside enjoying a cup of coffee or tea and listening to the birds. I lead a pretty healthy active lifestyle, am 5'4"" tall and height/weight proportionate, with long brunette/dark hair, light tan skin tone, brown eyes, and glasses. Minimal makeup/natural look.

If you are similarly equal parts emotionally intelligent, mentally sound, financially responsible, with healthy self-esteem, generally happy with your work, and value integrity, kindness, and authenticity feel free to say hello.

Welp! I guess that about covers the major points. Thanks for reading!

Mom fled their home to stay with me for a month while my cousin and her daughter stayed at their house a bit. My cousin works in their city but has a 50 mile commute so it helped her to not have to commute for some days of the week.

The daughter is a creative but damaged 40 yr old who had been living with her mom but the step dad couldn’t stand her. The thought was that she could live with Mom when she returned and look after her a bit and be there so Mom wasn’t completely alone when she returned.

I only remember my mom being a generally kind person though she could be a bit judgmental behind peoples’ backs. Unfortunately the daughter, who is an artistic plant lover, had made modifications around the home, and when Mom returned, it was fireworks! She flipped out about every little thing that was different.

Every phone call with Mom was about how Kathy had done this and that and was taking over. Unfortunately, I felt her examples were extreme. I figured it wasn’t unreasonable to give the gal a space where she could exercise her creativity but Mom took exception to her even personalizing her bedroom space! I could empathize with a person wanting to make herself at home at least in her bedroom, but Mom expected her to exist there like a ghost, having zero impact on the home.

A cousin’s wife lived with my parents for a year and never made an imprint, had coffee with them in the morning, went to work, come home with pre-made meals for dinner not even using the kitchen to cook. She never did anything to personalize her bedroom. She was the perfect guest.

I finally was able to come visit and help with things, and have listened to my mom complain about Kathy and all the inconsiderate things she has done such as leaving a bag of stuff in the pantry instead of taking it to her room. 

I told Mom that clearly Kathy was the wrong person to share space with her as she had needs to express herself and make herself at home. 

Tonight Mom came out swinging and stridently told Kathy it wasn’t working out and that she couldn’t live there anymore. There was a lot more to it but I was left to explain to Kathy why. I was blindsided. 

I’ve never seen my mom behave this way towards anyone directly and it was shocking. My dad was non-confrontational and uncomfortable with conflict and I’m like him. I had to deal with my relative crying, not understanding why this was happening because she had tried to adjust to what was bothering my mom, but how could she know what was wrong without communicating?

I went out to my car to have privacy and call my husband and have a meltdown. 

My sister nailed it, the anger phase of grief. Mom is fighting for control of her world at a time of chaos losing my dad, and her anger is being deflected onto Kathy. I am experiencing delayed grief being in the home I grew up in and always had both parents here when I visited. I want so badly to go back in time when they were both here and everything was okay and normal. I don’t know how to deal with my mom who is lashing out at this target in a way that is unrecognizable to me.

1icnpi9,https://i.redd.it/nso05fmonvfe1.jpeg,License to Drive (1988),"Teenager Les Anderson (Corey Haim) is excited to get his driver’s license, get on the open road and get a date with his crush Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham). Unfortunately, he flunked his written test and was grounded for two weeks by his father (Richard Masur) and pregnant mother (Carol Kane). But he already has the date with Mercedes. What’s a teenage boy to do? He steals the keys to his grandfather’s prized Cadillac and goes out anyway. What follows is an epic night of automotive mayhem as Mercedes gets drunk and caves in the hood of the car, Les’s friends Dean (Corey Feldman) and Charles (Michael Manasseri) convince him to go to a roadside drive-in restaurant, a drunk steals the Cadillac and the car gets progressively more damaged as the night goes on. Further complicating matters is a hilarious series of close calls as Les’s mother announces she is going into labor and his father almost discovers the car missing on several occasions. Can Les get the Cadillac home in one piece, survive his father’s wrath and still get the girl? Only time will tell.

Possibly one of the worst received of the films starring the Two Coreys but still a fun film for anyone who has ever stressed over getting their driver’s license and who has dreamed of the freedom that would come with the open road. Haim and Feldman didn’t spend as much time together on screen as they did in previous films, Haim’s character Les and his relationship with his family being the primary focal point in the film, but their scenes together still displayed the easy chemistry they were famous for. This was the first film I ever saw the beautiful Heather Graham in. It’s just a shame that her character spent most of the movie locked in the trunk, sleeping off her drunken state. Solid supporting performances from Richard Masur and Carol Kane, who made a hilarious double act as Les’s expecting parents, and a fun cameo from our beloved Uncle Phil, the late, great James Avery as Les’s coffee obsessed driving test administrator. To this day, my favorite scene remains Les’s chaotic drive to get his pregnant mother to the hospital, the badly damaged Caddy practically falling apart around them as Les is forced to drive in reverse the whole way.

They never question authority, they don't think for themselves and so on. This is how something like slavery could be legalised and accepted for 300+ years in America. Something like that could never even be thought of in a world where most people are conscious.

While many people may not like the term 'NPC' and find it ""dehumanizing,"" the behaviour and state of consciousness it describes is definitely real.

(F22),"So my boyfriend & I have been dating for 1 month. He asked me to be his girlfriend on the first date. I said yes because we REALLY clicked. I loved him for who he is from the second I saw him. 

The first few weeks, great. He introduced me to his family and I love them. They truly are really nice and I get along with them great. All is amazing.

A week and a half ago, he was sick. He is a bodybuilder & put on weight as he was planning, but he lost 10lbs in a week. He is VERY upset about this. I always checked up on him, made sure he was doing okay. Now that he’s gotten better, he doesn’t respond to my texts with much enthusiasm. I’m having a hard time getting a real conversation out of him. I’ll text him at 7pm and he won’t respond to me for the rest of the night into the following morning, but I know he’s awake and active. He barely gives me anything to go off of on text.

He said he couldn’t believe that he was dating someone like me to begin with. That he felt like he was dreaming. I told him the same thing and that he’s valuable and that he really matters to me (he has low confidence). 

His longest relationship was 3 months, my longest was 3 years. I felt like that was important to note before I go on.

I try to call him within the last week, of course not every day or one call after another, but occasionally. He always sends it to voicemail now, or ends the conversation sooner than it should be. He won’t respond to me for hours at a time now. I asked him what’s wrong in person, because he told me that he feels “broken” and is thinking too many thoughts. I kept checking in with him throughout the day because we were hanging out together when he opened up, but he refused to elaborate the entire day. I let him know that I noticed him pulling away. When I got home, I sent him a heartfelt text saying that it may be easier for him to open up through text instead, and I’m here to listen. He completely ignored that text and didn’t text me good morning the next day until I did. 3 days later, after sparse messaging, and failed attempts for me to try and get him to meet up for coffee, he sends me a paragraph saying the gist of “You asked me what’s wrong. It’s hard to describe, but I compare myself to people at my job and they’re farther ahead than me. I lost 10lbs that took me forever to put on, and I feel like a failure. As far as the relationship, I’m not sure what I’m doing and I don’t want to hurt you”. Etc. I tried to call him, he sent it to voicemail (he was on the phone with his uncle). He didn’t respond to me for an hour or call me back. Then he says “I’m ok.” And ghosts me again. I felt SO shut out. I felt like we really needed to talk it out in person. I deserve to hear about what’s going on because the last week and a half for me has been a living hell. I couldn’t take him not communicating with me any longer after dropping all that. He was at the gym (saw his location, he lives 40 mins away from me), so I decided to go buy a drink he really likes & meet him outside/surprise him and just let him know that he can talk to me, I want to know what’s going on in more detail, and to share my feelings with him in person. He said that he was talking to his uncle, and then talked to his friend for an hour beforehand (which made me feel like he had no intention of returning my call, or responding to my text seem as though he could’ve called or texted me after his uncle, but chose to call his friend) which has been the common theme this last week. 

Anyways, we sat in my car and talked for a bit. He said that him alienating himself is nothing to do with me, and that it’s all on his end. I tried to give him words of reassurance, as I had been doing the whole time. I have never changed how I was acting even when he was acting different. I was doing everything perfectly. Well, he didn’t even kiss me before he left after we sat and talked. Then, he removed both of us from being able to view each others location. I don’t feel like I overstepped any boundaries, because he said he’s dating to marry and of course so am I, and if I care about you, I will do anything for you and go to any lengths to make you feel wanted and listened to. I would have felt really special if someone drove all that way for me just to hear me vent. But he clearly may have thought different. I just don’t get it. 

I just don’t understand this switch up if it was going so perfect in the beginning.
My question is, how do I gain patience? How do I support him? I’m not sure if this is just something that I should walk away from? I can’t even bare to think about that. I’m just tired of trying with almost getting nothing back in return, which is unfortunate seem as though him & I really clicked, and he clearly liked me so much that he asked me to be his girlfriend from the first date. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend asked me out on the first date & shared his location. I agreed and shared mine. First few weeks, amazing. Love him for who he is, he said he can’t believe he’s dating a girl like me. He introduces me to his family. They like me, I like them. He got sick & dropped 10lbs in a week (he’s a bodybuilder and sad about losing weight). He stops talking to me for the most part. Doesn’t return calls, will drop hints that he’s depressed and refuses to elaborate. After a week of barely being able to connect with him, I drive the 40 mins to meet him outside of gym to surprise him with his favorite drink & to just talk things out. Afterwards, he removed himself & I from being able to see each others locations. He says I did nothing wrong & it’s him not being happy with himself. How do I support him? How do I make him feel loved? I’m not sure. Sorry for the length. ",1,1738131463.0,relationship_advice,5,0.67,False

Hey r/Carnivorediet, I really need some insight because every time I try carnivore, I suffer. I don’t mean mild “keto flu” stuff—I mean serious, intense pain that leaves me feeling like something is seriously wrong.

For context, I’ve done very strict carnivore multiple times, and each time, something extreme happens to my body:
	1.	First time: Ended up in the hospital because of intense stomach pain.
	2.	Second time: Had some milk, and my body nearly shut down—felt like I was about to pass out.
	3.	Now this time: Intense upper stomach pain that’s throbbing, twisting, and won’t go away.

What’s Happening Right Now
	•	I’m currently 42 hours into a fast (about to extend it for 12 more hours with just water & tea to see if it helps).
	•	The pain started as light menstrual-like cramps, but then it moved UP into my upper stomach and became throbbing, twisting pain.
	•	It feels like a rock is sitting in my stomach and won’t move.
	•	There’s rumbling/vibration inside, but no sharp stabbing pains, just constant throbbing pressure.
	•	It feels worse when I drink coffee or artificial sweeteners, but I need sweeteners to push through my fasts.

What I Suspect Might Be Happening

I’ve been considering a few possibilities:
	1.	Artificial Sweeteners Destroying My Gut?
	•	I usually tolerate a lot of artificial sweeteners, but I’ve noticed that on carnivore, my gut gets way more sensitive.
	•	I recently had psyllium husk (fiber) with artificial sweeteners + added even more sweeteners on top.
	•	My gut might be fermenting everything weirdly because it’s not used to processing non-meat stuff anymore.
	2.	Gastritis or Acid Issues?
	•	The pain feels deep in my upper stomach, almost like my stomach lining is irritated.
	•	Coffee on an empty stomach might have worsened things.
	•	Sweeteners like sucralose & aspartame are known to mess with gut bacteria and the stomach lining.
	3.	Bile Flow / Gallbladder Issue?
	•	Carnivore is high-fat, and if my gallbladder isn’t releasing bile properly, my digestion might be struggling.
	•	The pain doesn’t feel sharp or gallstone-like, but I know bile stagnation can cause digestive backup.
	4.	Intestinal Gas / Blockage?
	•	The pain moves around slightly, which makes me think maybe I just have a bad case of gas or slow motility.
	•	But I’ve done carnivore before, and I never had this level of discomfort just from gas.

My Plan Right Now

✅ Extend my fast for 12 more hours—only plain tea and water (no sweeteners, no coffee, no psyllium husk).
✅ Try deep breathing & belly massage to see if it helps move anything.
✅ Cut out artificial sweeteners for the next few days and see if things improve.
✅ Reintroduce some light foods after fasting (maybe plain yogurt + eggs) instead of jumping straight into heavy meat.

🚨 BUT if the pain gets worse, sharper, or I start vomiting, I’ll get medical help.

Why the Hell Does This Happen to Me Every Time I Do Carnivore?

I’m just sick and tired of every time I try carnivore, something extreme happens. I see people on here thriving, and I want to lose weight & stay low-carb, but my body is making it so damn hard.
	•	I’ve done strict carnivore before, so I KNOW it’s not just an “adaptation” thing.
	•	Every time I try, my gut rebels in an extreme way that doesn’t happen when I eat junk food, sugar, or even high-carb diets.
	•	It’s not just “keto flu” or “electrolytes.” It’s real digestive distress, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

👉 Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you fix it? Should I switch back to keto and slowly transition instead of diving into strict carnivore again? At this point, I’d rather just be able to function than keep going through this hell.

Any help would be appreciated. I don’t want to quit, but I can’t keep suffering like this.",0,1738131283.0,carnivorediet,24,0.5,False
