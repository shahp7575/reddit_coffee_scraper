1ralrtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futuresmove/comments/1ralrtp/every_trader_says_the_trend_is_your_friend_but/,Every Trader Says ‘The Trend Is Your Friend’… But How Well Do We Really Know Our Friend?,"Last week we were up +6%, this week +2%, and I still have an open trade running. Same strategy, same tools. Different results. And that’s exactly the point: trading isn’t about blindly following rules — it’s about thinking with what’s in front of you.

Let me give you an example. Imagine a restaurant in summer. They only serve coffee in the morning, for breakfast. Everyone knows it. That’s the rule. Then the weather changes, and suddenly people want coffee all day. The restaurant doesn’t stop selling. They don’t throw out the menu. They just adapt. Same resources, same framework, different application. That’s trading.

Crypto futures work the same way. There’s something called funding fees — every eight hours, one side pays the other. In a bullish market, longs pay shorts. That means sellers can make money just for standing short, even if the price keeps rising. Some traders ignore this because “the trend is up,” but smart sellers see the incentive and step in.

Here’s how it works in practice: when price hits a **resistance zone**, sellers use that as their **entry point**. They aim for the **POC (Point of Control) as their target**, but even if price doesn’t reach it, they can take **partial profits along the way**. Then, add the funding fee they collect while holding the position, and suddenly the trade is profitable even with a small risk/reward.

Do the math: last week, the highest funding collected in one zone was 0.79%. On a $50,000 position, that’s $395 just for standing short. Even if you only take part of your target at POC, that plus the funding fee turns the trade into a winner. Scale that to $100k or $500k and you’re talking serious money.

The key is understanding incentives and behavior. Sellers aren’t fighting the trend. They’re using **resistance as an entry**, **POC as a target**, and **funding as extra profit**, all aligned with the market structure. Most traders miss this because they’re blindly following rules or only thinking about the trend.

Your strategy is your framework. Your edge is your thinking. Look at zones, incentives, momentum, and behavior. Use your framework, don’t follow it blindly. That’s the difference between giving back months of profits and trading consistently.",1,1771661916.0,Futuresmove,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve been both surprised and confused by the coffee pricing at most popular cafes in Bangalore. My brain is honestly not able to comprehend paying ₹240–₹300 for a single shot of espresso. If you opt for a milk-based drink, it easily crosses ₹300. Pair that with a sandwich or a croissant, and before you realise it, the bill has touched ₹1000.

How does this even make sense?

I’ve traveled to countries that import 100% of their coffee and found prices that are half of what we’re paying here in a coffee-growing state. We can’t just ""pass the buck"" by saying we are paying for the infrastructure, the staff, or the aesthetics. No. It should be possible to have a good coffee without it feeling like a luxury investment. I brew coffee at home and I get some of the best beans for like *\~500/- for 250 grams*, which confuses me even more*.*

At this point, my raw feeling is that we aren't paying for coffee anymore, it’s a **Coffee + Instagram Tax.** These prices are almost exclusively found in the places that are constantly ""viral"" on reels and social media.

To get around this insane pricing, I’ve been looking for the ""silent"" cafes, those which don't make it to our social media feed. To my surprise, there are quite a few quintessential spots in every area (HSR, Indiranagar, Koramangala) that have incredible brews and fair pricing. I’m talking about high-quality black beverages for under ₹200.

Before people jump in with assumptions about my finances, this isn't about affordability it is just **the skewed unit economics**.

I am very intrigued to see what the future beholds, like are we looking at days where in few years espresso/americano touches 400/-.",3,1771661896.0,bangalore,0,1.0,False

when I woke up it was exactly 12pm, ive always found it cool when I wake up at an exact number on my own, but i couldn't move. here we go again. I'm in some sleep paralysis episode. that's ok that's cool ive been here done that. just need to go back to sleep and I'll be fine again. 

so I wake up and I can move again I call my mom but i realised that's not my phone.

I wake up again, my fan's speed is much faster than it is (context something wrong w my fan it needs to be repaired it's gotten slower) I could feel the air of my now repaired fan and realised I'm still asleep.

finally I wake up fr fr and i pet my lil doggy stuff toy that my boyfriend won for me at the arcade I felt better feeling it cus I knew I was actually up this time but the fur on that dog was longer than it should be and the time was still 12pm, I'm not up yet.

i woke up, called my mom, my brother picked up and said he has her phone and she's busy, she'll come to my room in a bit. everything felt fine but it didn't feel like my reality yet and i was right because I woke up AGAIN. 

This time I had to be sure I was up so i pinched my finger and i could feel it FINALLY I'm up i can feel pain i can feel the things around me yay, so i thought okay let's take a second let's breathe and immediately something didn't feel right again i can't tell you what exactly but it just didn't feel home. it felt real but not my home. 

i wake up AGAIN hoping this is my last time, check my phone like one does and see a message from my boss apologising for reaching out to me on a Saturday but she found some really fun inspo I could use and i thought to myself hey that's so funny cus I also had a fun idea for work last night. i look at the time and it's 12pm. 

i hate 12pm. 

i woke up yet again, reach for my phone and call my mom. she walks into my room and asks me what's wrong and I told her I've been trying to call her forever now, she said ""this is the first time you've called me"" so I look at the time and it's finally 12:10pm. but I had to be sure because I still couldn't move i still felt paralyzed. she helped me up and i immediately start crying because I could tell if I'm up yet and i had told her what's happening the best I could through my tears and kept asking ""is this real? am I really here? is this real?"" and it was. she gave me a hug wiped my tears and made me the strongest cup of black coffee.

**14 November 2044 — 06:08:31 UTC**

Senior Colonel Huang Jianwei had been awake for thirty-one hours because the mathematics didn’t wait for sleep cycles.

The Tianlong was running cold. Reactor at eleven percent — enough to keep the crew alive and the sensors minimally operational, not enough to generate detectable thermal emission at the distances involved. The vessel coasted in Mercury’s shadow, 3,800 kilometers above the surface, matching the planet’s orbital velocity precisely. 

To an observer approaching from the sunward side of Mercury, looking toward the planet against the overwhelming thermal noise of the solar disk at 0.39 AU, the Tianlong was invisible. To a passive IR sensor sweeping the anti-sunward hemisphere, looking away from the glare toward cold space, the Tianlong was also invisible, because it was not there.

It was a simple trick. You hid something in front of the Sun and people forgot to look.

“Firing solution,” Huang said.

Engineering Officer Tan Wei adjusted his display without looking up. He had been at that console for six hours. The lines around his eyes had deepened. “Nominal. European approach vector has not changed in forty-one minutes. At their current deceleration rate, predicted position at T-plus-seven-minutes is within our tolerance threshold.”

“Confidence?”

“Ninety-two percent. Their deceleration is consistent to within one hundredth of a G. They’re following the announced approach profile.”

Huang nodded once. He trusted that number. 

Professional spacers announced their approach profiles and followed them because the alternative was creating ambiguity that led to dead spacers. The French were professionals. They were following their profile.

T-plus-seven-minutes was the solution time. He would fire now. The slugs would take seven minutes and twenty seconds to reach the predicted French position. The French were decelerating, closing Mercury at a calculated rate. The targeting solution projected their position at T-plus-seven-twenty: 48,800 kilometers from Mercury center, approach vector 042, at the speed their profile indicated. Two railgun slugs at 45,000 meters per second, 12 kilograms of tungsten apiece. The kinetic energy at impact would exceed 12 gigajoules.

That was enough to end Vauban.

“Jianwei.” His executive officer, Major Chen Hao, spoke from the adjacent console. “The Menglong has confirmed firing solution parity. They’re ready.”

Four slugs total. Two ships, two shots each. The probability of at least one impact against a non-maneuvering target was calculated at 78 percent.

He was aware of what he was doing. The Hellas Draft Accords were unsigned. The Chinese Deep System Authority’s presence at Mercury was legal under the existing framework, which contained no prohibition on armed vessels within the inner system. The French were approaching under inspection authority granted by draft language that had not yet achieved ratification. Huang had received clear orders from Beijing: the Caloris extraction facility represented an investment of 340 billion yuan over eighteen months of operation. It would not be inspected. It would not be disclosed.

He picked up his coffee and drank it while it was still warm.

“Fire.”

The railgun capacitors discharged at 06:08:54 UTC. The slugs left the Tianlong at 45,087 meters per second relative to the vessel, which was itself moving at 47,400 meters per second on its Mercury orbit. The combined vector placed them on a course toward the predicted French position in seven minutes and twenty-two seconds. The muzzle flash was a pulse of radar-frequency emission lasting 0.003 seconds — the kind of transient that would appear as instrument noise on a sensor array not specifically calibrated for it. The recoil shifted Tianlong’s velocity by 1.1 centimeters per second.

The Menglong fired nine seconds later.

Huang set down his cup. “Drive at thirty percent. Begin turn to firing position for secondary engagement.”

The Tianlong’s drive ignited.

The thermal signature, bloom-bright in the IR band, began propagating outward at 299,792 kilometers per second.

It would reach Vauban in 0.50 seconds.",1,1771661492.0,MaritaUniverse,0,1.0,False

*February 6, 2026*

Yesterday after I picked my son up from school my neighbor flagged me down in the driveway to ask me if she could use my laundry machine because hers was broken. I said sure, because she's my neighbor. While she was in her house gathering her laundry I made grilled cheeses for myself and my son. When she came over I showed her where the machine was. After loading the machine she came into the kitchen.

My neighbor asked if she could have a grilled cheese. I might just be a dick, but I thought that was a ridiculous thing to ask. I told her I only made two. She asked why I did that since I knew she was coming over??? Because she was coming over for laundry, not grilled cheese...

My son offered her half of his. I always put an egg in my grilled cheese sandwiches. She bit into it and was grossed out by the egg (which she should have seen before she bit into it). She then asked where my trash can was. My son said ""don't waste food!"" So she just HANDED THE SANDWICH BACK TO HIM. I told him to switch halves with me and then binned the sandwich half when he wasn't looking.

She asked to use my bathroom, which I of course agreed to. She came back to the kitchen after and asked if I had any refreshments. I said no and suggested that she wait for her clothes to finish at home. She asked if I was trying to get rid of her. I said we needed to get started on homework. She said she didn't mind. I said we needed to keep distraction to a minimum.

She said ""well, I know when I'm not wanted,"" and left. When she came back to switch her clothes to the drier, she was very irritated. I apologized for hurting her feelings. She said it didn't matter, but she sounded angry. Then she left. I feel bad, but I also feel annoyed, because who acts like that?

___

She's married. And she's at least ten years older than me.

Like she wants to be my friend or like she wants to get with me? Because she's too old and too married for me. If you meant the friend thing, maybe. But what a weird way to make friends.

>#`How OOP makes their grilled cheese:`

Cook the egg at the same time you brown the toast. When you flip the toast and put a piece of cheese on put the egg on top and then a second piece of cheese. Place one of the pieces of toast on top, browned side down. Let the melted cheese seal in the egg and flip. Best way to eat a grilled cheese.

The cheese seals it in until you take a bite. The yolk mixed with the melted cheese is perfection.

*February 8, 2026, 2 days later*

I have a tiny update about my weird neighbor with the broken washing machine. She came back! I know 90% of you said to never let her back in the house, so you are probably going to judge me heavily. In my defense I was a little flustered by the whole thing.

She waved me down again when we were walking up to the house. She said to wait because she had something for me. I waited because... I guess because I'm stupid? I figured she would just knock on the door anyway if I didn't.

She came back with a pie that she said was thanks for using my washing machine. I said thank you and she didn't have to. She said ""let's go inside and try a piece."" I said it was almost my son's naptime. She said ""great! We can eat pie while he naps!""

A lot of you said she might have been interested in me, and that was still in my head. So I said ""yeah, and you should invite your husband over too."" I was expecting that to deter her. Nope!

She got very excited! She said ""that's a great idea! Here, you take the pie in and I'll go get him."" So at that point I'm internally thinking ""what the fu...."" My son and I went inside. I started cutting pieces of pie because at this point I felt like a victim of fate.

She came over with her husband. I have never seen a man that looked as exasperated and embarrassed as this guy. We ate pie, and the whole time she asked me weird questions while her husband looked annoyed. Every once in a while I would say something and she would give her husband a look. He kept pretending not to see the looks.

After we finished the pie, she asked if I had coffee. Her husband said ""Honey, he wants to put his son down for a nap. Let's go home.""

She said ""oh he doesn't mind.""

Her husband said ""he minds"" while he took her elbow and started leading her out the door. She kept insisting that I didn't until they were outside. I gotta say, I think I'm in love with this guy.

As weird and annoying as the whole thing was, I feel a lot better about my neighbor now. Some of the comments had some pretty crazy speculation that made me a little nervous. Now that I've met her husband I'm pretty sure she's just bored. Which is fine. It's annoying, but not creepy.

So to all the people who were worried she was trying to seduce me or spy on me or steal from me, don't worry. Based on her husband's reactions she's just... like this.

I'm divorced. I have a kid. She seemed really zeroed in on that topic. I think divorce is actually pretty common, but maybe not in her social circle. My son and I are in a minority group. Not a super interesting one or anything though.

___

Kind of weird. I'm younger than her and a different gender. I don't really see us being coffee buddies.

___

She has kids.

___

I think this is it. I'm pretty sure her kids are teenagers. So maybe now that her kids are at the ""leave me alone"" age she wants a project. Based on her behavior and a lot of the comments I feel this is most likely.

___

This is going to sound so bad, but... The pie wasn't that good. Way too much sugar.

It wasn't that great. To answer the question below, it was an apple pie. It was canned filling and had way too much sugar. It wasn't the worst pie ever, but she didn't even do a lattice crust. That's like the whole point of making a pie.

Mostly stuff about my divorce. I'm not salty about my divorce, so it didn't hurt my feelings, but she didn't know that, so I thought it was rude/weird. She wanted to know how long ago I got divorced, where we used to live, why I moved, why I have primary custody, what school my kid used to go to, what my ex-wife does for work, how she feels about not being the primary parent, nosy stuff. She also asked why we got divorced, which I didn't have to answer because her husband actually cut her off on that one. He said ""that's a private matter,"" and she dropped it.

*February 19, 2026, 13 days later*

I have a weird neighbor with boundary issues. She invited herself into my house twice, and after that I tried to be more assertive in telling her she can't come over. I thought I was doing well, but I had only seen a small slice of what she was capable of.

My ex-wife called me an hour ago to rip me a new exit orifice. My neighbor found her on Facebook and messaged her to ask if she was my ex-wife. She said she was. My neighbor asked her if she knew where I was currently living. She said she did. My neighbor then asked her why our son didn't live with her, his mother. My ex blocked her and then called me to yell at me.

I am furious. I want to yell at my neighbor, but I don't want to be stupid. I apologized to my ex-wife, but she is still pissed. How can anyone be so entitled as to think they have the right to interfere in a complete stranger's life like this?

She's just my neighbor! We aren't even friends. This is beyond the pale.

># Comments by OOP:

I told her my last name. She told me hers, and at the time I didn't think it was weird. She also asked me a lot of questions about my ex, and I very stupidly answered them because I am a big dumb dummy.

My neighbor wouldn't even know my ex-wife existed if I hadn't very stupidly answered all her invasive questions.

I thought I was an idiot. To me it's normal to tell your neighbors things about yourself. I never anticipated this.

 I'm nervous about making an enemy though. We just moved here. I need to be smart about this. I'm wondering if I should talk to her husband about it.

___

I thought she was just bored and nosey, but this is a whole different kettle of fish.

___

Do you think I can get a restraining order just because of an unsolicited Facebook message? I am ordering cameras now. Is ring still good? I know a lot of people have stopped using it. What's a good alternative?

___

My ex sent me screenshots. I have the messages.

___

Reading over the messages she sent my wife, that is the impression I get, that she thought my ex was unaware that my son and I live here. I know there were a couple of stories in the news not too long ago about a woman who was kidnapped by a parent and found forty years later or something. Maybe she had that in the back of her mind and her imagination ran away with her.

I really don't think that excuses her behavior, but I do hope that is what her problem is, because the alternatives are all so much creepier.

___

The husband is cool. I think a conversation with him is likely to be productive.


___

I didn't have time this morning, but I'll knock on his door when I get home from work. I hope she doesn't answer. If she does I'll tell her she crossed the line, but it will be so awkward.

___

I talked to him. I waited for his car to pull into the driveway (creepy, I know, but turnabout is fair play) and walked over to talk to him. I showed him the screenshots my ex sent me.

*February 20, 2026, 13 days after the first posting and 1 day after the last*

I talked to her husband, and he said he would talk to her. I don't doubt that he did, but whatever he said didn't get through. My son and I were eating breakfast when I heard a knock on the door. I thought there was absolutely no way it could be her, but it was. I looked through the peephole, and she was standing there with a baking tray.

I just went back into the kitchen. I ignored her. My son wanted to know why I wasn't answering the door, and I said sometimes we're already doing something important and so don't have time for other people if it isn't an emergency. I said breakfast with him was important, and it wasn't an emergency, so I wasn't going to answer.

She kept knocking for what felt like an age. Her husband must have come out at one point, because I heard him calling her name. She said ""I know he's in there. His car is here."" Just incorrigible, this woman.

I ignored her. I think her husband actually came and pulled her off the porch. That's what it sounded like to me, but I didn't look. Bugs Bunny is less Loony Toons than she is.

># Comment by OOP:

I am of a mind at the moment to not speak to her directly again. I think any level of attention might add fuel to the flame. She is obviously bored and fixated, and any engagement will alleviate some of the boredom and encourage the behavior.

Between rent, staffing, supplies, and rising customer expectations, margins can feel thin. That’s why more café owners in 2026 are investing in smart POS systems. Not just to process payments, but to increase efficiency and boost profits in ways that truly matter.

A smart POS system acts like the control center of your café. It connects orders, payments, inventory, and reporting into one streamlined workflow. When everything works together smoothly, your team spends less time fixing mistakes and more time serving customers.

# 1. Faster Operations, Less Stress

Speed is everything during peak hours. A smart POS system allows staff to take orders quickly using customizable menus and intuitive touchscreens. Features like quick modifiers for milk types, syrups, and extras reduce input time and errors.

When orders move instantly from the counter to preparation, communication improves. That means fewer mistakes, faster service, and shorter queues. In a city like London, where customers value convenience, that efficiency makes a real difference.

# 2. Better Data, Smarter Decisions

One of the biggest advantages of a smart POS system is real-time reporting. Instead of guessing which drinks are popular or when you’re busiest, you get clear data.

You can easily track:

* Daily and weekly revenue
* Best-selling menu items
* Slow-moving products
* Peak trading hours

With this information, you can adjust pricing, introduce promotions, and optimize staff schedules. Small data-driven changes often lead to noticeable profit growth.

# 3. Real-Time Inventory Control

Waste eats into profits quietly. A smart POS system automatically updates inventory as items are sold. You’ll know when ingredients are running low and can plan orders more accurately.

This prevents stock shortages during busy periods and reduces over-ordering. The result? Better cost control and fewer unpleasant surprises.

# 4. Flexible Payments Improve Customer Experience

Modern customers expect contactless payments and mobile wallets. A reliable system processes transactions quickly and securely, minimizing checkout delays. A smooth payment experience leaves a positive final impression — and that matters.

**best restaurant point of sale system** solutions go beyond simple transactions. They connect front-of-house and back-of-house operations, provide meaningful insights, and reduce operational bottlenecks. When your technology supports your workflow instead of slowing it down, efficiency naturally increases.

In London’s competitive café scene, efficiency equals profitability. A smart POS system doesn’t just organize your business — it strengthens it. By improving speed, accuracy, and visibility, you create a foundation for sustainable growth and stronger profits in 2026 and beyond.",1,1771661304.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

Dear {Agent}

What if your bully traveled back in time to win your heart?

At thirteen years old, Francis Kurt Coleman III moves to Orlando and meets two women: one who will define his life and another who will cause him pain and misery. His only problem is, he doesn't realize which is which. Jenna Carvel is the beautiful neighbor and his bully, who, through their years of school together, makes it her mission to ostracize him. Erica Strauss is the enigmatic coed and his first love, who introduces him to triathlons and his found family, where he finds refuge from Jenna's cruelty.

After years of yearning, just before his senior year, Kurt spends a glorious month as Erica's lover, and then she leaves him for a career in Boston. Simultaneously, Jenna wastes her life and mother's goodwill to the point that the only present her mother gives Jenna for her eighteenth birthday is two words: Get out.

Years later, Kurt and Jenna meet again. He's a soulless mogul, crushed by a failed marriage with Erica. Jenna is dying from Hepatitis C after suffering from every sort of abuse. As her life ends, it's only the boy she used to torment who cares for her and gives her time to heal. She swears that if she could go back, she would do it all differently.

And then, she wakes up in 1997, her senior year of high school. Every bridge around her is in flames, but they still haven't collapsed. Before they do, she must rewrite her fate, redeem herself with her mother, and stop Kurt from chasing after Erica. But it's so hard when trauma triggers lie around every turn, and the only person who made her feel human hates her with every fiber of his being.

*Crushed* is a dual PoV, upmarket contemporary novel. A complete standalone at 83,000 words, it has series potential and will appeal to readers drawn to character-driven, psychologically layered fiction such as *This Time Tomorrow* by Emma Straub, Toshikazu Kawaguchi's *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* series, and fans of Nick Hornby's style of culture as a character.

**DD blueprint**

1. Caffeine (tea and coffee)
2. Songs (i face earworms ) and Movies
3. Reels and Shorts (i never used insta but i used to watch yt shorts...)
4. Quora (sometimes vulgar content u know and violent content u know )
5. P#rn and M#asturbation
6. Movies

**what helped me in this journey so far :**

1. **leaving tea and coffee completely** : First, it helped me in calming my nervous system so I can rest better, sleep better, and nap better. Secondly, I have a little bit of constipation, so it helped me in constipation also.
2. **leaving songs, reels / shorts**: I experience earworms, where songs I listen to keep repeating in my mind. I stopped listening to music for a while, and it helped me sleep better and think more clearly. The earworms were contributing to my brain fog, and by reducing them, I was able to significantly lessen that brain fog.
3. **leaving movies** : I used to fantasize about it after watching it, and instead of resting it, it makes me fantasize more and increase my brain focus, so I think it is better to reduce it.
4. **leaving quora** : Just a lot of vulgar content

**and my routine is like :**

I wake up at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning and do all the rest of the stuff, and at night I follow the 11:00-6:00 routine, like I close all the devices till 10:30 and sleep till 11 p.m. last. Actually, I am a college student so I I have no time to make a schedule between this time.

 **where I get stimulation from. ?**

* I get my stimulation from various podcasts and lectures, and I read a lot on different topics like narcissism and astrology and different topics.
* In addition to that, I didn't put any limitations on my food; I do eat fast food 😋😋 except caffeine. I didn't put limitations on various kinds of food and love eating different kinds of food, especially sweet things. even before the dopamine detox !!
* I socialize more than before, and I know if I lowered the dopamine to an extreme, then it will cause motivation issues, work issues, and sleeping issues, because I have done dopamine detox after reading some famous books on dopamine.

**And talking about the benefits i got :**

1. Better energy whole day
2. clear mind and weird type of sense of satisfaction and happiness in the mind
3. feeling a bit lonely after 1.5 week mark is done may be still withdrawls are going on
4. My nervous system is now calm down, so I can have better rest, better sleeps, better naps.
5. I can think better, in terms of calculation-wise, and now I am present in the moment while talking.

**Final conclusion :**

not going to follow these whole my life, except the songs and caffeine part, but will do it every few months, like every three months, 15 days of Dopamine Detox or something like that. That will reboot my system and recharge my body.",0,1771660756.0,simpleliving,1,0.5,False

1ralbyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1ralbyh/limerence_or_love/,Limerence or love?,"Hi everyone. I’m hoping this reaches a fairly large, sensible and overall, patient and understanding audience. Back in Oct 2019, I was 13 and had the privilege of experiencing my first love, and the love I fear I’ll always be deep down chasing for the rest of my life. To this day, he is one of the most amazing men I have ever had the experience of meeting, and I sometimes fear the best. I don’t think I haven’t got over the idea of him because he was my first, but because he was the best. 

We dated until Oct 2020, and ended things shortly after our 1 year anniversary. At 21 years old, my singular biggest regret in life is still ever going to that boy and saying I wanted to separate. There was no big blow up fight, and in fact, what led me to decide that was his lack of putting effort into messaging me while at a tournament for a sport that he turned out to be extremely successful in for years after, and to this day. (In hindsight) due to being an extremely emotional teenage girl and my inability to self regulate my emotions at the time, I made a spur of the moment decision over text, insinuating that I thought we’d be better off not in the relationship, which was some messed up attempt to make him “show me how much he wanted/loved me.” I believe it’s also imperative to mention at this point that I was raised by an alcoholic mother, with severe NPD and BPD, and a father that was just as fearful of her and thus, enabled her treatment towards her children. She not only ruined our 1 year anniversary and numerous moments for us, but she made it so painfully difficult for us to just be in love, together, without the difficulty that is being young, in love and having one person be mentally crushed by an unfortunate reality that she (I) always had to go home to. This shaped the girl I was, as I found myself treating my first love similar to how my own mother treated/spoke to me, my father and my siblings. I didn’t understand it at the time and felt as though I had this natural nasty inside of me, but this was before years of therapy and acquiring the tools I needed in order to mature, process and understand the abuse, and become a better person all in all. As well, cutting off most contact and association with said mother due to how extremely toxic and poisonous she is in my life, and others lives.

When I reached out in days after, letting him know I’d thought I’d made a mistake and as any stable minded person would do, he reflected on the relationship, where he was at in life and where he wanted to be one day. To no surprise, after numerous attempts in following days and weeks to try and get him back, he eventually decided we were better off not being together. Within two months, he was seeing numerous different girls while I tried to somewhat grapple with what seemed like an empty void inside of me that would never be filled. I won’t say much here, other than even after 2 breakups after this one, I still haven’t cried or felt emotional pain like I felt after this relationship. hs after the fact. In a sense, it was the moment my innocence was taken away and I “woke up” to real life. After things ended, we essentially cut off all communication as we were thrown into lockdown shortly after and I was left to my own memories and discovered the nasty addiction that is mental rumination.

While still not over him, I got into a relationship months after with another boy (solely as some teenage girl ploy to try and make him see that I was, indeed, worthy of love) that went on to be an on and off relationship for the next 3 years of my life. While in that relationship, every time we were “off,” my mind and heart immediately wandered back to my first love, and the next day I’d be crawling back to the on and off ex, saying I wanted to make things work— partially because I knew, the first love wouldn’t take me back, but he’d take me back always. From day one, I self sabotaged essentially every part of that relationship. He was an amazing guy, and deserved absolutely nothing that I dished out to him. I hope, by this point most are starting to see the bigger picture.

There was one point where me and said on and off ex were broken up and I reached out to the first love shortly after hearing that him and a girlfriend had broken up months before. We hadn’t been in contact since the breakup 3 ish years prior. Of course, as any teenage girl would in this position (lol, note the sarcasm) I immediately tried to strike up conversation through Snapchat. We chatted briefly and snapchatted meaningless pictures back and forth for a few weeks, until eventually it stopped.

A few months after, at age 19, I met another man. While he was so perfect on paper and yet immensely flawed, for some reason, this relationship reignited all of these unanswered questions and unresolved feelings I had regarding my first relationship. In hindsight, I knew that if things were good enough with this man, it’d end in marriage and I’d never be able to try and see if things could work with my first love, the one I’ve truly wanted to be and grow with all these years. So naturally, self sabotaged every aspect of the relationship to the best of my ability the second I realized I didn’t want to be with him, but knew I didn’t have the balls to leave him. While most of the time, I thought I’d genuinely marry this man, anytime that feeling overcame me, even in our absolute happiest of moments, the only person on my mind was my first love. I would genuinely be over the moon happy, but then be hit with a massive wave of sadness, angst, and regret that would eventually turn outwards as anger towards my ex… because why couldn’t he just be my first love?

After things ended with this ex March 2025, I immediately ran and followed my first love back on socials. To my surprise, he followed back and I think that gave me some sort of false hope, because why after all these years would he care what I’m up to/care to be “connected” in any way if he viewed it simply as a “young relationship that meant nothing”— which is often how I’ve thought he’s felt about things.

This brings me to today. I planned to move to the other side of the world last year (which is currently where I am) and miraculously got a really great job out of town months before this big move. So I knew I wouldn’t be back home for a full year.  A few days before leaving for the job, I reached out and asked if he’d like to get coffee, but no pressure. He reached back out and let me know he was extremely busy with his sport and job at the time, and probably couldn’t make it work. While let down, I was suprised that he continued the conversation going asking where I was going, what’d I’d be doing, etc, as I’d never received a semblance of interest in past years. As a result, I think it gave me an even bigger false hope than when he’d followed me back on socials months prior.

My question now is: Is this love or is this limerence?

After numerous failed relationships as a result of just wanting them to be him and self sabotaging, countless years of hopelessly yearning with no end (6, but who’s counting…) and constant rumination over something that I may have just built up in my head, I’m curious whether there’s any point to reach out to him. This is the longest I’ve been single in years, and I cannot stop thinking about him and how things could maybe, just maybe work for us as a result of how much I’ve changed and developed into a different woman for the better.

If you managed to read this all, and have advice to give, please feel free to be as brutally honest as possible. I will appreciate it. I’ve never told anyone about this or how I’m currently feeling. Not even my family, friends or therapist know how deeply I feel for this man… I fight an internal battle every single day that is wondering if I should reach out to him, or to just simply try and let it go. I wonder what any sane person would possibly say to him if they had the chance to tell him how they’ve felt thru the years and how they currently feel, without completely destroying their self respect. I wonder if I’d call him, or simply text him. I sometimes wonder too if there’s just no point, as I’m on the other side of the world and won’t be home until August…. (But genuinely, if you’ve ever felt a “love” like this before, and haven’t been able to share how you feel with the other person, the distance between you two becomes completely irrelevant.

Let me know what you would do in this situation, how you may go about reaching out if you were to and what’d you say, or how you may go about TRULY getting over things, if you believe that is my best option in this case. This situation feels like it’s eating me alive from the inside out, and I worry if I don’t act soon, he may find someone new that ends up being his life partner, and my chances will be gone for good.

1ralbsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1ralbsh/m4f_madly_in_love_with_rachel_mcadams/,[M4F] Madly In Love With Rachel McAdams,"It had been two weeks since the 20-something year-old moved in with his unlikely best friend, Rachel McAdams. It was certainly one of the more fortunate things to happen in his life, considering how much darkness he grew up around, and he still couldn't believe this unusual stroke of good luck. To him, she was Home; he felt safe anywhere, as long as she was right there beside him.

Rachel had sadly been more of a mom to the young man than his actual mother, and as his personal stress began to pile up every now and again, he found himself needing her more and more; needing her hugs, needing her touch, needing her advice, and needing her love. 

As the weeks went by, this instinctual urge to profess his love to her grew. God, she was absolutely gorgeous; her warm, inquisitive green eyes, luscious brown hair, the way she carried herself with such grace....Ms. McAdams was easily the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen in his life. And he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, blurred lines be damned.

Later that night, in that shy, soft voice she'd grown so accustomed to, he asked a simple question with the utmost anxiety coursing through him: ""Can we....take things to the next level?""

---------------------

Whether you know her from Mean Girls, The Notebook, True Detective S2, Game Night, and/or Send Help most recently just to name a few, something about Rachel McAdams just stays with you. Her warm aura, playful greenish hazel eyes, her flattering figure....I'm almost never able to get a roleplay story with her up off the ground somehow.

That's where you fine people would come in. I'm open to most ideas, but right now I have something very wholesome and emotional in mind, and would prefer for this to be more of a faceclaim scenario. The main basis for the story I have in mind essentially entails her 40-something self falling in love with a much younger man around 19-22.

They could've met as neighbors, dormmates, through a mutual friend, or a chance encounter at a grocery store or coffee shop. And I would very much enjoy toeing the line between ""mother figure"" and ""lover"", with plenty of slice of life moments in there to make everything feel realistic, sweet, and most importantly, earned! And the fact that Rachel apparently loves to cuddle IRL just fills me with an indescribable amount of inspiration.

I would also like to explore an ""Opposites Attract"" angle with the two of them, with him being the less fortunate of the two, if that's something that speaks to you at all.

This is also predominantly MD/lb-focused, if that affects your preference in any way.

1ral8wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ral8wk/limerence_or_love_first_love/,Limerence or Love? First Love,"Hi everyone. I’m hoping this reaches a fairly large, sensible and overall, patient and understanding audience. Back in Oct 2019, I was 13 and had the privilege of experiencing my first love, and the love I fear I’ll always be deep down chasing for the rest of my life. To this day, he is one of the most amazing men I have ever had the experience of meeting, and I sometimes fear the best.

We dated until Oct 2020, and ended things shortly after our 1 year anniversary. At 21 years old, my singular biggest regret in life is still ever going to that boy and saying I wanted to separate. There was no big blow up fight, and in fact, what led me to decide that was his lack of putting effort into messaging me while at a tournament for a sport that he turned out to be extremely successful in for years after, and to this day. (In hindsight) due to being an extremely emotional teenage girl and my inability to self regulate my emotions at the time, I made a spur of the moment decision over text, insinuating that I thought we’d be better off not in the relationship, which was some messed up attempt to make him “show me how much he wanted/loved me.” I believe it’s also imperative to mention at this point that I was raised by an alcoholic mother, with severe NPD and BPD, and a father that was just as fearful of her and thus, enabled her treatment towards her children. She not only ruined our 1 year anniversary and numerous moments for us, but she made it so painfully difficult for us to just be in love, together, without the difficulty that is being young, in love and having one person be mentally crushed by an unfortunate reality that she (I) always had to go home to. This shaped the girl I was, as I found myself treating my first love similar to how my own mother treated/spoke to me, my father and my siblings. I didn’t understand it at the time and felt as though I had this natural nasty inside of me, but this was before years of therapy and acquiring the tools I needed in order to mature, process and understand the abuse, and become a better person all in all. As well, cutting off most contact and association with said mother due to how extremely toxic and poisonous she is in my life, and others lives.

When I reached out in days after, letting him know I’d thought I’d made a mistake and as any stable minded person would do, he reflected on the relationship, where he was at in life and where he wanted to be one day. To no surprise, after numerous attempts in following days and weeks to try and get him back, he eventually decided we were better off not being together. Within two months, he was seeing numerous different girls while I tried to somewhat grapple with what seemed like an empty void inside of me that would never be filled. I won’t say much here, other than even after 2 breakups after this one, I still haven’t cried or felt emotional pain like I felt after this relationship. hs after the fact. In a sense, it was the moment my innocence was taken away and I “woke up” to real life. After things ended, we essentially cut off all communication as we were thrown into lockdown shortly after and I was left to my own memories and discovered the nasty addiction that is mental rumination.

While still not over him, I got into a relationship months after with another boy (solely as some teenage girl ploy to try and make him see that I was, indeed, worthy of love) that went on to be an on and off relationship for the next 3 years of my life. While in that relationship, every time we were “off,” my mind and heart immediately wandered back to my first love, and the next day I’d be crawling back to the on and off ex, saying I wanted to make things work— partially because I knew, the first love wouldn’t take me back, but he’d take me back always. From day one, I self sabotaged essentially every part of that relationship. He was an amazing guy, and deserved absolutely nothing that I dished out to him. I hope, by this point most are starting to see the bigger picture.

There was one point where me and said on and off ex were broken up and I reached out to the first love shortly after hearing that him and a girlfriend had broken up months before. We hadn’t been in contact since the breakup 3 ish years prior. Of course, as any teenage girl would in this position (lol, note the sarcasm) I immediately tried to strike up conversation through Snapchat. We chatted briefly and snapchatted meaningless pictures back and forth for a few weeks, until eventually it stopped.

A few months after, at age 19, I met another man. While he was so perfect on paper and yet immensely flawed, for some reason, this relationship reignited all of these unanswered questions and unresolved feelings I had regarding my first relationship. In hindsight, I knew that if things were good enough with this man, it’d end in marriage and I’d never be able to try and see if things could work with my first love, the one I’ve truly wanted to be and grow with all these years. So naturally, self sabotaged every aspect of the relationship to the best of my ability the second I realized I didn’t want to be with him, but knew I didn’t have the balls to leave him. While most of the time, I thought I’d genuinely marry this man, anytime that feeling overcame me, even in our absolute happiest of moments, the only person on my mind was my first love. I would genuinely be over the moon happy, but then be hit with a massive wave of sadness, angst, and regret that would eventually turn outwards as anger towards my ex… because why couldn’t he just be my first love?

After things ended with this ex March 2025, I immediately ran and followed my first love back on socials. To my surprise, he followed back and I think that gave me some sort of false hope, because why after all these years would he care what I’m up to/care to be “connected” in any way if he viewed it simply as a “young relationship that meant nothing”— which is often how I’ve thought he’s felt about things.

This brings me to today. I planned to move to the other side of the world last year (which is currently where I am) and miraculously got a really great job out of town months before this big move. So I knew I wouldn’t be back home for a full year.  A few days before leaving for the job, I reached out and asked if he’d like to get coffee, but no pressure. He reached back out and let me know he was extremely busy with his sport and job at the time, and probably couldn’t make it work. While let down, I was suprised that he continued the conversation going asking where I was going, what’d I’d be doing, etc, as I’d never received a semblance of interest in past years. As a result, I think it gave me an even bigger false hope than when he’d followed me back on socials months prior.

My question now is: Is this love or is this limerence?

After numerous failed relationships as a result of just wanting them to be him and self sabotaging, countless years of hopelessly yearning with no end (6, but who’s counting…) and constant rumination over something that I may have just built up in my head, I’m curious whether there’s any point to reach out to him. This is the longest I’ve been single in years, and I cannot stop thinking about him and how things could maybe, just maybe work for us as a result of how much I’ve changed and developed into a different woman for the better.

If you managed to read this all, and have advice to give, please feel free to be as brutally honest as possible. I will appreciate it. I’ve never told anyone about this or how I’m currently feeling. Not even my family, friends or therapist know how deeply I feel for this man… I fight an internal battle every single day that is wondering if I should reach out to him, or to just simply try and let it go. I wonder what any sane person would possibly say to him if they had the chance to tell him how they’ve felt thru the years and how they currently feel, without completely destroying their self respect. I wonder if I’d call him, or simply text him. I sometimes wonder too if there’s just no point, as I’m on the other side of the world and won’t be home until August…. (But genuinely, if you’ve ever felt a “love” like this before, and haven’t been able to share how you feel with the other person, the distance between you two becomes completely irrelevant.

Let me know what you would do in this situation, how you may go about reaching out if you were to and what’d you say, or how you may go about TRULY getting over things, if you believe that is my best option in this case. This situation feels like it’s eating me alive from the inside out, and I worry if I don’t act soon, he may find someone new that ends up being his life partner, and my chances will be gone for good.

He is the definition of annoying brother. I don't mean that in a petty way like ""he's hogging the bathroom"" or something. I mean he refuses to listen to what any person tells him unless he's threatened with getting stuff taken. 

One example I'll give is cooking/baking. He says he's a really good cook and baker, and that he can make so many more foods than me. Yes I will admit I am not interested in cooking like he is so I don't know a ton of recipes, but I can actually follow a recipe on paper. He CANNOT.

 What he'll do is first he refuses to gather the ingredients before making something, so he knows we have the things. He'll just grab things as he goes until he realizes we don't have an important part and then just throws it away and wastes so much food. Also when he follows a recipe he uses the first instructions he gets on AI overview on Google. He doesn't go to websites or anything, and now Im slightly worried we may be at risk of E-Coli.

 He was making a recipe for cookie dough that you can just eat and flour was in the recipe. He tried heat treating it in the microwave but he didn't do it for long enough (he did it only for like 30 seconds and didn't check the temp) and so I am scared it's not safe. Also he wasted the rest of our butter making it because he realized we didn't have enough like usual while just dumping ingredients in a bowl. 

 This is just one example. He refuses to do any house work even when it's just sweeping the kitchen or filling the egg container. I'll make him eggs and some other stuff for food but when I ask him to get me a cup of water or maybe just make me a cup of coffee while I'm busy, he gets offended and refuses. 

 I have a feeling he's becoming this way because of his friends and how toxic apps like tiktok and YouTube are. He never used to be so mean and disrespectful. I also understand he's in the puberty age, but it feels like he's just becoming a whole new bad person. 

I am not trying to be just the nagging older sister, but my parents aren't doing anything, and I'm genuinely concerned for how he's growing up. I just want tips on how I can try to help and maybe have a heart to heart with him that he can take seriously. Does anyone have any tips to help?

1ral63w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nutrition1/comments/1ral63w/natural_sleep_aids_reallife_ways_to_fall_asleep/,Natural Sleep Aids Real-Life Ways to Fall Asleep Easier Without Feeling Groggy,"If you’ve ever stared at the ceiling at 2:00 a.m. while your brain replays every awkward thing you’ve ever said, you already know sleep isn’t something you can “force.” The harder you try, the more awake you feel. That’s why natural sleep aids are so appealing—they’re usually gentler, and they support what your body already wants to do: wind down.

The good news is that better sleep often comes from a few small changes that work together, not one magic trick. Natural sleep support can include herbs, nutrients, habits, and simple environment tweaks. Here’s a human, realistic look at what helps—and what’s worth skipping.

**What “Natural Sleep Aid” Really Means**

A natural sleep aid isn’t necessarily a sedative that knocks you out. Most natural options work by calming the nervous system, easing stress, or helping your body follow its natural sleep-wake rhythm ([your circadian rhythm](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/circadian-rhythm)). Think of it more like turning down the volume rather than hitting an off switch.

Also, “natural” doesn’t always mean “safe for everyone.” Herbs and supplements can interact with medications or be a bad fit for certain health conditions. If you’re pregnant, nursing, taking prescriptions, or managing a medical issue, it’s smart to check with a healthcare professional before adding anything new.

**Start With the Easiest Wins: Your Sleep Environment**

Before you buy anything, look at your bedroom like it’s a sleep cave. Small changes here can make a surprising difference.

* **Make it darker.** Blackout curtains or a sleep mask can help your brain get the “it’s night” signal.
* **Keep it cool.** Many people sleep best in a slightly cooler room. If you wake up sweaty, a fan or lighter bedding can help.
* **Reduce noise.** White noise, a fan, or earplugs can be a game-changer if you’re a light sleeper.
* **Remove the mini-sun.** Phone screens are bright and stimulating. If you can’t avoid screens at night, use night mode and lower brightness—but honestly, less screen time is better.

These changes cost little and support sleep every night, not just when you remember to take something.

**Natural Supplements People Actually Use**

If your basics are in place and you still struggle, some supplements may help. The key is choosing the right one for your situation.

**Magnesium (especially glycinate)**

Magnesium is popular for a reason. It plays a role in muscle relaxation and nervous system support, and [magnesium glycinate](https://ijmscrr.in/index.php/ijmscrr/article/view/1312) is often chosen for evening use because it’s generally gentle and calming. People who feel “wired but tired” at night often like magnesium as a starting point.

**Melatonin (low dose is usually better)**

Melatonin is a hormone your body naturally produces to signal sleepiness. It can be helpful for shifting your sleep schedule—like jet lag, travel, or a temporary bedtime reset. It’s not always ideal as a nightly long-term fix, and more isn’t always better. Many people do fine with a low dose.

**L-Theanine**

Found naturally in green tea, L-theanine supports relaxation without being heavily sedating. It’s often used when stress and mental chatter are the problem. If your body is tired but your thoughts won’t stop, this one is commonly recommended.

**Glycine**

[Glycine is an amino acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049525001994) that may help support deeper sleep and a calmer bedtime routine. Some people take it because it doesn’t feel “heavy,” but still helps the body settle.

**Herbal options: chamomile, valerian, lavender, lemon balm**

Herbs can be helpful, especially when taken as tea or tinctures as part of a calming routine.

* **Chamomile** is gentle and familiar—great for light sleep support.
* **Valerian root** is stronger and can work well for some, but others dislike the smell or feel groggy.
* **Lavender** is popular as an ароматерапия (essential oil) or tea, mostly for relaxation.
* **Lemon balm** is often used for stress and mild anxiety at night.

If you’re trying herbs, start with one at a time so you actually know what’s helping.

**The Most Underrated Natural Sleep Aid: A Wind-Down Routine**

Your brain loves patterns. If you do the same calming steps every night, your body starts to recognize the cues.

A simple wind-down routine might look like:

* 10 minutes of light stretching or slow yoga
* A warm shower or bath
* Herbal tea
* Reading a few pages of a book (paper is best)
* Dim lights and no intense conversations

It doesn’t have to be perfect. The goal is to send the message: “We’re done for the day.”

**Food and Timing Matter More Than You Think**

Sleep can get worse if your body is either too hungry or too full. A heavy meal right before bed can cause discomfort, but going to sleep starving can also wake you up.

A light snack can help some people, especially if it includes a little protein and carbs—think yogurt, a banana with peanut butter, or a small bowl of oatmeal. Also watch caffeine sneaking in later than you think. Some people are sensitive enough that afternoon coffee affects nighttime sleep.

**When Natural Sleep Aids Aren’t Enough**

If you’re dealing with insomnia for weeks, waking up gasping/snoring loudly, restless legs, or anxiety that feels out of control, it’s worth talking to a professional. Sometimes sleep issues are caused by things like sleep apnea, hormone changes, medication side effects, or chronic stress. Getting to the root is the real long-term solution.

**Final Thoughts**

A [natural sleep aid](https://outworknutrition.com/products/sleep) can be a supplement, an herb, or even something as simple as a darker room and a consistent bedtime. The best approach is usually a mix: improve your environment, build a wind-down routine, and try gentle options like magnesium or calming herbs if needed. Sleep isn’t about knocking yourself out—it’s about helping your body feel safe, relaxed, and ready to shut things down for the night.",1,1771659721.0,Nutrition1,0,1.0,False

So far we are looking into Majestic Mirage and Excellence El Carmen as those are the ones within our budget for those dates. 

Big thing for us is food. I know we can only expect so much from all inclusive resorts but we like to eat. I also like a good coffee spot in all inclusives. Other things we are looking for are good pool/beach options we can swim in, modern vibes, aesthetic and clean rooms. We aren’t huge party goers but are not reserved either.

Our first choice was Majestic Mirage but I have seen the food reviews to be 50/50 and people getting sick which is the main reason I started looking into the other resorts.  We are also open to any other resorts that might be more fitting as we just started looking into it now :) Also please let me know what to look out for when booking for early May. Thanks!

Those hours look wasted from the outside, but in reality I keep telling myself I’ll start soon and somehow never do. So the problem isn’t that I don’t study — it’s that I can’t seem to start.

Whenever I’m about to sit at my desk, I feel this strange resistance. I know what I have to do, and I even have a plan, but my brain seems to perceive the task as too big and exhausting. I end up thinking, “I’ll start in a bit, let me have coffee first, check my phone, get fully ready,” and suddenly hours are gone. The most frustrating part is that once I finally start, it actually doesn’t feel that hard.

This has become more obvious while preparing for exams. I know I’m capable of being productive during the day, but I keep delaying the starting point. It’s like my brain turns the moment of beginning into an unnecessary stress trigger. Sometimes I feel like I have to start perfectly, and other times I just don’t know where to begin, so I keep avoiding it.

Blaming myself hasn’t helped. I’ve often thought “I’m undisciplined” or “I don’t want it enough,” but it really feels more like an activation problem. When the task looks big, I start avoiding it, turn to my phone, and fall into a loop of short-term relief instead.

I’m wondering if I’m the only one experiencing this. Especially for those who study or prepare for exams — do you struggle with the same thing? What concrete methods have actually helped you overcome the resistance to starting?",1,1771659426.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I don’t care if you believe it because after it happens you’ll see I was telling the truth. I’ve put the meme flair because this might as well be a meme with how ridiculous this is considering it is entirely true. And btw there’s a chance that this man doesn’t buy the Seahawks or he doesn’t get the winning bid so keep that in mind.*

**LONG STORY SHORT**: I singlehandedly may be responsible for the future of the Seattle Seahawks organization being total shit and them never winning anything again because they have a shitty owner who only cares about making money.

**FULL STORY**: I’m not a rich man but I work in a field where I meet a lot of rich men. I’ve befriended many rich men. For the sake of this story I’m not gonna name any names but I’ll be talking about one billionaire who for the sake of this story I will call “Dirk”, for the record you will see in the coming weeks who he is. Anyways so Dirk and I have been pals for a while. He’s one of the first billionaires I met at my job and we hit it off instantly, he is not a narcissist but he is ambitious. He’s not necessarily greedy but he likes to do gray area things to make money to make a point to people. When you think of billionaires he’s not the first one that comes to mind, like yes if you google him he’ll come up with his own wikipedia page but he’s not like a billionaire who’s in the spotlight or in conversation a lot. Dirk likes to do things in the shadows. I don’t want to get into specifics but a couple months ago I did something crazy for him, something that almost messed up my whole life to make his a lot easier. I did it and by some miracle his life got easier without mine having to get any worse. Anyways Dirk has a massive super bowl party every year. He might be a billionaire but he hates going to social events like the super bowl. This year as usual I was invited and he invited me upstairs to his exclusive VIP area usually reserved for fellow men who have fame or money or whatever. We just started talking about football. He knows I’m a diehard Rams fan and I mentioned to him how upset I was about the championship game and blah blah blah. I also mentioned to him that the Seahawks were going up for sale and how I hoped they get a shitty new owner so our division gets easier. Like yk the type of owner that only cares about money and sucking the team dry of profits. Raising season ticket prices, spending the bare minimum on players, etc… He laughed for a second and said ok I’ll do it. I was confused because I never asked him to do it I was just joking around about how I hoped they get one. He said to me something along the lines of throughout his life people have only been using him for his money and connections. I’m the only person he knows who genuinely cares for him and has never asked for a penny or his help with anything that a poor person couldn’t help with. He also mentioned how I practically risked my life for him recently with no reward. He said he was going to do it to show his gratitude and also make a lot of money in the process. I told him he really didn’t need to do that but he continued to insist and at this point I surely thought he was joking. Yesterday we met up for our usual coffee meeting to discuss stocks and politics and etc… He said to me out of nowhere that he was thinking about our seahawks discussion and he could also make extra money by selling top secret info to the rams organization. I laughed but he didn’t. He was being entirely serious this entire time he has been. He wants to reward me for being a good friend by practically turning one of the rams rivals into a peewee team. I’m an active member of this server btw you can check my post history. I’m telling you guys this because I feel like the whole division deserves to know and no news org would believe me if I told them. So we ended our coffee meeting and as we left he said to me to look in the news as he was about to submit a very generous bid for the seahawks in the coming weeks.

Additionally, while I know they work well, I just hate the look of the silicone attachments. Personal preference, I guess. 

Specs I’m looking for: 

\- Double spout, not single spout 

\- Able to fit a VST 18g basket (24mm depth allowance) 

\- M12 thread, unglued so I can potentially swap in the current portafilter handle 

Nice to haves: 

\- Angled like the current stock filter. This isn’t really priority for me but it would be nice. 

\- Walnut handle to match the other accents. 

I’ve found this one that looks like it meets everything but the angled head, but wondering if I am missing something else that would be a good fit?

1rakycz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rakycz,First Rhode Order!,"For the first time in a very long time, I let myself get carried away and giddy with the Rhode drop here in New Zealand. I’ve never participated in a drop before but *boy* was it exciting! Lol. I only got a few little things to try but thought I’d do a review on them so far. The pictures are my attempt at an aesthetic haul photo, haha. 

The Peptide Lip Treatment in **Salted Caramel**. Smell is 10/10. Divine. It does leave a funky, almost chemical taste in my mouth/back of my throat within a few minutes, though. The delicious smell of the salted caramel disappears quickly. Packaging is adorable. Lips feel very moisturised but the texture is slightly gritty and tacky. 

The Peptide Lip Shape in **Balance**. Super creamy, easy to apply. Gorgeous colour. Packaging is equally adorable as the lip treatment. No funky smell or taste. Longevity is not there, sadly. I applied both the lip shape and lip treatment, then had a coffee and some breakfast and my lips looked bare/natural by the end of it. This is my first ever lip liner so I didn’t have any expectations really as to how long a lip liner is meant to last or how often it needs to be reapplied but I can imagine that’s not an ideal amount of time. 

The Rhode Pocket Blush in **Piggy** and **Sleepy Girl**. Firstly, the names and packaging = unbelievably cute. Love. I got both colours as I wasn’t sure which would look best on me. I am super in love with Sleepy Girl. The perfect shade for me. Piggy is a lovely colour but did me no favours (I’m a light skinned gal with neutral undertones, I can look yellow at my palest and olive at my tannest) - it made me look slightly feverish as opposed to healthy. I’m still going to keep it, though, and use it for my lips! Haven’t tried mixing the two for my cheeks but may also give that a go. 10/10 easy to apply, very creamy and buildable. I used my fingers to spread out and had no issues with blending. The ONLY con was I am used to powder blush that has staying power, this is my first ever cream blushes so I don’t know if it’s to be expected but on cleansed, baseless skin - the blushes only lasted a few hours before they were almost undetectable on my skin.

Overall: 

Will I purchase any of these again? Yes, the Sleepy Girl blush, definitely! Having to reapply a bit more regularly would be worth it to me for the amazing colour. I would certainly like to try another lip product, especially one of the Tinted ones, however for the price ($39 NZD) there are definitely better lip products out there for much less cost. The Salted Caramel is really delicious but not the first one I reach for still - due to the lingering aftertaste. There’s a chance I will keep it in my makeup bag on a regular roster regardless as out of all makeup products, lip products are the ones I have way too many of and get the most joy out of having even if they’re not the best. I just like having options. I’m happy I have a few Rhode products (but I think that’s more feeling like I’m part of the club) but I do believe that if these weren’t marketed as well as they are, and weren’t a product line from Hailey Bieber, they would likely not have the craze they currently do. 

Side note: I did find I had a few small white heads pop up around my mouth after applying the salted caramel lip treatment over a few days. Unsure if that‘s related but I can’t think of anything else that would cause that directly. My cheeks were also a little spottier than normal after using the blushes, but again - I have no proof the two are connected so without proof, I won’t claim these spots in certain places are caused by Rhode, but just something interesting to point out!

1rakxxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1rakxxk/how_to_tell_if_an_introvert_likes_you_10/,How to Tell if an Introvert Likes You: 10 Psychological Signs That Actually Work,"Look, introverts don't exactly send up flares when they're into someone. There's no grand gesture, no loud proclamation. Most people miss the signs completely because they're watching for the wrong things. After diving deep into psychological research, expert insights from Susan Cain's work on introversion, and tons of real relationship data, I've cracked the code on how introverts actually show interest.



Here's what blew my mind: introverts aren't bad at showing affection, they're just operating on a completely different frequency. While extroverts broadcast their feelings like a radio station, introverts are sending encrypted messages that only make sense if you know what to look for. And honestly? Once you understand these signals, they're way more meaningful than anything an extrovert does.



So here are the 10 dead giveaways that an introvert is seriously into you.



\*\*1. They Actually Respond to Your Messages (and Fast)\*\*



Introverts are notoriously bad at replying to people. Their phone could be on fire with notifications and they'll ignore every single one. But if they like you? Different story. They'll respond within minutes, sometimes seconds. They're crafting thoughtful replies instead of one word answers.



This matters because introverts have limited social energy. Texting drains them just like in person interaction does. If they're choosing to spend that energy on you consistently, you're not just another contact in their phone. You're priority level shit.



\*\*2. They Share Their Weird Interests With You\*\*



Introverts live in rich inner worlds filled with niche interests, random obsessions, and passion projects. They don't share this stuff with just anyone because most people don't get it or worse, they judge. But when an introvert starts telling you about their obscure podcast obsession or shows you their carefully curated playlist? That's them letting you into their real world.



According to research on introvert behavior patterns, this selective sharing is actually their version of intimacy. They're testing whether you can vibe with the parts of themselves they usually keep hidden. If you're getting the behind the scenes tour of their brain, congratulations, you're in.



\*\*3. They Initiate Plans (Just the Two of You)\*\*



Here's the thing about introverts, they hate making plans. Social commitments feel like homework. But if an introvert is suggesting one on one hangouts? Holy shit, that's massive. They're voluntarily using their precious alone time on you.



Pay attention to the setting too. Introverts who like you will suggest quiet coffee shops, late night walks, or watching movies at home. Places where you can actually talk without shouting over noise. They're creating environments where deeper connection can happen, not just surface level chitchat.



\*\*4. They Remember Everything You Say\*\*



Introverts are natural observers. They're the ones sitting quietly at the party, absorbing every detail. When they like you, this superpower goes into overdrive. They'll remember that random story you told three weeks ago about your childhood pet. They'll notice you changed your hair or got new shoes.



This comes from genuine interest, not some manipulative memory trick. Research shows introverts process information more deeply than extroverts. When you matter to them, every detail about you gets filed away and treasured. It's honestly kind of beautiful in a slightly intense way.



If you want to go deeper on understanding attachment styles and communication patterns but don't have the energy to read through dense psychology books, there's an app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's a personalized audio learning app that pulls from relationship psychology research, books like ""Attached"" and expert insights on introversion to create custom podcasts based on what you're trying to figure out.



You can type in something specific like ""understanding how introverts show love when I'm more extroverted"" and it builds a learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pick different voices, the smoky one honestly makes psychology way more engaging. It connects insights from multiple sources so you see patterns across different relationship experts and research.



\*\*5. They Get Chatty (But Only With You)\*\*



You know that quiet person who barely says two words in group settings? Watch what happens when it's just you two. Suddenly they're talking about philosophy, life dreams, childhood memories, weird shower thoughts. It's like someone flipped a switch.



Introverts conserve their words for people who actually matter. In groups, they're doing mental math on whether their contribution is worth the energy expenditure. With someone they like? That calculation disappears. They feel safe enough to just be themselves without filtering every word.



\*\*6. They Share Silence Comfortably\*\*



This one throws people off because we're conditioned to think silence equals awkwardness. But here's the secret: introverts show affection through comfortable silence. If an introvert can sit with you for hours without talking and it doesn't feel weird? You've reached peak intimacy in their book.



Dr. Laurie Helgoe, author of ""Introvert Power,"" explains that introverts recharge through solitude. When they can recharge in your presence instead of needing to escape from you, that's them saying you feel like home. You're not draining, you're restorative.



\*\*7. They Let You Into Their Space\*\*



An introvert's personal space, especially their home, is sacred territory. It's their fortress, their charging station, their escape pod from the world. If they're inviting you over, letting you see their book collection, their messy kitchen, their comfort zone? You're not a guest anymore, you're becoming part of their safe space.



This is huge because introverts need their environment to feel right. They won't pollute that sanctuary with people who stress them out or kill their vibe. Your presence passing the ""would I want this person in my safe space"" test is basically their version of meeting the parents.



\*\*8. They Open Up About Real Shit\*\*



Introverts are masters of the polite surface conversation. They can small talk their way through any social situation without revealing a damn thing about themselves. But when they like you, the mask comes off. They'll talk about their fears, insecurities, dreams, and the stuff that actually keeps them up at night.



This vulnerability doesn't come easy. According to attachment research, introverts typically have a slower trust building process. If they're speeding through those walls with you, dropping heavy emotional truths, they're basically saying ""I trust you with the real me."" Don't take that lightly.



\*\*9. They Get Awkwardly Protective\*\*



Introverts aren't usually the loudly protective type, but when they care about you, it comes out in subtle ways. They'll make sure you got home safe. They'll remember you're stressed about something and check in later. They'll notice if someone's being shitty to you even if they don't immediately call it out.



This protective instinct might look like quiet concern rather than dramatic confrontation. They're running background calculations on your wellbeing, making sure you're okay, watching out for you in ways that don't require spotlights or speeches.



\*\*10. They Choose You Over Alone Time\*\*



This is the ultimate sign. Introverts need solitude like they need oxygen. After social events, they're usually racing home to decompress alone. But if an introvert is consistently choosing to spend time with you instead of retreating into solitude? If they're okay with you being around during their recharge time? You're not just someone they like, you've become part of their emotional ecosystem.



When an introvert treats you like you ARE their alone time rather than something they need alone time to recover from, that's when you know it's real.



\*\*The Bottom Line\*\*



Introverts show love differently. It's quieter, more intentional, way more selective. They're not going to shout their feelings from rooftops or make grand public displays. But what they will do is share their inner world, their time, their energy, and their safe spaces with you. And honestly? That's worth way more than any flashy gesture.



If you're seeing multiple signs from this list, stop second guessing yourself. That introvert is into you. Now go hang out with them in comfortable silence and see where it goes.

I bet!,"More than half of you will have dissertations on never settling, modern women are this and that, and how you are focused on the grind and locked in.

And then there comes a woman in your life.

All of a sudden the guy who replied that relationships are distractions is lecturing her on skincare and remembering her coffee order and debating with people in comment sections as though he is her unpaid PR manager.

You'll go from:

1) ""I don't chase.""

2) ""I'm emotionally unavailable.""

3) ""Marriage is a scam.""


To:

1) ""She's different.""

2) You see, you do not understand, she is not like other girls.

3) ""Bro I think this is serious.""

Sir. She has even sent you a good morning text and has asked whether you ate. The character development is crazy.

It is the same man who claimed that he does not feel who is currently smiling at his phone as though he has come across fire. The gym posts motivational messages without noise. 

The ""alpha mindset"" tweets? Gone. Instead of normal Instagram stories, which are soft-launched, and suspiciously precise captions.

And the best part? The entire subreddit will run it before you can confess it.

The tone softens. The rants are less violent. One day you find yourself on the side of women in the arguments you initiated.

It's okay. We're not judging.

There is always one woman who breaks the hardest guy into freshly ironed clothes because, however loud the ""I don't need anyone speeches."" are like it.

I’ve honestly noticed my self-concept has improved a lot compared to before.

Day before yesterday, I decided to test it.

In the morning, I affirmed for around 2–3 minutes that I would get a free coffee that day. I LOVE coffee, so I thought this would be a fun little test. After that, I let go of how it would happen. I just knew it would.

Okay, I won’t lie, I didn’t fully detach (it’s hard for me). I did think about it during the day, but whenever I did, I just felt really excited instead of doubtful.

The whole day was hectic and I was out the entire time. In the evening, while I was about to head home, one of my friends randomly handed me a Spanish Latte and said it was a treat from his side because I helped him with some important work earlier.

AND MIND YOU it was my absolute favorite coffee. I always buy it from a particular café… and he got it from that exact same place 😭😭🫶🏻💗

I know it’s not some huge, life-changing manifestation, but I was genuinely so happy. There’s this affirmation in Rampage that says, “I only have to affirm once,” and that line is SO powerful. It really boosts my confidence and makes me feel like I don’t have to obsess or overdo anything.

Now fast forward to today.

Today I affirm for 2 minutes that it will be a less hectic day for me. Mind you, I have to grind today like crazy. Still, I believe it’s going to be a less hectic day regardless.

In the morning, I grind for about an hour. And then SUPRINSINGLY the deadline that was supposed to be today gets postponed to 24th Feb 😭😭

I literally cannot be happier than this

Can’t wait to share my big manifestations soon 😭✨

She tried making a lot of connections and hugging me, and at one point while crying she said “I’m sorry I’m a bad mom.”

There’s a lot of background to why my brother (26M) and I don’t speak to her, mainly because her husband (our stepfather) is an alcoholic who she enables, and I think he brings out the worst in her. 

There are other reasons throughout our childhood that have come to light as we have grown up, like purposely taking us out of the house to avoid our father from being able to visit us. I’m also upset that she’s used me as a therapist/ friend to vent to for years. This is not close to everything we’ve been through but I wanted to give some context for our VLC. 

I can’t sleep because I keep replaying seeing her today in tears and feeling awful. I can imagine at home now she’s crying saying that we hate her…

I know I shouldn’t feel guilty for taking space and living my life without her in it, but I feel like I’ve betrayed her. I keep asking myself “maybe I should ask her to go for coffee and set a clear boundary of what I’m comfortable with?” But I know I won’t like the result of her being involved in our lives again. 

I’d much rather protect my brother and live my life then get eaten by guilt and force myself to maintain a relationship I’m not looking to have at the moment.

I’ve been in Rwanda for a bit and I’m really looking to get involved in some grassroots community support.

Back home, I used to volunteer informally, running weekly Sunday tutorials for disadvantaged kids (literacy, math, science, etc.) at a specific school.

I love that low-key, ""boots on the ground"" style of giving where you can see the direct impact. Nothing big or formal, just consistent, community based support, and it was honestly very meaningful. And I'd really love to continue something similar here in Rwanda.

1rakozg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1rakozg/my_first_time_dating_a_woman_after_4_years_single/,My first time dating a woman after 4 years single.,"Hello everyone,

So I wanna start off and just say I’m still rusty and new to Reddit but I’m here just to get insight and understanding from others that may know. Lately I’ve been feeling I guess on edge and a bit anxious, nervous and like as if I messed up but I feel too, I’m overthinking all of this. FYI: She is 43 F, I am 31 M. She’s a Leo I’m an Aquarius.

Well, to start off, basically long story short from years of my dating life, it was a roller coaster and I noticed the scheme of things that I always dated younger than me, of course of legal age, but at most 5 years younger. Up until the recent break up it was 4.5 years we were together and I felt that was the final wake up call for me of younger people in the dating life. It do leave me with horrible scars from all the issues and drama that I’ve separated from February 2023 and ever since then until now of February 2026, I haven’t dated or tried because of how much damage it did to me and I focused on myself more and my self esteem and happiness to recover. Did a lot of traveling, got my MA degree, and continued working and promoting to where I’m at, but it’s up until maybe October 2025 of when I started to see more into this person that I’m currently to talking to now. 

So with this person, she does happen to work in my department and the one issue that we spoke about was our work, but it alls tarted from really is emailing each other but she is like a sub department to my main job. She would be here and there but she’s still part of our company overall since her co workers work with me and a lot of team work together. 

As time progressed she has moved to my floor level and her office is actually not far from my desk. The red flag is that she is one of my managers but not my direct I report to, but still a sub manager of the department. So it does create like a red flag in my mind. So when she moved over I did try and visit her as much as I could to talk to her, even small talk and I do know how to separate work and outside stuff with her, but it came to the point where she would always tell me, “talk to me about something that is NOT work related” and it would get to some personal stuff or just other interesting things. 

So as that goes on, I’m gonna try and keep it a bit shorter but about a month ago, we had frequently started going out on our breaks/lunch together and I wanted to show her coffee shops since we both are major coffee people, and I remember she would always go to my desk for coffee or creamer that I had, so we did that and that’s how I was able to kinda talk to her more an more, and it came to the point where my birthday was coming up and I decided to pull the ballsy move and decided to just go for it and invite her to my birthday night and I asked her if she wants my number and I got lucky and she said yes! 

So then I message her my number as we came back from break, she messaged me back and saying “this ain’t your crazy ex lol” (side story to that reference). So I told her “lol don’t remind me of that”. After a couple minutes she texts me again asking where my coffee was, and I was like “I’m sorry I finished it on my last break!” Case she told me “I know you like your coffee black, but I wanted to write “you’re soo sweet”” and I was a bit like shocked/surprised, so I told her “I’m sorry!! Next time 😭”

As the day ends, I come across her and her co worker and we say bye and when I approach my car, she texts me saying “seee! I told you you’re soo sweet, even my co worker said you’re such a sweet guy” and of course me thinking to say “well I was raised properly and treat those I care with respect”, I honestly was like idk if tha was correct to say cause I was still in work mode, and this is where I felt it was a green light, or hint hint and she texted after that “BTW: I like your outfit today, it looks really good on you” and this is where I’m like okayyyy so she really then has some sort of feelings for me or am I crazy? And I thought about that over night.

As the week goes we keep talking for a bit through text and sadly she couldn’t make it for my bday but it’s okay it was my fault for asking so late like 3 days prior but we made up a small like time to spend Monday for us and we went early for a walk at a park and it went well. We did our walk and got to talk deeply about stuff and at the end we sat down and spoke to each other and we both started opening up in a way and she admitted that I was handsome and attractive and I did the same back that she is very pretty and beautiful, that I felt this chemistry and aside from all that, she was already expressing physical touch, leaning her head on me and hugging me like romantic and touchy with me that day. We both did also discuss our concerns on if things don’t work out, how would we see each other at work, and we don’t want issues to happen. I was glad we both understood that. So towards the end she gets close to me and already having my hands wrapped around her and her hands on me I’m like shocked and a bit confused cause it was our first like time together her outside of work and for her to initiate these moves had me sooo shocked cause I didnt expect that from her. And we we said good bye but like it felt very warm.

So we continued texting and we don’t text like consistent because we do have our errands and jobs, etc… so we try and pla again but it seems that so much has happened that I did happen to try and ask her alot on planning stuff out that it seems a bit difficult and she did admit she is very like last minute in some things here and there and for her also to be a parent of 2 daughters. So it’s understandable, and I feel it’s very hard now and makes me wonder if she doesn’t have time the for me. But we came across I guess like an incident that wasn’t bad but something for me to learn from.

So me and my dumb self decided to surprise her at work to bring her flowers but of course I didn’t just wave it around and show it off to employees to get that attention, I took it to my desk and left it there and I send her a good morning text and of course told her “I have a surprise” and long story short she ended up getting me to tell her what it was and when I told her she was a bit surprised. So she said for me to meet her after work in the parking and stay hidden which of course makes a ton of sense and this was me after trying to sneak the flowers back to my car without people asking what or who those are for, and I park next to her car and she said wait for her to get into her vehicle and once she said come in, I go in and we discuss about it and it did feel awkward because of the concerns and how overall it was very sweet on my part and she loved them because I did ask her favorite type of florals for detail so I can note it, so I surprised her with that but she said it was isn’t the “wrong place and wrong time” but she loved them and she said “come here” with that like index finger motion and I’m like “ummm yess?” And she gives me a kiss in her car and of course I feel butterflies and blush, and I told her “aww please get home safe” and that was the end of that day.

Last timeout we had was Presidents’ Day Feb 16th and we originally planned a hike together but it got cancelled due to weather conditions, but then no rain was there, and she texts me asking if I wanna meet up for coffee and talk and I said sure and next thing you know half way in my drive it’s pouring rain out of no where, so our walk at a park that we planned also was a no go, but we did meet up for our talk and coffee and was in her car, and I felt the conversation was very I guess truthful and left me confused at the end of it. We expressed concerns and primarily she was hesitant overall about the age gap. She’s 43 and I’m 31. I told her how do you know if you’ve never tried or even continued to see where things can go cause you don’t Fully know me for me. Age shouldn’t be your decision because I told her I dislike people assuming that I’m young that I may be immature or look like a troubled lane but I’m not. So as we kept talking we did admit our feelings again, and as we reach the end, she leans over my seat and draws this thing on the window and I lean back to her and kiss her but multiple times and she turns red and was very speechless but blushing too, and from there she seemed very happy and she expressed in a text that she felt very warm and her saying that was more than she was expecting, and from there, we haven’t really text frequent, it’s been a bit dead like here and there like 1 or 2 text a day.

So this is where I’m like feeling anxious, worried, a bit sad if it was too good to be true, or is this normal because yes she is an adult and has her 2 kid and I have my 2 jobs I work so we do get bus but leaving that day after kissing her, feeling confused, anxious and worried, is that normal? Do older women usually communicate like this in an adult life? Did I mess up on anything? I still am feeling very deep and truly wanna express my love and care for her so much that not hearing as frequent of texts from her anymore kinda gets me concerned that I messed up. And yes, I prefer talking grave to face old school style before smart jokes came out. 

So I just need clarification if I’m over thinking, do I give her space to think about us because she is a bit hesitant as well like I said because of the age gap, or am I okay, what do I do? Leave her space and don’t text back? Just wait until she reaches out to me again? I’m just stressing out a lot feeling messed up and my shield is coming back up and I don’t wanna expose more of my emotions to be hurt and rejected.

I forgot to mention too, she is a Leo and I’m and Aquarius. I really Hope it works because I miss love and feeling love and I truly want something with her cause I feel it sincerely.

PS. She doesn’t use any sort of social media and is just phone text or call. ",1,1771658006.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1raknj1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1raknj1,A=P Cipher layer Discovery,"New fan. Got a few gems from this Reddit thread. Got into the movie. Fell into the rabbit hole. Here I am on Reddit. I am working on some additional larger content for this. I stumbled on this and had to share to see if this could help propel things towards a solution. 

To give credit to the pinned post, there are others that did heavy lifting and discovered the sequence of the copiale cipher ->  to the Morse code coffee menu -> to XJVO OJRY XERSW -> to the A=P translation from the comic book mans house -> to the E=EE -> to the hobo codes and what 3 words website -> to the dolls with the zodiac code -> which yields us tombstone.sheriff.entries -> which takes us to 36°42'36""N 118°35'30""W -> other orders for the dolls end up in Australia. So the doll order in Sarah’s apartment seems canonical to end up near Barton’s Peak.

That being said: it’s seems we are stuck. 

There’s a few things about this.  When I was reviewing the A=P order the shifts didn’t make sense mathematically at all. There wasn’t a rhyme or reason to it. So I broke them out on and excel sheet and mapped it. 

See attached images:

Row 1 = is traditional alphabet 

Row2= is traditional alphabet number assignment A=1 B=2…Z=26

Row 3 = the translation order

Row 4 = the translation order and the # in traditional alphabet

Row 5 = the variance from traditional to translation

Row 6 = several letters “can’t go backwards so have to go forwards. These are highlighted in yellow and red. 

I punched this through ChatGPT and it made a unique observation: the order was a reverse keyboard qwerty. Apparently this is common in ciphers and Kevin knight would be very familiar with this cryptological concept. 

See attached:m images.

I have some experience with kryptos and zodiac ciphers so this was an exciting development. 

I dove into the A=P code. I noticed a few things:

1. the A=P is featured 5 times in the movie. Repetition = patterns, clues, focus, shifts. The first time A=P is featured twice in the comic book man’s bedroom. Once above his bed and once on the well.

See attached images.

1. 3 times when Sam breaks into the comic book man’s house. Twice in the same spots and an additional new spot on the door/book shelf when Sam is peering into the room and sees the bloody bed. However, this time the cipher is in ascending order.

See attached images.

I reviewed the original shot and the ascending A=P was not there during the initial visit. I believe this implies orientation shift for future solves. 

See attached images.

Without going into themes, critical analysis or being siskel and ebert, I think there’s a Sam track in the movie and audience track. I think this was a subtle nuance intended for us as the audience. If ths is a fair puzzle, anyone can solve it.  

Now to supplement this, the shift demands attention and some focus. This is a combination lock as you need the right data, orientation and translation paths to solve this puzzle. If you have 1 of 3 parts wrong it won’t work.  

I personally am biased to this. 

I have a few ideas from the movie. Knights move- a chess move that is known in cryptology. With Kevin knight this would be an elegant play. With Kevin’s work on zodiac z340 and copiale there are also other reads and paths as well for population, orientation, and solves. There are two knights moves in the movie as well as 8x8 and 16x8 grids in the movie. Both are at the chess pool party and when sam solves the NPM1 map with the cereal box man. A2 -> C3 and h4 -> g6.

I believe this implies palimpsest and abscissa using the 8x8 grid or 16x8 Sam used and that chess grid and moves play a factor. Perhaps a polybius square or other methods. 

Additionally, Kevin knight was uniquely aware of the impending solves for z340. The movie was filmed pre z340 solve so z408 is canon. However, with his knowledge and experience I think the z340 tactics are also fair game. 

I am continuing to work through the movie but wanted to post this in the hope that this resonated with someone and would help our things to a solve.   ",1,1771657865.0,underthesilverlake,0,1.0,False

From rent and suppliers to staffing and equipment, every decision affects your bottom line. One of the most important choices you’ll make? Your POS system. It’s not just a payment tool; it’s the engine that keeps your café running smoothly every single day.

Before you buy, here’s everything you need to know.

# 1. Understand What a Modern POS System Really Does

A POS system today is far more than a till. It manages orders, processes payments, tracks inventory, monitors staff performance, and provides detailed sales reports. In a busy London café, that level of integration isn’t a luxury — it’s essential.

The right system should simplify operations, not complicate them. If it feels confusing during a demo, imagine using it during the morning rush. Always prioritize ease of use and speed.

# 2. Speed and Simplicity Are Non-Negotiable

London café customers don’t like waiting. Your POS must handle high volumes quickly without freezing or lagging. Look for:

* Intuitive touchscreen interface
* Customizable menu layout
* Quick modifiers for drink options
* Fast payment processing

Every second saved at checkout improves the overall customer experience.

# 3. Flexible Payment Options Matter

In 2026, most transactions are cashless. Your system should support contactless cards, mobile wallets, and split payments. Seamless transactions reduce queues and create a frictionless experience for customers.

# 4. Inventory Management Saves Money

Stock control can quietly make or break your profits. A good POS system tracks ingredients in real time as items are sold. This helps prevent shortages during busy periods and reduces unnecessary waste. Accurate inventory data also improves supplier planning.

# 5. Reporting and Insights Drive Growth

Guessing which items perform best isn’t enough. A strong POS system provides clear reports on daily sales, peak hours, and top products. These insights help you adjust pricing, refine menus, and schedule staff effectively.

# 6. Staff Management Tools Improve Accountability

Managing shifts and performance becomes easier when everything is tracked in one place. Role-based access ensures employees only see what they need, while performance reports help you reward top performers.

# 7. Cloud-Based Access Offers Flexibility

Cloud technology allows you to monitor your café from anywhere. Whether at home or planning expansion, remote access keeps you connected to real-time performance.

**best restaurant point of sale system** options combine speed, flexibility, reporting, and inventory control into one streamlined solution. They connect front-of-house and back-of-house operations, reduce errors, and support smarter decision-making.

Buying a POS system for your London café isn’t just a technical purchase — it’s a strategic one. Focus on speed, usability, scalability, and data insights. When your system works efficiently behind the scenes, you can focus on what truly matters: serving great coffee and building loyal customers.",1,1771657711.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Because of Sebastian’s… particular technique, I could never quite keep my voice down. 

Yet today, the moment I trembled and opened my mouth to gasp, he instantly clamped a hand over my lips, stifling the sound completely. 

Afterwards, I rubbed my aching lower back and asked casually, “Why the gag? I thought you loved 

hearing me.” 

Sebastian paused, the cigarette halfway to his lips. A flicker of something soft glimmered in his 

eyes. 

He chuckled quietly. “I bought the new girlfriend an apartment next door. Wouldn’t want her to hear and be disgusted.” 

Sitting on the edge of the bed, my clothes still disheveled, it took me a few seconds to process his 

words. 

“New… girlfriend?” 

Sebastian tilted his head and blew a smoke ring towards me, his smile utterly carefree. “Yeah. Met her not long ago. Painfully innocent. And our families are a perfect match.” 

As he spoke, he seemed lost in thought, the corner of his mouth lifting unconsciously. 

The drifting smoke stung my eyes, making them water. My fingernails dug deep into my palms. 

My voice began to tremble uncontrollably. “Then what am I to you?” 

Sebastian glanced at me from the side, his gaze roaming over my body with brazen familiarity before he leaned in to press a kiss beside my ear. 

“This is good,” he murmured, his tone intimate. “You like me so much. It’s not like you’re getting a 

raw deal-” 

He broke off, noticing my agitation, and his voice softened. “Why don’t you just wait a bit longer for me? Who knows, maybe once I’m bored of her, I’ll give you a proper title.” 

I stared sliently at his face, and in that moment, I finally saw the truly vile heart hidden beneath 

that beautiful exterior. 

We met five years ago. I was still in college then, working part-time at a nearby café. 

Sebastian would always order a coffee and leave an outrageously large tip. 

I wasn’t a fool. The intensity and directness of his gaze always left me flustered. 

Chapter 1 

11.11% 

But I hesitated. 

Sebastian was brilliant, born into privilege-a mother in high finance, a father in politics. 

My own world had fallen apart at sixteen when my father’s affair came to light. After my parents’ divorce, I moved to Emerald City with my mother. 

My father fought hard for custody of me, but the mere thought of him marrying that other woman and raising her daughter, who was no blood relation to me, made me sick to my stomach. 

And it was precisely this vulnerability of mine that Sebastian had exploited to win me over. 

One evening, as I was walking back to campus after my shift, my father’s assistant suddenly appeared, insisting I go back with him. 

I struggled fiercely. Just as I was being dragged towards the car, Sebastian appeared from nowhere. One punch sent the man sprawling to the ground. 

From that day on, he started showing up silently, like a steady, reliable shadow following me. 

I never asked why. He never offered an explanation 

I thought we had an unspoken understanding. Now i see it was just my own wishful thinking. 

I let out a heavy sigh, stood up calmly, and began to pack my things. 

I hadn’t been at it long when a weight settled on my shoulders. 

Sebastian’s low, lazy voice sounded by my ear. “Veronica, to be honest, I’m actually quite reluctant 

to let you go.” 

“But for your own good, you should hurry up and find some nice, simple guy to marry. You’re smart, you’ll definitely-” 

I cut him off impatiently with a crisp, “Fine.” 

Sebastian’s expression darkened for no apparent reason. He let out a cold snort and just watched me pack, his gaze fixed on me. 

I’ve always been the type to cut my losses cleanly. Once the decision was made, I picked up my 

suitcase and headed for the door. 

But the very next second, I came face-to-face with the last person I ever wanted to see again. 

My father’s stepdaughter-the daughter that woman brought with her. Cecilia Fairfax. 

She wore a pearl-white dress, her hair straight and sleek, carrying the faint, delicate scent of gardenias. 

She was the spitting image of me. No, to be precise, she looked like me when I was in my teens. 

Chapter 1 

11.11% 

There was not a trace of surprise on her face. Instead, she gracefully looped her arm through 

Sebastian’s. 

She offered a perfectly poised smile. “Well, isn’t this a coincidence, sister?” 

Seeing the blatant challenge in her eyes, my brow furrowed deeply. 

I knew, without a doubt, this was no coincidence. 

Her mother stole my father. Now she was stealing my man. Like mother, like daughter. 

Sebastian looked oddly conflicted, a mix of awkwardness and surprise coloring his features. 

“You’re sisters?” 

I cast an impassive glance over the two of them, then turned and walked away. 

Sebastian seemed startled. “Veronica, where are your manners!” he blurted out. “Cecilia is being 

polite, and that’s how you treat her?” 

“It’s alright,” Cecilia’s small voice piped up, laced with a hint of poorly-concealed hurt that was meant to tug at heartstrings. 

“She’s always been like this. I’m used to it.” 

Just as expected, Sebastian immediately pulled her into his embrace, murmuring soft comforts

Back in Oct 2019, I was 13 and had the privilege of experiencing my first love, and the love I fear I’ll always be deep down chasing for the rest of my life. To this day, he is one of the most amazing men I have ever had the experience of meeting, and I sometimes fear the best. 

We dated until Oct 2020, and ended things shortly after our 1 year anniversary. At 21 years old, my singular biggest regret in life is still ever going to that boy and saying I wanted to separate. There was no big blow up fight, and in fact, what led me to decide that was his lack of putting effort into messaging me while at a tournament for a sport that he turned out to be extremely successful in for years after, and to this day. (In hindsight) due to being an extremely emotional teenage girl and my inability to self regulate my emotions at the time, I made a spur of the moment decision over text, insinuating that I thought we’d be better off not in the relationship, which was some messed up attempt to make him “show me how much he wanted/loved me.” I believe it’s also imperative to mention at this point that I was raised by an alcoholic mother, with severe NPD and BPD, and a father that was just as fearful of her and thus, enabled her treatment towards her children. She not only ruined our 1 year anniversary and numerous moments for us, but she made it so painfully difficult for us to just be in love, together, without the difficulty that is being young, in love and having one person be mentally crushed by an unfortunate reality that she (I) always had to go home to. This shaped the girl I was, as I found myself treating my first love similar to how my own mother treated/spoke to me, my father and my siblings. I didn’t understand it at the time and felt as though I had this natural nasty inside of me, but this was before years of therapy and acquiring the tools I needed in order to mature, process and understand the abuse, and become a better person all in all. As well, cutting off most contact and association with said mother due to how extremely toxic and poisonous she is in my life, and others lives.  

When I reached out in days after, letting him know I’d thought I’d made a mistake and as any stable minded person would do, he reflected on the relationship, where he was at in life and where he wanted to be one day. To no surprise, after numerous attempts in following days and weeks to try and get him back, he eventually decided we were better off not being together. Within two months, he was seeing numerous different girls while I tried to somewhat grapple with what seemed like an empty void inside of me that would never be filled. I won’t say much here, other than even after 2 breakups after this one, I still haven’t cried or felt emotional pain like I felt after this relationship. hs after the fact. In a sense, it was the moment my innocence was taken away and I “woke up” to real life. After things ended, we essentially cut off all communication as we were thrown into lockdown shortly after and I was left to my own memories and discovered the nasty addiction that is mental rumination. 

While still not over him, I got into a relationship months after with another boy (solely as some teenage girl ploy to try and make him see that I was, indeed, worthy of love) that went on to be an on and off relationship for the next 3 years of my life. While in that relationship, every time we were “off,” my mind and heart immediately wandered back to my first love, and the next day I’d be crawling back to the on and off ex, saying I wanted to make things work— partially because I knew, the first love wouldn’t take me back, but he’d take me back always. From day one, I self sabotaged essentially every part of that relationship. He was an amazing guy, and deserved absolutely nothing that I dished out to him. I hope, by this point most are starting to see the bigger picture. 

There was one point where me and said on and off ex were broken up and I reached out to the first love shortly after hearing that him and a girlfriend had broken up months before. We hadn’t been in contact since the breakup 3 ish years prior. Of course, as any teenage girl would in this position (lol, note the sarcasm) I immediately tried to strike up conversation through Snapchat. We chatted briefly and snapchatted meaningless pictures back and forth for a few weeks, until eventually it stopped.

A few months after, at age 19, I met another man. While he was so perfect on paper and yet immensely flawed, for some reason, this relationship reignited all of these unanswered questions and unresolved feelings I had regarding my first relationship. In hindsight, I knew that if things were good enough with this man, it’d end in marriage and I’d never be able to try and see if things could work with my first love, the one I’ve truly wanted to be and grow with all these years. So naturally, self sabotaged every aspect of the relationship to the best of my ability the second I realized I didn’t want to be with him, but knew I didn’t have the balls to leave him. While most of the time, I thought I’d genuinely marry this man, anytime that feeling overcame me, even in our absolute happiest of moments, the only person on my mind was my first love. I would genuinely be over the moon happy, but then be hit with a massive wave of sadness, angst, and regret that would eventually turn outwards as anger towards my ex… because why couldn’t he just be my first love? 

After things ended with this ex March 2025, I immediately ran and followed my first love back on socials. To my surprise, he followed back and I think that gave me some sort of false hope, because why after all these years would he care what I’m up to/care to be “connected” in any way if he viewed it simply as a “young relationship that meant nothing”— which is often how I’ve thought he’s felt about things.

**This brings me to today**. I planned to move to the other side of the world last year (which is currently where I am) and miraculously got a really great job out of town months before this big move. So I knew I wouldn’t be back home for a full year.  A few days before leaving for the job, I reached out and asked if he’d like to get coffee, but no pressure. He reached back out and let me know he was extremely busy with his sport and job at the time, and probably couldn’t make it work. While let down, I was suprised that he continued the conversation going asking where I was going, what’d I’d be doing, etc, as I’d never received a semblance of interest in past years. As a result, I think it gave me an even bigger false hope than when he’d followed me back on socials months prior. 

**My question now is: Is this love or is this limerence?** 

After numerous failed relationships as a result of just wanting them to be him and self sabotaging, countless years of hopelessly yearning with no end (6, but who’s counting…) and constant rumination over something that I may have just built up in my head, I’m curious whether there’s any point to reach out to him. This is the longest I’ve been single in years, and I cannot stop thinking about him and how things could maybe, just maybe work for us as a result of how much I’ve changed and developed into a different woman for the better. 

If you managed to read this all, and have advice to give, please feel free to be as brutally honest as possible. I will appreciate it. I’ve never told anyone about this or how I’m currently feeling. Not even my family, friends or therapist know how deeply I feel for this man… I fight an internal battle every single day that is wondering if I should reach out to him, or to just simply try and let it go. I wonder what any sane person would possibly say to him if they had the chance to tell him how they’ve felt thru the years and how they currently feel, without completely destroying their self respect. I wonder if I’d call him, or simply text him. I sometimes wonder too if there’s just no point, as I’m on the other side of the world and won’t be home until August…. (But genuinely, if you’ve ever felt a “love” like this before, and haven’t been able to share how you feel with the other person, the distance between you two becomes completely irrelevant. 

**Let me know what you would do in this situation, how you may go about reaching out if you were to and what’d you say, or how you may go about TRULY getting over things, if you believe that is my best option in this case. This situation feels like it’s eating me alive from the inside out, and I worry if I don’t act soon, he may find someone new that ends up being his life partner, and my chances will be gone for good.**

1rakeu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1rakeu6/11_years_of_research_into_the_betz_sphere_why_the/,"11 years of research into the Betz Sphere: Why the official ""metal valve"" story is a fabricated pacifier.","I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this, but im honestly losing my mind holding onto this and I just need to put it out there. There is a specific, suffocating kind of terror you get when an inanimate object decides to just... wake up.  
  
Most of u have probably heard the fake n sanitized wikipedia version of the 1974 Betz Mystery Sphere. U know the one. The quirky Florida family who found a polished metal ball in a brush fire and the government swooping in just to say it was a rusty valve from a paper mill. its a neat little story tied up with a bow, literally designed to make u scroll past and not think about it again.  
  
But for the last 11 years ive been digging into the actual primary sources...im talking tracking down the original Navy xray techs, the civilian metallurgists who actually touched the thing and a family friend who was literally in the house for the two weeks before the military showed up.

What im about to share isnt the public story its the suppressed case notes and the quiet, terrified off the record testimonies of people who realized that our understanding of physics is basically just a fragile joke.

March 1974. Fort George Island, Florida. A massive brush fire burned down 88 acres of the Betz familys property. While walking through the blackened ashes they found it. Just sitting there perfectly pristine...

A completely seamless metal sphere, exactly 7.96 inches across and weighing exactly 21.34 lbs.

The first weird thing was the temp. It was sitting in the epicenter of a fire hot enough to literally calcify tree roots, but the sphere was cold to the touch. Not just room temp cool, but actively structurally cold. Like a block of ice left in a freezer! Terry Betz the 21 year old son, picked it up and told my source that holding it felt completely wrong.

21 pounds stuffed into an 8 inch ball messes with your brain. It felt too dense like almost like it had a gravitational pull totally independent of the earth!

Thinking it was discarded NASA satellite junk TErry carried it home and put it on a window seat in his bedroom. For two weeks it was just a heavy paperweight. It sat in the direct Florida sunlight all day but it never warmed up once.

It woke up by accident...

Terry was practicing his acoustic guitar in his room. When he hit certain sustained chords..mm specifically the lower register ones and guess whtt the sphere started to hum!

I have the audio transcripts from Dr. Carl Williston who investigated it later. The sound it made wasnt an echo it was this low frequency pulsing resonance. It completely bypassed your eardrums and vibrated directly inside your jawbone and your dental fillings.

When Terry stopped playing, the sphere didnt stop right away instead it kept vibrating, changing the pitch slightly felt like it was answering him.

Things escalated super fast from weird sounds to totally defying inertia. They started testing it on their hardwood living room floor.

If u push a heavy steel ball it should just roll in a straight line until friction stops it right? No. This thing did geometric math.

U push it forward, it would roll exactly 12 feet, come to a dead unnatural stop without slowing down first, hold its position for exactly 3 seconds and then roll backward. And it didnt just roll back in the general direction. It navigated. It would curve around the legs of coffee tables to come back to the exact hand that pushed it.

A neighbor came over and put it on a glass table. It rolled toward the edge but instead of falling off ..it just slammed on the brakes right at the precipice. Then it started tracing the perimeter of the glass, hugging the exact edge, spinning on its own axis.

This is when the psychological vibe of the house got really bad. The familys 70lb dog, Weedle, started refusing to come inside. He’d just stand at the edge of the yard crying his eyes locked on the exterior walls of the living room.

At night, the family started hearing heavy, metallic rolling upstairs. Doors would slam. Unseen weights felt like they were pressing down on the floorboards...making the whole house creak and shift. But everytime they turned on the lights to check? The sphere was just sitting perfectly still, dead center in whatever room the noise came from.

It never moved when u were looking right at it. Only in ur periphery, or behind a closed door.

They panicked n the novelty wore off and they realized they were sharing their house with something that was mapping the architecture and testing its physical boundaries. Gerri Betz called the news... and the massive media circus forced the US Navy to step in. The military confiscated it, citing national security and potential Soviet tech and took it to the labs at Naval Station Mayport.

This is where the official story is total garbage.

The Navy told the public it was a standard stainless steel ball check valve (Alloy 431) and gave it back. Case closed (seriously wtf??)

But I found the guy who ran the 300 kilovolt xray machine on it at Mayport. He\[s an old man now, hiding out in xyz. He wouldnt let me record his voice but he let me sit at his kitchen table and read his personal logbooks from that week.

The Navys public statement was a fabricated pacifier.

The xrays showed the sphere wasnt solid at all. It had a shell exactly 0.42 inches thick. Inside that shell, floating in some kind of unidentifiable vacuum state, were three smaller geometric spheres.

Worse, the object had dual magnetic poles that wouldnt stay fixed. They were actively migrating around inside the sphere, generating a localized magnetic field that was completely frying the labs diagnostic equipment.

The metallurgy was impossible too. tvhe surface had elements of steel but it was fused with an unknown element with an atomic density the Navy literally couldnt categorize. When they tried to drill into it with a diamond tipped industrial bit, it didnt just fail to scratch it even the drill seized up and the bit shattered into pieces.

The military didnt give it back because it was harmless. They gave it back because the inside registered as extremely volatile. The lead scientist concluded that if that 0.42 inch shell was ever punctured, the sudden depressurization of the vacuum mixing with the shifting magnetic core would cause an explosion equivalent to a small tactical yield.

Thhey handed a civilian family a sentient unexploded device because they had absolutely zero idea how to contain it without triggering it.

When the Betz family got it back, they noticed a change. It didnt hum anymore. It didn't roll around playing games. It just sat in the center of the living room projecting this heavy, oppressive silence. The air around it felt dense, giving everyone severe nausea and migraines if they stayed in the room for more thhan ten minutes.

This is where the trail goes cold, and its what messes with my head the most.

The family didnt write a book. They didnt try to get famous or monetize it. They just quietly packed their belongings, abandoned the property on Fort George Island completely, and vanished.

It took me 3 years to track down an address for Terry Betz. I found him living in a rural county xyz. I drove 14 hours to get there. I didnt even knock on the door. I just sat in my car parked on the dirt road, staring at the property.

Every single window on the house was covered in heavy blackout material. And the entire perimeter of the yard was lined with thick, solid lead plating like the exact kind they use to line the walls of hospital xray rooms...buried halfway into the dirt.

I sat there in my car, staring at the property. I had spent 11 years looking for this guy. I'd drained my savings, wasted thousands of dollars of my own hard-earned money on travel and background checks, and basically alienated everyone I care about just to find this one address.

But looking at the sheer amount of industrial lead buried in the dirt around his porch... I realized Terry Betz wasnt hiding from the government. He was trying to keep whatever was in that house from getting out.

Then I tasted it. A strong, overwhelming taste of copper in the back of my throat. The air pressure dropped so fast my ears popped, and a dull, throbbing ache settled right behind my eyes.

After 11 years and all that money wasted, I didnt even get out of the car. I put it in reverse and I left. I havent looked into the case since. Im done.

We are hardwired to recognize patterns to feel safe. We rely on the absolute certainty that the physical objects around us are blind and deaf and dead. Wood burns, glass breaks, gravity pulls down.

But there are things currently resting on this planet right now that do not follow our physics. They are dense, they are quiet, and they are incredibly patient. I'm sure the military knows it, the scientific community knows it, and the Betz family found out the hard way.

I have been writing since I was 15 (since the lockdown basically) and this is my first official book. The genre is crime fiction. It is the first draft and I would love a review of it because I don't know how good it is I just want to know what improvements I should make, what needs work. All I can say it's better than my previous writing: 

  
Chapter One

 

He knew he should move, but he just lay there on one knee, bent over. Sweat dripped down his nose and he moved a shaking hand hastily across his face, accidentally moving it too fast and ruffling some hairs at the front which caused them to break off from their set pattern and hover just a bit away from his forehead. He kept staring at the uncut grass, gun arm resting on the knee and blinking for no apparent reason, knowing there were pairs of eyes trained on him, watching him. Maybe two, the others had moved on.

 ‘Here, goddamn it. You didn’t know it was gonna be a hot day?’ Lance looked up at the agent with a lavender shirt on, cap angled slightly to the side. He raised his hand to take the water bottle from him. He gulped down two heavy sips, wiped his lips with the back of his hand and said, ‘I didn’t know it would take this goddamn long, Mickey, your majesty.’ Mickey rolled his eyes as Lance got up, stretching as he took another big sip. ‘Do I need to hold up my hand and ask you how many fingers I am holding up? Do I gotta tell you we are on your last manhunt-’

  ‘Yeah yeah, shush Brooklyn.’ Lance cut him off. Mickey moved subtly, and Lance suspected the SWAT leader had contacted him through the earpiece. ‘We gotta go?’ Lance asked, and Mickey nodded. ‘We are close, I hope. Come on FBI, let’s haul ass. We catching killers today.’ By now his accent was on the loose. Lance muttered, ‘Don’t call me that,’ but Mickey had already started walking to the trees, in the direction of the farm. As he and the silent agent behind him followed, Chief James’ voice came through his headpiece. ‘Detective Lance Morissen, are you okay?’ ‘Yes sir, just dehydration,’ Lance replied hastily, eyes covering the area. He felt tenser somehow.

  ‘What is our objective?’ He asked out of the blue, and Lance did his best to convince himself the Chief didn’t ask that just to annoy him and that he did it to make sure his mind was functioning. ‘To capture the Gem Killers with as low casualties throughout the SWAT team as possible, sir.’ He adjusted the vest over his dark red shirt while hoping the Chief noticed the way he added that “sir” at the end. ‘This goes on my list of top five long manhunts,’ he muttered as he walked ahead and caught up to Mickey.

  Mickey just nodded absentmindedly as they looked at the scenery beyond the slight downward slope that led to a huge area; two big buildings on the left consisting of a house and a barn on the further end, and large patches of different crops spread out on the right. ‘Glad we evacuated the area; those two know how to cause a scene.’ Lance just shook his head slightly to express his frustration. ‘Perimeter’s secured?’ ‘Yeah, but barely. It’s-’ ‘Not as thick as it should be. If there are any cracks, these high IQ bastards will sniff it out.’

  Lance kept looking around, thinking of the few possibilities. Either they were both in one of the buildings, preferably the barn as it was bigger but the house offered more cover, or they had separated but still in the area simply because one of them had to find the way out for the both of them. ‘Morissen, Mason here,’ the SWAT leader boomed into Lance’s earpiece. He was a naturally loud guy as far as Lance knew. ‘We are regrouping before going in, you are on barn with Delta team. Perimeter has been covered.’

 ‘Yes sir,’ Lance replied and headed down towards the team. The distance wasn’t too great so Mickey and Lance separated quickly and joined their groups. Lance looked around at the team as he joined the circle, wondering if he even knew most of them. ‘No signs of movement so far, not since they ran. Escape routes will no longer be accessible to them as we have surrounded the perimeter; the sniper is officially in place too,’ Mason spoke firmly and quickly through his thick head gear. ‘We are heading into the barn, which is big so be careful. As the lead detective mentioned earlier, the duffel bag could contain weaponry so consider them heavily armed. Detective Barnes, anything to add?’

  Jack Barnes the lead detective, an inch shorter than him but bulkier, shaved face but long hair tied up in a tight bun, lavender shirt and as usual blue pants, stepped closer to the center of the circle, and that’s when Lance’s eyes fell on the person tailing him; definitely a rookie. Short blonde hair, wary green eyes, same height as Barnes, wearing a striped white shirt beneath the vest and hand on the gun at her waist with the latch unbuckled.

  ‘It’s been almost two years since I started working this case. These guys are meticulous and unpredictably careful; the laws of criminal psychology almost don’t make sense when it comes to their long-term collaboration. Their dynamic is dangerous because they are both the brains. Whatever you do, don’t hesitate to shoot if you can’t capture. Here’s to ending the case today,’ said Barnes, sharp brown eyes glancing over all of them from his thick dimpled face.

  Lance was about to question him about the new girl since no rookies were supposed to join this op, but Mason suddenly said, ‘No movement spotted in the house so far. We are moving in, detectives in the back.’ Lance took the very end of the rear alongside the new person, assumingly the potential replacement for Barnes, while Barnes himself was ahead between the two of them. Every gun was out of its holster and raised. They entered silently unlike last time that day, and the barn had an atrocious amount of space, piles of hay covering a huge section of the floor while bits and pieces of it were strewn everywhere.

  Everyone slowly spread out, Lance staying close to the door while Barnes and some others checked around the piles of hay according to the signaled orders of Mason. Some had headed up the narrow pathway that went to this second floor that cut away at the middle leaving a huge gap, presumably for feeding cattle from above. ‘First floor clear,’ Barnes reported, disappointed judging from his voice. ‘Second floor clear,’ Mason reported from above. Lance suddenly ran his eyes over the floor again, something forming in his head. ‘Checking behind the barn no-’ Loud gunfire erupted from outside cutting Mason off.

  ‘Rear squad, stay back! Rest, on me!’ Mason shouted as he and the rest of the team rushed outside, almost moving in sync and then gone in a flash of black. ‘I suppose we check behind-’ ‘Hold on,’ Lance said, interrupting Barnes. ‘Something feels off. Look at the hay on the floor.’ Barnes was more confused than Lance. ‘It’s almost everywhere, so what?’ ‘There are gaps, yes, but look at that one, isn’t it suspicious?’ Lance began to approach the ground near the beginning of the left stairwell that went up.

  The pair followed and- His heart skipped a beat as a flurry of bullets flew from below, and Barnes dropped to the floor on his back, a bullet smack in the middle of his belly and another one having carved out the side of his neck. The trapdoor swung up with a loud bang as Andrei Popov, long greasy hair and an ice-cold stare with a grin that didn’t match his face, used his free hand to keep the trapdoor open while he climbed out carefully, hand pressed on the trigger. Lance had jumped over a stack of hay and lay flat, waiting for the shooting to stop. Hoping the rookie had done the same, he was planning on what to do when the bullets finally stopped as the last in the magazine landed close to his own feet. Lance immediately stood up, popping out from behind the hay and shooting at the door before shooting at him. The first one struck the wooden wall behind him as Popov ducked; his mag almost fell from his hands. The gun suddenly clicked when Lance pulled the trigger again; it was jammed.

  With no other course of action as he was about to reload successfully, Lance rushed at him bending low, arms grabbing the waist tight. Lance slid ahead, and Popov surprisingly stood his ground, fingers wrapped tightly around the handle of the gun. Without time to get up, a fist struck the right of his lower back, hard enough to make him go down on one knee. Successfully predicting him by stretching back just in time to avoid the back of his arm, he pulled his arm while the other one kept a tight grip on his leg and delivered a blow to his stomach; Popov retaliated a second after by slamming the gun into Lance’s side.

  Knowing by now underestimating his strength was a mistake, Popov bent low as a reaction from the gut punch. Lance heard the AR-15’s mag click into place; Lance began to move, the gun’s barrel began to rise in his direction. A burst of shock froze his heart for a millisecond as a spurt of blood suddenly popped up from the side of Popov’s chest.  He jerked to a still; the machine gun snapped out of his hand and he fell, spiraling backwards with a loud, ‘Ah!’

  Out of pure shock a familiar horrifying feeling overtook Lance, forcing him to forget where he was. He turned his head so fast his neck stung yelling ‘Who-’ He stopped as the rookie stood there, blood covered hands keeping the gun up and pointed ahead where Popov had been standing. She stood in front of Barnes’ body with her back turned, now she reached for the intercom and said shakily, ‘D-detective Lisa Dale, reporting Detective Barnes and suspect Andrei Popov dead.’

He started walking faster, trying to tune his pace to his heartbeat, not knowing it’s impossible. Oddly enough no one suspected the sweat, then again it was a hot day. He was surprised the man had shown up as early as he did. One of the nurses smiled at him, young and pretty with brunette hair tied in a ponytail. He almost removed his hands from his pocket, and made an effort to smile back avoiding eye contact.

The new clothes he wore were making him uncomfortable, the buzzing in his head increasing and becoming more of a nuisance out of fear that his nervousness was showing. *Stick to the plan, stick to the plan, stick to the plan.* He was almost muttering it under his breath as he crossed the ground floor, exiting from the elevator. He felt cursed with tunnel vision, wondering how many times he looked behind his shoulder on his quest. 

He felt his fingers tug at his pants at the waist, they were too tight, this uniform. But here he was here now, and nothing could stop him or so he hoped. He swiped the card at the entrance door, and…he breathed in wonder. Clear blue sky, sounds of traffic off the highway roads. He pressed the fingers of his left hand against the keys in his pockets, while in the other pocket the scissors rested, hidden. He started walking faster, his heart racing faster than he expected at the prospect of what’s to come. Somewhere on the third floor of Granthom Medical Facility, a nurse screamed. On her first day she had found a dead body.

 

Chapter Two

 

 

‘Who is he?’ ‘That’s on a need-to-know-’ ‘For this situation it’s need-to-know!’ She said quickly, almost shouting. Chief Mathers always put her on edge. ‘It’s just another maniac as far as I know, so why?’ Calculated breathing from the other end. She was sure he was thinking of exactly how much information he should expose. ‘All I know is this comes from higher up, and that’s all I can say.’ Maggie bit her tongue on that, almost sure that he was lying. ‘Anything about what’s coming?’ ‘They say it’s gonna be bad, but that’s it. And they know who they want on it. The FBI guy.’ Maggie didn’t have time to sigh heavily, rub her eyes or swear without consequences but she wished she could.

   ‘Lance Morissen.’ ‘Yes. Heard he doesn’t cause too much of a scene anymore.’ Maggie took a beat to try to think of a better response instead of the one she already had. ‘I doubt he will be very inclined to do so. He won’t be as cooperative as you think.’ ‘Your choice, your responsibility, remember?’ His words cut sharper than they should have; he was losing his patience, Maggie suspected. ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘I will check in soon. I am counting on you to handle this efficiently.’ The call disconnected. Maggie let the phone thump down slowly, her hands now covering the lower part of her face as she stared at the 2013 calendar in her office absent mindedly, and she thought very carefully for a very long time before picking up the phone again.

Pain, one of the strange things the long and complicated race of humans ran after. Either the most deserving or undeserving feeling. That was the last thought Lance had before managing to dodge the first jab of Kevin’s fist; but his second punch came just as fast and hit him square in the left side of his gut. Lance grunted out of a mix of frustration and pain and managed to back away. Out of the corner of his eye he viewed the crowd, the thick circle in this empty space of a parking lot that was made up of the usual unfulfilled blood-lusted gas station workers and “not addicted” gamblers.

   The ex-marine in the fighting ring with him, with that sharp look in his eye and twitchy golden beard and tight blue pants, knew better than to approach him so he kept a stable stance. His name probably wasn’t even Kevin; Lance just liked to assign people names when he didn’t know them. Lance couldn’t hear them due to the earplugs, but he was sure someone was shouting about how he had a lot riding on him. He wondered if he would ever return to this place. Now he moved forward, keeping an eye on his opponent. Military guys, the very threat of their capabilities could have an effect. Lance was no weakling but he didn’t look like an Australian surfer like this guy seemed to be.

  Lance leapt into the fray again, keeping the rules in mind. First punch successfully blocked, second a fast jab straight to his chest with a bent finger as Kevin opened his arms to hit back. As Kevin stumbled, Lance stuck out his leg to trip him but Kevin out of nowhere grabbed him by his open jacket as he tripped. He was pulled off his legs and thrown to the side, disoriented in a matter of seconds and wheezing on the floor.

  Part of his mind immediately threw minor insults at him, reminding him of his recent fight with Popov too. Telling him his physical combat skills had become rusty. It was childish and stupid, yet it pissed Lance off. He jerked himself up, feeling the numb pain of the sharp sand on his arm as he did so. Exhaling heavily, he looked at Kevin who now seemed pissed. This time he was the one to charge in, and at that point Lance began to let loose a bit. No point in joining fight clubs to lose.

  They struggled against each other for a bit; it was harder for Lance as Kevin kept insisting on very close combat and Lance kept ducking or dodging, as he was aware being in separate weight classes made a huge difference. All of a sudden, he pulled back his arm and swung it at Lance’s core, which forced Lance to rush backwards. He barely got his arms crossed as Kevin pistoned a fist at him with his other hand as was his tactic. Lance managed to block it though it blew the wind out of him a little bit; he wasn’t having fun this time. He launched a kick at one of Kevin’s legs and thrust a punch so hard he accidentally caught Kevin’s nose.

   The crowd turned tense, the atmosphere of their conversation changing ever so slightly. Only one punch to the face was allowed here. Kevin was hunched a little bit, tending to his nosebleed. He expected a surprise attack and yep- a kick, assumedly to get exact revenge. The second after he had turned and hit Kevin square in the chest with force.

  Lance couldn’t help but smile just a bit; this was his favourite part. No complex military strategies, no tricks, just pure combat, skilled or unskilled. Fighting kept his mind intact, sharpened him to the point where he could think about cases as well during battle. In a heartbeat Kevin turned, crouched and charged. Lance couldn’t dodge; his reaction was slow and as he was pinned down to the ground, all of a sudden he could feel it.

  That familiar mass of frustration and desperation, mixing and bubbling up to form what he hated the most his entire life. Anger. But it wasn’t slow, it skyrocketed beyond measure. In a flash he dropped his arms and launched his forehead at Kevin’s nose, stunning his opponent. Lance carefully got up, keeping his opponent in his line of sight while a flurry of insults whirled around him, not knowing where they should be directed. It was hard not to blame himself, using an activity like this for brainstorming. But today he had to, because of what was gonna happen tomorrow.

 

\*

 

  One annoying fact about Granthom was that the weather could be unpredictable, and just like most of the time the rain made everything dreary. As Lance entered the precinct, late as usual, bag in hand, he realized the weather made no difference to the mood inside. Uncountable pairs of eyes fell on him, accusing, filled with blame and fueled by judgement. *Why am I thinking this?* His mind asked, switching to analytical mode immediately. The bag moved, and he realized his hand was slightly shaking. ‘Carry on,’ the Captain’s voice came from around the corner. Everyone began to shift back to their position, but the tension in the air didn’t evaporate. A detective on the verge of leaving had died on the job, and everyone saw him as- ‘Lance, my office. Now,’ Captain Maggie said, interrupting his thoughts.

 She was wearing all black today, as she did the majority of the time. Bright grey hair wrapped up in a bun, piercing green eyes stared out of her slowly wrinkling face. It got easier to tell her age was fifty-six as one got closer. Thunder buzzed outside as a few officers and detectives Lance hadn’t taken the time to know about passed by him as he walked forward on clean white tiles past cluttered desks. By the time he got inside her, half the floor was empty. ‘Let me guess, Mathers wants a debrief. Should I go write it up or does he want a presentation?’

  Maggie slumped down in her chair, and from the way her serious glum expression didn’t budge Lance sensed something was wrong. ‘Mathers is heading here, with a request. That half-humour shtick of yours won’t work today.’ ‘Shtick huh?’ Lance muttered for no reason. ‘I need to tell you something.’ Now she looked worried. ‘If you are having-’ ‘I am fine, just...I quit.’ He let it settle in the room. Looked around the room, the new blue chairs near him and at the shelf at the far corner of the room, her items and paperweights gathering dust. Captain Maggie leaned back in her chair a little, trying to make sense of what to say next. ‘I am gonna do the paperwork and all, definitely, but once the case is closed I am leaving.’

  ‘Does this have anything to do with what happened yesterday?’ Rationalizing. It was surprising how quickly she leapt to the question. ‘No. I have been thinking about this for a long time.’ She sighed heavily, hands softly tapping on the faded brown-orange of her desk. He glanced at the familiar dimly shining title on the desk among papers, a little cartoon bear lightweight, and an empty cup of coffee which she normally didn’t drink. “Captain Joanne Magdalene”. Very old-timey name and definitely didn’t suit her. ‘So the rumors that were circulating…’ ‘I may have hinted at it talking to Mickey. Blabbermouth must have told somebody.’ A few more seconds of silence. Maggie inhaled.

 ‘Lance…. Mathers has a case he wants to give you.’ Lance immediately began to shake his head, and Maggie’s face started its transformation to the worried mom expression. ‘La-’ ‘Don’t, okay? Why the fuck would he give me a case now of all times?’ ‘I don’t know. All I know is that he gave me a few details he wants to disclose himself, and that it’s important someone with experience take the case.’ ‘And I have the most apparently,’ Lance muttered as he exhaled, leaning backwards on the wall. Hands fidgeting in his jacket pocket, he said, ‘No. I can’t do it, I promised myself I would quit and that’s the end of it. I don’t give a shit about Mathers’ case.’

  ‘I took you into this precinct’s wing for a reason, Lance. You had nowhere else to go.’ ‘Yeah, like you or anyone else didn’t have an ulterior motive. I am not stupid, I know the role I am playing.’ Their voices no longer held back the frustration they felt about the situation. Lance suspected this would soon turn into a big argument, but out of nowhere Maggie said something sharp and undeniably true. ‘You owe me, Morissen. You have for a long time. One last case.’ Before Lance could reply, the door opened with a soft click. Police Chief Mathers entered the office. Lisa Dale, the newbie from yesterday, came in trailing Mathers.

   He held a file in his hand which he now placed on the desk. Beyond the closed blinds Lance felt as if no one else was in the building. Maggie stood up out of respect. ‘Both of you, sit down please.’ Lance didn’t know why she was here, but somewhere in his mind the answer was forming when he sat down on the left. ‘How are you feeling today, both of you?’ They both muttered a fine or good, knowing full well alternate answers would lead to the suggestion of a psych consult. ‘That’s good to hear. Captain Magdalene and I have decided that since Barnes has passed away, you two will be partners for the time being.’ Lance looked at Maggie in protest while Lisa said nothing. Maggie made direct eye contact, signaling Lance to hold his tongue.

  ‘This may be a bad time for you to hear this…’ Maggie did her best to grab Lance’s eyes again but he blocked her out of his vision. ‘But I am quitting. Yesterday was my last case.’ A tense silence ensued. Lance kept his eye contact with Mathers. Mathers put the case file down, leaned back against the front of the desk. Lance felt like he was in school again, the principal staring at him and preparing a lecture in his head. ‘Why do you want to quit? You just got back in the field, what are you going to do after this? Forensics? Psychology?’ ‘I am backing out of crime altogether. I have seen all the roads this leads to. I don’t wanna keep walking on this one.’

  ‘Not only are you experienced, you are a very skilled homicide detective.’ Mathers’ face had gone all serious now, a different kind than his usual one, ‘How can you just say you quit after all you have done? There is still a lot ahead.’ Lance cocked his head slightly to the side, taking a deep breath in. ‘You must think I am a real moron, right? You don’t think I would have thought of that? You don’t think I can’t see through-’ As soon as Mathers raised his finger and began to interrupt Lance, Maggie jumped in between. ‘Both of you, that’s enough. Lance, you-’

‘What if I had a proposition for you?’ Mathers interjected, raising his hand to signal stop without even looking at Maggie. Clenching her jaw at this power move, she had no choice but to sit back. ‘I doubt anything you say would convince me,’ Lance said, his voice low as he narrowed his eyes monotonously. ‘If you take this case, there is a shot you can get back into the FBI. Directly to a homicide unit.’ Something in Lance leaped at this, and it must have showed on his face or in his eyes. Mathers gave a slight smile, not mocking yet smug enough to be annoying. His heart beat faster as he considered this, tumbling the idea again and again in his head like clothes in a washing machine.

  ‘That depends on what it is,’ Lance said, letting the words out hesitantly, eyeing the chief as he leaned forward to take it. He suspected, knowing himself well enough, that an inner conflict had begun. ‘Does she need to be briefed on it as well?’ ‘The Chief gave me the basics,’ Lisa replied. Short and simple, Lance thought as he opened the file, we just might get along. A few seconds of flipping pages and skimming over the details, he closed the file, confused. ‘Patient Rodney Summers, escapes from Sunshine Med Facility after killing a nurse. On the loose and considered dangerous, basically a retard from what I just read. It doesn’t make sense, it’s a quick case that will boil down to a manhunt in a few days. Why me?’

  Mathers stood up, clearing his throat. ‘The Board of Evaluation demands that someone experienced should take the case, someone with the guaranteed expertise to do this quickly and bring Summers in in a matter of days. They said it had to be you.’ Lance paid attention to the emphasis on “guaranteed”. ‘Why is he important?’ ‘I have no idea. And you two don’t need to know either.’ Lance almost forgot Lisa was sitting beside him, they glanced at each other with professional awkwardness. ‘I have to leave now, but the Board has ordered for me to watch over this case. I will keep checking in, but not for long. Someone like this, you will catch him in under a week at the most.’ It felt more like an order than a suggestive example, but Lance decided not to pick on it.

   If quitting wasn’t possible today, all he had to do was finish this case as fast as possible.  ‘Morissen,’ Maggie called out to him, making Lance break out of his thoughts and realize Mathers had left. ‘You still have time today, Sunshine Facility doesn’t close visiting hours till 7:30. And remember,’ Maggie said, ‘You have to work together on this. So no solo shenanigans.’ ‘So duo shenanigans are okay?’ Lisa was surprised he hadn’t missed a beat with that reply. ‘Get out and do your job,’ Maggie said, not even bothering to look at him.",1,1771656726.0,writers,1,0.99,False

Like I have their Flask, pero it's not that high quality pati prescription glasses nila idk kung naka-isang taon yun sakin.

Pero this one, I came in without expectations and purely curiosity lang and for me masarap siya. Or idk. Iba iba naman tayo ng taste pero if you like Matcha na di super sweet and di din ganun ka-bitter, I think this is worth a try.

 Ang meter ko pag masarap ang Matcha is pag na-good mood ba ko ng araw na yun and its def a good day kasi masarap ang Matcha ko hahaha (or baka magaling yung barista na nagserve sakin haha. This one is from their MOA branch tho pala). ",2,1771656603.0,FirstTimeKo,1,1.0,False
1rak9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1rak9oc/my_first_relationship/,My first relationship,"I just went through my first breakup at the ripe age of 25. I don’t even know where to start, honestly—so I’ll start where I think the beginning is. At 23, I was 6 feet tall and 278 pounds. I decided to go back to school, lose weight, and better myself in every way I could. I developed solid study routines and worked out consistently. For the first time in my life, I felt confident. And not to sound egotistical—because trust me, I’m not (we’ll get to that later)—but I’m not a bad-looking guy. Fast forward to summer 2025. I’m 25, in the best shape of my life. I’m studying harder than ever and feel mentally sharp. I meet this girl on Hinge. Keep in mind, at this point I had never even kissed a girl, let alone gone on a real date. I had always been afraid. I struggle with pure OCD, and I used to believe that if I ever got intimate with someone, something terrible would happen to me. So I avoided it. But there I was, standing outside a barcade with the most nervous smile on my face. I was so innocent. At the time, I thought relationships were like Disney movies. When I eventually asked her out, she was hesitant at first. I could tell she wasn’t sure about me, and honestly, I was nervous too. But somehow, she said yes. I meet this girl, and I’m floored. She’s beautiful. I’m honestly shocked that I’m even on a date with her. I had low self-esteem up until that point. To make a long story short, we start seeing each other. The first date was a museum in the city. It was perfect—museum, “want to grab something to eat?”, walking around, ending with a hug goodbye. The third date was at a bar where her friend’s band was playing. That’s when I had my first kiss. The fourth date was at her apartment. You can guess the rest. Up until then, everything felt like a movie. After we slept together, I remember apologizing for how “bad” I thought I was. Wrong move, I know—but I was insecure. Now here’s where things start to shift. On our fifth date, we went clubbing with her friends—two guy friends and one of their girlfriends. We get to the bar, and she immediately runs to it and starts talking to some random guy. He brushes her hair and buys her a drink—while I’m standing right there. She hands me the drink, and we walk upstairs. I’ll never forget how that felt. We weren’t official, sure—but I had been taking her on thoughtful dates and trying to treat her well. It felt disrespectful. Like a pit opened in my stomach. Later that night, she ran out into the street without her phone. Her keys were around my neck. I also found out she got someone’s number that night. The next day, her friend texted her saying she treated me terribly. I told her that while we weren’t official, if I was going out with her, I wanted to be the one buying her drinks. She agreed and gave a half-hearted apology. After that, nothing was the same. She became hot and cold. One moment she was happy and affectionate; the next, she’d look at me like I disgusted her. Not in my head—literally disgusted. Other days she’d be energetic, always wanting to do something, like she was trying to fill a void. And then there was something subtler—but more destabilizing. She would often say, “I thought you said this,” when I knew I hadn’t. Or she would repeat something back to me in a completely different way than I meant it. I’d find myself defending words I never said or explaining basic statements over and over again. It got to the point where I started questioning my own memory. Every conversation felt like it required clarification. Every opinion needed a footnote. It was exhausting. She also had a habit of saying things at the worst possible times. Right before a movie started, she once looked at me and said, “I swear you remind me of a friend.” No context. No explanation. Just something that subtly knocked the wind out of me. Instead of enjoying the moment, I’d sit there wondering what that meant. That same pattern showed up with timing in bigger moments. On the drive to Connecticut for Halloween, completely out of nowhere, she said she didn’t know if we were compatible. She said she didn’t feel “driven” toward me. She told me she likes to feel obsessed in relationships. We were literally on our way to spend the weekend together, and suddenly I was sitting in the passenger seat questioning everything. A month later, she brings up going to get ice cream with a guy she met on Valorant—except she had mentioned this plan months earlier. She told me this an hour before a major math exam, knowing exactly how nervous I was. The timing felt almost surgical—like she intentionally picked a vulnerable moment to destabilize me. I was rattled. I failed it. I’m not blaming her for the grade—but I can’t ignore how unsettled I felt. Moments that should have been neutral or focused became arenas of emotional manipulation. And throughout the relationship, she constantly made demands. “I want a boyfriend like this, or like that,” she’d say, and I started to realize it felt completely one-sided. My needs, my efforts, my feelings—none of it seemed to matter. I would give, try to support, and meet her halfway, but she never seemed willing to do the same. She wanted a man who was proactive, decisive, confident—but she herself was extremely indecisive. I felt like I was being asked to be perfect while she imposed no standards on herself. It created this constant imbalance, a pressure cooker of expectations with no reciprocation. I tried to show up for her in ways she never did for me. I wrote her notes, sent encouraging texts, wished her good luck on interviews for her new job. I stayed attentive, thoughtful, and consistent. Meanwhile, I never got anything similar in return—not even before my big exams, when I really could’ve used support or encouragement. The effort was all mine. She still had relics of her exes all over her apartment—paintings, gifts, bags of clothes. She admitted she’d “never really been single” and moved quickly from relationship to relationship. That fast-moving nature was obvious: I met her mom really early—within the first few weeks—and her friends almost immediately, within the first five weeks. It was intense, and at the time, it felt overwhelming. Here are some things she said to me: “Do you think you’re a cuck?” “How could you be an engineer? You can’t even pass Calc 2.” “It’s not six inches. Trust me, I’ve seen six.” “It could have more girth.” “You deserve better.” “I’ve never not been in a relationship.” “I hooked up with someone a day after breaking up with my ex of 10 months.” “I used him as a therapist for my loneliness.” There’s more, but those stuck. I never felt like she truly showed up for me. For her birthday, I drove two hours to buy her a gift in another state. I brought snacks, cupcakes, decorations—the kind of effort my mom always put in for me growing up. When she opened the gift, she barely reacted. Later I saw her on Reddit looking up something like, “Is my boyfriend bad for not putting in enough effort for my birthday?” At the movies, she asked, “Is this what you had planned?” Then she cried about being ungrateful and said she wished my birthday came first so she could “show me how it’s done.” Days later, she bought me a $200 gift basket—clearly out of guilt. Looking back, the only times she did things for me were when she felt bad about her own behavior. And that birthday wasn’t an isolated incident. There was a pattern. She would often say things weren’t what she expected. When we went to Connecticut for Halloween to stay at her friend’s house, something about it wasn’t right to her. When I suggested taking her to a haunted house during the fall, her friend even commented that it was “different” that I would consider something like that—as if effort itself was unusual. When we went to the shore and it rained one of the days, she focused on the weather instead of the trip. Nothing ever seemed to simply be enough. I remember overhearing her mom on the phone once mention that she’d been given everything growing up—her job was handed to her, her college was paid for, her car was financed through her mom. She wasn’t great with money. At 24 years old, when we went to visit, her mom even handed her a credit card to use. And that’s when something started clicking for me. I had been raised to appreciate effort. If someone showed up for you, if they tried, that mattered. But with her, it felt like effort was expected—baseline. I told her one of my boundaries was that I didn’t like one-on-one hangouts with other guys. People can disagree, but that’s my boundary. Her best friend was a guy she had a brief sexual encounter with before we met. She told me that years ago he had gone down on her once, but within seconds they both felt it was weird and stopped, agreeing to remain strictly platonic. By the time I met her, he was in a committed relationship. Oddly enough, he was the only male friend of hers I actually felt respected by. On the other hand, one of her close friends openly played mind games with me. I could feel it—subtle digs, tone shifts, little tests. Eventually, she admitted she knew that friend played mind games. But nothing changed. Toward the end, she created arguments out of nothing. Once, she got upset because I wouldn’t shave. Another time, at midnight, I went to Taco Bell while she was asleep. When I came back, she woke up and got upset that I hadn’t told her. She started crying, saying my tone reminded her of a toxic ex. Five days later, she suggested a “break.” She admitted she’d compared me to her ex the entire relationship—the same ex she emotionally cheated on and later obsessed over after he dumped her. She said she liked that he mocked her and made her chase his approval. So we broke up. A month later, she asked to get coffee. I went. She told me she’d already met someone else and made out with him—but it didn’t work out. Looking back, I think I was the backup plan. I told her I couldn’t be purely platonic. I can’t go from full intimacy to nothing and pretend it’s normal. A few days later, we slept together again. Now it’s been a few weeks. She texts me with days between replies. I suspect she’s seeing that other guy and keeping me on standby. But I’m done. I’ve started healing. I’ve picked up new hobbies, started walking in the woods, spending time alone. I transferred schools. I’m dieting again. Walking again. Rebuilding again. And this time, it’s not for a relationship. It’s for me.",1,1771656546.0,relationshipproblems,0,1.0,False

1. Seems like we will get a school festival that display students wearing cosplay costume. Which I believe Suzune might be anticipating it. I'm hoping Suzune can wear one too 🔥


2. Kiyo made statements based on npcs' remark about Ichinose & Hiyori. Seems like Kiyo was pointing out how those npcs were describing both girls based on their first impressions. And there was also a part where that npcs talked about Kaneda being Hiyori's partner & Koji didn't show any sign of being bothered/worried about their comment when the Y1 npcs mentioned about it. 


3. Koji remembered when he was put in charge of the maid cosplay in Y2. We can see Koji were thinking about his experience & would like to learn more about cosplay costume.



4. We also see how Kiyo decided to spend 30 minutes in cafe after hearing the npcs praised horikita's cuteness lol (of course, we all know he's such a noisy person & he wants to know where the conversation is headed) 😂 
Koji even make a remark about how his coffee was getting cold **(nothing big actually, it's just me noticing some small details & it's just how I perceived things)**

I’m a man of few words… but the right conversations can keep me up past my bedtime. Equal parts spreadsheets, curiosity, and random midnight Google searches about gadgets, food spots, and “how to cook this one thing perfectly.”

Life has thrown a few serious challenges my way (yes, I own more insurance policies than a typical 28-year-old 😄), but it has also made me value simple things — good food, peaceful company, inside jokes, and people who are real. I enjoy exploring underrated cafés, hunting for refurbished tech deals, cooking experiments that sometimes work, and occasionally just sitting with music and overthinking life.

Personality-wise, I’m calm on the outside, slightly chaotic on the inside. I like meaningful conversations, dark humor, and people who don’t pretend to have everything figured out. I’m introvert-friendly, comfortable with silence, and not someone who needs constant social noise to feel alive.

I’m looking for someone kind, self-aware, and emotionally honest. If you’re an introvert, have ADHD, are hot-headed, soft-spoken, or none of these — all good. Chemistry matters more than labels. I appreciate individuality, quirks, strong opinions, and people who can laugh at themselves.

No filters around caste, religion, or background — my family is multicultural and open-minded, and I value that a lot.

Looks aren’t everything, but I do have a soft spot for dusky and darker complexions — beauty comes in every shade, and confidence makes it shine brighter.

Age-wise, 22+ works, location doesn’t matter. Long conversations, shared playlists, random food plans, and building something genuine matter more than distance.

Bonus points if you:

• send reels at 2am

• get excited about food more than people

• have strong opinions about chai vs coffee

• can tolerate my occasional overthinking

• are okay with a partner who will absolutely research before buying a mixer grinder

If you’re someone who wants a peaceful, slightly nerdy, occasionally chaotic but sincere connection — we might get along.

Some random dude in the corner is holding court like he's the main character. Everyone's laughing. People lean in when he talks. He's not the hottest person there. Not the richest. Not even the loudest. But everyone wants to be around him.

What the hell does he have that you don't?

I spent way too much time figuring this out. Read books like ""[The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/07lcoltE)"" by Olivia Fox Cabane (Stanford lecturer, worked with execs at Google and HP, this book is insanely good), watched hours of Charisma on Command breakdowns on YouTube, listened to podcasts interviewing everyone from magicians to CIA agents about influence. Turns out, charm isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a learnable skill. And most people get it completely wrong.

Here's what actually works.

# Step 1: Stop Trying to Be Interesting

This is where most people fuck up. They think charm means being the most interesting person in the room. Wrong. Dead wrong.

Charm is about making OTHER people feel interesting. When you're genuinely curious about someone, when you actually listen instead of waiting for your turn to talk, something shifts. People remember how you made them feel, not what clever story you told.

**The trick:** Ask questions that make people light up. Not boring shit like ""what do you do?"" Ask stuff like ""what's been keeping you up at night lately?"" or ""what's something you're nerding out about right now?"" Then shut up and actually listen. Don't interrupt. Don't one-up their story. Just be present.

Robert Greene talks about this in ""[The Laws of Human Nature](https://a.co/d/01NA3cpT)"". He breaks down how the most magnetic people in history weren't the ones talking the most. They were the ones who made you feel like the only person in the room when they talked to you.

# Step 2: Master the Energy Triangle

This comes straight from Olivia Fox Cabane's research. Charisma isn't one thing. It's three things working together: **presence, power, and warmth**.

**Presence** means you're actually here, not mentally somewhere else checking your phone or thinking about what to say next.

**Power** is the feeling that you can make things happen, that you have value to offer. It's not about being an asshole. It's about confidence in your own worth.

**Warmth** is showing people you genuinely care about them, that you're not a threat.

Most people max out one and ignore the others. The ""alpha bro"" has power but zero warmth. The people pleaser has warmth but no power. The distracted genius has presence issues. You need all three.

**Pro move:** Before any social situation, take 60 seconds. Stand up straight. Breathe deep. Tell yourself ""I'm here to make people feel good."" This primes all three elements.

# Step 3: Get Comfortable with Silence

Awkward silence makes most people panic. They fill it with nervous chatter or dumb comments. Charming people? They're cool with silence. They let it breathe.

When someone finishes talking, wait two full seconds before responding. This does two things: Shows you're actually thinking about what they said, and gives them space to add more if they want.

Vanessa Van Edwards (behavioral investigator, runs Science of People) has a whole YouTube series on this. She analyzed thousands of hours of social interactions. The most charismatic people use pauses strategically. It creates anticipation. Makes your words hit harder when you do speak.

# Step 4: Use the Triangle Gaze

This is stupidly simple but works like magic. When talking to someone, don't lock eyes the whole time like a serial killer. Move your gaze in a triangle: left eye, right eye, mouth. Stay on each point for 2-3 seconds.

It feels natural. Shows you're engaged. And there's research backing this up from the Journal of Social Psychology. Direct eye contact builds trust, but TOO much is threatening. The triangle keeps you in the sweet spot.

Also, when someone's talking, nod slightly. Not like a bobblehead. Just small acknowledgments. It signals you're tracking what they're saying.

# Step 5: Tell Stories That Land

Here's the thing about stories. Most people tell them wrong. They include way too many details, lose the thread, or make themselves the hero in a weird way.

**The formula:** Set the scene fast (one sentence). Build tension (what went wrong or what was at stake). Resolution (what happened, what you learned). Keep it under 90 seconds.

Matthew Dicks won multiple Moth GrandSlams (storytelling competitions) and wrote ""Storyworthy"". His technique: Every story needs a ""five-second moment"" where something changed. Not the big external event. The tiny internal shift. That's what people connect with.

**Example:** Don't say ""I climbed Mount Everest and it was hard."" Say ""At 20,000 feet, my guide asked if I wanted to turn back. For five seconds I stood there realizing I'd rather fail trying than never know."" See the difference?

If you want a more structured way to absorb all this, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from communication books, behavioral psychology research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content.

You can set a goal like ""become more charismatic as someone who gets anxious in social situations"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan specifically for that. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific struggles. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator if that's your thing. Makes the whole learning process feel less like work and more like having a conversation.

# Step 6: Match Energy, Then Lead

When you first meet someone, mirror their energy level. If they're calm and quiet, don't come in like a tornado. If they're hyped up, bring some energy.

This is called **pacing and leading**. You pace their state first (builds rapport), then gradually lead them to where you want the vibe to go. It's subtle but incredibly effective.

Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference"". He used mirroring to de-escalate armed standoffs. You're not negotiating for hostages, but the psychology is the same. Match first, then guide.

# Step 7: Give Genuine Compliments

Forget generic bullshit like ""nice shirt."" Anyone can say that.

Notice something specific and non-obvious. ""The way you explained that concept made it finally click for me"" or ""You have this energy that makes people want to open up.""

The key word is **specific**. Vague compliments feel like ass-kissing. Specific ones feel like you actually paid attention.

And here's the kicker: compliment people on things they chose or worked for, not just genetic luck. Don't go ""wow you're tall."" Say ""your presentation style is really engaging."" One is lazy, the other shows you noticed their effort.

# Step 8: Remember Names and Details

Dale Carnegie wrote ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" back in 1936 and this shit still holds up. He said a person's name is the sweetest sound to them in any language.

**Here's the hack:** When someone tells you their name, repeat it immediately. ""Nice to meet you, Sarah."" Then use it naturally once or twice in conversation. Your brain will lock it in better.

Go further. Remember one detail they mentioned. Next time you see them, bring it up. ""Hey, how'd that job interview go?"" They'll be shocked you remembered. That's charm gold.

# Step 9: Make People Feel Safe

This is the secret sauce nobody talks about. Charm is rooted in making people feel safe around you. Safe to be themselves. Safe to be vulnerable. Safe to be weird.

**How?** Don't judge. Don't gossip about others (because if you gossip TO someone, they assume you'll gossip ABOUT them). Don't make everything a competition.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that people are drawn to those who create psychological safety. When you admit your own mistakes or uncertainties first, others feel permission to do the same. That's when real connection happens.

Try this: Share something slightly embarrassing or imperfect about yourself early in conversation. Not trauma dumping. Just being real. ""I completely blanked on my presentation this morning, had to wing half of it."" Boom. You're human. They can relax now.

# Step 10: Exit Conversations Like a Pro

Nobody teaches you this, but how you leave a conversation matters as much as how you enter it.

Don't ghost mid-sentence. Don't fake getting a phone call. Just be direct and warm: ""I've got to catch up with someone, but this was great. Let's continue this later.""

Or introduce them to someone else before you leave. ""Hey, you need to meet James, he's also into hiking."" Now you've added value and made a smooth exit.

The charming person leaves people wanting more, not wondering why you bolted awkwardly.

# Real Talk

Look, you're not going to nail all of this immediately. You'll forget names. You'll interrupt people. You'll tell a story that bombs. That's fine. Charm isn't perfection.

It's the consistent practice of making people feel seen, heard, and valued. That's it. Do that enough and you'll be the person everyone gravitates toward, whether you're at a house party, a work function, or just getting coffee.

Start with one thing from this list. Master it. Then add another. In six months, you'll walk into rooms differently. People will respond to you differently. And you'll realize charm was never about being someone else. It's about being the best version of yourself while making others feel good.

1rajxa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1rajxa9/feeling_slightly_fucked_up_after_moving_back/,Feeling slightly fucked up after moving back,"Hey r/gurgaon 

I've been lurking on this and similar subs for a bit, and seen rarely any similar posts. I finally decided to put this out there because I'm genuinely struggling. I moved back from the US about a month ago; primarily for family health reasons (serious issues that required me to be here right away) and because I'm an only child with no siblings to share the responsibilities. Family is pretty important, so it was the only real choice, but the shift has hit hard already (I declined the H1B offer I got to move back). The pollution, crowds, traffic, and overall energy feel like a massive downgrade from what I had stateside, and socially, I've been feeling pretty dissatisfied, frustrated, and a bit lost.

Background on me: I went to an elite school in India growing up, so I had that exposure early on. Then studied and worked in the US (growth consulting and real estate development), went to college through COVID-the crowd was limited, and many international people around were from extremely elite backgrounds. The Indians I met in college there were also truly the crème de la crème-decent YPO/ YNG types and similar, ambitious, worldly, but rarely with real depth and drive. It wasn't always easy to build deep friendships, but it shaped my global, ambitious mindset. Here, I'm solidly middle to upper-middle class-not ultra-rich by any stretch-but I've been around that world through my experiences, work networks and deals. I'm not being classist or elitist; I just need to find people on a similar intellectual and ambition wavelength to collaborate with, grow alongside, and build real friendships. Even if it's not a perfect match on every interest, I don't want to keep feeling this messed up and out of place.

Most recently, I've been offered to join the family business in real estate, but honestly, I don't want to go down that path-not because of the work itself, but mainly because of the kind of people I'd be surrounded by day-to-day (barrier to entry in real estate is pretty low), and sometimes clients too. A lot of them come across as wealthy but crude/ unrefined in ways that don't align with me at all, and I just don't vibe with that environment. Even in the relatively ""good"" places-well-rated spots, expensive venues, upscale areas-the quality of people often doesn't feel great to me. I don't like going clubbing either; it's not my scene (been there done that in south Delhi can't even think about going to other places)

Right now, I've paused all work stuff for about a month to sort my headspace (yes I'm that fucked but also privileged enough to be able to afford this) and figure out next steps. In the meantime I stick to my usual stuff; I stay super active through lifting in my gym sessions, focusing on fitness and nutrition to keep sharp. Reading is a huge part of my routine: business, finance, productivity hacks, philosophy, art, history, religion (I'm just starting to get into world religions more deeply), a slight touch of politics (more global affairs than local drama). I thrive on thoughtful discussions-over coffee, a walk, brainstorming ideas, or even potential side hustles. I'm ambitious and want to build my own legacy business someday-something meaningful and impactful.

Personality-wise, I'm fun and chill-love house music (I've seen most of the major artists live and traveled the world for it), smoke bud sometimes, rarely drink.

I game sometimes mostly for recreation alone). My old friends are solid for casual hangs, but we've grown in different directions, and conversations rarely go deep like I need. I'm ready to put in the effort to build new circles with people who have real exposure-global experiences, curiosity, depth-without just being rich and “gavaar”.

If you’ve been through a similar returnee adjustment, or have tips, opinions, or perspectives on some things I’ve talked about, I’d love to hear them. Or if you’re in the same boat and want to chat/DM, that’s cool too—no pressure, just looking for some solidarity and real talk.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts,

For a little context we have been together for a total of 8 years and been married for 3 of those years. We had a baby 1 year ago. We’ve not been intimate since I was like 5 months pregnant, so that was middleish of 2024. We also just purchased and moved into our own house at this time, moving from his parents house about 20 mins away. I had complications and then a c section that added to this but after we had the baby and he went back to work he has just been relentlessly rude.

Freshly postpartum he was great and did everything right. He’d help me to the bathroom, made all the meals, changed all the diapers for 4 weeks and then he had to go back to work. He was a salaried manager working “40 hours” a week which without fail was more like 50-60 hours a week since he was a manager he “had” to stay and fix things since he was the only person that knew a damn thing at that place. He worked night shift and would come home anytime between 9 to midnight. Once he started working again we tried taking shifts at night so I could get some sleep, but with the stress from work and lack of sleep he started having night terrors and would wake up screaming. So I stopped waking him up for shifts and took it all on.

He has never been a super sweet or romantic guy but after I stopped working and we had the baby it seemed more like he was the one having postpartum depression. Everything was a complaint to the point of, if he was talking to me it was only to complain. At some point, about 2 months PP I started bed sharing with the baby because it was the only way for me to get sleep and allow him to get sleep for work. And he felt “kicked out” even though I had never told him to leave the room or the bed. He started sleeping on the floor at the foot of the bed and eventually got tired of that and went to sleep on the couch. He’s been on the couch since then.

As time went on his resentment only grew. I was and still sort of am in a “mama bear” mind set, baby was 10 weeks old and it was about to be Easter and I didn’t really want to go anywhere. I just wanted to stay home and not be forced to go along with other people holiday plans. Well, he was planning to go to the shooting range with people from his work, which included his female assistant manager, who I will refer to as M.  Prior I didn’t have a problem with her but several months before this he had off handed mentioned that she was having family and husband problems and needed more of a work life balance, so he adjusted her schedule to help her out. Okay, whatever.

Easter comes up and I tell him it’s messed up to go to the range on our sons first Easter and that he should be spending it with us, not people he sees everything single day and is around more than us. After a lot of arguing he gave up and said he wasn’t going to leave. Obviously, the day was ruined after that. Time goes on and nothing gets better. We argue about the dumbest things, regularly ending in screaming matches. And I mean it is something weekly. 

Eventually every day off he’d get he would be going to his parents house and spending hours there talking about our marriage to them and complaining about me. I know this for a fact. So every time his parents came around they would interrogate me about whatever he had been bringing up to them. I eventually I told him to stop talking to your parents about our marriage or I was done. I’ve never even hinted about anything negative about him to my family. They all think he’s great to me. 

He said he’d stop talking about me behind my back and we moved on. 

I’m logged in to his Starbucks app and I’ve noticed on occasion (I would get a push notification) that he’d buy a second drink, a tea when he ordered. He’s an only black coffee kind of person. So when I brought it up to him he flipped out on me saying he bought it for his male store manager and said that I was stalking / tracking him and he didn’t appreciate it. Brought it up it in several arguments that I “track” him. Literally so paranoid that I’m tracking him he wouldn’t even turn on “find my iPhone” so he could ping his AirPods because he thought I’d find a way to track him since we’re family sharing on the phones. 

I never brought it up again. Recently, in January when I saw him in the morning he had scratches all around his neck. Clearly fingernail marks. I asked him what that was and he response was just “i dont know “ later he took off his shirt to go and shower and he clear has day had a whole hand of fingernail scratches across his back. 

I know that he has a thing for this sexually. To dig your nails into him while you’re having sex. So to me that was just glaringly obvious. I didn’t say anything. 

I was planning to try and get evidence, unlock his phone and see if anything was there when I got a chance but it just never came up. Days after this he was laid off from his job (at no fault of his own) and I forgot for a while. 

Assistant Manager M would still text/call for work advice, reassurance and to gossip about what was going on a work since he was gone. I was uncomfortable with this but didn’t say anything. 

Well, the other day we went to pick up a few things from his work, I went in since I wanted to stretch my legs and as soon as she saw him (she had called him as we were on the way there to say another person was laid off, so knew that he was coming) brought him a coffee she bought for him and said “I just figured I’d get you another one, one last time. “ 

All things considered this really just ticked me off. In his call with M he found out the store manager lost his job and she said he should apply for it. And said it multiple times how great it’d be for him to be working there again because they need him and whatever else. And he was VERY insistent that he would apply for it. 

So despite me wanting to gather some sort of evidence before confronting him this put me over the edge. This morning my baby knocked over my cup of Gatorade I had sitting on the floor and it spilled. Husband freaked out and grabbed our stick vacuum and started to vacuum the wet carpet. I yelled at him to stop because it’s a vacuum… not meant for that. He screamed at me, his go to saying, “look it up” and that it can suck up water. 

In fact, he did this once before and we had to take the vacuum apart and let it dry outside because it got messed up. Well I did look it up and big surprise it cannot and is not meant for that. 

He went on a huge screaming tirade that “he’s just stupid” and thought it could do that and he specifically chose that one because it could. But I looked it up so I’m right, congrats. Asked him why he was being so rude to me and he said that I was rude first because i told him to stop and that if he electrocuted him self then he’d know he was wrong. 

Well that was my last straw. he was planning to leave the house right after that so I just plainly asked if he was sleeping with M or anyone else. And his response was just (not screaming, yelling or anything) “wtf I’ve never slept with anyone else while I’ve been with you” I explained my reasoning above for being suspicious and he had zero answers just kept repeating the same thing then asking me what he should do, because “I can’t prove I wasn’t cheating if I wasn’t doing anything” 

I said that’s not a good enough answer and I need an explanation for the scratches on his back. All he said was i dont know and I don’t have an explanation. Then he said he’d take a polygraph 🙄 do any testing I wanted, etc. I said okay get some STD testing done. On the spot he called and made an appointment for next week. Not sure if he thought that would pacify me, but regardless of the results I’m waiting for an explanation of the scratches. He said if he had an explanation for that it would be a lie because he doesn’t know where it came from. 

I sarcastically asked if our house is possessed by a demon and scratched him tf up and got the same i dont know /no explanation answer. 

When I asked him if it was appropriate to still be communicating with M, he said “probably not” 

OH. And I will add in one of our last arguments I was getting on him for never taking accountability for the things he does and always shifting gears and blaming other people or turning it around to blame me and he admitted that yes he does that, always has and is “working” on it. 

Since me accusing him we’ve basically just ignored the problem since he couldn’t get past his “i dont know”s and we were in a stalemate. Only talked to each other when we have had to. 

TLDR. 

Ive been suspicious of him cheating because we’ve not had sex in over a year, (my choice because he’s been an asshole). I’ve noticed he’s been too friendly with a female from work. I was going to try and gather evidence to prove my theory but I couldn’t help it and straight up asked him if he was. He denied it and had no explanation for things I’ve noticed in the past. Since this morning we’ve only talked when we’ve needed to and not brought up anything else.  

Not sure where to go from here. 

I’m sure I’ve forgotten things and will answer any questions if needed. ",0,1771655322.0,relationship_advice,20,0.29,False
1rajw3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewDelhi/comments/1rajw3h/feeling_slightly_fucked_up_after_moving_back/,Feeling slightly fucked up after moving back,"Hey r/newdelhi 

I've been lurking on this and similar subs for a bit, and seen rarely any similar posts. I finally decided to put this out there because I'm genuinely struggling. I moved back from the US about a month ago; primarily for family health reasons (serious issues that required me to be here right away) and because I'm an only child with no siblings to share the responsibilities. Family is pretty important, so it was the only real choice, but the shift has hit hard already (I declined the H1B offer I got to move back). The pollution, crowds, traffic, and overall energy feel like a massive downgrade from what I had stateside, and socially, I've been feeling pretty dissatisfied, frustrated, and a bit lost.

Background on me: I went to an elite school in India growing up, so I had that exposure early on. Then studied and worked in the US (growth consulting and real estate development), went to college through COVID-the crowd was limited, and many international people around were from extremely elite backgrounds. The Indians I met in college there were also truly the crème de la crème-decent YPO/ YNG types and similar, ambitious, worldly, but rarely with real depth and drive. It wasn't always easy to build deep friendships, but it shaped my global, ambitious mindset. Here, I'm solidly middle to upper-middle class-not ultra-rich by any stretch-but I've been around that world through my experiences, work networks and deals. I'm not being classist or elitist; I just need to find people on a similar intellectual and ambition wavelength to collaborate with, grow alongside, and build real friendships. Even if it's not a perfect match on every interest, I don't want to keep feeling this messed up and out of place.

Most recently, I've been offered to join the family business in real estate, but honestly, I don't want to go down that path-not because of the work itself, but mainly because of the kind of people I'd be surrounded by day-to-day (barrier to entry in real estate is pretty low), and sometimes clients too. A lot of them come across as wealthy but crude/ unrefined in ways that don't align with me at all, and I just don't vibe with that environment. Even in the relatively ""good"" places-well-rated spots, expensive venues, upscale areas-the quality of people often doesn't feel great to me. I don't like going clubbing either; it's not my scene (been there done that in south Delhi can't even think about going to other places)

Right now, I've paused all work stuff for about a month to sort my headspace (yes I'm that fucked but also privileged enough to be able to afford this) and figure out next steps. In the meantime I stick to my usual stuff; I stay super active through lifting in my gym sessions, focusing on fitness and nutrition to keep sharp. Reading is a huge part of my routine: business, finance, productivity hacks, philosophy, art, history, religion (I'm just starting to get into world religions more deeply), a slight touch of politics (more global affairs than local drama). I thrive on thoughtful discussions-over coffee, a walk, brainstorming ideas, or even potential side hustles. I'm ambitious and want to build my own legacy business someday-something meaningful and impactful.

Personality-wise, I'm fun and chill-love house music (I've seen most of the major artists live and traveled the world for it), smoke bud sometimes, rarely drink.

I game sometimes mostly for recreation alone). My old friends are solid for casual hangs, but we've grown in different directions, and conversations rarely go deep like I need. I'm ready to put in the effort to build new circles with people who have real exposure-global experiences, curiosity, depth-without just being rich and “gavaar”.

If you’ve been through a similar returnee adjustment, or have tips, opinions, or perspectives on some things I’ve talked about, I’d love to hear them. Or if you’re in the same boat and want to chat/DM, that’s cool too—no pressure, just looking for some solidarity and real talk.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts,

1rajv9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1rajv9b/cholesterol_increasing_after_9_months_of_improved/,Cholesterol increasing after 9 months of improved diet,"Hi, I'm a 38 year-old male who exercises frequently, both weight training and cardio and am quite fit. I've had to start hypertension medication in the past year and am currently on 5mg of ramipril that might need to be increased. I have a family history of hypertension and high cholesterol.

9 months ago I did a blood test and my cholesterol numbers were high: Total cholesterol was 224 and LDL was 160. The specialist treating my hypertension wasn't super concerned and I was already active but improved my diet, cutting out cheese and medium ground beef that I was eating quite a lot of, switching from full fat milk with my oats and coffee to 1% and increasing my fibre intake and eating more legumes. I've thoroughly reduced my saturated fat and meat consumption.  

After 9 months of eating well consistently and watching my saturated fat intake I did another test and the results came back at total cholesterol: 255 and LDL 180.   
I have been even more active during this period and feel and look the healthiest I've been in my life. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Seems as though I'll need to start taking a statin but was wondering if there's any explanation for the increase despite improved diet?",1,1771655197.0,Cholesterol,2,1.0,False
