1hdfkqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1hdfkqk/just_found_out_my_partners_siblings_are_getting/,"Just found out my partners siblings are getting me gifts, need ideas...","I just found out my partner's, who I \[we have discussed this\] am planning to be engaged to within the next year and a half, brother is getting me a gift for Christmas. He has a history of getting expensive/luxurious gifts for people, so I don't anticipate it being something small. 

We have never exchanged gifts before (this is mine and my partner's 3rd Christmas together, 2nd that we've been dating though) and I have no clue what to get him, nor can I afford to match the quality I'm expecting from him. This also means I must get something for their sister as well, as I don't want to get a gift for one sibling and not the other. A bit about both of them below...

**Brother**: Has a fianc√© so the gift would be combined for both of them, aka looking for something a little gender neutral. Likes expensive and fancy things, makes good money so can afford to keep up with that lifestyle. Has a house and has for many years, scattered with (in my opinion... sorry) cheugy decor so think ""But First, Coffee"" signs and Rae Dunn mugs (again... sorry if that's your jam, not trying to yuck your yum). Has a dog that he loves, but his fianc√© unfortunately recently had to put hers down so maybe a sensitive subject... unless it was in honor of the dog that passed maybe? Not sure on that one.

**Sister**: A bit of a nerd, per my partner's own description of her. Has two kids, a 7 year old son and a 3 year old daughter, so maybe something they could do together? Recently divorced, not on good terms with the ex/father of the kids. Her and the kids currently live at her parents, so I'd like to avoid anything that could add clutter to the house as it is currently overwhelmingly full. Trying to avoid toys, they have far too many currently and need to unload some. Partner said she likes Shakespeare which I didn't know.

Aside from the above, I really don't know them all that well as we've only spent so much time together since I've met them.  
  
Things to note: Personalized items probably won't get here in time for Christmas (wish I knew about the gift they got me sooner so I was more prepared), so need to be mindful of arrival time for things ordered online at this point. My budget is around $75 for brother and fianc√© since they're a duo, and around $60 for the sister and potentially the kids if it's a family-centric gift. ",1,1734106137.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False

1hdfjt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1hdfjt4/if_youre_struggling_to_go_sugar_free/,If you‚Äôre struggling to go sugar free,"I(56) have been sugar free for over 4 years and i must say it has improved my health in numerous ways.

If you‚Äôre not sugar free yet, give it a shot. Its takes a few months to get used to it but well worth it.  Humans have lived sugar free lives for millions of years. So it is totally doable. Eliminating sugar improves various aspects of your life, most notably oral and metabolic health.

How to go sugar free? For most of us, going sugar free is not like quitting smoking. You can‚Äôt simply quit and move on. Sugar is everywhere. Most of us agree, sugar free means free of added sugar.  Almost everyone agrees fruits are perfectly fine to eat and are in fact beneficial. It‚Äôs safe to assume that almost every food product that comes out of the factory probably contains sugar.  Even breads, sauces,, etc. contain some added sugar. To me there are two groups of industrial products that come with added sugar: List (1) the obvious- cookies, cupcakes, candy, sugary drinks and table sugar (in coffee, frappe, etc) and List(2) trace quantities of sugars as in ketchup, breads, etc.  Goal No. 1  needs to be quitting sugar from List (1) candies, cookie etc.. Once you get there, you can decide for yourself whether you want to be rid of the rest of the sugar in your diet. What ever you do I don‚Äôt recommend quitting fruits. Quitting sugar may cause a dip in how you feel (it did for me). So, I feel fruits can give you the little spike needed to feel alive! 

So, how do you quit sugar? Well, specifically how did I quit sugar? I used what I call a windowing method.  I woke up one morning and said I won‚Äôt consume sugar until 11 am. I keep doing that for a few weeks. Once I was comfortable with that I extended the window to 1 pm and so on. Eventually I was sugar free. I also did the same technique to quit processed foods, but that‚Äôs for a different sub.

So there you go, start with a small window and grow it . Eventually one day you will say ‚Äúto heck with sugar, I‚Äôm now sugar free‚Äù. Even after you consider yourself sugar free, you may sometimes eat sugar occasionally and that‚Äôs not a big deal.  I consider myself sugar free but occasionally (say, once a month) I end up taking a bite of a cookie or a candy.  Why? Because unfortunately, it‚Äôs everywhere. Navigating a grocery store or even your own home is impossible without running into sugar. So, at least for me, sugar free means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sugar free almost all the time‚Äù.  Once you start seeing the benefits of going sugar free, it is very motivating. Life is easier, fewer visits to the doctor/dentist, improvement in numerous areas. So, why not?

1) Good anecdote about him claiming it was quicker to get coffee from coffee shop on the way than to make it on arrival at the office (where he was already late)
2) Even better anecdote about him accepting a gig on the phone, writing it in his diary, then turning two weeks before and writing ""call to cancel gig in two weeks""

1hdfhut,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hdfhut/the_stranger/,The Stranger,"  My wife and I recently moved to her hometown into her childhood home. It was bigger than our old house with plenty of room for not just our two cats, but a new kitten. He was a feisty little guy, easily the most courageous of his siblings. When we brought him home, it wasn‚Äôt long before he wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the place. If there was any space we thought it was too dangerous to let him into, he would throw a hissy fit at us, annoyed that there was an untouched area that he wasn‚Äôt allowed into. All this is to say, our little guy, Rorschach, was not easily cowed. It was a little surprising to us then, when he was staring, hair up and back arched, into what was to be my wife‚Äôs office one evening. The light was on, so I don‚Äôt think there was any way he could‚Äôve mistaken anything in there for a threat. Our other cat, Tarrare, was also in the office, so we thought maybe he got spooked by her, seeing as how the little guy still hadn‚Äôt gotten completely used to the other cats. I checked the office anyway, for pests or the like, then to be thorough, I looked along the wall outside. Nothing amiss. We didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time. After all, Tarrare was completely at ease in the office.

  A few days later, we put our other cat, H√§agen-Dazs, alone in the bathroom with the hot water running. She had allergies and the steam from the shower seemed to ease her sinuses. After a short while, my wife, we‚Äôll call her RocksAnn, went to the bathroom to check on her. When she went in, she saw H√§agen-Dazs staring intently at the running water. She called her name, but she didn‚Äôt respond. Maybe the running water was too loud. She reached down to pet her, but when she did, H√§agen-Dazs flipped out, literally. She sprung up and flipped against the wall like a jack in the box popping out. I don‚Äôt know what made the poor girl so spooked. We‚Äôd done this shower treatment for her at least a dozen times before, but I guess it was the first time in the new house. Again we didn‚Äôt think much of this as all that really happened was our cat got spooked by a room she wasn‚Äôt really used to. Cats are finicky like that. H√§agen-Dazs was no different and unlike Rorschach was fairly timid and skittish. In fact I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered writing and posting anything about these two pretty mundane experiences had it not been for the next few weeks, and now I can‚Äôt help but feel there could be more to them.

   I should note how our house is situated. For the most part, it‚Äôs the usual setup of a neighbor‚Äôs house on either side and facing the street. The back though, rather than being framed by more neighbors, is lined with the town cemetery. It‚Äôs actually nice because most of our neighbors play loud obnoxious music. Not a peep from the cemetery though. Anyways, the first few weeks at the house went without incident besides those with the cats. Around the fourth week though, a few things seemed to be amiss. Little things mostly. Lights would flicker off, just for a moment, then something would be in a spot where I swear I didn‚Äôt leave it. One time I heard my wife call my name from another room, so I went to check on her.

  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, she asked.

  ‚ÄúYou called me.‚Äù I told her.

  ‚ÄúNah, your headphones must be blurring other noises.‚Äù

  Maybe. I did always wear headphones while doing most household tasks. Still, I heard her call my name clear as crystal. Could‚Äôve been she was messing with me. We did often scare each other. But that was always by cheap jump scares. Maybe she was making her scare game more convoluted but I didn‚Äôt think so. This was a woman whose humor was people falling over. She wasn‚Äôt exactly all about subtlety. Besides if she was messing with me, she would‚Äôve made sure to laugh at me about it later, but she never did. That was one of the weirder happenings. Another thing was my figurines. I collect a lot of action figure type stuff, bionicles mostly. Yes I‚Äôm twenty six years old. Most of them are pretty poseable figures and can have their limbs and heads moved every which way. Well I had a few on the kitchen table that I hadn‚Äôt put on a shelf yet. When I woke up one morning and went into the kitchen to make coffee, I barely noticed that all their heads were looking at the window that faced the cemetery. I know none of them were posed like that the day before. I don‚Äôt think my wife did that to mess with me either. It‚Äôs such a small thing that I could‚Äôve easily missed. I kinda wish we had some curtains for that window now. 

  Writing this now I also just realized when the weird goings on stopped, at least for a little while. Our house used to have central heating and a/c, but the system hasn‚Äôt been used for years, and we had no plans to start it back up again any time soon. So all the ceiling vents that had been open, we closed. It was such a small thing that I didn‚Äôt think about at the time. But that‚Äôs when all the weird happenings stopped for about a week. I pushed the past events to the back of my mind and assumed it was over. We‚Äôd more or less settled in and everything was finally smoothing out. I was content to jot the odd stuff up to the expected stress of moving into a new home. 

  My convenient illusion came to an inconvenient conclusion though, when my wife and I were woken up in the middle of the night by a terrified yelping. I got up and went to the kitchen where it was coming from. When I turned the light on I saw H√§agen-Dazs screaming and yelping and pawing at the kitchen window. I put on my shoes and went outside and looked around with my phone light. I probably should‚Äôve also carried a blunt object like a bat or something, but I never claimed to be smart now did I? Besides I assumed it would be something like another cat that set H√§agen-Dazs off. Our neighborhood had plenty of outdoor cats after all, and a similar thing happened at our old house with Tarrare. Her and a stray cat had gotten into a tiff with the window keeping them from getting at each other. Anyway I couldn‚Äôt find anything outside to warrant concern. That is until I shined the light on the window. That‚Äôs when my blood froze. On either edge of the window was a dirty handprint, and in the middle was a badly drawn happy face, also from dirt. Two dots and a semi circle. The dirt had dripped down in spots. From the left eye it looked like a tear. I did not want to be outside a second longer. I went in and made sure all the doors were locked. When I told RocksAnn what happened we decided to call the police. We told them what happened and showed them the handprints. Unfortunately for whatever reason, there were no fingerprints to examine. Whoever it was must‚Äôve been wearing gloves they said. They told us that since we weren‚Äôt in the best neighborhood, it‚Äôs possible that some kid was in our yard and trying to mess with us. There wasn‚Äôt much else they could do, so we were told to keep an eye open and call if anything else happened. We didn‚Äôt really sleep that night.

  The next couple of weeks were rough to say the least. I started finding those same dirty handprints on both of our vehicles. A couple times there was one on the living room window. We called the cops again twice, but there was still no way to trace the prints. I wanted to set up cameras but we couldn‚Äôt afford much in that department. One night I did tape my phone high on the wall facing the cemetery to record all night. Nothing. Things came to a head on a Saturday night. We were just about to fall asleep, when I heard something that froze my blood. A knock. At the back door. Well not quite a knock. More like a slap. I got up and put on my robe. Quietly as I could, I inched to the front door. RocksAnn waited for me in the living room. I put my ear close to the back door, waiting. In spite of me wearing a fairly thick robe, it felt so cold. I know we hadn‚Äôt insulated the back door but still, the cold air was thick and almost made it hard to breathe. Even though I was expecting it, I still almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the slap again. The hand, or what I assumed was the hand, slid against the door. Almost like a cat pawing, but slower and more rough. And also more‚Ä¶deliberate. The doorknob remained undisturbed. I motioned away from the door as silently as I could. My hand found a hammer that I still hadn‚Äôt found a place in the house for. The stranger pawed at the door once more. That‚Äôs about when I heard the stranger‚Äôs voice, only it wasn‚Äôt a stranger‚Äôs voice. It was my wife‚Äôs voice on the other side of the door.

  ‚ÄúH-Hel-lo?‚Äù, said the stranger. I was not about to answer back. The way their greeting was spoken sounded breathy. Almost like a whispered hiss. I could see RocksAnn from where I stood at the kitchen/back door. Through the darkness, I could see her face had gone ashen. I can‚Äôt imagine I looked any different. The stranger‚Äôs one word had shifted our perspective on the past few weeks. Whatever was on the other side of that door was no punk kid or vagrant. No telling if it was really a person at all. And while my wife and I said nothing to each other, the looks we exchanged affirmed that neither of us wanted to find out. After waiting for a few painfully long minutes, the stranger made a new noise. Not a slap on the door, but a knock. And then they spoke once more, now more clearly and fluently. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù It was my own voice this time. I had to cover my mouth to keep from gasping. It knocked one more time, in this case with a rhythm I used all the time: shave and a haircut. 

  Knock-knockknockknockknock. 

  Now I was starting to get pissed. It‚Äôs like it was mocking us, and not just because it was using our voices. Still, I was not about to open the door. Nor were either of us going to say a word to our would be intruder. All we could do was wait. It didn‚Äôt knock again. It didn‚Äôt repeat its greetings. All it did was breathe, loud enough to be heard by me anyway. It sounded tired. Almost like an old man whose lungs weren‚Äôt what they used to be. I hoped it couldn‚Äôt hear us breathe. For the better part of an hour I stood by the door shivering. I should‚Äôve been sweating in my thick robe. Eventually the breathing faded, and the deep chill subsided. And the room felt normal again. For a minute I thought it was over, and maybe it was. But I never claimed to be smart now did I? 

  For whatever reason, curiosity, stupidity, whatever you like, I moved my hand to the doorknob. I saw my wife shake her head at me emphatically. I mouthed a probably unconvincing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine‚Äù at her, and I opened the door and went outside. I shined my phone light through the night and saw no sign of anything. It was a quiet, still night. Peaceful even. Or at least it would be if it weren‚Äôt for the past hour. I shined my light at the still open door. On the outside was the familiar dusty handprint, slid down the door. I put my hand next to it. It was a little smaller than mine. I decided it was probably time to get back inside and lock the door. That was about when I heard a gust of wind getting louder by the second. I swore under my breath and scrambled inside and just as I was slamming the door, I felt a burst of blistering cold, dusty wind. I looked at RocksAnn. She had both hands in her hair and the most horrified look I had ever seen on her face. I tried to think, to delude myself, that maybe it was just ordinary wind, or that I‚Äôd closed the door in time. But I knew better. I‚Äôd let my curiosity get the best of me. And I‚Äôd foolishly let a stranger into our house.",1,1734105919.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I went in and made sure all the doors were locked. When I told RocksAnn what happened we decided to call the police. We told them what happened and showed them the handprints. Unfortunately for whatever reason, there were no fingerprints to examine. Whoever it was must‚Äôve been wearing gloves they said. They told us that since we weren‚Äôt in the best neighborhood, it‚Äôs possible that some kid was in our yard and trying to mess with us. There wasn‚Äôt much else they could do, so we were told to keep an eye open and call if anything else happened. We didn‚Äôt really sleep that night.

  The next couple of weeks were rough to say the least. I started finding those same dirty handprints on both of our vehicles. A couple times there was one on the living room window. We called the cops again twice, but there was still no way to trace the prints. I wanted to set up cameras but we couldn‚Äôt afford much in that department. One night I did tape my phone high on the wall facing the cemetery to record all night. Nothing. Things came to a head on a Saturday night. We were just about to fall asleep, when I heard something that froze my blood. A knock. At the back door. Well not quite a knock. More like a slap. I got up and put on my robe. Quietly as I could, I inched to the front door. RocksAnn waited for me in the living room. I put my ear close to the back door, waiting. In spite of me wearing a fairly thick robe, it felt so cold. I know we hadn‚Äôt insulated the back door but still, the cold air was thick and almost made it hard to breathe. Even though I was expecting it, I still almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the slap again. The hand, or what I assumed was the hand, slid against the door. Almost like a cat pawing, but slower and more rough. And also more‚Ä¶deliberate. The doorknob remained undisturbed. I motioned away from the door as silently as I could. My hand found a hammer that I still hadn‚Äôt found a place in the house for. The stranger pawed at the door once more. That‚Äôs about when I heard the stranger‚Äôs voice, only it wasn‚Äôt a stranger‚Äôs voice. It was my wife‚Äôs voice on the other side of the door.

  ‚ÄúH-Hel-lo?‚Äù, said the stranger. I was not about to answer back. The way their greeting was spoken sounded breathy. Almost like a whispered hiss. I could see RocksAnn from where I stood at the kitchen/back door. Through the darkness, I could see her face had gone ashen. I can‚Äôt imagine I looked any different. The stranger‚Äôs one word had shifted our perspective on the past few weeks. Whatever was on the other side of that door was no punk kid or vagrant. No telling if it was really a person at all. And while my wife and I said nothing to each other, the looks we exchanged affirmed that neither of us wanted to find out. After waiting for a few painfully long minutes, the stranger made a new noise. Not a slap on the door, but a knock. And then they spoke once more, now more clearly and fluently. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù It was my own voice this time. I had to cover my mouth to keep from gasping. It knocked one more time, in this case with a rhythm I used all the time: shave and a haircut. 

  Knock-knockknockknockknock. 

  Now I was starting to get pissed. It‚Äôs like it was mocking us, and not just because it was using our voices. Still, I was not about to open the door. Nor were either of us going to say a word to our would be intruder. All we could do was wait. It didn‚Äôt knock again. It didn‚Äôt repeat its greetings. All it did was breathe, loud enough to be heard by me anyway. It sounded tired. Almost like an old man whose lungs weren‚Äôt what they used to be. I hoped it couldn‚Äôt hear us breathe. For the better part of an hour I stood by the door shivering. I should‚Äôve been sweating in my thick robe. Eventually the breathing faded, and the deep chill subsided. And the room felt normal again. For a minute I thought it was over, and maybe it was. But I never claimed to be smart now did I? 

  For whatever reason, curiosity, stupidity, whatever you like, I moved my hand to the doorknob. I saw my wife shake her head at me emphatically. I mouthed a probably unconvincing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine‚Äù at her, and I opened the door and went outside. I shined my phone light through the night and saw no sign of anything. It was a quiet, still night. Peaceful even. Or at least it would be if it weren‚Äôt for the past hour. I shined my light at the still open door. On the outside was the familiar dusty handprint, slid down the door. I put my hand next to it. It was a little smaller than mine. I decided it was probably time to get back inside and lock the door. That was about when I heard a gust of wind getting louder by the second. I swore under my breath and scrambled inside and just as I was slamming the door, I felt a burst of blistering cold, dusty wind. I looked at RocksAnn. She had both hands in her hair and the most horrified look I had ever seen on her face. I tried to think, to delude myself, that maybe it was just ordinary wind, or that I‚Äôd closed the door in time. But I knew better. I‚Äôd let my curiosity get the best of me. And I‚Äôd foolishly let a stranger into our house.",1,1734105793.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

BTC also... likely the driver of this spike back to 2.46 it just had.. but I caution. It has to break the last high on the 4hr to break out of the bull flag that was/is forming. It came up just shy and dipped down to 2.40ish again (currently). 

MACD is rounding the bottom... there is a chance of reversal here soon.. and red bars may turn to light red bars indicating we are pulling up. Hasn't happened yet.

STOCHASTIC RSI is in the oversold zone... sittin at 7.73 and 7.29.. but hasn't made a strong crossover. It's kinda flat. It might turn up here ans begin to climb will need to see how more of today plays out. 2.20ish is the bottom of the flag formation and support. It may still tap that before a major reversal and break above the 2.47 flag top. Either way we are still in the flag zone... just a but more time needed for clarification and a better reverse signal on the daily stochastic.

Good luck!

It was so bad I wouldn‚Äôt want to go out again or talk much but I‚Äôm posting here because I think I really just need to vent, appreciate that sometimes on here someone says helpful/makes my brain think stuff. Anyway, back around on OLD and this is my third new person meet. I‚Äôm vetting way harder this time to hopefully make this less discouraging. Anyway, I don‚Äôt think men realize that if we‚Äôre meeting up with you we‚Äôve already put a ton of time into you and have literally chosen you out of hundreds and hundreds of men. I‚Äôm taking this seriously, I‚Äôm putting the time in, I don‚Äôt have any weird parameters, you can be short or chubby (or both ü§£), you don‚Äôt have to have gone to college (but yeah you need be financially good and not hate your job hopefully). I‚Äôve actually chosen you for a lot of what I‚Äôm seeing of all your many parts, like you‚Äôre already a bit special if I‚Äôm meeting you, I‚Äôve already talked to alot of other people that I didn‚Äôt choose. Also I‚Äôm putting in time in so many other ways, stay in shape, women‚Äôs clothes, make up, hair, all cost more, I‚Äôve worked hard all my life and have stability financially, mentally. So why on a meet up are you guys not trying harder? Last night‚Äôs guy came grumpy and hangry and wouldn‚Äôt eat, not flexible about changing venue (the food at venue not acceptable to him). He admitted he was hangry btw when I asked him about seeming so grumpy so yeah. I eventually said we need to get you something to eat or I‚Äôm just going to walk home. Yep, walked home. This just one example but feels like not a lot of effort to be fun/etc in general. 
No one out of 15 first meets now or before ever brought a single flower, like wouldn‚Äôt one be cool? One guy separated the bill so he could pay for his own drink rather than paying for mine. And the quick coffee only method to meet. Ugh. Like we could get a drink somewhere fun so there‚Äôs a possibility more fun. No one‚Äôs creative with ideas, and I think men should pay and it would be so nice if it was a little more exciting and effort than a coffee (gasp, buy her an appetizer if a quick drink went well). Men are dating women, we make less on the dollar, we do so much more unpaid work for the future generations. I spent $80 on average each meet just to pay for a babysitter (yeah didn‚Äôt mention it/yeah not whoever I dated business), just saying, we‚Äôre really trying out here. I wish I felt like men were making more an effort.

To give you an idea, the beans he's currently brewing are from Yemen and have notes of ""orange blossom, milk chocolate, and white grape."" We go through about 12 oz of beans per week. I think he would prefer to roast once per week, but could maybe do 2x per week. He will be roasting inside in the kitchen, and we don't have a ton of extra storage space, so machine size does play into it somewhat.

  
I think I have it narrowed down to the Behmor 2000ab or the Fresh Roast SR800, but I am open to other options. I'm unsure of which machine would be better for achieving light roasts: are air roasters or drum roasters best for light roasts?

1hdevhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1hdevhn/an_actual_unpopular_opinion/,An Actual Unpopular Opinion,"The immediate reaction is to stop engaging with the content and hide it. Why? Rote memorization fosters a fragile mindset, making it difficult to adapt to conflicting information and causing physical discomfort, such as feelings of guilt or a sense of impending doom if the belief is deeply ingrained.

To illustrate this, I will discuss a topic I do not personally feel strongly about, but one that highlights a relatively non-controversial subject, as opposed to issues of identity or conspiracy.

1. Languages naturally evolve over time due to cultural, social, and phonetic influences.
2. The method of pressing liquids dates back to ancient civilizations such as the Romans and Greeks.
3. Latin's *exprimo* and its derivatives align closely with ""expresso,"" which literally translates to ""from out of"" and accurately describes the coffee extraction process.
4. The ablative form of *exprimo* in the supine, *expresso*, directly conveys the meaning of ""pressed out,"" supporting its historical and linguistic accuracy.
5. ""Espresso"" in Italian translates to ""pressed coffee,"" but its Latin root suggests ""expresso"" as the more precise term in English.
6. The shift from *expresso* to ""espresso"" in Italian deviates from the original Latin root and meaning, reflecting localized adaptation.
7. Italian adaptations often replace ""x"" with ""s,"" as seen in examples like ""express"" becoming ""esprimere"" and ""exquisite"" transforming into ""squisito.""
8. Other examples include ""extract"" becoming ""estrarre,"" ""exclude"" turning into ""escludere,"" and ""exhale"" to ""espirare.""
9. English tends to retain the ""x"" in Latin-derived words, as seen in ""express,"" ""exquisite,"" and ""extract,"" contrasting with Italian patterns.
10. The term ""expresso"" fits English's adherence to Latin roots, unlike ""espresso,"" which reflects Italian regional adaptation.
11. Italian adaptations of foreign words often diverge significantly from their origins, as seen in examples like ""suppressor"" becoming ""soppressore."" This highlights American adherence to Latin roots, with the origin being ""suppressus.""
12. Italians criticized English speakers for using ""expresso"" while modifying countless foreign terms to align with Italian phonetics.
13. Luigi Bezzera patented the first steam-pressure coffee machine in 1901, marking the birth of espresso, though the method of pressing had been used long before as a foundation for this advancement.
14. Linguistic conformity to Italian norms, like insisting on ""espresso,"" reflects external pressures rather than organic development.
15. Historically, ""expresso"" was widely accepted and understood without resistance or mockery in English-speaking contexts.
16. English‚Äôs historical adaptations, like ""escape"" from Latin's ""excapare,"" showcase natural linguistic simplification.
17. The debate over ""espresso"" versus ""expresso"" highlights the obstacles to linguistic adaptation and cultural blending.
18. Ultimately, it does not matter, it is the insistence that one is correct over the other, despite natural localization.

However, I am likely wrong. I am just a stupid American.",0,1734104277.0,intj,9,0.5,False

I'm looking to find some Hungarian friends or other international friends in general that share the same hobbies, since I've found myself rotting and resting too much at home during weekends, for needed ""self care"". 

I spend most of my time jumping and studying for different exams so ngl I don't do much outside of school. But once in a while I do wanna do random stuff and spend healthy quality time outside of the house. 

I am aware of the situation in which if you wanna meet new people here you either go on dating apps or different parties, or school clubs, study groups. 

Though out of the blue once or twice a year I do find myself the urge to put on mascara and go clubbing to early 2010s Disney songs, parties with loud noises aren't really my place to go to  . Don't really get dating apps (bumble for friends), tried a few years back, but there's something about it that's bugging me.

What's going on with the social life here (that's not evolving around clubs and parties guys??).
Where do y'all go ? What are y'all doing ? Music sessions, jam ? Anyone wanna form a band ? Lalala. 

Anw :) girlies, boys, gays folks. Hmu if you wanna:

- Go to random places and explore random stuff on random days that we both agree on. 

- Themed friend-dates (baking, dress up and have coffee, drawing, pic nic, intepreting art pieces like we know them soulfully,  therapy talk, travelling, photoshoot day, spa days, shopping days, taking dance class together, gym day maybe etc). 

Let me know friends :)

1hdes2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hdes2y/i_fear_that_i_wont_achieve_anything_in_life/,I fear that I won‚Äôt achieve anything in life,"I thought COVID would change my life. I, 31M, moved out to North Carolina during the pandemic to try and start a life for myself. I drove for Amazon, delivering packages full time. I had a grand vision of opening up a coffee shop, a dream I‚Äôve had since high school. Down there I thought I would get into my first relationship. I now fear my 3 years of living in NC has ruined my life.

I achieved nothing. I developed absolutely zero friends, and became a shut-in. My self confidence plummeted, and now I mentally can‚Äôt get myself to work productively. I moved back to my mom‚Äôs house, and can‚Äôt get over the mental hump of being 31 and living in my mom‚Äôs basement. I see all of my friends who are either happy or content with their lives, and I‚Äôm stuck in neutral. I started a business, in the hopes of turning everything around, but I fall into the same pits of depression and procrastination and then wake up the next morning feeling like I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything. 

I‚Äôm not proud of me and where I am. I can‚Äôt get myself to think that anyone is proud of me. When I ask for help, and get help, I can‚Äôt help but think of it as a negative because I didn‚Äôt do it myself. Pride fucking sucks sometimes, but I can‚Äôt get myself out of whatever shit rut I‚Äôm in.",1,1734104015.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

It took about an hour, but I stopped and sat for a bit along the way and got a coffee and some pastries for my girlfriend on the way home.

I've got a bit of an annoying cough still, mainly from the cold I think. This weather always makes me a little phlegmy anyway. But since I'm basically a living breathing Google search for symptoms right now, I say mild cough and my mind immediately jumps to endocarditis. I'm working on this, and in my other posts, I talk about some of the techniques I've been using to get this kind of thinking under control. 

I know I don't have endocarditis. From what I've read, it's not like a cold where you're walking around telling people, ""oh it's nothing, just a touch of endocarditis.""

Goos oral health seems to be the best preventative measure which is good, because I always brush in the morning (I might have skipped a couple mornings after coming home from the hospital) and floss and brush at night (I almost never skip this and have been told I wander like a zombie to the bathroom and do this even in the most blacked out incoherent state).

However, it still has me wondering. How much should I worry about endocarditis, and what else should I be doing to prevent it? I have a fully prosthetic aortic root, valve, and ascending aorta, which I think increaes my risk more than someone who still has all their own tissue.",1,1734104001.0,valvereplacement,1,1.0,False

We are alighted in terms of our belief and we have common interest, goals and hobbies. We are attracted towards each other as well.She expressed this wish to her parents that she wanted to speak to me alone in a coffee shop as she wanted to ask some questions.

Her parents allowed her and we met without her mehram at a coffee shop

She mentioned that there were somethings that is on her mind and she wants to say it loud 
A) she wants to have oral pleasure post marriage as female pleasure is important too
B) She knows from her married friends that for a man it's simple process to reach the level of satisfaction after releasing but for a woman it takes time so she would achieve that via oral x 
C) She said she has done her research and according to the school.of thought she follows it's permissible 

After hearing this I told her surely there are ways for a husband and wife to pleasure each other such as hands etc. But I feel mouth would be not suitable due to hygienic purposes and also I would be not interested in this receiving or giving end 

After that she said she feels quite nervous as she feels she wouldn't be able to live without this
Which then made me pass a comment to her 
That why does she feel this way, when she isn't even married to which she responded that you're single man and you know sex is pleasurable act so how do you know this ? 

I said this is natural and she said that is natural too, I asked her in private if she has a past to which she took a pause and then said this question should have been asked before meeting me, now you know what I look like and you know my family so you can spread this information and make.my name ruined. She then mentioned I don't have a past and I am a virgin.

We didn't talk much after this and decided to go our respective homes 
Then she later texted me saying that 
I shouldn't share this with our.parents 
And don't tell them.about our conversations 

I do like the potential we are aligned and everything

Welcome back to the weekly /r/Coffee thread where you can share what you are brewing or ask for bean recommendations. This is a place to share and talk about your favorite coffee roasters or beans.

How was that new coffee you just picked up? Are you looking for a particular coffee or just want a recommendation for something new to try?

Feel free to provide links for buying online. Also please add a little taste description and what gear you are brewing with. Please note that this thread is for peer-to-peer bean recommendations only. Please do not use this thread to promote a business you have a vested interest in.

1hdeoc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1hdeoc0/how_to_become_a_person_again/,How to become a person again?,"TLDR: used motherhood as a mask to ignore my terrible marriage. Momming has become my entire personality but I am ready to be a whole human again. How do you develop hobbies/socialize when you're more or less home bound with 2 young children? 

I met my husband when we were in high school. He is the only partner I have ever had. Fast forward 18 years and I've spent all of my adult life trying to make him happy/ figure out how to make myself appealing or lovable to him. After the birth of our first child I had my first ""wtf. This is actually a terrible relationship"" realization. Had a major confrontation about it, he said he would do better, he didn't and instead of following through and leaving, I put all my headspace into parenting and tried to ignore the problems. Every time I would consider leaving I felt almost frozen from the gravity of my choice. I was basically a single mother but at least his income provided stability and resources that I wouldn't be able to provide with my teacher salary. Ultimately we had one more child, sheerly out of my own selfishness because I wanted one more baby. My baby is about to turn two and this last year has been one of my lowest in regard to my relationship with my husband. 

I think that I am finally on the other side of being sad/mad and am truly ready to pick up the pieces and move on with my life. I feel like an invisible person. I have no opinions. I have no hobbies. I have no style. I really do love my children and being a mother in general but I think I let it consume me to an unhealthy level. If I had to pick hobbies I would say gaming (though I haven't truly done much in the past 8 years), i like to watch tv/movies, crafty things (I got a bit into crocheting this year but it's hard to do with a toddler), hiking (I wish I could develop this interest more but now that my 7 year old is finally into it and has more stamina my toddler is a bit of a terror and it turns into lugging a 30 pound screaming person through the woods). It is complicated because I incorporate my kids in most of those hobbies and like I said I do truly love being a mom. If someone handed me a credit card and said to plan a perfect day it would all be activities that I know my kids would love and in turn I would love because I love to see them happy. I truly have no fucking idea what would do if it was a day only for me. I would probably end up sitting in a parking lot in silence sipping an iced coffee lol


So, my question is, how do I do it? How do i become a fully fleshed person with a personality and interests of their own? 

Side note, I also have no style and am in desperate need of clothes. I do not love my body (working on that) and I'm pretty sure the old and ill fitting clothes that I wear do not help. I am overweight (size 16/18) with an apron belly and I really struggle when I walk through the store imagining that the current style will work on my body. I ultimately end up buying a cheap plain colored tee and wear that until it gets ratty, rinse and repeat. Where do plus size 30 year olds shop that doesn't look matronly?

I am loving a good espresso doppio, a cappuccino or even a coffee, I believe you call it lungo - mostly the ones they serve in good Italian restaurants.  
At home I drink coffee from Nespresso so far and occasionally a cup of Jura E8 from my neighbors machine. I wonder if I would really taste a difference with a semi automatic machine:  
Im considering whether it's worth buying a Eureka Mignon Specialit√† and a Sage Bambino Plus. What is the general opinion on these products? Additionally, I‚Äôd like to know if it's possible to grind beans directly into the portafilter with the grinder for precise portioning. I plan to use only one type of bean and switch between espresso, coffee for workdays and cappuccino for weekends. Are there any user experiences or recommendations? Do I need any additional accessories to get started?

I plan to only prepare one cup at a time. Is there anything I should keep in mind? I'm not experienced enough to fully understand the difference between single and double baskets. Here's how I imagine the process:

1. Grind 18 grams of beans for an espresso, directly into the portafilter.
2. Tamp the grounds evenly with a tamper.
3. Insert the portafilter into the Bambino.
4. Press the button to start brewing.

My ex split up with me 3 months ago because basically both of us weren't able to be good partners to one another mainly due to mental health reasons. She did some stuff throughout the relationship which wasn't great, and so did I and I think I basically checked out because of that. She was going through a really hard time and I basically was not able to care for both myself and her to the standard the she wanted because of my own difficulties. 

I went no contact two months ago. She reached out once to which I was dry because it was too soon in my opinion. 

I reached out a week or so ago because honestly I very much miss her and a lot of the problems that caused the breakup on my part (prioritising the wrong things, impatience, poor mental health) have been resolved or atleast worked on to a great degree. 

We had a good conversation. She was asking questions and seemed like she wanted to talk to me. 

When we split we semi kept the door open for the future. 

I have told myself the following: sit on it til atleast after Christmas and see how this interaction made you feel. If you still feel the same, continue to build the relationship back up slowly and ask to see her for a coffee if applicable and go from there.

The first shot was the scariest. I used the lidocaine which I only think helped me mentally and maybe marginally reduced the ‚Äúpain‚Äù. And now, can you believe it? I look forward to shot day. I never in my entire life thought I would say those words. It‚Äôs truly mine melding for me.

I downloaded the Shotsy app, I paid for the premium Lose It app, and have tracked every calorie over the last month. I average about 1200 to 1300 calories a day. With some days being much lower around 1000 and some days a little higher because..  you know it is the holiday season ‚ò∫Ô∏è but I track them every day and every calorie. I also weigh myself every day just to help get an average. I am being very precise and diligent because I don‚Äôt know how long I will get the opportunity to take this medicine so I want to honor this opportunity and hopefully do it right. 

I have incorporated a variety of vitamins and supplements, mostly fiber, daily vitamin, and one for skin and hair. I‚Äôve added collagen powder to my coffee to help boost my collagen intake. And I try to get as much protein as possible all while drinking water every single hour I‚Äôm awake.

Now a month later, 16.6 pounds down, clothes are feeling less tight, shoes are feeling less tight, I get out of chairs easier. I am not so out of breath when walking longer distances. I don‚Äôt have the intense craving for food, but I do still get hungry, however I‚Äôm learning that that‚Äôs not a bad thing and eating a small meal can fill me up or at least satiate me enough to stop the hunger. 

I‚Äôm starting to think I can do this.

Side effects have been minimal. I do get dizzy or feel weak if I‚Äôve not eaten enough. I carry around protein bars and eat one when I start to feel dizzy. I have had constipation, so I take fiber supplements, both Gummies and pills. I also drink water all throughout the day. I‚Äôm starting to incorporate a small apple a day as well so hopefully it gets better. But compared to where I was a month ago and the relief my joints are starting to get, the benefits far far outweigh the minimal side effects. 

So that brings us to today, today is my first injection of 5 mg. What will it bring? More intent side effects? Maybe the return of hunger if it‚Äôs not as effective as the 2.5? Maybe the complete disappearance of hunger? I don‚Äôt know but what I do know is that I‚Äôm going to keep logging my food. I‚Äôm going to keep recording my shots and I‚Äôm going to keep traveling this journey to health. 

So for all of you out there, who‚Äôs just now starting, don‚Äôt be afraid, or be afraid, but don‚Äôt let it stop you. You are worth it and you can do this. 

Happy holidays, everyone. And thank you for this community.

I‚Äôll try to keep this brief. I‚Äôm not an inexperienced domme, I‚Äôve had multiple subs and several of those branched quite organically into findom. I was pleasantly surprised by how intense and hot it felt, how much I enjoyed walking around knowing my devoted subs were taking care of me in such a literal way, worshipping my teasing clothed pics with such abandon and so willing to pay for the chance to see me, or knowing my coffee/salon trip was thanks to them. 

I can be pretty harsh but naturally lean to gentle most of the time, and I‚Äôm definitely more vanilla than the bulk of the erotica I write for people‚ÄîI just enjoy pressing people‚Äôs buttons. I don‚Äôt want like a harem, I just want one or two subs to further explore the depth I‚Äôm discovering findom has. I‚Äôm finding it pretty hard to find the right place to do this though, and indeed the right subs. Lots seem to want more transactional shorter term arrangements, which I‚Äôm not entirely against but it isn‚Äôt what I really want. Do any of you have any advice for where to look for something like this specifically? Apologies if this post breaks any rules, I‚Äôm mostly just looking to find some community with other women who understand it better and probably have more experience than I do.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1hdeb18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1hdeb18/are_you_with_a_covert_narc_do_they_like_single/,Are you with a covert narc? Do they like single moms?,"This is a very targeted question for women married to covert narc men, so if it doesn't apply, please feel free to skip this one. 

Question: Is your covert narc really into single moms? Or, women whose marriages are in crisis?

I finally admitted to myself that my covert narc wayward husband has a real thing for lonely, needy, vulnerable single moms. Bonus points if they are in crisis. Although, his second choice is women whose marriages are in crisis. 

I thought I was crazy for years. CN never, ever befriends men. He is always running around and rescuing, all but dating (baseball games, meals out, coffee dates, celebrations, etc.), texting, taking tearful calls at odd hours with single moms in crisis, and mostly ones he works with. All while being ""too busy"" to so much as respond to a text from me. 

He really ramped up this behavior with his subordinate at work, whom he spent all of 2023 purchasing costly gifts he curated for her various celebrations, culminating with him taking her out for an insanely expensive steakhouse lunch for her birthday‚Ä¶while ""forgetting"" mine a few days earlier. And ""forgetting"" my adult son's a few weeks earlier. You see, he was too busy planning her special gifts and day. 

Here's the really weird part. CN HATES kids. When we married 20 years ago, I didn't know this. I knew he didn't want kids, but he told me he wanted to be a family with my son. Soon after marriage, it was clear he had zero interest in a relationship with my son. CN spent the next 20 years avoiding him, while I, much to my, shame, made excuses for CN. That he was tired from his workaholism. Yep. Somehow, he had energy for his single mom ""friends.""

Also, CN has a spouse-like relationship with his sister. She is almost 50 and has never dated or had a serious relationship. CN and his sister were chatting around me last year, and they started to talk about how they hated kids. Fine for her, but, um, CN is a step-father? And he hates kids? That is a problem, methinks, but it explains a lot. 

I think CN loves the idea that single moms could be vulnerable, easily manipulated, and welcome him like a hero, thanks to his love-bombing and ""generosity."" He LOVES to hand out cash and gifts (That I turned down when dating. It made me uncomfortable). Eventually, his true colors shine with these women. He withholds time, attention, communication, touch, and sex. He works 70 hours a week by choice. Eventually, you're left with nothing, wondering what the fuck you did wrong. 

In his two other longish-term relationships, he basically checked out of them entirely, and then when the women dumped him for other guys who were actually present, he was whining about how he'd been done wrong. I mean, what did he expect, when he was entirely absent, refused to communicate, and clearly disliked touch and sex?

I would like to hear your insight about this adoration of single moms‚Ä¶when he hates kids.

Straight to the point, she's just not the way she was when we initially got into the relationship. Recently we had this event in college and we clicked so many pictures and a lot of couply onces too. And she posted so many pictures of her and her other friends but only one small picture where we were standing far away. And I genuinely felt kinda sad and when I tried telling her about this she told me that she doesn't want her relatives on ig to know about us, which I totally understood but I asked her why is it that it's only and only with me and nobody else? As in she posts pictures of her and her other guy friends where they're standing close and there have been occasions where people have misunderstood them as her boyfriends and asked her too. But when we go out she has never posted a picture of us. And even when she does post something of ours it's usually just one tiny picture where we're standing far away in a collage between all other pictures with her other friends.

And untill now in the past 3 years she has never skipped a class to hang out with me or done something out of the blue, I even gave her a cute ""rescue pass"" to get her out a boring class but when it comes to her friends she just bunks class cas one of her guy friend's girlfriend broke up and they all wanted to be there for him. She bunks classes cas friends just randomly ask her to. But with me she always has some reason regarding attendance. And most of the time when she does ask to meet up it's cas she is free and it's either we meet or she straight away goes home, she doesn't wait for my class to get over so we can hangout for a while. When I told her I felt bad about this her reply was I won't post anything from now on, it's like she didn't even try to understand how I'm feeling.

She wasn't like this initially, she was this cheery person who actually wanted to be with me and spend time with me. But now it's more like she's just living her live and I'm just another person in her life.

And recently she has just been forgetting a lot of ""the tiny things"", for example I walk her to her car and wait till she takes a reverse and then we both wave and she goes, but recently she had to give a drop to one of her guy friends and she takes reverse and just leaves and there I was just looking at her drive away. It just made me feel something... And we use this app called locket where we send pictures of what we're doing throughout the day and she just doesn't send or reply because she ""forgot"". And what I hate the most is that I go to meet her and sometimes she'll be on her phone and doing something important and I wish her a goodmorning or say hello and she just says hello without even taking her eyes off her phone, I mean no matter how important it is, is it too much to just turn around and acknowledge my presence and tell me she's a little busy...

Recently I proposed an IKEA date and she was happy, and then I was like let's leave at 9 in the morning as it takes an hour to reach there, and she was like ""What are we going to do for so long? Let's leave at like 11 or 12 so I can have lunch at home and then we can go there and we can spend like 4 hourse there and leave"", it really hurt me and I told her it wasn't about going to ikea but it was going to ikea with her and spending time with her. And I told her let's eat out as I never eat out as I live in a dorm in my college and she was like haa it's fine I'll get mu lunchbox and you order what you want and I'll have a few bites. This really pissed me off and I straightaway told her why is it that when you go out with all your other friends you're okay with having outside food but when you're with me you're like this? Like legit told her let's try lemon team in our college canteen and she said no for a month saying she doesn't trust the water he uses even though we've been drinking coffee for a long long time in a bakery next to it. But then her friends told her let's go to this restaurant and she just goes with them taking them in her car blindly and eats momos there, like legit my friend got food poisoning there and I tell her that he uses the same knives for veg and non veg and uses the same oil to fry both (She's a vegetarian).

Also I love pretty earrings and I have gifted her like 20 of them of all kinds but she barely uses them, she just wears the same pair every single day and when I confronted her regarding this her reply was ""It's too much work to pick among all the jewelery I have and I'm kinda lazy so I just wear the same pair everyday"", and even on special occasions she doesn't wear the ones I gift her, and when I ask her why she didn't wear one as it would go really well with her outfit she's liike umm I felt like this one looked much better. Sometimes it just feels when she does put an effort and dresses up it's mostly to look good for everybody else and what I think doesn't even matter as according to her ""Men have a bad taste when it comes to all these"". She has even told me I'm not allowed to pick a wedding ring on my own and am suppsed to take her mom with me as she knows her taste well, I have thought a lot about this and have mixed feelings regarding this.

And among all this I don't know why but her friends are interfering in our relationship and talking shit, in the fest I mentioned above she wanted to go hang out with her friends and I went to click a few pictures with mine and we decided to catchup again in half an hour and her friends were like ""Is everything okay between you guys?"" ""Don't worry we're there for you"" and other shit....

I don't know all of this is really taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do.

But no matter what I did, I just couldn‚Äôt stick to it for longer than a few weeks. 

Well, I‚Äôm currently on month five of my weight loss journey and have lost 20 pounds. I did this by maintaining an incredibly clean and healthy diet‚Ä¶five days out of the week.

Sun-Thursday I become very strict on my health and diet. Only eat whole, heathy food that I cook myself. Hit my protein goals, don‚Äôt consume any sugar and low carbs. But on Friday and Saturday? I let myself stop caring about that stuff. I don‚Äôt track calories or macros, I let myself eat whatever junk and stuff I want. And it had worked so well for me!

I found that my problem in the past was kind of a fear of missing out factor going on. I missed the foods I used to eat and the foods I saw my friends and family eating. So I decided to let myself enjoy them, but in moderation. Only two days out of the well. At first, I ate like garbage these two days. Fast food three times a day, tons of cake and sweets. But I slowly just began preferring my healthy way of eating that I had most of the time. It was like I naturally just stopped wanting the ‚Äúbad‚Äù food once I let myself enjoy both and realize the differences. 

Now, I still give myself freedom on those two days, but recently it‚Äôs just boiled down to Starbucks for breakfast instead of black coffee, and a pizza for dinner. 

I love this lifestyle now to be honest. I feel healthy, but also don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve ruined my relationship with food. Sure, there‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôs slowed down my progress a bit (I have about 30 more lbs to lose) but this feels very sustainable for me. 

I hope you all can have success in your weight loss as well!!!",5,1734102003.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

1hde0di,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hde0di,My coffee journey,"I got into coffee brewing this year and the experience is wonderful. 

I started with a SIF but didn‚Äôt really work out well and  moved on to the mokapot. I got a cheap blade grinder at first since I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much and learnt a good lesson there.

I eventually got a Timemore C3 and that was a game changer. My brews got more consistent and tasted much better. My advice to anyone starting out or thinking about getting into this, don‚Äôt cheap out on the grinder. If you can‚Äôt afford a good grinder, get small packs of preground until you save enough for one.

I explored a couple of other methods - aeropress and french press.

I am still struggling a bit with the Aeropress but I liked the last brew I got when I switched to the metal filter instead of paper. I‚Äôll try some more and see if I can get it right.

The french press was relatively much easier to brew and almost all the cups I got were pretty good. 

I still prefer the Mokapot over anything else for now, well, except espresso. And I got myself a smaller 2 cup mokapot just for those off days when I‚Äôd like a cup just for me. 

These are my preferred top 3 beans so far 
BT French Roast, Lavazza Gusto Crema, BT Silver Oak

I plan to get into espresso once I've saved up for the grinder and machine ü§û

-You‚Äôre guaranteed $250,000 annually, tax-free, deposited in your account monthly in equal payments. No strings attached, no catch outside of this:
  
-Once a month, at a completely random time, you‚Äôll be hit with an hour of extreme bad luck.  
  
Here are the specifics:  

-This bad luck is bad, but it‚Äôs not life-threatening. Examples might include: losing your wallet, getting stuck in traffic and missing an important meeting, spilling coffee on a stranger and getting berated, having a minor car accident (nobody hurt), or suddenly getting hit with a power outage during an online test or work presentation.  
  
-The hour starts at a random time and is unavoidable once it begins. You won‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs coming.  
  
-The bad luck will not permanently ruin your life (e.g., you won‚Äôt get fired or evicted), but it can still cause major inconveniences or temporary embarrassment.  
  
-The bad luck isn‚Äôt supernatural‚Äîit follows the laws of reality. So, no meteors randomly hitting you, but if you‚Äôre walking under a ladder? Well, you‚Äôre probably tripping over a loose nail and falling into a puddle.  
  
-You cannot escape the bad luck by isolating yourself. If you lock yourself in your house for a month, something in the house will still mess with you during your unlucky hour (pipes burst, important items go missing, etc.).  
  
-The bad luck cannot be tracked or predicted. It might happen while you‚Äôre asleep, working, on vacation, or even during a critical moment in your life.

1hddryx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1hddryx/how_to_get_unbanned_from_tinder/,How to Get Unbanned From Tinder,"Getting banned from Tinder can feel like a punch to the gut, especially when you're in the middle of great conversations. Whether you've been wrongfully banned or made some honest mistakes, I'll show you exactly how to get back in the game. After helping numerous users navigate Tinder bans, I've put together this comprehensive guide with proven solutions.

# Understanding Tinder Bans

Before diving into solutions, let's get clear on what we're dealing with. Tinder uses two types of bans:

# Regular Ban

A regular ban completely blocks your access to the app. You'll see a clear message saying you've been banned, and you won't be able to log in or access your matches.

# Shadow Ban

This sneaky type of ban lets you use the app but:

* Your profile becomes invisible to others
* You stop getting new matches
* Messages often go unanswered
* The app might feel unusually slow

# Why Did Tinder Ban Your Account?

Based on my research and experience, here are the most common reasons for Tinder bans:

* **Reported by other users**: Multiple users flagging your profile
* **Inappropriate behavior**: Harassment or offensive messages
* **Bot-like activity**: Swiping too fast or using automated tools
* **Fake profiles**: Using someone else's photos or info
* **Multiple accounts**: Creating more than one profile
* **Spam**: Sending repetitive messages or promotional content
* **Age violations**: Being under 18 or lying about your age

# How to Get Unbanned from Tinder: 5 Working Methods

# 1. Submit an Appeal

This should be your first move if you believe the ban was unfair. Here's what to do:

1. Go to Tinder's Support Page
2. Select ""Trouble with Account Login""
3. Choose ""My Account Was Banned""
4. Fill out the form with:
   * Your email address
   * Phone number
   * Clear explanation of why you think the ban was wrong
5. Add supporting evidence if you have any
6. Submit and wait for a response (usually 1-3 days)

**Pro tip**: Keep your appeal professional and honest. Avoid emotional language and stick to facts.

# 2. Create a New Account (The Right Way)

If your appeal doesn't work, here's how to start fresh:

1. **Get a new phone number**
   * Contact your carrier for a new number
   * Don't use temporary SMS services - Tinder blocks them
2. **Create a new email address**
   * Use Gmail or Outlook
   * Don't link it to your old accounts
3. **Clean your device**
   * Clear Tinder app data
   * Uninstall the app
   * Restart your device
   * Download a fresh copy
4. **Use a VPN**
   * Connect to a different server location
   * Use a reliable VPN service like [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH9E2)
   * Don't switch locations too often
5. **Set up your new profile**
   * Use new photos (remove EXIF data)
   * Write a fresh bio
   * Avoid copying old profile content

# 3. Try the Browser Version

Some users have better luck using Tinder's web version. Here's the approach:

1. Use a private/incognito browser window
2. Go to Tinder.com
3. Create your account with new credentials
4. Don't link any old social media accounts

# 4. Reset Your Device ID

This method requires more technical know-how but can be effective:

**For Android:**

1. Settings ‚Üí General Management
2. Reset ‚Üí Factory Data Reset
3. Backup important data first!

**For iPhone:**

1. Settings ‚Üí General
2. Transfer or Reset iPhone
3. Erase All Content and Settings

# 5. Get a New Device

As a last resort, using a different device can help because:

* It has a fresh device ID
* No trace of your old account
* Clean slate for the app

# Preventing Future Bans

After getting back on Tinder, follow these guidelines to stay unbanned:

1. **Follow Community Guidelines**
   * Read and understand Tinder's rules
   * Stay respectful in conversations
   * Report inappropriate behavior instead of engaging
2. **Avoid Suspicious Behavior**
   * Don't swipe too quickly
   * Keep conversations genuine
   * Use recent, real photos of yourself
3. **Protect Your Account**
   * Use a strong password
   * Don't share login details
   * Keep your phone number private

# Alternative Dating Apps

If Tinder isn't working out, consider these alternatives:

* **Bumble**: Women make the first move
* **Hinge**: Focused on serious relationships
* **OkCupid**: Detailed matching system
* **Coffee Meets Bagel**: Quality over quantity
* **Plenty of Fish**: Large user base

# FAQ About Tinder Bans

**Q: Are Tinder bans permanent?** A: Usually yes, but you can appeal if wrongfully banned.

**Q: How long do Tinder bans last?** A: Most bans are permanent, but some temporary bans last 24-48 hours.

**Q: Will Tinder refund my subscription?** A: You'll need to manually cancel and request a refund.

**Q: Can I use my old photos on a new account?** A: Better not - use fresh photos to avoid detection.

# Final Thoughts

Getting banned from Tinder isn't the end of your dating journey. While the appeal process might work, having a backup plan with these alternative methods can help you get back to matching. Remember to follow the guidelines this time around to avoid future bans.

The dating world has plenty of options, and sometimes a Tinder ban might just be the push you need to try something new. Whatever you choose, stay authentic and respectful - that's the best way to find meaningful connections.

Me(M28) and my GF(38) have been together now for close to two years. We are living long distance and are separated due to Work and Academics I manage to visit her on all my days off. I proposed last month and we are moving together in the beginning of new years. 

We had an argument 3 weeks ago she was throwing a party on the weekend. After the party was over around 11PM I suggested to go to bed due to me traveling a lot and working Nightshifts I was very tired. All left but one Guy let‚Äôs call him Jake. My fianc√©e decided she wanted to stay up late and talk with Jake instead of going to bed with me. She joined me around 02:00 in the morning I told her afterwards I felt uncomfortable with her decision and think she should have called it a night aswell I mentioned I feel unease with her spending time one on one late night with another man. She told me that it‚Äôs usual for her he is always staying late and she enjoys the conversation and I don‚Äôt need to be jealous and controlling. 

Today she told me while dropping me off at the train station that one of her work buddies is coming home to her later that day in order to go over a presentation. I was left a bit puzzled and told her before that spending time with the opposite gender alone at home is a breaking a boundary for me in our relationship and if she cannot make the meeting in a public area like a coffee.

She got defensive and told me I don‚Äôt need to worry and need to trust her more. The issue is not that I don‚Äôt trust her I just am having an Issue with another man and the breaking of my boundaries.

Realistically, I can turn out a 12oz batch (\~10.5oz finished) every \~30 mins with a 5 min warm up, \~18 min roast cycle (just barely into 2c) , and the machine forcing a cool down cycle between roast that can take 10+ mins depending on ambient outdoor temp (I cool beans outside of the roaster, but machine mandates a cool cycle).  

I'd love to get into a used Allio Bullet but those are hard to come by, especially in the SE US or so it seems.  I am also struggling with spending that much cash but would  consider if it a machine popped up locally. 

I have no experience with a Fresh Roast, but after watching a few videos on line it looks like it might be faster, with no preheat needed and no extended forced cool down between roast. Could I possibly end up cranking out back to back roast faster using an SR800 with extension vs my Behmor even with the lower capacity of the SR800?

I've been using the Stanley Quencher H2.0 for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed with how it's changed my daily hydration habits. This 30 oz tumbler is a game-changer for anyone who wants to drink more water throughout the day.

The lilac color is eye-catching and adds a fun touch to my desk. I love how the narrow base fits in my car's cupholder, making it perfect for my commute. The handle is comfortable to grip, which is great when I'm on the go.

https://preview.redd.it/17pbp8wqnm6e1.jpg?width=409&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc02ffb4ec3d0d24fc05a346d5f2eb84980eb37d

The insulation is top-notch. My water stays cold for hours, even when I leave it out on my desk all day. The 3-way lid is handy - I can use the straw, drink directly, or close it completely. It's mostly leak-proof, but I wouldn't toss it in a bag without being careful.

I like that it's made from recycled stainless steel. It feels durable and doesn't hold onto flavors or smells. Cleaning is a breeze since it's dishwasher safe.

# Bottom Line

The Stanley Quencher H2.0 is a solid choice for anyone looking to up their water intake. Its size, insulation, and versatility make it worth the investment.



# Discover the Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler

I recently got my hands on the Stanley Quencher, and it's quickly become my go-to for daily hydration. This 30 oz tumbler fits perfectly in my car's cupholder, making it ideal for commutes and road trips. I love the comfortable handle and how the narrow base keeps it stable.

The insulation is impressive. My drinks stay cold for hours, even on hot days. The FlowState lid is a game-changer with its three positions. I can use the straw, sip directly, or close it completely to avoid spills.

Made from recycled stainless steel, it feels durable and eco-friendly. Cleaning is a breeze - I just pop it in the dishwasher.

While it's not completely leakproof, it's great for everyday use. The lilac color is gorgeous too. Overall, I'm really happy with my Quencher. It's helped me drink more water throughout the day.

# FlowState‚Ñ¢ Technology Lid

I really like the FlowState‚Ñ¢ lid on this Stanley tumbler. It has three handy positions that I can switch between. There's a straw opening with a seal to keep the straw in place, which is great for sipping without spills. I can also use the drink opening for bigger gulps or the full-cover position to prevent leaks. The lid twists smoothly to change positions. While it's not 100% leakproof, it does a good job keeping most spills at bay during my daily use. I've found it easy to clean too - just pop it in the dishwasher. Overall, this smart lid design adds a lot of versatility to an already solid tumbler.

# Eco-Friendly Materials

I'm impressed with Stanley's commitment to sustainability. The Quencher is made from recycled stainless steel, which is a big plus. It's durable and long-lasting, so I won't need to replace it often. This cuts down on waste. The tumbler is also BPA-free, which is great for my health and the environment. I like that it's dishwasher safe too. This makes it easy to clean and reuse, reducing the need for disposable cups. The straw is reusable as well, another eco-friendly touch. While the lid is plastic, it seems sturdy enough to last. Overall, I feel good about using this tumbler from an environmental standpoint.

# On-the-Go Hydration

Carrying this tumbler around town is a breeze. I love how the handle makes it easy to grab and go. The narrow base fits in my car's cupholder, so it's always within reach during drives. It keeps my water cold for hours, which is great for long days out. The straw is handy for sipping while walking or working. I've found the lid design smart - I can switch between straw, open drink, or closed positions as needed. It's big enough that I don't need to refill often, but not so huge that it's a pain to carry. The stainless steel feels sturdy and eco-friendly. Overall, this tumbler makes staying hydrated on busy days much easier.

# Ease of Maintenance

I found the Quencher to be a breeze to clean. The wide mouth makes it easy to scrub inside, and I can fit my hand in there with a sponge. It's dishwasher safe, which is a huge plus for me. I just pop it in the top rack and it comes out spotless. The lid does have a few nooks and crannies, but it's not too bad to clean by hand if needed. One small gripe is that the straw can be a bit tricky to scrub thoroughly. But overall, it's pretty low-maintenance. I haven't noticed any staining or lingering smells, even after using it for coffee and tea. The stainless steel seems to resist odors well. For quick cleanings between uses, a simple rinse usually does the trick.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Stanley Quencher for a while now, and it's become a constant companion in my daily life. Let's break down what I've found to be its strengths and weaknesses.

# Pros

* The insulation is top-notch. My drinks stay cold for hours, even on hot days.
* I love the 3-way lid. It's great to have options for drinking through a straw, sipping directly, or sealing it up.
* The 30 oz size is perfect. I refill it 2-3 times a day, which helps me track my water intake.
* It fits in my car cup holder, which is a big plus for me.
* The handle makes it easy to carry around.
* I'm impressed by its durability. I've dropped it a few times, and it's held up well.
* It's dishwasher safe, which makes cleaning a breeze.

# Cons

* It's not completely leakproof. I have to be careful when I toss it in my bag.
* The price is on the higher side compared to other tumblers.
* It can get scratched if you're not careful.
* Some users might find it heavy when full.

In my experience, the Stanley Quencher is a solid choice for everyday use. It keeps my drinks at the right temperature and helps me stay hydrated. While it's not perfect, its pros outweigh the cons for me. If you're looking for a reliable, well-insulated tumbler and don't mind spending a bit more, it's worth considering.

# What Customers Are Saying

I've noticed that many buyers are really happy with this tumbler. People love how well it keeps drinks cold for hours. The 30 oz size is great for all-day use, and it fits nicely in car cupholders. The handle and straw make it easy to carry and drink from. Lots of folks say it's perfect for work and daily routines.

Some users mention it's not totally spill-proof, which can be a problem when traveling. A few wished it came with leak-proof accessories. The price is on the high side, but most feel it's worth it for the quality.

Overall, customers seem pleased with the Stanley Quencher's durability, size, and how it performs. It's getting a lot of praise for helping people drink more water throughout the day.

# Lifetime Warranty: Is It Worth It?

I think the lifetime warranty on the Stanley Quencher is a big plus. It shows the brand stands behind their product. If anything breaks or doesn't work right, I can get it replaced. This gives me peace of mind.

The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship. But it doesn't cover normal wear and tear or misuse. I still need to take good care of my tumbler.

While the warranty is nice, I probably won't need to use it. The Quencher seems very well-made. It's built to last with sturdy stainless steel. I've dropped mine a few times with no issues.

Overall, I see the lifetime warranty as a nice bonus. It adds value to an already solid product.

# Conclusion

This tumbler is a solid choice for everyday use. I found it keeps drinks cold for hours, which is great for long workdays or outdoor activities. The handle and straw make it easy to carry and sip from. It fits in most car cupholders, a big plus for commuters. While it's not 100% leakproof, it's pretty reliable for most situations. The 30 oz size is perfect - I refill it 2-3 times daily. It's durable too, surviving a few drops without issue. The lilac color is lovely, though it can scratch if not protected. It's a bit pricey, but the quality makes it worth it for me. If you're looking to up your hydration game, this tumbler won't let you down.",1,1734100728.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

1hddimy,https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1hddimy/constantly_waking_up_thirsty_after_starting_going/,Constantly waking up thirsty after starting going to the GYM.,"Hello,

I had for years bad sleep quality for years and around 3 months back I saw videos about how caffeine affects the wake/sleep cycle, so I decided to completely stop it and I managed to achieve very good sleep quality just from that alone. This continued for around 2 months. What I've noticed during this time is that I also needed less sleeping time. From 8 hours I was managing to get decent sleep for just 7 or even 6 hours. Prior to this when I was frequently drinking coffee I had many days where I felt trash even after 8 hours of sleep.

Recently I decided to start going to the GYM later after work (around 8-10 PM) and immediately I noticed how my sleep quality deteriorated a lot. I use Watch GT 4 to measure my sleep quality and I've noticed how my deep sleep phase is only 1-2 hours. I go to bed around 12 PM. I keep waking up thirsty constantly and it's really annoying, as drinking water also causes waking up to use the toilet too. What's interesting is that I am waking up mostly around 4-5 AM. There are no external factors that cause it. There is no light or temperature shift or sound around the room and I am also not worried to anything in particular.

I used to have this problem before with frequent waking up, but most of the time it was happening only once around 1-3 AM and it was to use the bathroom and not so much due to feeling thirsty and even if I was thirsty literally 30-50 ml would've been enough. Now for a single night I feel like I consume 500-700 ml of water.

Of course the obvious thing to do is to drink more water during the day and the issue is I don't limit myself in any way from consuming water. I drink glass of milk and use milk for my proteins. I take two sachets of dopplehertz electrolyte extra (standard adult dose per day) [https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Doppelherz-Electrolytes-Extra-Magnesium-Electrolyte/dp/B0CLWQ5CWJ](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Doppelherz-Electrolytes-Extra-Magnesium-Electrolyte/dp/B0CLWQ5CWJ)

It has all the main salts that I expect to be losing while exercising. When I wake up in the evening I am hardly sweating, so it's not like I am losing much hydration during sleep. I also put extra salt on the meat I consume.

I've read that exercising in the morning can help and yesterday I did just that and it was very early exercise like 7-8 AM, yet somehow I had again very bad sleep in the evening, so I am not sure what exactly is causing it. Also eating too late doesn't explain it, because I had this bad habit for years and it never caused such frequent awakening. Also I try to eat around 9 PM if it's my day off.

I haven't changed anything in my routine besides going to the GYM, however I had several exercises where I was also running on the treadmill immediately after the GYM. This is to counteract the workout paradox in order to properly cause weight loss. I am sweating a lot during such runs and I burn around 500 kcal, so I suspect that maybe I need to drink around 4 sachets of electrolytes instead of just 2? I have never drank electrolytes before.

I do constant changes of the water I drink - mineral/tap (osmosis) /natural in order to avoid nutritional issues from drinking only one type of water.",0,1734100501.0,crossfit,19,0.29,False

1hddh1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1hddh1x/best_way_to_overcome_social_anxiety_according_to/,Best way to overcome social anxiety (according to chatgpt),"I discussed with chatgpt many methods of recovery from social anxiety and it came to the conclusion that this is the best one because it's the fastest working and most permanent. It is from a coach called JulienHimself on youtube, where he keeps talking about it and touting it without really going into detail how it works, probably because he wants you to buy his products. Fair enough.

He calls the process letting go, it's basically opening yourself up to feeling emotions that automatically come up while at the same time using breathing and grounding techniques and not thinking to not make it worse.

What I got from his videos is that the method goes as follows: first do exposure, then when you're triggered and anxious, ask yourself why that is so. After going as deep as you can, you then just sit with the feelings until they dissipate.

With this in mind I asked chatgpt to put out a guide on how to do this step by step practically. Here is what it came up with. I think it did a great job of putting into words things that I only had assumed I should do but wasn't sure.

\---

Here‚Äôs a practical guide to combining **exposure** with **letting go** so you can systematically reduce social anxiety and ensure the changes stick:

# Step 1: Prepare Yourself

1. **Set Your Intention:**
   * Decide why you‚Äôre doing this. Are you looking to feel comfortable speaking in groups? Handling judgment better?
   * Write it down so you can reflect on your progress.
2. **Create a Hierarchy of Triggers:**
   * List anxiety-inducing situations from least to most intense. Example:
      * Low: Saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù to an acquaintance.
      * Medium: Asking a question in a group.
      * High: Initiating a conversation with a stranger.
3. **Ground Yourself:**
   * Practice basic calming techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) before starting.

# Step 2: Exposure in Action

1. **Pick a Trigger from Your List:**
   * Start small (e.g., a ‚Äúlow‚Äù anxiety situation). Success builds confidence.
2. **Engage with the Trigger:**
   * Enter the situation mindfully, knowing that discomfort is part of the process.
   * Focus on staying present. Notice your body sensations, thoughts, or impulses.
3. **Resist Avoidance Behaviors:**
   * Avoid compensating behaviors like looking at your phone, rehearsing responses in your head, or rushing through the interaction. Let yourself be vulnerable.

# Step 3: Letting Go During or After the Exposure

1. **After the Trigger: Ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù**
   * Reflect on why the situation triggered you. Examples:
      * ‚ÄúWhy did I feel anxious saying hi?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBecause I didn‚Äôt want them to ignore me.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhy does that bother me?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôd feel unworthy if they ignored me.‚Äù
   * Keep asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù until you reach an emotional core like shame, fear, or unworthiness.
2. **Let Go of the Root Emotion:**
   * Sit with the emotion. Close your eyes and focus on the sensations it brings up (e.g., tight chest, queasy stomach).
   * Avoid overthinking. Instead of analyzing, just *experience* the feeling without resisting it.
3. **Use Breathing to Release:**
   * Take slow, deep breaths into the area where you feel tension.
   * As you exhale, imagine the tension leaving your body.
4. **Repeat if Needed:**
   * Some emotions will dissolve quickly; others might need multiple attempts.

# Step 4: Build Momentum

1. **Repeat the Trigger:**
   * Exposure works best through repetition. Once you feel the intensity lessen, move to the next item on your list.
2. **Track Progress:**
   * After each exposure, write down what you learned or felt. Did the anxiety lessen? Did you uncover any insights during letting go?
3. **Celebrate Small Wins:**
   * Acknowledge progress, no matter how small. This reinforces the habit.

# Example in Practice

**Scenario:** Ordering coffee at a caf√©.

1. **Exposure:** Walk up, order, and stay fully present in the interaction.
   * Notice thoughts like ‚ÄúAm I speaking too fast?‚Äù but don‚Äôt act on them.
2. **Letting Go:** Afterward, sit down and reflect:
   * ‚ÄúWhy was that so stressful?‚Äù
   * Answer: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to seem awkward.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBecause I worry they‚Äôll think I‚Äôm weird.‚Äù
   * Sit with the fear of being judged. Breathe deeply, let the sensation pass.
3. **Repeat:** Keep practicing at the caf√© until ordering feels routine, then move to a bigger challenge.",2,1734100373.0,socialanxiety,1,0.75,False

We have a new quartz countertop. Unfortunately, I spilled a pot of hot coffee near a seam. Within a minute, this caused part of the seam to fail and ... 1. The coffee leaked into the cabinet below and 2. about 6 inches of the seam opened slightly and I could see the coffee ooozing up

I immediately soaked up the coffee with a cloth and attempted to clean the discoloration with baking soda and a soft brush.

The contractor tried to lift the stain with hot steam and filled in the damaged part with... whatever they use (apoxy?). The area now looks rather ""tampered with"" and certainly not like it did when it was new. The discoloration from the coffee remains; however, the contractor told me ""it's not the coffee and only the natural colors in the quartz"". The contractor also suggested that the coffee leaked from another area and not the damaged seam.

I don't agree. This discoloration is not part of the veining. And, it was not there before I spilled the coffee. Also ‚Äî I looked under the counter and could see the liquid streaming from the seam area within minutes of the spill.  

The builder guarantees all work for 5 years, but is suggesting that this repair may be all that can be done. I'm sure they want to avoid replacing the counter, but... and here are the big questions..... Should a hot liquid spill damage a quartz countertop seam? Am I entitled to a replacement? There are two other seam areas (one centered at the cooktop) and I am concerned that additional spills may cause the other two seam to fail.

Thanks. I will appreciate all comments. Photo is below.

I started taking Elvanse 17 days ago. For the first 15 days, I was on 30mg. Initially, I felt a mild effect: my mind was a bit quieter, and I had a few moments of intense focus, which was very nice and promising. After those first few days, however, the positive effects seemed to vanish. Instead, I just felt jittery after taking the medication, and then even that feeling went away, leaving no noticeable benefit. Over time, I grew more and more tired each day. I slept okay and ate properly, though my appetite was reduced, and I ended up losing almost 2kg in two weeks.

Two days ago, I increased the dose to 50mg. The first day at the new dose was really good. I felt very calm, the ‚Äúradio in my head‚Äù switched off completely, and I had a very productive day at work. I didn‚Äôt sleep very well that night, but I‚Äôm not sure if that was due to the medication, since I didn‚Äôt really feel its effects by evening.

This morning, I took my second 50mg pill with high hopes. It wasn‚Äôt as noticeable at first compared to yesterday; I only felt mild effects. After lunch, I had a coffee, and then the medication kicked in properly. It feels good again. I can focus on work, and I‚Äôve already done more today than I did in the entire last week.

I‚Äôd be interested to hear if anyone else has experienced similar results.

I‚Äôm looking for a good filter coffee decoction or ready-to-drink coffee liquid that I can use for a quick and easy coffee fix. Due to job restrictions, I barely have time to brew coffee properly, so I need something instant but still gives that authentic filter coffee taste.

Here‚Äôs my coffee journey so far:

I had a Nespresso machine (a Costar machine I ordered), but I returned it after seeing headlines about Nespresso officially launching in India soon. There were rumors it might arrive in December, but I haven‚Äôt seen any updates. So, I‚Äôm holding off on buying Nespresso until it officially comes to India.

I‚Äôve already tried Zenma Coffee, but unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt enjoy their flavors.

Now, I‚Äôm considering brands like VS Mani and Tata filter coffee decoction. However, I‚Äôve read mixed reviews about Tata‚Äôs decoction and am hesitant to try it.

Can you recommend the best instant filter coffee decoction or something similar that delivers a great coffee experience? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on VS Mani or any other options I might not have considered.

Thanks in advance! Let‚Äôs make coffee life easier!

They'll lose their temper over a lukewarm coffee, a slow driver in front of them, or a train that's five minutes late. They'll huff and puff, their frustration spilling over as though the whole world is against them. But when it comes to the bigger things‚Äîthe things that really matter‚Äîthey barely even flinch. The years slipping through their fingers, the dreams they‚Äôve let wither in the corners of their minds‚Äîthey just shrug it off, as if it‚Äôs not worth a second thought. 

Maybe it‚Äôs easier that way. Maybe it‚Äôs more comfortable to get angry about the small stuff, the things we can see and touch. It‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs simple. There‚Äôs a clear target for that anger, and once it‚Äôs out, we can move on. But what happens when you start to see that the small stuff isn‚Äôt the real issue? What happens when you start to realize that the train you‚Äôre complaining about isn‚Äôt the real problem? 

Maybe the truth is, we don‚Äôt want to admit it. Maybe we‚Äôre scared to realize we‚Äôre not even on the right track. Maybe we‚Äôre scared to acknowledge that the real problem isn‚Äôt the delay or the inconvenience, but the fact that we‚Äôve spent so much time chasing the wrong destinations. The truth is, so many of us are so caught up in raging against the little inconveniences that we forget to look up and check if we‚Äôre headed in the right direction at all. 

It‚Äôs easier to get upset about the surface, the things that feel like they can be fixed, than it is to confront the deeper things‚Äîthe ones that would require us to question everything we thought we knew about where we were going. But sometimes, in the quietest moments, you realize that all the time you‚Äôve spent fuming over spilled coffee or a slow driver is just a distraction from the bigger, scarier truth: you‚Äôve been living someone else‚Äôs dream, or worse, no dream at all.

So, maybe it‚Äôs time we stop. Stop raging against the small stuff long enough to look at the bigger picture. Maybe it‚Äôs time we ask ourselves: *Are we on the right track?*",1,1734099406.0,u_Top_Check8102,0,1.0,False
