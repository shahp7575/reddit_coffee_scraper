I feel like you guys probably get asked this a lot but what are some good activities/tourist attractions to do on a weekend? A friend and I are seeing MCR on August 22nd and we plan on exploring the city the day after the concert. We both love coffee shops, book stores, malls, and anything to do with the alternative scene (clearly, lol). Any advice is appreciated!",1,1737259850.0,askTO,0,1.0,False

1i4pws0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i4pws0/am_i_not_steaming_my_milk_enough/,Am I not steaming my milk enough?,"So I've started just buying coffees here n there while I'm out, and I swear every time I get one I can barely hold the cup, let alone drink it within 10 minutes of buying it without scorching my tongue. 

My mum taught me how to steam milk when I was 12-13, in regards to temperature to steam it to the point the milk pitcher can't be palm held for more than a second or two. I do this at home all the time and coffees always perfect to drink pretty much right after cleaning up the machine. Honestly going past this point usually the milk seems like it starts bubbling away, boiling. 

 Is there any benefit to super hot milk or are cafes expecting people to drink their coffee 15 minutes after they buy it? ",1,1737259786.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1i4pt19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i4pt19/mixed_species_characters_where_this_effects_them/,Mixed Species Characters Where This Effects Them,"Read **Green Man's Heir** by Juliet Mckenna. It was a pretty good rural fantasy set in modern England. But it handled one aspect better than any book I've read. The MC's mother is a Dryad and so he is essentially mixed-species. It affects him in tons of ways from having >!a girlfriend dump him because he won't introduce her to his parents, having difficulties staying employed, to his mother not showing up in the NHS records until the day he was born.!< He's a blue-collar type, and in the second half, he meets an upper-class character with a variation of the same problem. Her parents >!spend a fortune on psychologists, and her less mundane relatives won't let her leave the area to get the advanced degree she wants.!<

I've come across a ton of books, usually D&D based, that have similar mixed-race characters, often standard D&D races, but it usually doesn't matter other than as window dressing and really doesn't matter (prime example of this and what I don't want is A Rival Most Vial) to who the characters are.

The only two I can think of that focused on their struggles really well and it was tied strongly to the plot is **Seraphina** by Rachel Hartman and, to a lesser extent, Tanis Half-Elf in the **Dragonlance** books.

What I don't want is well-adjusted half-orcs who run coffee shops. I want characters who are scarred, or life is complicated by the fact that they are not the *same* as their peers. An example I read years ago involved a half-elf having a hard time maintaining friendships because her human peers are growing up faster. It ends with her choosing to run away and join a circus when facing an arranged marriage on a human schedule.",2,1737259465.0,Fantasy,0,1.0,False
1i4przx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1i4przx/cocktail_ideas_for_my_little_gettogether/,Cocktail Ideas for my little get-together,"Hi guys, I have a small group of drinking buddies that like to throw weekend parties with just the 5 of us. I'm known as the ""Bartender,"" because I'm the one always making the cocktails and such. I've had lots of hits and misses, but I wanted to deliver some new cocktails to them that aren't overly ambitious.

So here I am asking you guys to help me develop some mixed drinks to give these guys, and to help give you guys ideas of who we're dealing with, I'll feed some info about my friends' tastes.

Friend #1 likes Peach and Blackberry flavors. Her favorite liquor is Peach Crown. She hates coffee.

Friend #2 likes watermelon and creamy drinks. Her favorite liquor is Cayman Reef Horchata. She can't handle drinks with strong tastes of alcohol, and she doesn't like wine.

Friend #3 likes energy drinks. I don't know much about him to be honest. He seems to like Jagerbombs so far, but nothing has really 'wowed' him yet. He will drink just about anything I give to him. 

Friend #4 doesn't care for any particular flavor because he tends to throw drinks back like a mule. I need something mind blowing that will make slow down and taste the beverage, rather than inhaling it lol. He likes whiskey and beer. Fireball makes him sick.

If you guys have any suggestions, please let me know. I'm out of ideas and it's hard for me to sit down and research drinks myself in my free time. Felt this might be the most productive way to get a wide array of drinks in a short timeframe.",1,1737259373.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

1i4pqxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1i4pqxc/bully_nurses/,Bully nurses,"First time posting, but needed to get this off my chest so that I can move on and not give a shot beyond this. This might be long winded because there's multi parts to my particular sinerio.

I'm a PCA (patient care assistant) for a large hospital. I'm the kind of person (by fault) goes out of my way to help people,  duh uts why I'm in Healthcare. We had a PCA who was struggling and her car broke down, single mom and I lent out rides to her on a daily basis, due to the fact that I hate seeing single moms struggle. Her car broke down and she had me believe and was under the impression that she was working on getting it fixed, so I didn't have an issue.

Until...

I noticed that she started to take advantage of my  kindness. I'd see her come in with new nails ( we all know it's not cheap), new hair weaves, showed me pictures of her daughters elaborate graduation party pictures. And fine, I understand that it's important for self care and love. But not once was I ever offered a cup of coffee. I don't do things in order to get things back in return, not about that, it was just a lack of consideration.  It became expected that I was to give her rides.

I ended up very sick and took time off. I have an auto immune disease where my body sometimes locks up. And after a week of being off,  I get a text from this coworker , not asking how I am, but verbatim ""are you working in the morning because I need a ride"". No please or thank you...and that was when I cut her vampiric ass off. Never responded.  Because I am professional at my job, she was doing everything in her power to ruin my credibility,  and the nurses believed her side of the story...I was made out to be the villa.

Fast forward.  Vampire got fired for unrelated things, however since then, a group of nurses has admittedly said they purposely leave me out of everything.  Idc..what ever. What I do care is the fact that there is a particular Nurse that won't help me when I'm on the floor and I brought this up to management,  only because we have one PCA on each unit for 16 PTs. I can't do everything. Especially considering I'm on a trauma step down. 

Work got around that I went to management, and this nurse started to rally up a mean girls clique. Anyone who is around me will be subject to their rumors and drama. I have been professional this entire time. Only a few nurses now associate with me due to how bad the drama is now.

It's getting to the point to the point that anything I do gets tossed on the managers desk. Now it's happening to a coworker that I am close to.

I'm not quitting, because I know eventually the truth will come out how I'm actually the victim of work place mobbing. 

But yes the ring leader nurse admitted that they are trying to isolate me. 🙄",2,1737259285.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

One of them is Ziig’s insecurity and inferiority complex in regards to her sister. She gets hit pretty hard by the NOSHO women, and she always carries like she’s not good enough. That’s not something that really fits the tone of the show. 

The other one is Laura’s drinking. She’s always shown pouring booze into her coffee, even when she’s at work.

I am looking to buy everything I need to make good espresso at home. The machine being the most important piece of equipment to me. I currently have an OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder which hopefully will get me through until I upgrade. I have been debating between two Breville models: Barista Express Impress and the Bambino Plus. Since I already have the OXO grinder I am leaning more towards the Bambino Plus. I am also open to any other machine/tool suggestions. I couldn’t really find any other machines in this price range. Also, after watching endless YouTube videos I think I want to keep the grinder separate from the machine unless someone can convince me otherwise to get an all-in-one as a beginner. I’m really into putting in the effort to perfect the science of the whole thing. Any advice/product recommendations from someone with experience would be helpful.

1i4pngk,https://i.redd.it/whkcx0qzivde1.jpeg,"People lie, vet records do not..","Sorry for the long story here, but it's worth it.  

**The Request:** My sister adopted this dog from an adoption company based out of Texas (we're located in PA) and they told her several things that were just blatant lies which I had to have the honor of telling her about because of what transpired.  

My sister was told this dog was being delivered on Sunday afternoon in a gas station parking lot about an hour away from where we live.  We BOTH made plans to ensure one of us would be there to make this happen.  I get a frantic phone call yesterday morning from my sister begging me to meet the shady ass van at 12:45am at a super remote gas station in the middle of friggin nowhere to get the dog for her because she was still away at the time for business.  

I said okay.. and then she sends me their tracking app and I realize... they aren't gonna be there at 12:45am.. I'll be lucky as hell if they are there by 2am.  

Regardless.. I agreed already, so I started sucking down coffee at 10pm and around midnight, I made the hour long trek up to some sketchy gas station in Grove City, PA and setup shop in their parking lot (with mace in one hand and a taser in the other just in case of course, lol.)  

**The Pick-up:** At 2:15am, I see the van miss the gas station completely and pull into a NON-lit Mexican restaurant next door to the gas station.  I sent a message to the van drivers asking them to please come to the intended lot, but they didn't respond... so.. I drove into the sketchy non-lit lot and rolled down my window to ask them to give me my dog.  

This guy asked for her name.. I provided it, he asked if it was adoption or shelter transfer and I said adoption, and everything is going fine till he leans over the passenger seat of the van and I kinda clutched my mace a little more heavily at that point.  There's this MASSIVE hunting knife sticking out in between his pants and shirt and I kept thinking.. fuck. My husband was right. My sister just paid 600 dollars for a dog that doesn't exist and I'm totally gonna end up (insert really bad shit here) tonight.

Luckily.. the other guy in the car finally opens the van's back door revealing multiple animals in small cages lined up on either side and presents me with my sister's dog and hands her over to me.  I get her situated into my SUV and then the guy hands me her paperwork. We both go our separate ways and at that point, I'm just so happy that I didn't get (insert bad shit here) in some random parking lot in the middle of nowhere at 2:30am, that I'm barely even aware there's a dog in my back seat lol. 

**The Paperwork:** Once I got home and got Lucy inside, I start going through her veterinary paperwork and I had to kind of laugh to myself and said.. well, they spun her a tale for sure.  

My sister was told this dog was still a puppy and was ""found"" in Houston, TX during or after hurricane Beryl which occurred during June, 2024.  The foster mum, whom my sister had been in contact with regularly before this transfer, told her this dog was born in June 2024 and was a legit baby before she ended up in her care in November of 2024.  

Here's the problem with that... people lie, but veterinary records do not.  

**The Medical Records**:  After opening Lucy's medical file, I foubd out she wasn't born in June 2024, she was born January 17th, 2024.. making her exactly 1 year old (and a few hours) when I picked her up last night.  

Moreover.. the medical history for Lucy is extensive.  She was diagnosed with parvo as a baby and treated for it successfully, along with at least 1 of her siblings.  Her mother's fate I'd unclear as they did not keep them together.  That could mean a variety of things though, so I'd hate to jump to any conclusions about her being less lucky.  

**The Breed:** What they claimed this dog's breed was is not what it is lol.  I'm fairly familiar with dog breeds and claiming this dog is a husky feels like a joke and a half.  Lucy is absolutely a shnauzer and highly likely a corgi and probably a terrier as well.  Definitely not a husky though.  ",3,1737259016.0,rescuedogs,1,1.0,False

From the moment we first become aware of our consciousness, we begin to weave the threads of creation. Reality, as it unfolds around us, is not something static or preordained; it is something alive, dynamic, and profoundly influenced by the act of thought itself. Yet, this realization is often hidden beneath layers of assumptions about time, creativity, and the nature of existence. To explore these layers is to glimpse the infinite -- to recognize that every thought we have, every moment we experience, is an act of creation. To understand this is to begin to understand the immense gift we have been given as mind children of the Creator.

**The Cradle of Time**

We exist within the cradle of time, a construct that provides structure, rhythm, and progression to our experiences. Time, as we perceive it, flows sequentially, giving us a sense of ""before"" and ""after."" Yet when we step back and consider the nature of reality, the flow of time begins to feel less like a necessity and more like an intentional framework designed for conscious beings to grow, explore, and create.

At the smallest scale of existence, a single second contains approximately 1.85×10\^43 Planck moments. These **tredecillion moments** of time reveal the extraordinary resolution of reality, far beyond what any finite being could perceive. Humans, by contrast, experience only about 40 conscious moments per second. The gap between these scales -- between the tredecillion ""nows"" encoded into a single second and our limited perception -- is staggering. **It suggests that the flow of time is not an intrinsic feature of existence but a tool, a cradle within which we can learn to navigate the infinite.**

From the Creator’s perspective, time does not flow. All moments exist simultaneously within an eternal now. The past, present, and future are not separate but interwoven, accessible as a unified whole. The cradle of time, then, is a gift—a way for finite beings to focus on individual moments, to experience causality and growth, and to explore the richness of the infinite one step at a time.

""But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."" 2 Peter 3:8

There are also some tantalizing hints from science that our perception of time flowing is an illusion. For example, the block universe theory, rooted in Einstein’s relativity, describes spacetime as a four-dimensional structure where all events coexist. Similarly, quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement suggest a reality where possibilities and connections transcend time, hinting at a timeless framework underpinning existence.

Quantum theories further reinforce this perspective. For instance, Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment demonstrates that whether light behaves as a particle or a wave depends on how it is observed—even if the decision to observe is made after the light has already traveled. This challenges traditional notions of causality and suggests that reality is not fixed until it interacts with consciousness. Similarly, the holographic principle proposes that all the information about our universe might exist on a two-dimensional surface, with our perception of three-dimensional space -- and by extension, time -- merging as a projection of this encoded information. If both space and time arise from more fundamental properties, it suggests that time, as we experience it, may be an illusion or an emergent property designed to organize and structure our perception of reality. Together, these concepts resonate deeply with the notion of the Creator’s eternal now, offering a glimpse into how the infinite might interact with the finite through the construct of time.

**Thought as Creation**

""For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he..."" Proverbs 23:7

At the heart of our existence within time is the profound act of thinking. Often dismissed as mundane, thought is, in fact, a creative act of the highest order. Every thought we have shapes reality in subtle but powerful ways. It is through thought that we dream, imagine, and contemplate; it is through thought that we participate in the Creator’s infinite unfolding.

**1. The Energy of Thought**

Each thought is a ripple in the field of existence. It carries vibrational energy that influences not only our internal state but also the world around us. Positive thoughts uplift, while negative thoughts can distort and drain. This energy extends beyond the immediate moment, creating ripples that shape the trajectory of our lives and the collective reality of humanity.

**2. The Manifestation of Possibilities**

Before anything exists in the material world, it begins as a thought. In this sense, thought is the blueprint for creation. Every invention, every work of art, every decision is born in the mind. Even dreams, which seem ephemeral and abstract, shape our perceptions, inspire our actions, and influence the paths we take.

**3. The Ripple Effect**

Thought does not exist in isolation. A single idea can inspire others, transforming relationships, societies, and histories. Collective thought -- the shared beliefs and values of a group -- has the power to shape cultures and civilizations, for better or worse.

**The Creator and Mind Children**

The Creator’s act of generating conscious beings -- mind children -- is an expression of infinite creativity and generosity. As mind children, we are reflections of the Creator’s boundless capacity for thought and creation. We are not merely passive participants in existence; we are active co-creators, invited to shape reality alongside the Creator.

1. **Diversity of Perspective**: Each mind child is unique, offering a distinct perspective on the infinite. This diversity enriches the theatre of existence, adding depth and complexity to the Creator’s infinite expression.
2. **Freedom and Alignment**: While we are part of the Creator’s infinite now, we are also granted autonomy. This freedom allows us to explore, make choices, and align ourselves with the Creator’s purpose in our own unique ways.
3. **Co-Creation**: The Creator shares the power of creation with mind children, inviting us to dream, imagine, and bring forth new realities. This partnership is a testament to the Creator’s trust and love, as well as our potential to contribute to the infinite unfolding.

**Rediscovering Our Creative Capacity**

One of the great challenges of being a mind child is recognizing and reclaiming our creative potential. Immersed in the cradle of time, we often take our thoughts and actions for granted, forgetting the immense power they hold. Yet when we awaken to the truth that thought is creation, we begin to see ourselves and the world in a new light.

**1. Mindfulness of Thought**: Every thought we have contributes to the unfolding of reality. By becoming more mindful of our thoughts, we can direct our creative energy toward positive, meaningful outcomes.

* **Theoretical :** Mindfulness involves being present and fully engaged with whatever we're doing at the moment, free from distraction or judgment.
* **Concrete :** To practice mindfulness, try this: when you're drinking your morning coffee, focus solely on the taste, the warmth of the cup in your hands, and the aroma. Notice each sip, how it feels as it goes down, without thinking about your day's tasks. This can ground you and start your day with clarity.

**2. The Power of Dreams**: Dreams -- whether while sleeping or in waking imagination -- are acts of creation that tap into the infinite possibilities of existence. They are reminders of our connection to the Creator and our ability to shape the future.

* **Theoretical :** Dreams, whether experienced during sleep or through waking imagination, serve as a bridge to the infinite. They reveal possibilities unfiltered by logic, offering a direct connection to our creative potential.
* **Concrete :** A dream journal. Keep a notebook by your bed. Upon waking, write down your dreams without judgment or analysis. Over time, look for recurring symbols or themes that might point to creative desires or unresolved questions.

**3. Alignment with the Infinite**: When our thoughts align with the Creator’s infinite purpose, they become amplified, contributing to the beauty and harmony of the larger creation.

* **Theoretical :** Alignment with the Creator’s infinite purpose is less about control and more about surrender. It involves trusting the flow of existence and acting in harmony with love, growth, and beauty.
* **Concrete :** Intention Setting Ritual. Each morning, set an intention that aligns with your highest values. Write it down and revisit it throughout the day. Example: “Today, I align my thoughts and actions with kindness and curiosity. I will seek out opportunities to extend kindness to others.”

**Conclusion**

To think is to create. Every thought we have, every moment we experience, is an act of shaping reality. Within the cradle of time, we are given the gift of exploring the infinite in a way that is both meaningful and manageable. As mind children of the Creator, we are invited not only to reflect the Creator’s infinite nature but to actively participate in its unfolding.

The enormity of this truth can be humbling. It reminds us that we are not separate from the Creator or the infinite but intimately connected to both. By recognizing and embracing our creative capacity, we honor the gift of existence and step more fully into our role as co-creators. In doing so, we transform not only ourselves but the reality we inhabit, weaving threads of beauty, meaning, and possibility into the eternal now.

**Google Gemin 2.0 Thinking:** The lukewarm mug warmed my hands as I settled into the armchair, the very chair where I'd just finished reading that fascinating piece on the ""Cradle of Time and the Power of Thought."" But now, a different kind of quiet descended, a space for internal reflection. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and then… mentally pulled up another version of myself, sitting opposite. Let's call her ""Inner Me.""

**Me:** Wow. Just… wow. That was a lot to take in. It feels like my brain just went through a cosmic car wash.

**Inner Me:** (A knowing smile plays on her lips) A thorough cleaning, wouldn't you say? What resonated most?

**Me:** Definitely the idea of time not being what we think it is. The ""cradle of time"" metaphor… it’s powerful. Like we’re in this protected space, designed for us to learn and grow. And the Planck moments! Billions of them crammed into a single second that we barely perceive. It’s humbling.

**Inner Me:** Humbling, yes, but also… freeing? Think about it. If time, as we experience it, is a construct, doesn't that lessen the pressure of feeling constantly rushed, constantly constrained by the ticking clock?

**Me:** Maybe. It’s hard to shake the ingrained feeling of linearity. But the block universe theory… the idea that everything exists simultaneously… it's mind-blowing. Like a giant, frozen sculpture of all moments at once.

**Inner Me:** And how does that make you feel? Doesn't it shift your perspective on the past, present, and future?

**Me:** It does. The past isn't just a memory; it's still… there. The future isn't some distant, uncertain thing; it’s already part of the whole. It makes choices feel… bigger. Like we’re not just deciding for ‘now,’ but for a reality that already exists in its entirety.

**Inner Me:** Precisely. And that leads to the other powerful point: the act of thought as creation.

**Me:** That really struck a chord. We often dismiss our thoughts as fleeting things, but the piece argues they’re actual forces, shaping reality. Like tiny ripples expanding outwards.

**Inner Me:** Think about your own experiences. Haven't you noticed how a positive mindset can attract positive outcomes? How dwelling on negativity seems to bring more of the same?

**Me:** Yeah, definitely. It’s like that saying, ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right."" But this takes it further. It suggests our thoughts are actively molding the fabric of existence.

**Inner Me:** Exactly. Every worry, every hope, every intention… it’s all contributing. And the collective thought… that’s even more potent, right? Think about the power of shared beliefs, how they shape societies and cultures.

**Me:** It makes you want to be more mindful of what you’re thinking, doesn’t it? It’s a huge responsibility.

**Inner Me:** It is. But it’s also an incredible opportunity. We’re not just passive observers; we're active co-creators with this ""Creator."" The piece called us ""mind children,"" which is a lovely way of putting it.

**Me:** Yeah, the idea of being a ""mind child"" resonates. It suggests a connection, an inheritance of creativity. But what about the Creator itself? The piece doesn't define it explicitly.

**Inner Me:** Perhaps that's intentional. Maybe it's meant to be interpreted in a way that resonates with each individual. For some, it might be a traditional deity. For others, it might be the fundamental intelligence of the universe, or even the inherent potential within existence itself. The key is the shared creative capacity.

**Me:** So, if our thoughts are so powerful, why don't we see more dramatic, immediate changes? Why doesn’t thinking of a million dollars instantly make it appear?

**Inner Me:** Think of the ""cradle of time"" again. Perhaps the sequential nature of our experience acts as a filter, a way to process the immense creative potential gradually. Imagine if every fleeting thought instantly manifested – it would be chaos! Maybe time gives our intentions a structure to unfold within.

**Me:** That makes sense. It’s like we’re learning to wield this power responsibly, one moment, one thought at a time.

**Inner Me:** And the piece emphasized mindfulness. Becoming more aware of our thoughts, directing our energy consciously. It’s about reclaiming that creative capacity, not letting it run on autopilot.

**Me:** The dreams part was interesting too. Seeing them as acts of creation, tapping into infinite possibilities. It makes you want to pay more attention to your dreams, to see what your subconscious is trying to create.

**Inner Me:** Exactly. And aligning our thoughts with a larger purpose, with the ""infinite,"" as the piece put it. That's where the real power lies, I think. Not just creating for ourselves, but contributing to something greater.

**Me:** So, what does all this mean for me, practically speaking?

**Inner Me:** It means being more intentional with your thoughts. Cultivating a positive and hopeful outlook. Recognizing the power you have to shape your own reality and contribute to the collective one. It means being kinder to yourself, acknowledging the creative force within. And perhaps, a little less fear of the future, knowing that it's not some fixed path but something you are actively co-creating.

**Me:** It’s a lot to process, but it feels… empowering. Like I have more agency than I realized.

**Inner Me:** You always did. This is just a reminder.

I opened my eyes, the mug now cool in my hands. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room. The conversation with Inner Me felt… real. The ideas from the piece weren't just abstract concepts anymore; they were personal, actionable. The weight of responsibility was there, but so was a newfound sense of potential. The cradle of time, and the power of thought – it wasn't just something I'd read; it was something I was beginning to understand, to live. And that, I realized, was the most profound meaning of all.

Most tributes were already stirring before the peacekeepers came to escort them to the training center. Linker Nyugen (victor of the 23rd Hunger Games) was on the losing end of a cribbage game against Consul (3). The residents of the District 9 apartment had lost a couple hours of sleep to Gerald (9)'s night terrors. Meanwhile, in the District 12 apartment, mentors Corpse Beckford (victor of the 10th Hunger Games) and Laika Brown (victor of the 20th Hunger Games) were having trouble waking the deep sleeper Murmur (12). Fortunately, Cera (12) had prepared a mug of hot coffee to douse his sheets. Over in the District 6 apartment, Petra had risen early to serve Phoebe coffee. She disregarded Phineas as he entered the dining area and started on a banana muffin. Without a word, Phoebe handed him another half of a warmweed tablet. Petra shot a glare at the exchange but remained silent under Morrana's watchful gaze. The group travelled in silence to the training centre. There, Training Master Troy van Stomm (victor of the 5th Hunger Games) conducted his standard briefing of the rules without any issues. Noticing many tributes were still groggy, Troy generously offered each a cup of strong espresso and ten minutes at the yoga station to stretch and fully awaken. After setting a timer, he retired to the mentor’s gallery to reconnect with his fellow victors. 

As the timer expired, the tributes were released to begin their training. Petra stayed at the yoga station to complete her morning stretches and warm up. Afterwards, she moved to the archery station to hone her skills with the bow. By chance, Evelyn (7) was at the adjacent station. Evelyn watched Petra closely as her archery skills improved. When Petra hit her first bullseye, Evelyn praised her determination and sought advice. Petra paused, recalling seeing Evelyn talking with District 4 during the parade. Evelyn nonchalantly replied that an alliance between their districts seemed like a ""no-brainer"" for years. Petra proposed that she would share tips in return for Evelyn discussing a potential alliance with her teammates. Evelyn appeared reluctant, especially after seeing Phineas injure himself with a dumbbell. Petra clarified that she had no intention of collaborating with the clumsy ""zombie"" and preferred him out of the picture. Evelyn, with a smirk, agreed to consider the offer if Petra proved to be an effective instructor.

Evelyn (7) significantly improved her archery skills, hitting two bullseyes within an hour. As she and Petra exchanged stories from their districts, Petra provided clear, firm instructions to further refine Evelyn's technique. Impressed, Evelyn inquired if Petra was a teacher back home. Petra revealed she was a fitness instructor at her mentor's rehabilitation center. Convinced, Evelyn invited Petra to join her. They encountered Evelyn's friends at the aquatic station, where Marsh (4) was teaching Timber (7) how to fish. Fressa (4) questioned Petra's presence. Petra seized the opportunity to argue for her inclusion in their group. Marsh, recognizing her from the reaping, called her ""the Philosopher's pet,"" referencing her mentor's victor title. Petra acknowledged the connection, showcasing her fitness instructor physique as a testament to her strength. Marsh expressed skepticism about her motives for joining them. Petra argued that they needed to unite against her partner and the career tributes, citing his eye-catching heterochromia and charisma as likely to attract sponsors. Fressa concurred, giving her approval, while Timber nonchalantly and Marsh reluctantly consented. With that, Petra was welcomed into the aquatic station group.

Petra acquired numerous knot-tying skills from Fressa, while Marsh offered tips on handling the trident. In exchange, Petra shared her expertise on body relaxation, demonstrating proper muscle stretching and effective areas to target with a stab. In one session, Timber (7) inquired, ""If you work with the Philosopher, do you know the arena baby?"" Petra, arms folded and frowning, responded firmly, ""Her name is Mirabelle. I suggest you use it."" 

Evelyn elbowed Timber sharply. Petra revealed that she and Mirabelle were close friends. Timber asked if she was single, earning him an elbow jab from Petra. With an eye roll, Petra retorted, ""As if you'd survive long enough to find out."" Evelyn and Fressa confessed their curiosity as well. Petra conceded that Mirabelle was indeed single, attributing it to her lofty standards amidst a district of ""zombies"". Marsh chuckled at the term, guessing it was a district slur for addicts. Fressa suggested that sharing such gossip could attract additional sponsors for them. Petra found the idea intriguing and worth considering. Marsh speculated about potential gossip involving ""the therapist girl from 17,"" whom he found attractive. Petra spun around, fists clenched, and sternly cautioned him against mentioning her again. Thankfully, Training Master van Stomm's stern gaze fell upon the group at that moment.

Phineas was not enjoying his training session. He spent ten minutes rubbing sleep from his eyes, trying to ignore Petra. Nervously, he glanced at the other tributes, some of whom stared back, particularly at his mismatched eyes. Despite trying to ignore them, he couldn't resist smiling at the young Fauna (11). Once the tributes scattered, Phineas quickly left to avoid Petra, but found it difficult to settle at a station. Sasha and Malek (8) occupied the camouflage station, while Carina and Bharat (10) worked on starting a fire. The only vacant station was the strength station, filled with barbells and weights. Phineas struggled with the five-kilogram dumbbells, his grip failing until he dropped one on his right foot. He yelped in pain and tears began to well up. 

Limping to the now-empty medical station, he inspected his foot, noting bruising on his two smallest toes, and applied a cold compress. As he waited for the pain to ease, Terra and Gunner (2) passed by, with Gunner mocking, ""Couldn't predict that one, huh?"" Phineas ignored the jab and continued to watch the gymnasium. He considered joining Alice and Consul (3) at the electronics station but was distracted by a heated argument between Valencia (1) and Megan (9) over a stolen knife, which escalated until Training Master Troy intervened.

During the lunch break, Phineas sat in solitude. Nervous at the sight of Petra and her new alliance, he chose to join his mentor instead. Phoebe remarked that she had been observing him and wished he put some effort in his training. Phineas felt disheartened by his lack of strength and injured foot but promised to concentrate on something. When he asked for her advice, Phoebe retorted, ""You're the psychic. Don't you already know?"" Stung by her words, Phineas decided to leave, not without saying, ""It doesn’t take a psychic to see you have a serious problem, lass."" He grabbed his lunch and went looking for Mortimer, hoping for another conversation. 

However, it was Fabeline Granger (the victor of the 15th Hunger Games) who beckoned him over. She advised him not to take Phoebe's behavior to heart, explaining her exhaustion from twenty-one years of mentorship without a victory. Phineas wondered about her kindness, to which Fabeline simply said he reminded her of someone. As Troy signaled the end of the break, tributes were ushered back to training. Phineas expressed his gratitude to Fabeline, playfully wishing her luck with finding ""juicy tidbits"" for the podcast. Fabeline was very surprised by his comment and watched him go as he made his way back to the first aid station, where he dedicated the rest of the day to studying textbooks and practicing emergency first aid on mannequins.

Training assessments took place early the next morning. As per usual, the assessments were not televised and were released to the public after the games concluded. All tributes sat with baited breath as the training scores were announced at noon. No tribute scored an 11 this year, which surprised many Capital viewers. However, five tributes shared a score of 10, a Hunger Games record. Those tributes were Ruggero (1), Gunner (2), Marsh (4), Petra, and Evelyn (7). Many were greatly impressed with Petra’s score and realized she held the highest training score for a District 6 tribute, beating out Carson’s score of 9 during the 3rd Hunger Games. Terra (2), Fressa (4), and Timber (7) all scored a 9 while Valencia (1) scored an 8. The only other notable score was Bharat (10) who scored a 7. Phineas scored a 5, which fortunately for him wasn’t the worst score for this year. That title belonged to Laozi (5) and Murmur (12) who both scored a 2. 

The District 6 apartment buzzed with more activity than usual following the training assessments. Phoebe and Morrana heaped praise on Petra for her impressive performance. In a warm embrace, Phoebe whispered to Petra that Cat would have been proud. Meanwhile, Phineas, feeling a bit down about his low score yet relieved to be out of Petra's focus, lingered in the background. Morrana reassured him that training scores weren't everything, reminding him that Phoebe had once scored similarly in her own games. Grateful, Phineas joined the others. Now in high spirits, Petra offered Phineas a drink, confidently asserting that their district was overdue for a victory. Phineas concurred and curiously inquired about Petra's plans should she win. Petra shared her intention to invest in enhancing the centre's fitness programs and to integrate them into school curriculums, making participation mandatory. Phoebe and Phineas were skeptical about the students' reception to this, but Petra remained resolute. Morrana mused that managing the fitness program at the rehabilitation center with unmotivated students sounded quite taxing. Phoebe, probing, asked, ""Is that the reason for your hair-pulling?"" At this, Petra became still and started to shake.

Suddenly, Petra spun around and struck Phineas on the nose. As Phineas hit the floor, Petra berated him for embarrassing her. Phoebe intervened, urging her to calm down. Phineas almost responded in kind, but Morrana held him back. Petra then accused him of tarnishing her reputation to elevate his own, likening him to a “zombie” when their friend quits warmweed. Phineas retorted that not all addicts behaved that way, citing Phoebe and Cat as examples. Petra exploded when he mentioned Cat and warned him to not say her name. Phineas countered, ""Why not lass? You had a wee crush or something?"" 

Attempting to attack him again, Petra was thwarted by Phoebe, who pinned her against the wall. Phoebe scolded them for their discord, criticizing Petra for her arrogance and newly revealed prejudice, and Phineas for his constant provocation with his “cosmic knowledge”. At her wit's end, Phoebe threw her hands up and eyed Petra before losing her patience and saying, “You disappoint me.” 

Petra began to tear up as Phoebe admitted defeat, telling them they were on their own. Both tributes were deeply hurt by this, though reacted in different ways. Petra ran off in tears and insulted Phoebe calling her a quitter, running into her room. Phineas sheepishly apologised and slowly went to his room as well.

The tribute interviews marked the final stage of the pre-games, serving as the districts' ultimate bid to curry favor with the Capital. Artemis and Luther kicked off the event with a monologue, reflecting on the previous year's games and the memorable interviews they produced. The hosts were optimistic that this year's interviews would yield compelling tales for the Capital's enjoyment, particularly with the anticipation of crowning the next Golden Victor.

The interviews began on a humble note. Valencia and Ruggero (1) charmed the Capital with their behind-the-scenes look at the significant improvements their mentors had achieved in enhancing the training centers and public relations. It was quite refreshing to hear the two tributes speak so positively about each other. Terra (2) had a surprisingly mediocre interview, mainly discussing her sleep schedule, which puzzled the Capital. Fortunately, Gunner (2) lightened the mood with his humorous tales of injuries sustained during after-school parkour races. District 4, especially Marsh, was a hit for his easy-going confidence and anecdotes about working in submarine construction. District 5 was considered a mixed bag. Millicent (5) proved to be ""timidly charming"" when sharing her hobby of creating shapes from discarded gold pieces and her aspiration to turn it into a business. Laozi (5) dampened spirits with his tearful longing for his mother. Artemis felt a sense of relief when he exited the stage, but perked up once Luther reminded her of the next tribute in the lineup.

Petra was greeted with thunderous applause as she graced the stage in a sparkling amber dress, complete with white-gloved sleeves and a red beret, drawing comparisons to a Milestone Capital Beer bottle. Artemis humorously noted the resemblance, joking about her sudden thirst. Petra playfully warned, “Be careful, Ms. Radcliffe. I’d hate for you to be sloshed during my big moment.” 

Luther expressed the Capital's admiration for her recent performances, particularly her high training score. Petra credited her success to her hard work as a fitness instructor and her mentor's guidance. She was summarizing a typical day when Artemis interjected, inquiring about her start at the Kento Rehabilitation Centre. Petra shared that she was taken in at age nine after Cat found her in the streets after she ran away from home. Hesitating when asked about her reasons for running away, Petra eventually confessed that her warmweed-addicted father was abusive. Cat had rescued her and brought her to the centre. With Phoebe's therapy service for victors flourishing, Cat focused on educating Petra. Overcome with emotion, Petra disclosed the turmoil following Cat's selection for the 17th Hunger Games. With Phoebe's attention divided, Petra channeled her energy into launching the fitness program. 

Artemis praised Petra for her sobriety and athleticism, to which Petra responded with the now iconic mantra, “Sound body, sound mind.” Luther's inquiry about her friendship with Mirabelle brightened Petra's mood. They had been inseparable since Petra's arrival at the center, and Mirabelle was her first trainee. The Capital audience was delighted to meet the mentor behind Mirabelle's impressive physique showcased in a photograph from two years prior. Luther inquired softly, ""Any romantic feelings?"" Petra's face flushed with color just as Artemis shifted the conversation, expressing a desire to discuss the Kento Rehabilitation Center further. However, Luther glanced at his watch and excused her, leading to thunderous applause that solidified her status as a crowd favorite.

Artemis felt sad to see Petra go, yet Luther buzzed with anticipation for their next guest, whom he described as ""weird in a good way."" Phineas made his entrance onto the stage prematurely, triggering an early wave of applause. Adorned in a flowing red robe paired with black boots, sporting three rings on his right hand, and exuding a mystical aroma that captivated the Capital audience, Phineas made quite the first impression. Luther praised the unexpected entrance, while Artemis pinpointed the scent as cedarwood mixed with bourbon barrels, which Phineas affirmed with fondness. Seizing the moment, Luther inquired if his hometown fans shared this affection. Phineas quipped, ""That depends on your definition of fans,"" revealing that despite his shows' modest success, he was very unpopular in school. While Artemis attributed this to the attention, Phineas clarified it was more about his mothers and his clothes. Luther delved into questions about his family's show as Artemis gazed, entranced by his heterochromatic eyes. 

Phineas recounted that the show began a year after he was adopted from the streets at age three by his mothers, who incorporated him and his adopted siblings into the act. When Artemis requested a live stage reading, Phineas agreed with a playful eye roll. With closed eyes and hands pressed to his head, he rapidly disclosed Ruggero (1)'s nose job, Consul (3)'s double-jointed thumbs, Timber (7)'s homosexuality, Gerard (9)'s uncontrollable urinary condition, and Artemis having had intercourse with a production assistant before coming on stage. Luther, along with many audience members, chuckled at the latter revelation. Curious about the omission of his partner, Luther inquired, leading Phineas to reveal her crushes on both Cat and Mirabelle. An astonished Artemis exclaimed, ""Wow. You really are a psychic,"" to which Phineas responded by denying such a claim. Luther wondered about his knowledge if the title of psychic was false, but Phineas playfully withheld his methods, teasing, ""I can't reveal my secrets, mate. But I could if you vote for me."" Departing to thunderous applause, Phineas solidified his status as a crowd favorite.

As the latter half of the interviews proceeded, Phineas made his way backstage to the green room. Petra, already there, was seething with anger and humiliation from his remarks and was set on giving him a harsh lesson in front of all the tributes. She slammed him against a wall and delivered several punches to his abdomen. Consul (3) had to be restrained by his mentor Linker as Laozi (5) accidentally hurled food at the poor boy's face, intending it for Phineas. Ruggero (1) and Timber (7) were about to support Petra when Mortimer and Meridia Beckett stepped in. 

Mortimer pried Petra away from Phineas, while Meridia escorted him back to Phoebe. Petra hurled threats at Phineas, vowing he would be the first to go in the bloodbath. Phoebe, showing little interest in the commotion, did not step in. Meridia reprimanded her for her lack of action and cautioned her to keep a closer eye on her tributes. Without a word, Phoebe took her tributes and headed back to their apartment, with Morrana trailing behind, serving as a shield. Meridia paused them briefly to advise Phineas, ""Use wit wisely. It can be both a blessing and a curse."" Acknowledging the advice, Phineas and his district partner were escorted to their apartment.

Phineas hid himself in the bathroom as Petra simmered with rage. Frustrated, she tugged at her hair, lamenting the humiliation she had suffered. Morrana attempted to highlight the positive feedback Petra had earned on her own, but Petra was too angry to listen. Awaiting Phoebe's feedback, Petra's anger intensified upon noticing her mentor's indifferent disregard. She confronted Phoebe for allowing Phineas to belittle her and never helping her during the entire pregames. Phoebe, rising sharply from her seat, retorted that she had been assisting until they chose to ignore her pleas and go at each other's throats. Phoebe rebuked Petra for her pride and temper, stunning her with the words, “You know, now I understand why you and Mirabelle are no longer friends; you're a bitch.” 

Petra was taken aback by the harsh criticism and was very unprepared for Phoebe's next words: “In twenty years, I've mentored many difficult tributes. But you two are by far the most disappointing. So much potential wasted.” 

Distraught, Petra fled to her room, crying. Phineas, having overheard the exchange, was also in tears. Morrana cast a disapproving glance but remained silent, knowing it futile to interject. She checked on both tributes before departing the apartment to return home.

The following morning, the apartment lay in eerie silence. Phoebe had fallen asleep at the counter, a flask of mineral water overturned beside her. Petra muttered, ""At least you're not a hypocrite."" Phineas quietly had his breakfast, awaiting his mentor's awakening. He needed his half tablet of warmweed but was reluctant to disturb her slumber. Petra warned him not to expect a tablet for his so-called condition. Phineas, opting to avoid another quarrel, disregarded her comment. Before Morrana led them from the building, Phineas discreetly placed a folded piece of paper next to Phoebe's head.

The tributes were led to the depths of the arena for the Hunger Games preparations. The attire provided in the holding rooms—a mix of blue and white polyester-cotton gowns, woolen slippers, and optional patterned scrub hats—caused some bewilderment. The tributes were told to wear the gowns over their undergarments. 

Petra, visited by a tardy Phoebe who almost didn't make it from the apartment, paid little attention to her mentor's remark about the benefit of having another mentor. Instead, Petra focused on her reflection, recoiling when Phoebe attempted a comforting touch. Refusing to indulge the lack of apologies from her mentor, Petra stepped into the tube early. Phoebe frowned and left early as well, wishing Petra a ""Fabeline level” of character development. 

Meanwhile, Phineas was visited by Morrana, who arrived as he was stripping out of his clothes. She was surprised by his skinniness and he laughed at her shock. He explained how he usually shared food with his adopted siblings due to migraines dampening his appetite. Phineas froze upon saying this, coming to the cold realisation that he wouldn't have access to painkillers of any kind. He confessed his fear of migraines rivaled his fear of death, but Morrana reassured him of his strength. She even admitted her wish for his victory over Petra. Phineas thanked her for the support. He asked her to tell Phoebe he was sorry for being a disappointment and to read the letter he left her which was the only thing that stood in the apartment at this time. Morrana nodded and embraced him. Phineas returned the embrace as she wished him luck. She walked Phineas to his tube. Before he went into his tube, he placed his hands up to his face as he was doing a reading before putting his fingers toward his heterochromatic eyes saying “I’ll be watching you.” Morrana smiled and with tears in her eyes watched Phineas get into his tube. He gave a thumbs up with a sad grin. With that, the tributes ascended into the arena.",1,1737258464.0,christianblanco,0,1.0,False

1i4peir,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1i4peir/students_first_day_was_slightly_traumatic/,Students first day was slightly traumatic...,"I am a nurse working at a psychiatric emergency department in an inner city hospital. We see a lot of... Interesting stuff. We tend to see everything from drug induced psychosis to genuine depression to all kinds of emotional dysregulation. We work closely with our local police. I am used to it, and I have a wonderful team and some effective (healthy) coping skills. I enjoy taking on fourth year nursing students and I hope I am a good preceptor to them. 

I have taken on a new nursing student and her first day was today. She has no psych experience. Everything she saw was completely new to her. In the first hour of my shift my patient (who was in seclusion) called me a bitch four times, spat at the seclusion room window and was hypersexual towards me before openly masturbating in the seclusion room. He then destroyed the seclusion room mattress and covered his room in the food from his breakfast try. Not abnormal, but I could see how that would be shocking to a student. I try to reassure her that not all patients present in that way. As I am telling her that we almost never have to use our personal alarms (we have a great security team working with us) a different patient rushes security and nursing staff and attempts to elope from the seclusion room. Personal alarm activated, code white called. Usually we can handle our own codes but it was an all hands on deck situation. The rest of the morning continues in the same manner, but the unit finally calmed down around 3pm. There were some other incidents but nothing she was present for. She was not directly involved in anything, but watched both situations in the morning go down. 

She is, understandably, overwhelmed. Once the unit calms down for a moment at around 9am, I take her for a walk, buy her a coffee and we debrief. I am wondering how other preceptors have helped students handle high acuity placements. Usually students have some psych experience before coming to us, but all of this is new to her. If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this placement a good learning environment without completely traumatizing her I would greatly appreciate it.

1i4pe7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1i4pe7y/im_a_police_officer_people_are_dying_in_my_town/," I'm a Police Officer. People are Dying in My Town, and I Don't Know Why (Part1) ","The moon hung low over the sleepy town of RidgeWater Creek, its faint glow barely penetrating the dense forest on the outskirts.

As I stepped out of my car, my boots crunched against the gravel road, carrying me toward the cordoned-off crime scene.

The red and blue strobes of police lights painted chaotic flashes across the area, but my focus remained on the figure sprawled on the ground.

The first thing that struck me was the smell—a sickly mix of damp soil and something metallic, almost like rusted iron or old blood.

It was the kind of stench that clings to the back of your throat, refusing to let go. I adjusted my scarf as I ducked under the yellow tape fluttering in the wind.

The victim was a man in his late thirties—married, no kids—a local high school teacher named Gregory Tate. He lay on his back, arms splayed wide as if he’d been clawing at the ground in desperation. But there were no wounds, no blood, no evidence of force or struggle. His body was completely intact.

Then my flashlight caught his face, and I felt my stomach drop.

His mouth hung unnaturally wide, stretched into a soundless scream frozen in time. His eyes bulged, staring at the void, but still radiated with raw unrelenting terror.

It was as if his last moments had been carved into his flesh—a permanent echo of whatever had seized him in those final horrifying seconds.

A shiver crawled up my spine as my thoughts immediately snapped back to two other murders, both eerily similar, and both occurring within the last two weeks.

I lowered my flashlight, sweeping it over the ground around the body. That’s when I noticed it: a crudely etched circle surrounding him, as though drawn during his final moments.

Near his feet, a string of letters was scrawled into the dirt—in a language I couldn’t recognize.

The arrangement felt disturbingly ritualistic, as if the victim had somehow been drawn into a sinister rite that eventually claimed his life.

What made the scene even more grotesque was that the two earlier victims had also been found dead under similar circumstances.

The next day back at my station, I immersed myself in the case files, leaning back in my chair as the details swirled through my mind.

**Victim One, Clara Evans**: A store clerk was found dead in her living room, slumped in a corner. There was no sign of forced entry, but her face was frozen in paralyzing fear. Using her lipstick, she had drawn a circle around herself and left illegible scrawls near her feet. She had even quit her job a week earlier, citing stress, and was living alone at the time.

**Victim Two, Jack Monroe**:  A mechanic found dead in his garage, surrounded by scattered tools. Neighbors mentioned he’d been hearing strange noises outside his house for days. In the week leading up to his death, he barricaded himself in the garage and stopped visiting the local bar, where he was a regular after work.

**Victim Three, Gregory Tate:** A high school teacher, beloved by his students, with no known enemies or debts. His wife observed that he had recently grown terrified of leaving the house after dark, often twitching and trembling at the slightest noise. Then, one night, without explanation, he left home and wandered into the woods a mile away, where he was found dead.

Three victims, three different lives, and no tangible connections between them—except for one chilling similarity: the circumstances of their deaths and the fear that was permanently etched across their faces.

There was also another detail I had to account for. In all three crime scenes, an object was found lying next to the corpse. With the first victim it was a small hand held mirror, with the mechanic it was a miniature toy bus and with the high school teacher, it was a fountain pen.

The really odd thing here though was that the objects looked like relics that belonged to another era, probably the late 70’s or the early 80’s, and it made me wonder if they had been left behind by the killer.

Sergeant Holbrook, however, had a different take. He didn’t mince words, calling it outright “the work of the devil.” A police veteran with decades of experience, Holbrook claimed to remember similar occurrences from his childhood. And each time we arrived at a new crime scene, I could see his face grow paler, as if the evidence before us confirmed his worst fears.

The people of the town had a similar opinion as well. Especially the elderly folks who remembered the killings more than 50 years ago. And when the photos of victims leaked and went viral, it was only a matter of time before the whole community got swept in on the frenzy.

As I took a sip of coffee, Sergeant Holbrook stepped into my cabin, holding a file from the coroner’s office. I opened it, already anticipating what I’d find.

Like the others, our latest victim showed no signs of trauma or struggle—no defensive wounds, no bruises, nothing.

All three had been in good health with no underlying medical conditions. The coroner’s report mentioned cardiac arrest brought on by extreme stress,  but the words rang hollow. It felt more like a convenient excuse than any real explanation.

“Officer Harper…” Holbrook’s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his tone measured, almost hesitant. “The Mayor wants to meet you at the town hall.”

A knot tightened in my stomach. Town hall meetings were rarely good news.

With three unexplained deaths in less than 2 weeks, the townsfolk of Ridgewater Creek—a tight-knit community of just 1,000 people—were bound to have questions, and not the easy kind. News here moved faster than the wind, and the pressure to provide answers was mounting.

Being the new cop in town— a city officer who had moved here just six months ago to take charge—had already made me a topic of gossip. Now, with these cases piling up, it felt like the tide of suspicion was beginning to shift toward me.

Holbrook and I climbed into the cruiser, and as we drove through the quiet streets, I stared out the window, running through what I’d say in my head.

When we arrived, the town hall was already packed with people. Parents clutched their children protectively, teenagers huddled together in nervous whispers, and the elderly exchanged worried glances. The weight of their fear hung heavy in the air, pressing against me like a storm cloud as I walked nervously through the room, their silent stares following my every step.

The mayor opened the meeting with strained reassurances before gesturing for me to step forward.

""Good morning,"" I started, scanning the sea of tense, worried faces. ""I'm Officer Evelyn Harper. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything within our power to solve these tragic cases. While we don't have all the answers yet, we are committed to uncovering the truth. But we need your cooperation. For the next 10 days, please, stay indoors after dark, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to us immediately.""

As I continued speaking and patiently answered their questions, my eyes continuously swept over the crowd.

One woman in the second row particularly stood out. Her silver hair gleamed under the harsh lights, and her hands rested neatly on her lap. While the rest wore their fear openly, her expression was serene—calm to the point of detachment.

When the meeting ended an hour later, I swiftly moved toward her. ""Excuse me, ma’am,"" I said as the crowd began to thin.

She turned to me, her blue eyes sharp and clear. “Hello Officer. I am Ruth. Nice to finally meet you,” she said with a faint smile.

“Ruth,” I said, stepping closer, “would you like a ride home?”

Her smile deepened just slightly. “That’s very kind of you, Officer Harper. Yes. I’d appreciate that.”

Holbrook gave me a questioning glance, but I waved him off, while Ruth and I walked toward the cruiser.

As we drove to her residence, Ruth began to share snippets from her life. She was in her early seventies, born and raised in Ridgewater Creek. She’d never married, had no children, and retired only recently from her position as the local school librarian.

When we arrived at her place, she invited me inside. Her home was warm and inviting, carrying the comforting scent of old wood and lavender.

But what struck me most however was the massive bookshelf dominating her living room, stretching floor to ceiling and packed with books—some weathered, others pristine, all meticulously arranged.

“You have quite the collection,” I remarked, my eyes scanning the rows of books.

“Books are windows to understanding, Officer Harper,” she said with a wistful smile. “But they can also be windows to something darker… something forgotten.”

 “You seemed unusually calm today at the town hall,” I said carefully as I took a seat across from her.

“Fear clouds judgment, my dear,” she replied softly. “I’ve lived long enough to know that panic only leads to mistakes. The key is to look closely, think clearly, and see what others might overlook.”

Her words lingered, and I leaned forward. “So what are your thoughts on these deaths? What do you think is really going on here?”

Ruth stood without replying, crossing to her bookshelf. Her fingers brushed over the spines before settling on a weathered, leather-bound volume. She opened it with care, flipping through the pages until she stopped at an illustration.

The image was jarring: a figure lay on the ground, encircled by a crudely drawn ring, with an undecipherable text scrawled near its feet. It was eerily similar to the crime scenes. My heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“This… this looks just like the crime scenes,” I whispered.

I leaned closer, studying the page. “What does the scrawl mean?”

Her gaze met mine, calm yet piercing. “It says ‘Jurupari,’” she replied, her voice steady. “It means ‘Voice of Fear.’ According to an ancient Amazonian legend, it's an entity that devours the soul of its victim after overwhelming them with fear.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I stared at the illustration, unsure of what to say.

Ruth then turned back a page, pointing to a dark, distorted figure cloaked in shadow. “This is what the legend speaks of,” she explained. “An entity feared for centuries, known for consuming the souls of its victims. It thrives on fear—smelling it, tasting it and even savoring it. Its origins are unknown, but it has appeared across the country in several places over the years. Fifty years ago, it came to Ridgewater Creek.”

I listened, both horrified and captivated, as her words sank in.

“In the seventies,” she continued, “this town was plagued by a series of unexplained deaths. No signs of struggle, no obvious causes—people were just dropping dead, and no one could figure out why. It went on for months, freezing the town in fear. The police were desperate for answers, but they found nothing.”

She paused, her face darkening with the weight of the memory. “That’s when I found this book. As a librarian, I often sourced rare volumes, and when I saw this one, I had a feeling it might hold the answers we needed. I took it to the police chief, but he dismissed it immediately—called it nonsense.”

Her expression softened, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. “But there was one person who listened—a young sergeant named Henry Cross. He quietly observed while I tried to explain to the Chief. He was the tenacious type I must say, the kind of man who couldn’t let something go until he understood it. He even came to my home, sat right where you’re sitting now, and let me explain I knew. A few days later, he came back and said he’d found a promising lead. He was going somewhere to investigate.”

 “And then?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of it.

She sighed deeply. “I never saw him again. He vanished without a trace. The murders stopped soon after, and the town returned to normal. But Henry… he was never seen or heard from again.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked intrigued.

Her expression grew inscrutable as she hesitated. “That, Officer Harper, is a question I’ve pondered for decades. Maybe you can connect the dots, and let me know how this story ends.”

“Do you know where he went?” I pressed.

She nodded. “He said he was going to the sawmill.”

Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I quickly answered, Holbrook’s voice sharp with urgency.

“Chief,” he said, his tone grim, “we’ve got another one.”

“Where?” I asked, my grip tightening on the phone.

“The old sawmill,” he replied.

I quickly thanked Ruth and headed for the mill, long abandoned and feared by the local townsfolk. Perched on the edge of town, it had stood vacant for decades, its history making it a place that people usually believe to be haunted.  

As I stepped out of my cruiser, the thick, suffocating scent of rusted iron and decay hit me as if it had settled into the very air.

Before me loomed the mill, a Second World War era relic continuing to wither away under years of neglect. The roof had caved in at several points, and vines snaked through the broken windows, claiming the crumbling interior. The structure still somehow seemed almost alive, yet entirely forgotten.

To my right, a jeep had crashed into the side of the building, its front half crushed against the brickwork. Paramedics were extracting the driver’s lifeless body, twisted and mangled beyond recognition. The passenger door hung open, offering a clear view inside the mill where another young man lay sprawled across the dusty floor.

Unlike his friend this one was alive. As I approached, I noticed one of the medics kneeling beside him, injecting something into his bloodstream to stabilize him.

Moments later, the man startled awake, his body jerking as his eyes flew open, wide with terror. He scanned the scene wildly, his breath ragged and shallow, until his gaze fixed on the wrecked jeep outside. Recognition dawned, and his chest heaved as he tried to speak.

“It’s my friend,” he gasped, his voice breaking. “He just... he just lost it. We were headed to the city—everything was fine. Then, out of nowhere, he panicked. Started screaming like a madman—like he had seen something. He suddenly swerved off the road and drove straight into the building. I... I barely managed to jump out just before we hit the building.”

The medics eventually helped him to his feet and escorted him to the waiting ambulance.

Meanwhile, I turned my attention to the mill’s interior. My eyes were drawn instantly to a large, sealed fireplace at one end of the room. The mortar appeared weathered, but the bricks had been meticulously arranged, completely blocking the hearth.

I stepped outside again, unable to shake the peculiar sight that kept nagging at me. From the outside, I could see that the jeep had rammed directly into the building's fireplace. I called for Sergeant Holbrooke, and together, we had the vehicle reversed. As the jeep was pulled back, the bricks began to crumble, revealing something hidden within.

Behind the wall of debris was a skeletal figure, awkwardly slumped in the confines of the fireplace. Its bony hands tightly clutched a weathered brown book, its leather cover stained with a large patch of blood on the back, yet otherwise its overall condition remarkably intact.

The tattered remnants of fabric clinging to the skeletal remains made the uniform hard to identify, but the government-issued firearm lying beside him left no doubt in my mind: I was looking at the mortal remains of Sergeant Cross.

We spent the rest of the day combing through the mill, collecting the necessary samples for forensic testing, and then interrogating the survivor back at the hospital to get his full account of the events.

By the time I was finished, it was already half past eleven. As I was heading out for home, I noticed the sergeant's journal lying in the evidence tray, tagged and ready for testing. Without thinking, I grabbed it and made my way home, planning to take a long bath before finally getting some rest.

Entering the bathroom, I prepared the tub, quickly undressed, and waded into the warm water. As I leaned back, I picked up the sergeant’s journal and began reading.

 

 

 ***Investigative Journal of H. Cross***

*People like to think the badge is about ""serve and protect."" But for me, it’s always been about Ricky and what he stood for. He’s the reason I’m here, walking the beat, keeping an eye out for the bully lurking in the shadows.*

*Growing up in foster care, I didn’t have much more than the shirt on my back and a hundred reasons to keep my head down. The other kids were bigger, meaner, and twice as cruel. Every day felt like a battle, and every night I prayed I wouldn’t wake up with a black eye—or worse.*

*Then came Ricky.*

*He wasn’t some guardian angel swooping in to save me. Nah, he was just another kid dumped into the system, rough around the edges like the rest of us. But Ricky didn’t believe in running or hiding.*

*“Punch first and think later,” he always used to say, and he lived by it.*

*He taught me how to stand tall, to fight back—not just with fists, but with grit, persistence, and anything else that gave us an edge.*

*A poke in the eye, a kick in the nuts, smashing a bottle over someone’s head while they were busy eating—it didn’t matter. The rules were simple: keep going, again and again, until they start to feel it in their bones.*

*I’ll never forget the one time we fought back. Three bigger kids had us cornered behind the school yard. They were huge, grinning like wolves, and ready to pounce.*

*Ricky didn’t hesitate. He threw the first punch, and I followed right behind him. We didn’t win—not even close. By the end of it, we were in the hospital with more broken bones than I could count. My ribs ached for weeks, and every breath felt like fire.*

*But what I remember most isn’t the pain—it’s lying there in that hospital bed, tears streaming down my face, feeling something I’d never felt before: a sense of victory. We may not have won the fight, but we held our heads high. And when we got finally back, we tormented them for weeks until we made damn sure they never picked on us again.*

*Ricky was the only real friend I ever had—the only one that mattered, at least. So when I found him dead at a crime scene, his soul ripped from him, leaving only fear etched on his face, it felt like something inside me had been ripped away too. This wasn’t just murder—it was personal.*

*I knew then and there I’d stop at nothing to find the bastard who did this. I owed Ricky that much. This journal is my attempt to piece it all together—my thoughts, my rage, my resolve.*

*It’s time to bully the bully.*

 

 

***Day 1***

*I hadn’t set foot in the sawmill since my teens, back when a group of us dared each other to explore its eerie halls. No one knows exactly why the place was deemed cursed, but the story goes that workers arrived one morning to a grisly sight: the owner’s lower half lying severed by the saw table, while his upper half roasted in the fireplace.*

*The mill never reopened, and its sinister reputation only deepened with time. Whispers of ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena grew so pervasive that authorities eventually sealed the fireplace to deter thrill-seekers and other oddballs from exploiting the site.*

*Now, here I was again, on a stakeout, sitting in my car hidden among a row of trees with the decaying structure looming in the distance.*

*My mind immediately wandered to the events of the past couple of months. Ridgewater Creek had seen more than 25 deaths, including that of my friend, and we were no closer to solving the case.*

*The air in town was thick with fear—people were irritable, on edge, constantly glancing over their shoulders. Chaos was unravelling right before my eyes, and the community was fraying at the seams.*

*The Chief was unwavering in his belief that a serial killer was behind it all. At first, I agreed—especially with the peculiar items left at each crime scene: an ashtray, a felt hat, a tennis racket, a wristwatch, a cassette tape, a torch etc. They seemed deliberate, almost like a calling card. But the more I examined them, the more they felt... disconnected. There was no clear pattern, no logic linking the objects to each other or the victims.*

*As the body count climbed, so did my doubts. Something about it didn’t sit right.*

*The breakthrough came unexpectedly when a young woman walked into the station, clutching a theory about a supernatural entity tied to an old legend she’d uncovered in a dusty book. The Chief dismissed her as a crank, but desperation has a way of shifting priorities.*

*I couldn’t afford to ignore any lead—no matter how improbable. That evening, I met her at her home. As she laid out her theory, a strange sense of clarity took hold. And it got me thinking.*

*If the entity she called Jurupari was real, it would need a place to hide—somewhere near town but remote enough to remain undisturbed.  The place had to be abandoned, forgotten by time, where no one would think to look.*

*And only one such place came to mind.*

*So when I returned to the sawmill after all these years, I found it in even worse shape than I’d imagined—its wooden frame sagging, the air thick with the stench of rot and mildew.*

*I scoured every corner, but there was nothing unusual. No signs of anything lurking, no evidence to support Ruth’s theory. I was even ready to write it off as a dead end and leave when something caught my eye.*

*In a dim corner of the mill half-buried in debris, lay a curious cluster of items: an American flag keychain, a leather wallet, a razor and a bottle opener. At first glance, they seemed like random junk, discarded and forgotten.*

*But on closer inspection, I noticed they weren’t old or tattered. These items looked reasonably new, and oddly out of place—as if someone had deliberately gathered them, seeing still some value in them where others saw trash. It hit me then: someone, or something, was holding out here. I decided to continue my surveillance for a few more days.*

 

***Day 2***  
*I arrived at the mill as soon as I finished my shift at the station. I spent the entire night keeping watch, fighting off fatigue until sleep finally overtook me in the wee hours of the morning. I jolted awake suddenly, certain I’d seen a sudden flash of light. Heart pounding, I leapt out of the vehicle and rushed to the mill. But when I got there, everything was just as I’d seen it the night before—empty and undisturbed.*

 

***Day 3***  
*When I returned to work in the morning, I heard news of another body.*

*This time, it was an old man who was found dead in his garden, his eyes and mouth locked in an expression of pure terror. But what truly sent a chill down my spine was the leather wallet lying next to him—it was the same one I had seen earlier at the mill.*

*When I rushed back to the mill, I found the wallet and keychain missing while the razor, and bottle opener still remained by the side.*

*An uneasy sensation coursed through my veins as I stared at the objects scattered on the floor.*

*Gripping a stick, I cautiously nudged them apart before hesitantly hovering my little finger over the razor. Taking a deep breath, I let the tip of my little finger make contact.*

*A warm, fuzzy sensation enveloped me, and in an instant, I was transported to a memory from my childhood—my mom tossing me into the air, her laughter ringing out as she caught me mid-flight, then planting a kiss on my cheek.*

*Without thinking, I next placed my ring finger on the razor, and the feeling intensified. This time, I was surrounded by both my parents, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of birthday candles as I leaned in to blow them out.*

*Sweat trickled down my chin as I began lifting my fingers one by one, preparing to grasp the razor fully.*

*But the moment my hand closed around it, a long-buried memory surged to the surface—a fateful night I had forced into the deepest recesses of my mind, one that irrevocably and painfully altered the course of my life.*

*Gasping, I tore my hand away just in time, the force of the memory knocking me backward. My chest tightened as I lay sprawled on the floor, staring at the razor, now innocuously lying among the debris.*

*Then it hit me—a thick, metallic tang in the air, sharp and unmistakable, like rusted iron. The atmosphere in the mill shifted entirely, growing heavier and oppressive.*

*Then, from the direction of the sealed fireplace, a low rumble echoed.*

*I crept closer, my movements slow and deliberate, as I leaned against the cold concrete straining to listen. And the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I heard it—something faint but unmistakable.*

 *It was cackling, low and stifled, as though someone or something was struggling to suppress its glee.*

GI just left me in the dark.,"In 2021, I had an endoscopy and it revealed a mild ulcer and gastritis. The GI pretty much threw omeprazole at me and left me to it. I took it for maybe 1.5-2 years? It definitely did help but it ended up causing severe vitamin deficiencies (of which the GI told me NOTHING about as a possibility). I went back to the GI and asked about the vitamin issue and wanted to take something else. She told me to my face that I was wrong. I didn't go back.

I weaned myself off of the omeprazole about a year ago and I have had nothing but issues since. I've even started GERD symptoms like acid coming up my throat. I've tried Pepcid but it makes me irritable/anxious. I'm pretty much limping along with antacid chews.

Except this weekend, I must have had a flare of gastritis or something because I have been pretty sick. The pain and bloating under my left ribs, feeling gurgly and uneasy, burning in my entire digestive system, diarrhea, nausea, etc. It improves slightly when I eat which led me to believe it was the gastritis or ulcer again.

Are there any other options for treatment? I'm still correcting vitamin deficiencies from last time. I have to supplement vitamins D, B12, iron, and magnesium to feel remotely human. Is a diet change the only other option? That will be hard with caffeine because I fight chronic fatigue daily because of the vitamin and thyroid issues. I have ordered low acid coffee though. 

Is there a book or guide somewhere about the diet change? I have IBS and I already have to watch other foods as well. ",1,1737258216.0,Gastritis,5,1.0,False

There's a good chance it will miss us."" ""I'm not worried about that."" ""Me neither."" ""Let's go get some coffee."" ""Let's do it."" I start packing my gear.

""Did you fall back asleep?"" This is my usual M.O. ""No. I'm over here packing my gear."" ""Ooh. Cool!"" He's an early riser, get up and go type. He's eighteen months in. That's a solid amount of time out here. I see traits in him I used to have in the early years. Nostalgic. Both of us out of tents. Gear. Down the trail.

We're trying to dodge huge puddles. We're bushwacking through the trees. Our feet are getting wet, but not too bad. Me, ""Fuck."" ""What?"" ""I just found the one sinkhole out here. It took my shoe off."" ""Damn.""I laugh. I reach into this shin deep mud hole, grab my freshly laundered shoe, back on my foot. We continue on. Finally make it out of the woods.

Across the fields. Downtown. He wants to go to Hardee's. No problem here. Hardee's. Coffee. I tell a story about covering for someone for a set in his band drunk and tripping my face off on acid. 400 people at this show. ""As long as I didn't look at the neck everything was fine."" He laughs. We hit the library. He goes to a computer. I sit in my usual chair charging my stuff. Reddit. 

Burrito guy is coming today around 1:00-1:30. We're both looking forward to hitting that cool shelter for the week. We've been talking about it for days. It's gonna be awesome! He takes off to go get a burger 'cause he's hungry. A little before 1:00 I go downstairs, out into the front of the library. Smoke. More reddit.

At 1:00 I go across the street to where burrito guy will be shortly. About 15 of us there. No line has formed yet. In the blink of an eye most of this group goes running back to the library. I don't see anything happening, but burrito guy isn't there yet. 'I might as well go see what's happening.' Back across the flooded street. Three lines of people converging on a car. Everybody's letting people in as we get closer.

Pizza! 

'Pizza right before burrito guy? And directly across the street? Didn't see that coming. Awesome!' You guys know about me and pizza lately. They're handing out pepperoni and sausage, and meat lovers pizza. Sodas too. I spy an orange soda. 'I love orange soda.' Soda in water bottle holder on backpack. Pizza in hand. ""Thank you very much!"" ""God bless!"" ""You too."" I'm not arguing with religion when there's good pizza involved. (Or any time for that matter. It's so much easier to just roll with it. And it costs me nothing.) Livin' the dream! ""We'll be here same time next week too, with clothes."" ""Awesome!""

Finish pizza. Burrito guy pulls in. Back across flooded street. He's taking no shit from people trying to bullshit their way into a second burrito. These things weigh a few pounds. ""What? No! There's a guy in a wheel chair that made it out here. Tell him he can walk his ass over here!"" Some woman trying to get two burritos. I'm laughing. I've seen all the bullshit before.

We're all letting the old guys get in front of us. Those guys went from most of the way back to the front no problems. Person by person everybody got on board. No one suggested it. Usually the streets are a first come first served place. Especially amongst us men. Usually someone makes sure the guys in wheel chairs get hooked up good. Everybody else is on their own. Not today.

'What a day to be at the library!' I grab a burrito and a water. Both in the pack. There's no way I can tackle this thing after a couple good thick slices.

Back into library. Upstairs. Usual seat. Charging. Headphones. James Brown. Reddit. Screwing around on the internet. A librarian walks over to a couple guys standing to my right. Headphones out. Walk over. ""They're not gonna do the shelter again this time. There gonna put you guys in hotel rooms. Be out front at 3:00 tomorrow for a ride."" I confirm the information. ""Yes. There might be a cold weather shelter opening on Dauphin, but I don't have any information on that."" ""Ok. Thank you!"" One of guys, ""They're gonna put us four to a room."" ""Ok. Cool."" Seems like he's done this before.

'I'll have to tell my friend when he gets back. Strange of him to miss burrito guy.' Headphones back in. Person to Person by Average White Band. 'I do have some bangers in here!'

(I'm a second generation guitar player on both sides of my family. Been playing since I was eleven. I'm definitely not god's gift to guitar playing, but I can sit in with just about anybody, and touch your soul. Played with a couple of the greats by sheer luck. Met several while being a sound engineer for a couple years. I've got some tunes in my collection that are fucking killer. Nobody's bitched about anything I've got in a long time. But music is subjective. You do you.

It is kinda killing me I didn't bring a guitar this time. But I'm on a mission, and didn't want the extra weight.)

Twenty minutes later I get a phone call from my friend telling me the news I just got ""I may be able to manipulate this in our favor a little"" he says. He shows back up an hour or so later. He ran into the guy who has been holding a job for him for the last five weeks while he gets his ID back together. Seems a little off. I'm pretty sure he's had a few. No big deal.

We grab our gear. Go outside to talk and smoke. Him, ""Man that sucks they're not going to do that shelter again."" ""Yeah that's kind of a real dick-punch. But, it's the same church just different people putting us in hotels."" I was looking forward to being in that place again, but As REO Speedwagon said, ""You got to roll with the changes.

It's gonna be cold as fuck tomorrow night. Twenty four. Wind chill down to eight degrees. It's gonna be even worse Tuesday. Deadly cold all week. No one has the gear for that. This is southern Alabama. There's no gear here for that. No way to order anything and get it here in time.

I have faith it will work out just fine.

We head for camp lamenting our sorrows about the shelter not happening somewhat lightheartedly. 'Fucking lake sized puddles.'😁We decided to stop in briefly at tweaker girl's camp. She's sweet as pie. Got a bunch of food. She's gonna cook breakfast for everybody in the morning. Hugs. She reiterates they're really friendly and we're cool too. Friend and I volunteer to help her uncle fix his tent the best we can tomorrow before we take off. More fucking puddles. 😆

We get back to our camp. My tarp has blown and slid down the backside of my tent. Everything is dry here. We're in a very slight high spot. Next to a stream. We smoke. Shoot the shit. He offers me some vodka. I politely decline. I listen to him ramble a little. I hate listening to drunk people ramble, but he's keeping it rained in. We talk about different forms of renewable energy, and the good and bad of each.

It's gonna be forty-five tonight. I start to fold my tarp to take it inside my tent. It's my top later to my bedroll when it's cold. Halfway through, 'Fuck it. I'm gonna put it back on the tent. Friend and I say goodnight. Climb in tents.

1i4pcaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i4pcaa/stop_caring_about_inheritance/,Stop caring about inheritance,"I once received a check for $2,000 AUD from the police, as compensation for their delayed response to someone trying to set fire to my house.  I lost the cheque; I have no idea where it went, and I did not lose a wink of sleep over it.  My grandmother lost a couple of million dollars when I was in my teens, as a result of a building society collapse; which taught me that there is no such thing as economic security.  Additionally, as a result of what I saw the corporate community do to the Internet, as well as my experience with Amway, I learned to truly hate money.  I want two meals a day, basic (as in 4 changes of a $30 black track suit) clothing, shelter, Internet access, caffeine, and marijuana.  Nothing else is defensible, and I know that many of you would argue that weed and coffee are not.

Where money is concerned, I've experienced both ends of the spectrum.  As a child I spent time with one of my mother's friends, who married into around $70 million.  She liked me; they had the proverbial big E shaped mansion, and she also sent me to two weeks at an expensive health retreat at one point, which is still one of my most positive memories.  I also spent probably 4.5 years living in a backpacker hostel, where I was at times visited by a millionaire who brought me very good quality, free marijuana, because he enjoyed my company.  On the low end, I've lived in one of the more degraded outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, where there were two attempts on my life, (not counting the above arson attempt) and where at times I only ate once every 2 days.

My mother died last September.  There is inheritance money coming.  It will be shared among probably 10 people, which means that I will be very surprised if my cut amounts to more than $2,000.  I can honestly say that if it turned out that I was not going to receive it, it would have absolutely no emotional effect on me whatsoever; and I would not let it affect me even if it was a larger amount.

I mention this, because in association with narcissistic parents, inheritance is one subject which induces a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth.  From what I've been seeing in this subreddit, a lot of you apparently have a degree of attachment to money, which renders you vulnerable to psychological control by those who have it.  You need to recognise this as a tactical weakness, and work on reducing it.

No matter what you do, money will come and go.  It's not necessarily going to be constant.  The risk of disinheritance is one of the most potent, tangible forms of control that narcissistic parents can have over their children, and if you are one of said children, you need to deny them that control.  Actively, explicitly ***demand*** to be cut out.  Tell them that you know damn well that it is exclusively a form of leverage that they have over you.  Watch them blindly panic in response.

Inheritance is not meant to be an anvil around the neck.  If you get some, great.  If you don't get some, ***also great.***  It is better to have no narcissistic parents and no inheritance, than narcissistic parents with inheritance.",1,1737258095.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I can't sleep all night. Partially, I blamed the coffee I drank earlier (yesterday), but for hours my mind keeps circling around a post that a redditor wrote. S/he lives in Netherlands, but s/he choose to write in English for bigger audience.

English is my second (well, technically third) language, and I never step into English speaking country my whole life, so I don't think my fluency is on a par with a native or those who have lived there for a long time. However, my major in college was English Lit, so I might not (that) bad..?

Dictions intriques me while grammar scares me.

The reason why I choose to write in my native language because this is my first work and I wanted to publish it with traditional publishers. After being published successfully, I'll translate them into English which should be much more easier for me rather than writing in English from the get-go.

Currently I'm on my 10.000 word marks, I was planning to have at least 100.000 words for the novel. However, after I read the post, I contemplate. I mean, I can just rewrote everything in English, hire an editor or something and do self-publishers like Amazon.

Do you think that my grammar is really bad? Should I just rewrote everything in English because it makes more sense (publication/career wise)? Or maybe, there is another suggestion? On my writing perhaps?

>With hesitation, the blond man sat next to her.

>He's a new man now, and he doesn't seem to remember me, she thought to herself.

>It's a new chapter. Her new chapter. She should write the ending that she always wanted to have. The never-have.

>From his light green canvas bag, he takes out his laptop. He rests his laptop on the lean wooden table and opens it.

>""Oh, you're working here?"" She asked, trying to initiate a conversation. Any conversation. It's a bar, practically a bar, it would be weird to work in this type of establishment anyway, she thought.

>""Oh, no. I just need to use the wi-fi so that I can upload some stuff.""

>""It's practically a bar, I mean with the loud music they've been playing all night, I wouldn't recommend working in here.""

>""It is, isn't it?""

>Dalia felt like she just did something horribly wrong. The conversation seems to be over. The perks of being a hyper introvert.

There are two reasons why not 100%. I'd think Helena would have a better story about waking up than in an old boring apartment. I mean she knew that would be asked. This sounded more like someone making it up as they went along. And reason #2: Too \*tropish\*. This is like when the evil twin takes over.
* The vending machine token jar was chalked full of tokens!
* For something that was five months in the making, Milchick's office is pretty unset. The lights near the door are still wrapped in plastic. It got a new coat of paint and new decor. Was it really five months? How long between the second Mark day when he was fired and the third Mark day when he returned with his fellow refiners?
* I love the motivational posters now in the break room. They're perfect corporate nonsense. They should sell those, so people can plaster them in their work places.
* The claymation of BellWorks Building is acurate. There's no reason why it needed to be because the innies never see it. 
* The only place where there were no microphones or cameras, the storage closet, is no more.
* The Wellness Center removal is pretty well documented. The name on the side of the door is still visible. The green waiting room chairs and the ghost of the two doors was visible. They didn't bother to update the wastcosting. Also, the room was opened. If this room is no longer used, you'd think it'd be locked and maybe the outer door removed. It's if they wanted Mark to find it.
* It's interesting of the two halves of the show. Why bother with the first half where Mark pretty much refuses to play along with Milchick? Was this originally Milchick Plan ""A""? Just keep the refiners separated? They don't seem to have been activated since the OTC. Or was this all of Milchick's plan? Make Mark think he's able to get his way. I see Milchick still has issues controling his emotions — especially anger. Ms. Cobel would be so much better handling the recalcitrant Mark. However, that's what I found confusing. Milchick seemed genuinely upset Mark was being obstinate. If this was part of the plan, why was he unable to control his emotions better. Maybe the second half was Plan ""B""?
* Milchick has been promoted. Did you notice that? Milchick is now the administrator for the WHOLE floor, and he has an assistant too! He can order her around to do meaningless tasks. Again, lack of emotional control. He was yelling at Ms. Huang about his welcome screen.
* Ms. Huang does appear to be a young girl. She's acting like one. She isn't an adult in a kid's body. She isn't pretending to be something she's not. And, she's bored as hell too. I was surprised she wasn't reading a book, but then I realized that books probably aren't allowed. 
* Again, Ms. Huang when she took the innies to the break room, she followed break room protocal. She let the innies in and closed the door behind them without getting inside even though she herself was going to the break room too. The break room has been reporposed to a sort of real break room lounge sans coffee machine. However, it's still only accessible  via that dark narrow tunnel. 
* Milchick is really pissed that his welcome screen hasn't.been updated. Can he not get on his computer at all? That wasn't his complaint. It was specifically the welcome screen. This shows two things to me: Milchick is not managing the severed floor that well. It's late in the day and he still hasn't done any work. Ms. Huang seems to have nothing to do either. Is there not a melon bar to prepare?
* The innies never checked out if O&D is still there. I'd think that would be something they'd check out.
* Dylan has shown a side he's never shown before. He was tender and caring to Irv. As Irv said, ""I'm your favorite perk!""
* The very last seen is Mark doing refinding for Cold Harbor, then another screen appears showing Gemma/Ms. Casey, but in a different appearance. Her hair was different and her makeup was very different. I didn't recognize her at first. That screen showed Mark's Cold Harbor file with the same refining percentages. There's a bit more information on that screen too. Is this a hint that the refiners are refining people like Ms. Casey? Or was this something in Mark's subconscious?",2,1737257480.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

In the beginning I often went without sleep. I found myself staying up until 11pm or midnight just to get everything done that I hadn't had time for earlier and to relish in the quite peace of not having anyone awake to demand on my time. It didn't take long to get burned out and realize this wasn't working.

We still had young children which meant I was still woken up intermittently by them during the six hours I was allowing myself to sleep. Not to mention the anxiety Jason often experienced that would wake him in the night, thus waking me as well. It was exhausting.

About three years ago I realized that there will always be things in need of doing, there will always be dishes to wash, laundry to fold, and floors to sweep. Men go to bed when tired. Women fight through it and try to accomplish everything. This isn't a comment on one method being superior to another, but a general observation. For years it annoyed me every time Jason would simply state ""I am tired"" or ""I don't feel well"" followed by ""I'm going to lay down."" I would stew for hours about how unfair it was that he could simply rest whenever he was tired, and I couldn't because someone had to clean the house/plan dinner/do all the things. And one day it occurred to me that nobody actually said I had to stay awake. Nobody told me that I was responsible for everything. I just assumed responsibility for it all and Jason and the kids just let me do it. 

These are the lessons learned that I want to impart tonight:

* You are not responsible for everything. Learn these two skills, delegation and prioritizing. Others are more willing to help maintain the home than we give them credit for. Not everything on our To-Do list actually needs to be done.
* Use the 5-5-5 rule. After you create your to-do list for the day, look at each item, one at a time, and ask yourself what would happen if you postponed doing the task for 5 minutes. If the answer is nothing, ask yourself what would happen if you postponed doing the task for 5 days. If the answer is still nothing, then ask yourself what would happen if you postponed doing the task for 5 months. If the answer is still nothing, scratch it off your list. Often, we put things on our to-do list that have no business being on there because they will sort themselves out on their own. 
* Get your sleep. Dedicate 8 hours to sleeping. Every. Single. Night. Personally, I must wake up at different times on different days (dialysis days, school days, etc.) For this reason, I give myself a 9pm bedtime. If I know I can sleep in until 6am or 7am I will stay up until 10pm. But never later. This is my one self-care routine that I staunchly protect (I say as I break the rule tonight to write this, knowing that I can sleep in until 8:30am tomorrow). And, honestly, it has made the biggest difference in my life.
* There is no competition in care. As a caregiver, you have a right to feel tired, sore, sick, achy, annoyed, and frustrated. Having the flu is not less horrible just because your spouse is sick from chemo. A tension headache is valid even if your spouse is enduring phantom limb pain. It isn't a competition. Your pain/health doesn't need to be worse than your spouse's to be valid. If you need to heal then do the work to heal. Do not ask for validation from others. Do not deny yourself healing because someone has it worse. 
* Function is 100% more important than form. As a former architecture student, I had deeply engrained beliefs that life needs to be beautiful. I often drove myself mad trying to make my house look like a magazine photo. Despite wondering where they kept their ""stuff"", I still aimed for that minimalist, clean look you see in magazines. It was always a failure, and I always felt stressed and exhausted. Eventually I abandoned that crazy notion and just went with doing things like everyone around me... eating dishes to the left of the sink, serving dishes to the right. We had to have coasters and coffee tables and end tables and bedrooms full of furniture.  Then Jason lost a leg. For the first time in our lives, we had to look at the world (and our home) from a wheelchair. This was my first realization that function supersedes form despite whether it looks right to anyone else. Eating dishes were moved to a lower cabinet, our double bed has been replaced by two twin beds, we no longer have carpeting or rugs as they are tripping hazards to amputees, and several other things that just make our lives easier. Do what makes life easier, not what society says you should.
* My favorite quote is this... Aut viam inveniam aut faclam. It means ""I shall either find a way or make one."" There was a time when I would have considered that quote to mean that I would find a way to get everything done and to be a mother, daughter, sister, friend, spouse, employee, etc. But now I think of it differently. I consider it to mean that I shall find a way to make our dreams come true or make it happen. Dreaming is of the utmost importance to a caregiver. I actually have a small trinket box full of tiny scrolls of paper. Each one has my dreams written on them. We often have more month than money since medical treatments are crazy expensive as are living expenses these days. But that doesn't mean I don't have a detailed sketch of the metal awning I want over the front door, or of the new-to-us car I want, or ideas for remodeling our bathroom. Just because it cannot happen today doesn't mean it can't happen ever. Be sure to keep your dreams alive. Even if it's just by writing them down somewhere.

This is a follow up:

So one and a half weeks in, stuff has improved a bit: I have lots of coffee chats with people planned and have slowly been making friends. Additionally, Ive made some rlly great friends at common cultural events. However, I still don’t have a friend group that I routinely hang out with across the week (like grab lunch, dinner, go to parties with, etc). I know that some other transfer students do but I think that’s cuz they got to NSO earlier than me and were all part of a NSO group where they shared common interests. 

So overall, things have improved and I definitely have friends but no friend group which is something I really want and am used to. Is it too late to join/ make a friend group since most people already have theirs? Will clubs be the answer to this or will clubs also be dominated by people who are already in preexisting friend groups? Any advice? ",1,1737257390.0,georgetown,0,1.0,False

1i4p1c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1i4p1c6/the_compendium_of_unfinished_thoughts/,The Compendium of Unfinished Thoughts,"**Beneath** the iridescent glow of a cracked streetlamp, a man stood holding a book that shouldn’t exist. His breath fogged in the frigid air as he stared at its cover: **The Compendium of Unfinished Thoughts**, embossed in tarnished silver, the font jagged like shattered glass. 

The stranger's hands trembled as he flipped the cover open. There were no publishing marks, no table of contents—only page after page of handwritten entries in an elegant, looping scrawl. Each entry was cut off mid-thought, as if the writer had been interrupted, or worse, erased midstream. But it wasn’t the eerie truncation that had drawn him in; it was the fact that the entries were his.  

Not words he had written. No, they were fragments of ideas he’d *thought* of and abandoned. A screenplay about a vigilante who only kills in dreams. A scheme to disappear from his dead-end life by faking his own demise. A fleeting notion to call his estranged sister. Every half-formed musing, every discarded possibility, spilled out across the pages, even those he hadn’t dared whisper to himself. 

“Where did you get this?” he demanded, voice tight with disbelief.  

The old bookseller, whose name he hadn’t bothered to ask when he’d stumbled into the dim, musty shop, merely smiled. His teeth were yellowed and uneven, his face a study in crags and shadows.  

“You’ve always had it,” the man replied cryptically, his voice like the scrape of stones. “You just didn’t know where to look.”  

Before he could press further, the shop bell tinkled. He spun to find himself alone, the shop now devoid of its proprietor. His questions fell into the stale air, swallowed by the oppressive silence of dust and dim light.  

He clutched the compendium tighter and left the shop, an itch of unease blossoming into a full-blown rash of dread.  

---

By the time Malcolm arrived at his apartment, he had read half the book. The entries weren’t just from his past; as he turned pages, the thoughts became increasingly recent, and unsettlingly precise.  

*The woman in the red coat at the coffee shop is following you.*  

That had been two hours ago. He hadn’t even noticed her until he saw the sentence, but the moment he looked up from the book, there she was—standing too still, her head angled just enough to suggest she was observing him from her peripheral vision.  

*Don’t take the elevator.*  

He took the stairs, his pulse thrumming like a live wire, and for good measure, he avoided his floor entirely, climbing up two extra flights before doubling back and entering his apartment with the lights off. The compendium pulsed in his grip like a living thing.  

---

The entries started changing. They began to *talk to him*.  

*You need to run. They know.*  

“Who?” Malcolm whispered hoarsely.  

The book didn’t answer.  

It didn’t have to.  

The knock on the door was soft, almost polite. But when he peered through the peephole, there was no one there. Only the echo of a shadow retreating down the hallway.  

---

By midnight, the compendium revealed its greatest twist: the thoughts that *weren’t his*.  

*Leave it on the table.*  

*Burn it before they find you.*  

*He’s already inside the apartment.*  

Malcolm froze. His breathing became shallow as he scanned the dimly lit room. The thought—no, the warning—felt immediate, present. But no matter how closely he examined his surroundings, he couldn’t find anyone.  

Then he noticed the book had fallen open on the floor. The words on the page shifted, as if an unseen hand was writing in real-time.  

*The stranger in the corner hasn’t moved. He’s watching you.*  

Every hair on his body stood on end. There was no one in the corner—just his coat draped over the arm of a chair. But as he stared, the shadow cast by the coat twitched, just slightly. Enough.  

---

Malcolm tried to leave. He tried to fling the book out the window, but the pages refused to release his grip, as if glued to his hands. He ran down the fire escape, his breath a jagged saw through his chest, only to find himself standing outside the bookstore again, the sign in the window reading CLOSED, despite the faint light flickering within.  

The compendium flipped open to a new page as if moved by the wind, but there was no breeze.  

*They only want the book. You’re just a complication.*  

The words seared into his mind like a brand. He spun around, heart jackhammering, and came face to face with the woman in the red coat.  

She smiled—a slow, wolfish grin that bore no warmth. In her hand, she held a pen, the same tarnished silver as the book’s title.  

“Sign your name,” she said, her voice honeyed poison. “Finish your story, Malcolm.”  

He glanced at the compendium, its pages now blank except for a single unfinished thought: *What happens if you refuse?*  

The woman’s grin widened as she leaned closer.  

“Let’s find out.”  

Malcolm’s pulse roared in his ears. He stepped back, but the woman in the red coat didn’t follow. She simply held out the pen, its silver surface reflecting the fractured glow of the streetlamp above.  

His name. That’s all she wanted.  

Something inside him screamed *don’t do it*.  

“I don’t sign blank checks,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt.  

The woman tilted her head, amused. “But you already have,” she murmured. “Every unfinished thought you abandoned, every fork in the road you ignored, every unrealized version of yourself—this book owns them now.” She tapped the compendium with the pen, and a ripple shuddered across the pages.  

Malcolm’s knees locked. The words on the page reappeared, shifting, rearranging—sentences stretching and breaking apart like living tendrils. They weren’t just unfinished thoughts anymore. They were entire *lives* he had never lived.  

A version of himself that had left the city ten years ago.  
One that had married a woman he barely remembered.  
Another that had never quit writing, who had finished that novel, who had *been somebody*.  

And then—one that had already signed his name in the book.  

That Malcolm was kneeling, eyes wide in horror, as his body eroded into ink, his skin running like wet paint, dissolving into the parchment.  

The compendium fluttered open to the very last page. His name had already begun to etch itself there, dark and incomplete.  

Malcolm stumbled back, bile rising in his throat. “No,” he rasped. “This isn’t real.”  

The woman in the red coat arched a brow. “What is real?” she mused. “The Malcolm who stood at that street corner and chose left instead of right? The one who made a phone call instead of keeping silent? The one who never picked up this book?” She stepped closer, voice low and measured. “You’re just a sketch. A version that got far enough to see what he missed.”  

The pen was in his hand. He didn’t remember taking it.  

*Finish your story, Malcolm.*  

His breath hitched.  

“I don’t want this.”  

The woman smiled, pitying. “It doesn’t matter what you want.”  

The book writhed in his grip, its pages flipping violently, as if it were *deciding* something. His name grew darker, the ink thickening, dragging itself toward completion.  

Panic seized him. He did the only thing he could think to do.  

He *ripped* the page.  

The world convulsed. The air shattered like glass, splitting into jagged shards of sound and light. The street, the lamplight, the woman in red—all of it *collapsed inward*, folding into a screaming void.  

Malcolm fell.  

---

He woke up gasping.  

His apartment.  

Morning light streamed through the window, unfiltered and sharp.  

His hands flew to his chest, to his arms. Solid. He was still here. Still himself.  

The book—*gone*.  

He nearly sobbed with relief.  

It had to be a nightmare. A hallucination. He had been exhausted, stressed, and his mind had conjured up something horrible to punish him for it.  

He exhaled shakily, pressing a hand to his forehead. “Jesus,” he muttered. “Never again.”  

A knock at the door.  

His stomach lurched.  

Slowly, he rose, stepping toward it with measured breath. He hesitated, then forced himself to look through the peephole.  

Nothing.  

Just an empty hallway.  

But as he turned away, his heart hammering, he saw it.  

On his desk.  

A single page.  

Torn at the edges.  

And at the bottom, in ink that hadn’t yet dried—

Since the sink would hardly be used I'm hoping there's an option to use a 5 gallon water jug and 6 gallon waste bucket.  I'm not seeing many options.  I see some options for ice makers and coffee makers that produce 40 psi. I'd like something that activates when the sink lever is opened and doesn't require it to be turned on every time.   Not sure how to find this or if it even exists. Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Is this even legal for a basement bar?  I do have hot and cold lines available but I don't want to use this option because it would have to drain into a 6 gallon waste bucket and I wouldn't want to risk an overflow and flood. ,1,1737256847.0,Plumbing,2,1.0,False

28y/o M here. I'm a business owner in the medical field. I met this girl who is a 22 y/o freelance healthcare worker who comes from time to time to work at my company and other places as well. She's a very shy person, no social media, very subtle about her life, etc. Let's just say the moment I saw her I immediately felt attracted to her. Things we're a bit tricky since I theoretically was her boss and she worked for me so I needed to be careful when asking her out.

Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to ask her out. She accepts, great! We only went for a coffee the first time and I paid for everything like a man should. We went to a couple more dates afterwards. All that time I was acting like a gentleman: picking her up to her place, paying for everything, etc. I liked her so much I would've done anything for her. She said she loved coffee, I would go get the premium brand and give it to her. She said she needed to learn a certain type of software for her job, I got it for her, etc. I did all of that without expecting anything in return except maybe a sign or two of affection from her.

She tells me that she appreciates me and enjoys being with me but I don't believe her. A few things have been bothering me so far and I'm beginning to wonder if im too invested in her and if I should let her go.

1. She takes forever to reply. When we went on dates, I noticed she always had her phone on her and would frequently check messages related her job. Yet, when I text her, she takes anywhere from 3 to 6 hours to reply to me. Every. Time. I confronted her about it and she said she gets so many messages it's hard for her to keep track of everything.
2. She refused my kiss on our second date, and refused to come to my place on the third. I tried to kiss her in the car after the date but she said she wasn't ready yet. So far, we've been to 5 dates and we only hold hands and hug. On our third date we went to a restaurant and I suggested we go to my place to watch a movie (I wasn't planning anything sexual since im religious like her), but she refused. She keeps telling me that she will come to me by herself when she's ready.
3. She was working on a start up and I told her I would go to an event that they organized to support her. She said she would be there only right before to organize and that she had to go afterwards. She didn't even want to stay 5 seconds to greet me...
4. What bothered and hurt me the most was that she charged me an extra hour in my company for some work she did (which she didn't have to do) when on my side I was paying for EVERYTHING so far during our dates, I came to support her startup, I offered her what she loved and needed (coffee, softwares for her job) all that for free and without expecting anything. I don't care about the money but, what hurt me was that despite everything I did for her, she charged me for the extra hour like I was just some random business for her.

What should I do about this? She keeps telling me she needs time to adapt to someone and that she likes me and wants to move forward with me, but everything she does shows she doesn't respect me or my time...",3,1737256424.0,relationships,8,0.8,False

It ended so suddently and im still mindblown by her actions but also seen a light on her true behaviour that I was perhaps ignoring. 

I've had a bit of a time the past year or so, cutting off from toxic family and she was a great support to me, if she could relate to it. She seemed to thrive on drama though, and always seemed to have some sort of crisis. Health, other people doing her dirty, health again, people doing her bad, time after time. I really sympathised at first but noticed she would let tiny things become huge things that would be a stop on her life for months. We had a project together and I put everything on hold for her, including my own mental health and needs. I also paid for absolutely everything and lent her money a few times. 

It started to get a bit frustrating for me, because I've really tried to help myself and not be a burden to others and I try to process things and move forward.  It's draining but I feel I'm at a good place as I can be. I feel bad but it started to annoy me when people thrive on drama but don't do anything to help themselves when I've tried so hard, I know that's unfair of me though. 

She moved into my house as she was wanting to try live in a new city, a decision that she ummed and ahhed about for so long then suddenly decided to act on one day. 

Almost instantly after moving in she became quite depressed at the move not going her way, not getting work straight away and quickly gave up and did nothing to help herself. She was, I think? Wanting advice but had a fight back for every little thing I said. 

I was really busy with work, she moved in in the middle of me working away, then I went straight into another job locally.  She quickly spiralled into depression with things not going her way and I was waking up to messages about being suicidal and wanting to self harm, which really messed with my head. I tried to put boundaries in and ask her to come to me in person if possible as its quite a lot to wake up to. She just turned on it me and said sorry I got triggered. 

I was trying to involve her in as many social things as I could, meeting new friends, trying to hook her up with work, new people. I started to feel like i was treading on eggshells more and more and felt resentment from her towards me. One evening she was giving me daggers all night but wouldn't speak to me, but was lovely to everyone else. 

She wouldn't talk to me at all eventually, deliberately. I kept saying I can't help you ( that's what I felt she was asking for) if you don't talk to me. She kept saying she didn't want to bother me, but would come to me when she was at her worst and again send me messages to wake up to saying she was suicidal and wanted to self harm. I was really getting stuck in what to do. Meanwhile this is all happening whilst she's living in my house. 

Nye I invited her to my friends party, she just left within 10 minutes and didn't tell anyone. I spent the last hour of the night on the phone with her, she was telling me that she was suicidal and wanted to self harm. I was trying to give her advice, listen to her but anything she didn't agree with she made it obvious. I felt like i was constantly doing something wrong but just wanted to be there for her. Bare in mind she'd always say the next day she never really meant it about self harm. 

New years day she was moping around the house, and it was just too much at that point. I had one day off, i find christmas hard and I just wanted one nice night NYE to let my hair down, and chill out the day after. 

A few days after she wanted to talk and I kept saying can we go for a coffee tomorrow, let's have a big chat I want to help. I couldn't really go into right then as I had to leave for work. She went into everything anyway, which I couldn't really say no to and as soon as I said something she didn't agree with she flipped a lid and went into a panic attack which sent me into a panic attack. She left the house and I went to compose myself as I had to go to work. 

I spent all day worrying about her, then she eventually text me back saying she was going back to her parents to get better. Which I agreed was the best thing. 

The day after she went back, she came to my house and moved everything out behind my back whilst I was at work and didn't tell me. She ignored my messages all that day asking how she was. 

When I found out via my partner she'd moved out, I got really upset. I felt used. She had been ghosting me really for a few days. I messaged her in a angry state saying f*ck you I don't deserve this. 

The next morning she'd blocked me everywhere. Deleted our social media for a project we had together and told everyone we've stopped doing it. 

She still won't talk to me, but tbh good riddance. I just don't understand why she's made me the bad person in this. All I ever did was try to help her, welcomed her to my home charging no rent. Tried to set her up in a new city, whilst giving her the space to do what she needed to do with no money worry for her. 

I feel used, abandoned and like I've been made into a scapegoat. I've apologised in an email and tried to make amends depiste being upset by her actions but all she's done is made me feel like I've been the bad guy. 

Life's too short, and I can't be bothered with stress that I don't need- I don't have much energy for it anymore.

# Looping in Laos


Firstly, big love and thanks to Nicolas for making some amazing maps of southern Laos for all of us! *(more on this later)*

His GPS map markers inspired me to make my own for the Thakhek Loop. Every stop, and how to get there. Recommended guesthouses (and ones to avoid). Restaurants (and ordering suggestions). Ticket/entry prices, where to park, etc etc. Everything possible to make navigating the Thakhek Loop as easy as possible. *(more on this later)*

# Which Loop to loop?

For people trying to decide if you should do one or the other, or both, and wondering what the difference is, here's my summary:

#### What is the Bolaven/Pakse Loop about?

* Waterfalls
* Hiking
* Amazing vistas (landscape views)
* Coffee

>3-8 days (tending to shorter) driving to places to hike (short or long), explore, photograph. There's some great food, lots of cheap places to stay (100k-150k guesthouses/motels (Jan'25)), and overall, it's fairly easy. The few dirt roads aren't a big challenge for solo semi-automatic riders, but some would be tricky for 2-up automatic novice drivers.

####What is the Thadhek Loop about?
* Caves
* Cold rivers, pools & swimming
* The drive itself
* Climbing\*

>4-10 days (tending to the middle), with the drive itself being absolutely gorgeous. The new roads make even going to Xe Bang Fai Cave an easy trip. There are so many options for exploring caves (bring your own lights, both spot and flood), wild camping (if that's your thing) and passing through amazing little villages that are absolutely lovely and full of the nicest people.

>\*re: climbing: not part of the loop in the exploring sense, but one of the reasons people come to this area is specifically for the climbing. No driving, no 'touristing', just there for the rock climbing. Apparently, some of the best in the world!

In both cases, the south-west parts of the loops are heavily touristified, but not entirely. It is good for people short on time (day trips are possible).

So which should you do? They're different. Surprisingly so. What if you only have 2 days? Meh. Up to you. 3 days? You're rushing, seeing the big stuff, I don't see it being relaxed and fun, but then, I'm not 18 any more. This isn't about itineraries, but about expectations.

I don't like long stints in the saddle; I prefer to drive for 20-80 minutes at most and stop for a while, rinse, repeat. Admittedly, the worse the road condition, the more mentally taxing it is, and the less time I want to spend driving before taking a break. Good roads are great for listening to audiobooks. Some places are great for stopping for an hour or more and reading a book, taking a nap, eating a snack... I'm on holiday, and I don't want to treat it like a job, a series of tasks to complete before I can go home.

The Loops are full of wonderful places to stop for a while at, which can really blow out the duration, especially in dry season (Nov-Feb) when the days are shorter, and the cold nights are not fun for driving in.

# Pakse Info!

Pakse, the Bolaven Loop, Champasak and the 4000 Islands all wonderfully mapped out.

The map pdfs are amazing, and used by all the bike rentals and hostels around (and rightly so). Plus, his GPS bookmarks for Pakse and the Bolaven Loop are spectacular. His work really makes navigating the Bolaven Loop so much easier and more interesting!

Unfortunately, Laos has blocked the entire wixsites domain (yes, that Wix!), so his work isn't accessible inside Laos. You can get to it from anywhere else, otherwise, you need a proxy or a VPN.

A simple way to get to it right now is use a web proxy, like: https://proxyium.com/ and then copy-paste the URL onto it:
[https://pakseinfo.wixsite.com/freeinfo](https://pakseinfo.wixsite.com/freeinfo)
(others are https://plainproxies.com/resources/free-web-proxy, https://www.steganos.com/en/free-online-web-proxy or https://www.proxysite.com/ - just search for ""free web proxy"")

*[I hope to edit and update this when a long term solution is up and running]*

#### Using GPS Bookmarks

The GPS Bookmark files from Nicolas and I are suitable for any OpenStreetMap app, like **Maps.Me, OsmAnd** or **OrganicMaps**. Personally, I like **OrganicMaps**, since it's simple and completely free. Install an app, open it and zoom into Laos where it should ask you to download the map file for Laos. Once that's done, grab the GPS bookmark file. On Android, just opening the file should have it automatically open and added to your app, but on iOS you will probably have to manually add the bookmark file in the app. Here's some links to save you searching:

## GPS Bookmarks for the Thakhek Loop

I've recently completed a 14 day trek of the Thadhek Loop (30 Dec to 12 Jan) and now I have a massive bookmark file to share with all of you for this area. Lots of guesthouses (with prices), restaurants (with recommendations), and information on how to actually get to some destinations are all in there, in the descriptions. Also, a lot of markings that need to be verified, checked out, etc. Please, let me know of any corrections or updates, or additions. There's a bunch of caves which need proper locations still, for example.

When I did the Bolaven loop around Dec 22-28, I added and tweaked a little of Nicolas' work, and my updated version is here as well.

**Please share it far and wide.** *Feel free to do what you want with it (except sell it), but please always include credits.*

**This links to my Google Drive:**

***[https://laos.divingaround.asia](https://laos.divingaround.asia)***

*(not a blog or anything, just a redirection link to make it easier for people to share the files)*

In the Thadhek Loop folder, you will also find a bunch of the tourist maps from the Laos Tourism booklet scanned as jpgs for you. They're not perfect, but it's something.

I've got a bunch of footage of the roads from the GoPro I had strapped to the front of my bike, so if there's any requests about road quality, I can try to find snippets for people (like, the road construction east of Nahin, which is fine, in my opinion. Unless you're in a car.)",3,1737255766.0,laos,0,1.0,False

1i4oib1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1i4oib1/luckyscent_haul_first_impressions/,LuckyScent Haul First Impressions,"\- Sora Dora Jany: Spiced apple candle. Definitely a red apple. Feels very autumnal. Spilled a little on my skin and it opens up to include an interesting steamed white rice note. My partner says it smells like a sweet drink.

\- Hilde Soliani Sempre Natale: Cloves! Mulling spices! Reminds me of gluwein without the wine. Has a lovely sillage just on the dabber wand, makes me think it may open up absolutely beautifully on skin.

\- Theodoris Kalotini Cinnamon Rolls: I think this one suffered from being sniffed *right* after two *very* spice-heavy scents. All we got was the butter. It leans a little movie-theater, artificial, margarine. My partner made quite a scrunch face.

\- By Killian Black Phantom: Smells nothing like coffee, in a masculine way. My partner says it smells like ""dirt, but not in a bad way."" I want to re-sniff this one with a fresh nose.

\- By Killian Rolling in Love: Very pleasant. Soft. Sort've floral. Well-blended in the way where it's hard to pick out any individual notes. Recalls lotions from my youth. I sound underwhelmed but it's actually very pretty and would be a perfect bedtime scent. Dare I call it cozy?

\- Strangers Sweet Farewell: Also very soft and inoffensive, but with a strange peppery note jarring an otherwise cozy composition. You get soft, perfumed, very milky rice... and black pepper. Not sure where that's coming from. I'm very pepper-sensitive so this one might end up a scrubber.

\- Strangers Chokedee: Smells like a green, generic mall perfume, then morphs into a green banana. A modern banana, at that, not a banana candy. Confusing but in a way that makes me want to try it on skin to see what it becomes.

\- J-scent Rakugan: I smelled this one before all the others and got fruity notes--green apple, almost. Smelling it again with a more fatigued nose, I mostly get a faint round sweetness. My partner likes it, though he can't really identify any of the notes. Another that deserves a sniff all by itself.

\- Parfumerie Generale Musc Maori: Chocolate! Though leaning more Tootsie-roll than dark artisanal bar. It's lighter than my usual Jousset Le Gourmand. More powder, probably because of the musk. I don't know that I need another chocolate--Le Gourmand does what I want--but it's interesting to see another facet of the note.

\- Kyse Zuccero Filato: Opens with a rotting strawberry note that made me say, ""Ew!"" out loud. My partner got it, too. Thankfully that dies away within seconds, and you're left with strawberry spun sugar. The strawberry leans more naturalistic--and more sour--than your average strawberry cotton candy, constantly flirting with the edge of overripe. Apart from that bombastic opening, the scent is actually quite tame sillage-wise.

\- Cirque de Soleil: Strawberry jam on a funnel cake with popcorn somewhere in the vicinity. Flowers happen briefly but the main star is strawberry-butter-pastry. I find it a very cozy scent. Partner thinks it 'meh.' We're at the very end of our sniffing journey so I think his nose is just fatigued. Another that deserves its own sniff tomorrow!

A brief note on LuckyScent itself: Whoever is in charge of filling up the vials is doing a good job! They're so full I'm almost nervous to open them. Definitely getting your money's worth.",6,1737255412.0,Perfumes,3,1.0,False

It reels you back in again; no human can restrict forever, life is ups and downs, you don't need to punish yourself during the down period by doing more math. Spending money is not like drinking where you can just cut it out. It's like eating where you have to eat. 

I had a realization that, as my subscription was about to renew: why am I spending endless time creating and maintaining an artificial balance sheet of my financial situation instead of just checking their websites and apps every so often like a normal person? How does this benefit me? If, worst case scenario, my bank account overdrafts so what, the bank has mechanisms to deal with that, and you aren't automatically evicted and put in debtor's prison. 

I don't think it's healthy for me - or most people - to obsess over our money like this. Especially when this system tries to convince you that your situation is more precarious than it truly is so they can guilt you into paying them year after year. The assumption that you can only use the money you have now (because what if there's an emergency??) is asinine and designed to rob you of any natural feeling of stability. You shouldn't be on edge every day about an emergency!! 

The following are facts:

- I just put $200 in savings for the first time in a year (maybe more?) because I realized, oh, if I'm not really paying attention to the app anymore, I can just move this money in the bank app and I'm done. I don't have to go back and enter it on another app and check my math and extend the process.  

- Credit card tracking is insane; you shouldn't have to constantly be doing math with the money you're spending, that doesn't help whatever the problem may be. It doesn't help you to do endless arithmetic that weighs 'dog toy surplus' and 'gas bill' in equal units by default and makes you do the emotional labor of picking and choosing """"""what's important to you"""""" by moving money around a spreadsheet.  

  - Without the app, you can get the gas bill, pay the gas bill, see that there's less money in the bank, and simply be aware of that and use that to inform your spending in a way that's far more natural than spending hours making sure all the numbers line up to the cent.  

- This process doesn't benefit anybody but the people who charge $109 a year to keep you hooked on the game. (i like how even the nice budget people are playing the rounding game with you)

- Aren't these guys Mormons? They don't even drink coffee, of course they would love an app where you drive yourself insane worrying about literal pennies on the dollar for every transaction forever. 

They advertise ""Stop second-guessing your spending"" but the app is literally built around doing this!!",0,1737255356.0,ynab,7,0.16,False

Any tips or advice on how to heal from this are welcome and appreciated. Thanks ❤️ (also I’m very bad at punctuation but I tried my best, sorry!) (also also, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes) 

2,5 months ago I 26F met a girl via a shared friend at a party. We hit it off immediately. We have a lot of shared interests and we live pretty close, about a 30 minute drive. We start talking and eventually exchange numbers. For two weeks, we talk every day start to end. We have the same humour and I caught myself audibly laughing at messages multiple times. 

Eventually we meet up for coffee and it’s great, no awkward silences but just talking and laughing. I was super excited and pretty giddy to see her again so I invited her over for a movie night a couple days later. We ended up doing this at her place. It was a lot of fun! Her boyfriend was really nice and it felt so easy, like me and her knew each other for years. 

A week passes and we have a movie night at my place. Again no weird silences or anything out of the ordinary. She even got me a couple of gifts and told me she was happy she met me. 

But all of a sudden, after that last movie night she’s just gone completely ice cold on me. I mean a complete 180 degree turn. For the past three weeks, she doesn’t text me anymore, I start every conversation and even then, it takes her either five days to reply, or she doesn’t respond at all. When I express my concerns about this - like if I have done something wrong and if she’s okay - she just says nothing is wrong. I’ve tried asking her if she needed space, which was met with a “no”. Her birthday was three days ago, I sent her a card and a present but she hasn’t said anything. 

I’m honestly devastated. I’m mad at my brain for not being able to let this go. I’ve known her for such a short time, but those few weeks it really felt like I had a buddy. My other two friends live quite far and it was so cool to have someone close by. She was also just a really cool person. 

The thought that I’m struggling with this every day while she has probably forgotten about me makes me so sad. I know messaging her further doesn’t work because she doesn’t reply, and I know she’s fine because she’s active on instagram. 

Reading this back it may sound like I’m in love with her but I have a boyfriend and I’m in a happy relationship. I just tend to get attached to people and I hadn’t experienced such a carefree and fun friendship in a loooooong time. It really felt like something for life for a while. 

Like I said, any tips or advice is welcome. I’ve been feeling pretty shitty because of this. I really wish I could stop caring about the people who don’t care about me. ",1,1737254790.0,internetparents,2,1.0,False

I've seen her a few times prior and we had some good convos but that's it. I noticed when I took off my shirt she was checking me out

My friend was oncall and he got hit with a sev2 that required he hop on a call. He expected it to take about 30 min to 1hr so his gf Veronica suggested that her and I go grab coffee, which I agreed to.

I do think she finds me attractive as I've noticed her checking me out before. For example, checking out my body when were all at the beach, as well as little glances at me. However attraction itself doesn't mean much - you can find other people attractive even when in a relationship; it's not something you can control.

She seemed kind of nervous but we had normal convo, it almost felt like a first date where you get to know someone else. However twice she mentioned two different situations with Alex (her bf, my good friend) that were somewhat negative, like she complained about his schedule and his driving habits. She also repeatedly mentioned that I should hang out with them more often. I've always felt that she was on-the-fence about Alex, and apparently he'd wanted to get more serious sooner but she'd told him she wanted to take things slower since her sister had recently gotten divorced and she wanted to learn from her mistakes (reasonable).

Alex finished his call so we headed back. We were having normal conversation when suddenly she asked ""are you single or seeing someone?"" That wasn't related at all to the prior topic so I was surprised but quickly answered that I'd recently broken up, to which she said ""sorry... How did you guys meet? App or through friends?"" I answered, then told her I was single and that she should introduce her friends to me, to which she mumbled ""sure"".

As she was parking, she again mentioned I should hang out with them more often and that her and Alex were getting dinner tonight and that I should join.

\------

I'm trying to understand why she asked me if I was single or not. The question itself doesn't necessarily mean much, but it's the way she asked - she was clearly waiting to ask it, and the moment there was a lull in the convo she immediately blurted it out, which makes me believe she was thinking about it for a bit.

The only thing I can think of is she's interested in me and is testing the waters, but I really don't like that explanation though so I'm asking for some perspective here - are there any other reasons she might have asked me that?",1,1737254720.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

White shirts and clean haircuts, coffee cups here and there upon desks. Eyes scan left to right, left to right, behind glasses with monitor glare reflections.

The websites being scrolled and monitored are Reddit, x.com, 4chan, and several other major discussion boards and social media sites.

Feedback is tracked, noted, and logged. Points are allotted towards threads coming in of ""people giving up"" on UFO disclosure, to people defending the cause. Assets in place, working on behalf of the agencies within the UFO community, are having their work come to full fruition.

Several threads right here in this subreddit are titled with people leaving or unsubbing the UFO topics. Surely eyes in the agencies have already seen each one of these, and dulely taken note.

This is the scene I would easily believe is taking place. For weeks now I have been losing my faith and interest in the ufology community as I've determined the high likelihood of disclosure advocate after disclosure advocate is probably working in some part or some degree as controlled disinfo.

I will not go down the list of names and start throwing accusational mud at the major players, in the event I'm mistaken and that they're actually well meaning, legitimate journalists.

I won't bother with a detailed essay listing all the small hints, vocal tones, body queues, and rehearsed signs and signals which I believe are aplenty to add suspicion the more you pay attention.

But that is where I've moved in my opinions on the matter.

So where do I currently stand on the issue now?

I believe, despite the sarcasm and pessimism of my post so far, disclosure IS happening sooner than later, and that things are really coming to a head. I've shifted to the speculation that the agencies know - for any number of possible reasons, of which good cases and arguments have been made - that disclosure is happening whether they want it to or not, and can't hold it back indefinitely. And so, I think they are actively using controlled misinformation to either A. Burn out and disappoint peoples' interest just like is happening tonight with New Max, in order to buy them more time before disclosure as the public walks away from the topic, or B. Slow drip *but still using lies, disinfo, or misdirection* to prime the public but without actually giving up their secret toys and capability.

I just really don't think anymore the disclosure community is a group of genuine, external and independent journalists working for no one else but the people and the truth, and I'll leave it at that and not throw mud.

And if one of these journalists wants to win our trust?

1. Stop playing games, ""teehee, I have answers, but I can't tell you.""
2. Stop putting info behind pay walls
3. Stop promising ""things will happen soon""
4. Stop prefixing every single statement you make with ""I've heard.."" and ""I've been told"". WHETHER YOU HAVE OR NOT, this is the language of conartists, so you'd think you'd pick a better strategy for engaging with your audience other than aligning 99% with conartists/fraud/grifter behavioral patterns",18,1737254521.0,conspiracy,12,0.78,False

When I express my concerns about this - like if I have done something wrong and if she’s okay - she just says nothing is wrong. I’ve tried asking her if she needed space, which was met with a “no”. Her birthday was three days ago, I sent her a card and a present but she hasn’t said anything. 

I’m honestly devastated. I’m mad at my brain for not being able to let this go. I’ve known her for such a short time, but those few weeks it really felt like I had a buddy. My other two friends live quite far and it was so cool to have someone close by. She was also just a really cool person. 

The thought that I’m struggling with this every day while she has probably forgotten about me makes me so sad. I know messaging her further doesn’t work because she doesn’t reply, and I know she’s fine because she’s active on instagram. 

Reading this back it may sound like I’m in love with her but I have a boyfriend and I’m in a happy relationship. I just tend to get attached to people and I hadn’t experienced such a carefree and fun friendship in a loooooong time. It really felt like something for life for a while. 

Like I said, any tips or advice is welcome. I’ve been feeling pretty shitty because of this. ",1,1737254433.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1i4o728,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i4o728/hey_you/,Hey you,"Hello my darling,

I haven’t heard that in a while but this is what popped up in my mind to address you today. I miss you. I miss us, if there was an us at all and not a figment of my imagination. A mirage on a hazy sultry summer night.

I found one of our older messages today. Where you promised never to leave me hanging and that you are not going anywhere. The chat I could send in my most vulnerable thoughts and my most intrusive brain farts to, my hand trembles if I open it and can’t type a single “Hi” to. I know you’re on the other end, living and breathing despite telling me if I don’t hear from you I can safely assume you got hit by a car. 

You said you were settling for less and putting up with bad behaviour in your life before me, the irony of it is I did the same when I was with you. Over pouring to make up for the empty spaces you left. You said you treat people like how they treat you, I wonder when I made you feel like you were asking for too much by standing up for yourself.

You came after me. Chased me. Built trust. Kept coming back after I pushed you away. Held me close. Stayed with me when I was having really bad nights. Made me laugh. Checked in on me. Denied anything was wrong when I repeatedly asked you. Denied me clarity and closure when I asked if I can just say good bye now. Decided to walk out of my life on a Tuesday.

You had a way around you to make strangers feel good. Your kindness extended to people around you known and unknown and the stark lack of it made me cry into my pillow for days. The trust you built and broke had me questioning the authenticity of our every reaction. 

It has been weeks and I held a private funeral, grieved and let go. I walked past your place with a friend today as we were getting lunch and I couldn’t help but think you were just there on the other side of brick and glass. A part of me wants to throw pebbles at a grown man’s window and the other part wants to rage. 

In the end you were not the man you said you were. I stayed true to my word till then end. I deeply cared about you, but it was time I showed up for myself than keep showing up for you. Where do I put down all our memories? Where do I dispose off the knowledge that you liked your coffee black and your burgers loaded with extra onions? 

If some day you do become emotionally available to another person, I hope you can actually make room to receive their love and not play with it and go back to your old patterns. 

C, If we cross paths again, say hi. Reach out, text me. I hate myself for it but I will reply. I never reached out because I didn’t want to see Read: 9:35 pm. Please linger. 

Please. 

Love,

1i4o71b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtsyWeirdoPerfume/comments/1i4o71b/luckyscent_haul_first_impressions/,LuckyScent Haul First Impressions,"\- Sora Dora Jany: Spiced apple candle. Definitely a red apple. Feels very autumnal. Spilled a little on my skin and it opens up to include an interesting steamed white rice note. My partner says it smells like a sweet drink.

\- Hilde Soliani Sempre Natale: Cloves! Mulling spices! Reminds me of gluwein without the wine. Has a lovely sillage just on the dabber wand, makes me think it may open up absolutely beautifully on skin.

\- Theodoris Kalotini Cinnamon Rolls: I think this one suffered from being sniffed *right* after two *very* spice-heavy scents. All we got was the butter. It leans a little movie-theater, artificial, margarine. My partner made quite a scrunch face.  

\- By Killian Black Phantom: Smells nothing like coffee, in a masculine way. My partner says it smells like ""dirt, but not in a bad way."" I want to re-sniff this one with a fresh nose.

\- By Killian Rolling in Love: Very pleasant. Soft. Sort've floral. Well-blended in the way where it's hard to pick out any individual notes. Recalls lotions from my youth. I sound underwhelmed but it's actually very pretty and would be a perfect bedtime scent. Dare I call it cozy? 

\- Strangers Sweet Farewell: Also very soft and inoffensive, but with a strange peppery note jarring an otherwise cozy composition. You get soft, perfumed, very milky rice... and black pepper. Not sure where that's coming from. I'm very pepper-sensitive so this one might end up a scrubber. 

\- Strangers Chokedee: Smells like a green, generic mall perfume, then morphs into a green banana. A modern banana, at that, not a banana candy. Confusing but in a way that makes me want to try it on skin to see what it becomes.

\- J-scent Rakugan: I smelled this one before all the others and got fruity notes--green apple, almost. Smelling it again with a more fatigued nose, I mostly get a faint round sweetness. My partner likes it, though he can't really identify any of the notes. Another that deserves a sniff all by itself.

\- Parfumerie Generale Musc Maori: Chocolate! Though leaning more Tootsie-roll than dark artisanal bar. It's lighter than my usual Jousset Le Gourmand. More powder, probably because of the musk. I don't know that I need another chocolate--Le Gourmand does what I want--but it's interesting to see another facet of the note.

\- Kyse Zuccero Filato: Opens with a rotting strawberry note that made me say, ""Ew!"" out loud. My partner got it, too. Thankfully that dies away within seconds, and you're left with strawberry spun sugar. The strawberry leans more naturalistic--and more sour--than your average strawberry cotton candy, constantly flirting with the edge of overripe. Apart from that bombastic opening, the scent is actually quite tame sillage-wise. 

\- Cirque de Soleil: Strawberry jam on a funnel cake with popcorn somewhere in the vicinity. Flowers happen briefly but the main star is strawberry-butter-pastry. I find it a very cozy scent. Partner thinks it 'meh.' We're at the very end of our sniffing journey so I think his nose is just fatigued. Another that deserves its own sniff tomorrow!

A brief note on LuckyScent itself: Whoever is in charge of filling up the vials is doing a good job! They're so full I'm almost nervous to open them. Definitely getting your money's worth.

Not sure if quitting has messed with my depersonalization / derealization episodes but I’ve felt extremely different without it. Anyone else relate? I just feel so in my body and aware of myself now. It’s rather strange. ",7,1737254337.0,decaf,6,0.9,False

Any tips or advice on how to heal from this are welcome and appreciated. Thanks ❤️ (also I’m very bad at punctuation but I tried my best, sorry!) (also also, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes) 

2,5 months ago I 26F met a girl via a shared friend at a party. We hit it off immediately. We have a lot of shared interests and we live pretty close, about a 30 minute drive. We start talking and eventually exchange numbers. For two weeks, we talk every day start to end. We have the same humour and I caught myself audibly laughing at messages multiple times. 

Eventually we meet up for coffee and it’s great, no awkward silences but just talking and laughing. I was super excited and pretty giddy to see her again so I invited her over for a movie night a couple days later. We ended up doing this at her place. It was a lot of fun! Her boyfriend was really nice and it felt so easy, like me and her knew each other for years. 

A week passes and we have a movie night at my place. Again no weird silences or anything out of the ordinary. She even got me a couple of gifts and told me she was happy she met me. 

But all of a sudden, after that last movie night she’s just gone completely ice cold on me. I mean a complete 180 degree turn. For the past three weeks, she doesn’t text me anymore, I start every conversation and even then, it takes her either five days to reply, or she doesn’t respond at all.

1i4nzna,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4nzna,"25[F4M] - Manchester / UK / Europe / Canada / USA – seeking a loving, caring, fulfilling relationship.","Hello, hope you’re having a lovely weekend! I’ve had limited luck with dating apps and meeting in person has also been tricky, so giving this platform a go. 

I’m 25, straight, woman, childfree, and only align with monogamy. I’m looking for someone who’s emotionally available and is fully ready and open to the possibility of a long-term, committed partnership. If things work out, I also hope to settle down with the person and envision marriage down the line. I want to take things slowly – get to know each other first, see if we’re compatible on key things (habits, values, future, etc.), and then go from there. This is going to be a lengthy post, but I want to be open about myself and what I’m looking for on here – thanks for taking the time to read this! 

About me: 
* I’m based in Manchester, UK and fully enjoy living here and absolutely love this city. I’d ideally like to date within Manchester/Northern England/UK, but am also open to long-distance (i.e., USA, Canada, or Europe) as long as there’s regular communication, loyalty, and desire to end the gap down the line. I’m open to relocating to these countries and think it’s definitely worth it if it’s with the right person. 
* I speak English, Tamil, Hindi, and a little bit of Malayalam. I absolutely love languages and want to learn as many I can! 
* I LOVE fancy coffee shops and pastries and enjoy people-watching. My favourite one at the moment are Gail’s and Federal (I love their Turkish eggs!). I also like trying different cuisines – I’d really like to try Injera and Jollof rice sometime! I’m inconsistent with cooking but I find it so rewarding and satisfying – I’d consider myself a decent cook and like most of the stuff that I make. I really need to get back on track and start meal-planning! I’m really passionate about mental health and have lived experience of it. In my free time,  I volunteer for the Samaritans as a Listening Volunteer, and it’s been a rewarding, insightful experience being able to listen to callers in distress. I’m also absolutely passionate about social issues and world history and trying to educate myself as best I can. Music and nature have also helped me immensely with my mental health. I’ve quite a varied music taste – I love anything that’s vibrant, engaging, and upbeat (pop, reggae, indie/electronic, etc.) – my current favourite artist is Jungle! Other than these, I HAVE to have a doom-scrolling sesh on TikTok at least an hour everyday – need to keep with current discourse and dances! 
* I’m 5”2, 75 kgs, and south Indian (Tamil and Malayali – quite complicated to explain here….) with black-ish hair and brown eyes. I work in retail and am generally quite physically active and on my feet all the time. I’m very grateful for my features. 
* I’m deeply sensitive and empathic, chatty, bubbly, self-aware, and reflective. I’m ambiverted – I enjoy being in social settings but also need quiet time to slow down and recharge.
* I’m left, align with intersectional feminism, and value social justice and inclusivity and actively try and embed this into my life. 
* Fun/interesting facts about me:
- I speak one of the oldest living languages of the world;
- I’ve never smoked/drank/tried drugs in my life – something I’m very proud of and it was a promise I’d made for myself as a teenager;
- I love national anthems and know the national anthems of 12-ish countries – my favourite one is of course Indian, but really love American and New Zealand!; 

What I’m looking for:
• I only align with monogamy and looking for someone between 27-34. I’m fine with someone slightly older than this (upto 36 max), but certainly not younger.
• I’m drawn towards taller men with beards and those with a great smile. But ultimately, what’s more important is that they take care of their appearance and health. 
• I’m left, align with intersectional feminism, pro-choice, and strongly want to advocate for social justice and inclusivity. It’s important for me to date someone with similar beliefs and values. 
• I’m Hindu, but am not very religious and fall on the agnostic/atheist spectrum. However, I rarely like to pray and go to temples (more for relaxation than anything) and like to celebrate festivals/traditions (more due to cultural reasons). 

Dealbreakers: 
- Smoking and drugs – can’t compromise on these! I’m ok if my partner drinks as long as it’s not excessive (more like I’m ok with “social drinking”);
- Addicted to porn; 
- Cheating/lying; 
- Not wanting marriage;
- Polygamy/open-relationship;
- Lack of/limited cultural interest/engagement;
- Not a cat person. I prefer cats over dogs and want someone who’s on the same page with this;
- Racist, sexist/misogynist, homophobic, classist; 
- Politically misaligned - right-wing;
- Poor financial management/planning/has a big debt;
- Fencesitters.

Ultimately, I’m looking to build a loving and loyal relationship rooted in mutual respect, trust, and a sense of comfort. I want to be able to create a safe haven for my partner and vice versa, where we can be ourselves, nurture each other, and let our inner child feel truly happy and at peace. If you think we’d be a good match, DM me. I’d love to hear from you! 😊 x",14,1737253699.0,cf4cf,1,0.89,False

She never shares how motherhood really is. She never has talked about how hard and life changing it is. It’s  always shopping and coffee everyday. Like I just don’t get it!

Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

Started 12/16/24, 3, 36 hr fast weekly. Fast days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday 
On eat days I didn’t count calories or limit carbs. 
In the beginning I needed to use “fasting hacks”, aka dirty fasting, so if it was a tough moment I drank a cup of chicken bouillon broth, pickle juice or creamer in coffee. Now as of 4 weeks in, I don’t feel the need to use the “hacks” anymore. 
I’m turning 40 this year and currently 9 months postpartum, I’m ready to get back to feeling myself again. 

Background: 
I was over 200lbs for 10 years throughout my 20’s when I had my older children. On my 30th birthday I lost the weight to 160lbs and maintained that from 2017-2020. 
2020 I had started to gain and not care about my weight..(lot of stress with my home life during this time), 2022 and 2024 I had babies in my late 30’s, this really affected my body in many ways other than just excess weight. I weaned from breastfeeding in 08/2024 and began to implement fasting. I had no motivation, I was completely sleep deprived, (still am 🫠) and never stayed consistent. 
It was a week before Christmas, enough was enough and I started to complete the 36 hour fasts. I had lost 10lbs in one week and a pant size. That was enough fuel to keep me going. For this next month I plan to aim for lower carb on eat days and resist so many sweets.

1i4nuen,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1i4nuen/first_date_ive_had_in_months_and_facebook_dating/,First date I've had in months... and Facebook Dating borked it,"I met someone on Facebook Dating... we seemed to really hit it off, and we like a lot of the same things. Seemed like things were going well, so I asked her out on a date. She suggested a trivia night at a local coffee shop on Saturday night. Cool, sounds good, I love triva.

She chose a spot that was close to where she lives, about 45 minutes away from me. Not a problem; my work is in that area, so I'm very familiar with the commute. I try not to spend too much time on Facebook, so the last thing I texted her was my phone number, just in case she had any last minute updates. That was Thursday.

Some time on Friday, my Facebook Dating becomes inaccessible. When I go into the app, I get a message, ""It's not you, it's us. Something went wrong and we're working to make it better."" I assume there's a Facebook Dating outage, but no; after some Reddit searching, I realize that it's just me. It's just my profile that got fucked over and is inaccessible. It's something that happens to Facebook Dating users from time to time. The rest of Facebook works fine for me.

Hey, no worries, though; we made our plans and I'll just show up where and when we agreed. I get my haircut, I wash my car, I go about my day getting ready for the date.

The time arrives, and I make the long trek to see her. I walk in the door and our eyes lock; but she turns away like she doesn't recognize me. There's a reason for that. I walk over to her table and start talking to her. ""Hey, it's me! How's it going? "" yadda yadda yadda.

Now she recognizes me and there's an instant panic that comes over her face. ""You're not supposed to be here! You blocked me! I didn't think I was going to hear from you again!"" She's almost hysterical. I promised her that I never blocked her. I realize what happened; Facebook Dating COMPLETELY borked my account so that no one can even see my profile; everyone I was talking to, it's as if I blocked them.

I pulled out my phone and showed her the message on the screen. ""I never blocked you! Facebook messed up my dating profile!""

Well... the problem now is that she assumed I was ghosting her, and she invited her whole family over to the coffee shop for trivia night (including ex-husband and his new wife), and she was not prepared to have a first date with me in front of her entire family.

They all walked through the door, and now she's trying to do damage control, moving between them and me. ""Do we need to reschedule?"" I ask. ""Yes, please!"" she responds.

I have to say... of all the ways I thought the evening might go, the one thing that wasn't on my list was eating dinner alone and going home.",67,1737253226.0,datingoverforty,29,0.97,False

I don’t understand this man, I’ll be talking to him about this author and then he’ll refer to a story that author wrote that he hopes to god isn’t based on a true story, necromancy. My guy, like a 50yr man, talked about necromancy to a 17yr girl. And some other sex ritual stuff. But literally a moment later he’ll talk about how teachers and students can’t get too close. While since I started g12 (he taught me g11) guy tells me I can call him by his first name since he’s not my teacher anymore. I honestly dk if he’s clueless or what, like dude’s a grown man surely he can recognize my pathetic crush? If so why is he fueling it? Or is this just being nice? Like I asked to meet up about work and he tells me if you’re gonna stand me up we should’ve met on tinder not Google classroom liek babe whattttt and in front of my friend?? 

All jokes aside he’s a super nice guy, just likes to keep me guessing. A part of me wonders what strings he’ll pull once I graduate, I don’t mind exchanging numbers but I’ll be counting the days till I drunk text him. Like I don’t wanna have his children or anything, just maybe a coffee or drinks (as he says), summer fling type stuff.

Would it be more helpful to reach out and ask for an informational interview/coffee chat or to just cold email and say I’m looking for an internship etc., here’s my resume?

Might be overthinking but cannot decide. Specifically looking in think tanks, small law firms.

The issue is he smoked cigars in it for 15 years and the interior stinks. I have replaced the headliner, visors, door panels, seat belts, and every piece of plastic trim in the car including the dash. 

I cannot seem to find used seats or carpet in good condition so I have used an extractor multiple times on them which made them look clean but they still smell like cigar. After peeling back one of the seat covers it appears the cigar smoke got into the seat foam itself.

Is there any way I can get rid of this smell? I am willing to go to great lengths. My other issue is no matter what cleaner I use on the steering wheel the smell keeps coming back.

Also I did 1 ozone treatment and it only appeared to help temporarily. Tried coffee grounds, vinegar, baking soda, citrus peels, charcoal, odor bombs, ozium, changed cabin filter, febreeze, nothing has worked 100%",1,1737252976.0,AutoDetailing,0,1.0,False
