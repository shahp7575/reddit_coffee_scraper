I don’t mind driving her, but there are days when I simply can’t. Today, for example, it’s been snowing heavily, and I still had to take her to class. I just wanted to have a slow day, relax, and do nothing at home—but it turned into a fight.

We share household responsibilities, but somehow, I end up handling most outdoor chores. If she wants coffee, needs to buy plants, or has any activity related to her, I’m the designated driver. And if I don’t seem enthusiastic about it, she complains that I came unwillingly.

I go to the office twice a week, and on the other three days, I drive her to work. I don’t mind it, but sometimes I get busy. Last week, I had a lot of work and couldn’t take her, and that led to an argument.

She tried taking driving lessons but never attempted the test. I encouraged her, but she insists she needs more practice. I even volunteered to teach her, but she doesn’t like my teaching style.

I suggested Uber, but she refuses, saying, I’ll just take the bus—I don’t want to spend $50 on a round trip. Then I feel guilty seeing her take the bus in the snow and end up driving her anyway.",1,1739736600.0,nri,0,1.0,False

She’s made friends at work, I not as much. We’ve talked a lot about missing having alt friends as there isn’t a big alt scene here.

About a month ago, we met 2 guys. They are alt, super fun and we got along really well. 1 of the guys started inviting me out to gigs and introducing me to his queer friend group. I was really happy that I was finally making alt and queer friends as I missed having queer people around me (I’m pan).

My best friend has been out with us a few times, but since she has work friends she mainly either has commitments w them, or leaves early bc she is tired - I’m usually the one who’s happy to stay out late.

I did think one of the guys was pretty cute, and he would flirt with me pretty often. But I wasn’t 100% sure if he had a gf or not. He mentioned a girl once or twice, but I wasn’t sure if there was any kind of commitment, and if I’m being honest I’m not in a place in my life where I’m even interested in a relationship. Truthfully I was just enjoying attention from someone cute and more so enjoying his friendship as he is a really fun friend to have and we get along really well.

I got invited to his house party this weekend, and I knew some of my new friends would be there so I asked my best friend to come as well. We all had a great time and got wasted, and since she’s a heavy drinker she left fairly early before everyone else. 

I always ask my best friend if she wants me to take her home or if she wants me to leave with her and she always tells me no. I always make sure she’s home safe and text her a bunch just to be sure.

Anyways, during the night the guy asks me if I can stay after everyone’s gone. I’m a bit drunk and genuinely , since we’ve hanged out a lot just me and him - I didn’t think there was any kind of motivation. I’m autistic so sometimes I’m not the best at picking up between the lines.

The night goes on till 5 am, and I fell asleep on the couch. When I woke up, I realise everyone has gone home. I decide to call myself an uber, but felt like I should probably say bye before I left.

I found him in the spare room, slumped over a wooden chair in an uncomfortable position- I felt bad if he woke up in pain or hurt, so I decided to wake him up to move him to the couch.

He’s almost a foot taller than me and super wasted. So when I bent down to try and pull him up, he opened his eyes, grabbed me by the face and started kissing me.

Because he seemed so nice, I assumed that maybe I was wrong about him having a girlfriend- bc there was also no gf at this party which was full of his close friends. I also thought that maybe he had been in something but broke it off, bc it had been weeks of us being drunk together and he’s never made a move on me. So I kissed him back, and we proceeded to have sex. We both fell asleep cuddling on the couch together, he kept saying I was so beautiful and I thought everything was fine.

When I woke up, he initiated sex again. For me - this felt like confirmation that he didn’t have a girlfriend, since he was clearly sober now. We fucked again. It was only after he swiftly got up after sex and started getting his clothes on was when I realised something was weird.

He seemed off - like he was nervous. he wasn’t as bubbly anymore. He was quickly trying to escort me out, saying he had plans but was also being super nice and apologetic. I decided to go to my best friends house as I was feeling weird, like I was starting to realise that I might have fucked up.

I went to my best friends house, and as soon as I said “we fucked”, she started saying “oh god how could you” “he might have a girlfriend” “you’re not a girls girl” “you just ruined everything with our new friends bc you’re opening your legs” 

When I told her I stayed behind bc I thought we would hang out, she laughed at me and said “no you didn’t , you knew what you were doing” she kept insisting that I wanted him to cheat, and that I didn’t care about anything .

I never once said I was innocent, or blamed it fully on alcohol. I said I was drunk but also that I don’t really think he has a gf bc he doesn’t look like the type to cheat. But she just insisted I was being horrible  and that everyone would hate me now. She kept making jokes about how I was asking for it.

The day after, I met up with one of our new friends for a coffee. I decided to ask if the guy had a gf. Apparently he does indeed, but he was also wondering what was happening since the guy was being so openly flirtatious with me and wasn’t the type to cheat. I found out he’s been in a long distance relationship for a few months. He mentioned he had gone on holiday recently, but never mentioned it was to see his girlfriend. I didn’t tell my new friend that we had sex, just that he seemed flirty and a bit cute so I was curious and dropped it at that. His friend mentioned that the relationship was fairly new.

I decided to text him to ask him if we could have a chat - I honestly just wanted to apologize for not making sure he was in a relationship and also wanted to let him know that I was sorry if I ruined our friendship in any way. It was stupid and I did a really awful thing, but I truly didn’t have any ill intentions. He told me he appreciated me reaching out, and that he would love to talk in a few days once he’s processed everything. He also apologized profusely and asked if he had taken advantage of me - I said although I was drunk I did consent and it wasn’t like that. 

I told my best friend what had happened , and she continued to make fun of me - she said that we knew he had a girlfriend (we didn’t- we always were confused and she would always tell me that she didn’t think he did), that I was a weirdo and that I should keep my morals in check. She said I was a hypocrite for saying I was drunk when it happened. I told her that I still think I did something horrible and it doesn’t matter if I was drunk, but also that I would appreciate if we could just talk about it without her making  constant fun of me or judging me. She basically told me that I deserved judgment because what I did was weird and that I would do the same to her. I said I wouldn’t, and brought up the fact that she’s done several mistakes when she’s drunk but I wouldn’t put it against her. She then said she wouldn’t be on my side if I did something wrong and that I deserved to be called out - I told her that I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong, but that I would appreciate it if we could actually talk about it instead of just constantly making fun of me and calling me a slur.

If I already have said multiple times that I’m a terrible person and that I did a very awful thing, and I am trying to make amends, what more can I say? 

I decided to talk to my long distance best friend and my cousin about it. They both had the same reaction - they asked if I was ok, and if I had been taken advantage of, and told me that as long as I can talk to him and figure out what was going on with him it should be fine. They both agreed that it was a shitty thing to do - but also agreed that I wasnt trying to force anyone to be a cheater or that I was begging for it. It was only when I talked to them that I realised that my best friend might have had a pretty shit reaction and was only concerned about how her new friends would perceive her.

What annoys me about my best friend is that she seems to care more about our new friends (that I introduced her to), that she cares about pleasing people she met a day ago over seeing if I’m ok, and that she’s so comfortable with punching down on me. I’m not saying I don’t deserve criticism for my actions - but all I wanted was to be able to talk to my closest friend about it without being called loose every other sentence.

I found myself shaken with anxiety everyday and I had gone short streaks of semen retention but only 7-9 days and only once ever reaching 17 days where than I had relapsed terribly hard and went back to everyday. Most of my life I masturbated nearly every day. About 3 months before my 28th birthday I decided to quit coffee. I had bad anxiety something I had always struggled with but it wasnt getting any better and I thought after reading a article of what caffeine can do for someone more prone to anxiety and all the nutrients it leaches from your body I decided to quit coffee. I shocked everyone when I eventually quit I was use to 2-4 cups of coffee a day. I’m 5 months free from coffee now and I don’t think I’m ever going back I do have an ice cap once in a while but never straight coffee. The most beneficial effect I noticed from quitting coffee is I no longer get High highs and crash or wake up needing coffee to start my day no more headaches anymore either. After new years I decided to start semen retention since Jan 8 I’ve been on semen retention (39 days today) I’ve noticed a difference and I like how I feel reaching to go to  90 days. 

Nutrition 
The other thing I thought I’d add that I do is i eliminated margarine (vegetable oil) from my house I only use real butter in cooking and on food. You also have to be careful a lot of butter is made from vegetable oil something to be aware about. cheese a lot of cheese is made from modified milk ingredients I’ve switched to real cheese from dairy farmers. Real honey is a powerhouse too. So if you can get any one of those products even if it costs a little more I promise you you’ll get more back from it. ",1,1739736289.0,Semenretention,0,1.0,False

I saw the missing photos and left a sticky note, which she ignored like she couldn’t see it stuck to the coffee pot she used multiple times, pathetic, the note said “please put the photos from the fridge back where you found them”. The draft was much more honest.

Woke up the next day and walked into the kitchen to see the photos not returned to the fridge. I calmly asked her where the missing photos were. “There aren’t any missing photos.”

Yes there are (describes them). Please put them back where you found them. “Oh, they’re in that tote bag over there hanging on the closet door.”

I check, **the photos are in the tote bag,** I make a note that I have to take time to put them back where they were on the fridge. My first mistake, other than allowing her into my home, was backing down from my boundary/request that SHE put them back where she found them, but she subtly manipulated me into cleaning up her transgression, and I passively backed down from my boundary, subtly manipulated into thinking I was being “unreasonable” and that my preferences mattered less than hers. I forgive myself for this, and I will learn from it.

Next day, the bag on the doorhandle is gone, and so is she, a day earlier than she said she was leaving.

I text her, where’s the bag on the closet door with all my personal photos I asked you repeatedly not to throw out? “There were no photos in that bag.” Lol.

You **told me** there were photos in the bag, and **I saw the photos in the bag.** I want my photos back. “No.”

And that’s that. I feel deeply violated, which is exactly what she wanted. It’s okay. I will not abandon myself. I take my sense of “loss”, and turn it into self-protection. I articulate my grief, because it’s real, and perfectly warranted. I know what reality is, to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.

I did not do the ""free"" trial. I purchased both the Liquid Collagen in pineapple and one bottle of the TruFolix Hair Growth and Strengthening Liquid.

Shipping was very fast. Contrary to popular belief, you do not receive a free lip balm with your order, you must add another discounted product to your order after placing your order to get a free lip balm. I skipped this step. You do get a free 2tbsp shot glass for measuring your collagen.

I didn't bother mixing the collagen into water, I would just take it like a shot. The texture and taste is... a lot. Very, very thick and syrupy and the flavour is incredibly artificial. Very cloying on the tongue and swallowing was a challenge, but I powered through.

After a week of taking the recommended 2 tablespoons per day, I was down to 3/4 of my bottle and wasn't noticing any results. For $49 CAD for 450 ml, this product is incredibly over priced.

The only benefit is that it left me feeling fuller for longer and I've lost a little bit of weight.

Instead of ordering more, I purchased a big tub of Garden of Life's grass fed collagen peptides and probiotics. It has ten times the amount of collagen, and after two weeks of mixing a scoop into my morning coffee, my skin has completely transformed. It's soft, supple, clear, glowing and bouncy. My skin is SO soft and SO smooth. I had joint pain in my right knee and this has completely gone away.

If you're wanting to try collagen, don't go with Spoiled Child. Save your money and get a tub of flavourless collagen peptides. I recommend Garden of Life.

I will, however, recommend the TruFolix Liquid Hair Growth and Strengthening Liquid. I will be writing a review for it on a different sub so check my profile for that.

Spoiled Child seems very predatory and over priced for what you get. Do your research and read reviews.

For starters this was my first valentines day being married (3 year relationship) and I feel so disappointed that my husband didn't get me anything 😔 despite me telling him how gifts are my love language and I guess he hasn't gotten the memo after several upsetting moments. To be clear, I do not expect expensive gifts (although would be nice lol) but it can be anything candy, flowers, a single rose, my fav dessert coffee, chips etc. I just like to be acknowledged by the gesture that someone thought about me.

I asked him the day of where was my gift and he said he didn't get a chance to go to the store and I snapped. I may have said things that came off hurtful like I deserve more or I want to be with someone that celebrates special days even if it's a stupid holiday. I also said I feel stuck in the relationship bc we started an immigration process that who knows how long itll take given current situations in the world and I know that probably hurt but its true. Not like I can get up and move on, we're not only married but also in this process that has not been cheap to say the least. 

Money has been an issue since the getgo and Im honest to say I didn't think it through fully b4 tying the knot and now reality has hit me when it comes to paying bills, emergency expenses etc. He's basically paycheck to paycheck and I'm the breadwinner. We don't join accounts bc I feel some type of way but he helps with a percentage of money on a monthly basis, helps around the house, cooks cleans, helps with the kids etc is a good man overall doesn't disrespect me and is pretty much a healthy relationship. 

As he says valentines day should be every day and I agree but also why not celebrate it the day of? I feel I been so understanding with his financial situation and him not getting me anything for my Birthdays, Christmas, mother's day has hurt so much and idk how long i can take this. Despite him not getting me anything I have gotten him gifts but it sucks things not being reciprocal. I feel like i show up more in this relationship and mostly financially so I'm hurt that I can't even get something from the dollar store to make me feel special..

Thinking about it deeper, it hurts more bc this is how my dad was with my mom. Hes never celebrated her in any occasion in 30 something years they been married and growing up it just hurt me and I always said that wouldn't be me and now it is and has me feeling let down. 

We haven't really spoken since Friday and I tried talking this morning but he said I said enough and he didn't feel like talking so I left it alone. For the record i despise silent treatment so this not talking stage is really making me anxious. Not sure how to approach this but I'm very saddened and I feel like our marriage is over.

I keep seeing a trend of Americans taking ibuprofen, energy drinks and/or tylenol for just about anything, from a headache to hangover. 

In Europe, painkillers are usually taken when you are actually sick or injured, with the most common painkiller/anti-inflammatory drug being paracetamol (pure, without additional chemicals) and ibuprofen (again pure). Aspirin is taken for hangover, but usually it is treated with fluids, food and coffee. 

Yet in the US, no one seems to drink actual coffee (espresso or Turkish), and all medication is laced with some additional shit. Apparently the goal is to get you all hopped up like an actual methhead, without any consideration for the consequences on your metabolism and immune system.

(disclaimer: i am on 25mg of extended release adderall that i take around 1pm, so thats its effective when im at work. it typically does it job for around ~10 hrs and the effects are stopping right around the time im clocking out/getting home. i’m meeting with my psychiatrist in a couple weeks and will mention this to see if it’s could be partially attributed to a medication thing.)

the problem at hand right now is that i am absolutely struggling to wake up and stay up in the morning. i work 4pm to 12am, i have a somewhat consistent schedule of going to bed ~2:30am, plus or minus 30 min. i try to (and often fail) to wake up between 10-11am. 

i’ve always struggled with waking up, especially when it’s for something that i don’t necessarily have to do. i think this problem has been exacerbated by my new work schedule, which began about a month ago. having my day be centered around leaving the house so late is likely contributing to this issue. unfortunately, it can’t change so i need to work around it and fix my problem with waking up.

i have tried everything from timed brew coffee pots, gentle wake alarms, alarms that i have to do tasks to turn off, to sleeping masks, everything. it’s like i have this indomitable will for the first 15 minutes that i am awake where if i want to and can go back to sleep, i am going to do so no matter what arbitrary guardrail i set for myself.

it often feels like i am not fully in control of my actions when i first wake up either. i will vaguely remember snoozing my alarms, but not remember making the conscious choice to do so. it’s almost like an out of body experience or like im watching myself on a tv when this happens. and then 2/3 hours past when i actually want to be up, ill shoot out of bed confused and late and fully awake. 

this has been effecting my productivity at home because i reserve a lot of the morning time to do chores/tasks that i otherwise can’t do any other time due to my work schedule. its been stopping me from going to the gym and i paid $140 for the membership. i thought that id be able to get up and go out of spite, my second most indomitable trait, but even thats being conquered. im just at my wits end here and dont know what to do.

She works only morning shifts, so i didn’t see her as much before, but now that i’ve been promoted, i work with her more often. Before i come to this, I’ll have to put here some storyline.

I have worked at my current job for little over 3 years. When i was 17 I started dating a girl that was working there too. We were dating for 9 months and we were still studying so I didn’t work as many morning shifts. During summer break i had only morning shifts, so I started talking with her more and more, but I am as loyal as they come, so there was nothing physically nor emotionally. Easy to say my then girlfriend was jealous, but I reassured her and made her feel loved more. We broke up shortly after new year 2023 and I was left in a bad state. I started ditching school, started doing morning shifts and I was feeling really bad. That was a time I started talking to the coworker mentioned in the title a little more, we went to grab coffee a few times just to talk and have fun. There never was anything, we talked about life, dates and stuff. One time after a coffee she gave me a hug and it felt really nice. I don’t know if it was because of me being single for quite some while or because I unconsciously liked her, but it did feel good. Some time later I quit school to get a welder’s license. In order to finish it, I had to quit my workplace as well, so we didn’t see one another for 3 months. After I got back, I quickly got promoted to a manager and so my training started with morning shifts. I should’ve said I am a pretty funny and extroverted guy, so starting up conversations isn’t a problem for me. During the shifts we talked alot and one day I jokingly asked her “who are your top 3 favorite people outside her family” just to scold her for not saying her name. But what I didn’t expect was her to say my name. I didn’t think much of it tho, so I just brushed her off with saying “that’s nice of you”. I was kinda used to compliments and people liking me, I’m not a bad looking guy and I can say I have a great personality. We have a coworker that’s older than us (let’s call her V.), old enough she could be my mother - we didn’t really like one another before, mostly because of my rebellious childish behavior, but as I grew as a person, we grew together a little more. I have to say she’s a great woman. Well she works morning shifts too, because she has a kid, so she talks to D. and she brought up the idea of me dating her a few times now. When New year’s came this year, V. brought it up again, saying it now with more seriousness, that I should ask D. out. I laughed a bit and said “maybe i will”. That was probably my breaking point where I started thinking of D. romantically. I started noticing her gazes across the room, her smile, her laughter, her smell and i realized that she’s a wife. She has many great traits and is the most caring and loving person I know. V. really likes to bring up the theme of me and girls in front of D. and I always say that I’m not interested in casual dating no more (keep in mind I’m single for almost 2 years now) and that I want a wife. Of course V. once said to me “then marry D.” and to which D. replied “he’s too young for me”. Needless to say it left me a little hurt, but I still managed to ask her out for a coffee, just like in the old days. She accepted. There I realized she’s really the one I want and admitted to myself that I really fell for her and still am falling. I’m just really scared to ask her out for a proper date, because I’m afraid of rejection, and well you don’t want to be rejected from a girl that has been your work best friend for 2 years and in love with for another 4 months.

i think i ate over 4k kcal both today and yesterday (whole foods mostly, most processed thing was these big market sausages (which i ate fucking 8 of)).

for referance i have been dieting for past two months and i got used to eating around 2200 kcal and lost a lot of bodyfat. i'm 17m, 6'1, ~170 pounds and i go to the gym nearly daily so i think my intake should be 3k max, definitly not the amount i ate past few days

i heard that this happens and eating protein helps, but i've been eating 180-200g per day for the past half a year so i'm already kinda used to eating a lot of protein so it doesn't really help me now

idk if this is related but i am also quitting caffeine since i used to take in ~650mg daily (usually lots of dark coffee with something sugary and pre workout)

is this really normal? i'm scared of losing progress with my weight since i started to really like the way i look and now i eat so much i will gain weight again if i continue

TLDR: how do i not gain weight when i'm somehow always ravenous now

1ir0i8h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ir0i8h,ROAD TO M20: END OF THE WEEK AND FINAL THOUGHTS,"Hi PokeSleepers!

Just wanted to share the final results of my week. You can see how my production was everyday, each of my meals, the trigger count, and berry total strength. I have started cooking Colas, but Friday, once I hit M20, with the main goal accomplished, I decided it would be better to start increasing the Eclair dish level.

It has been my very first serious try to M20 (GG) and I was more prepared than I thought,  not hitting 5M for so little. Seems that Cyan or Taupe (and maybe Snowdrop) are also reachable with a 1.5x cooking bonus and a GCT.

I also have cooked my biggest dish today, a 3x (well 4,5x this week) Eclair. 418455. Amazing.

Also, I want to share some thoughts/learnings I have realized during the week:

1. Stockpilling ingredients the week before is essential to ensure a 100% fiability on meals and make space in team for any extra mon (Dedenne, in this case). From now on, I will try to play a relaxed week stockpiling ingredients, followed by a serious week (where I would start with full ingredients). Stocking coffee could be a nice choice because is in the biggest recipes right now.

2. Dedenne is strong, really strong. Those 10 extra tasty meals means like 1.200.000 during this week. So it's necesaary to include him when trying to cook big.

3. Strenght skill are a good complement, but falls behind the cooking if you are going to cook big and include Dedenne. My Ampharos gained 400.000 triggering his skill.

4. I was overprepared for this challenge! Now I have some rellevant data for future estimates.

5. GCT is amazing. As a F2P I am always running a Pot Expander. So, 2 out of 5 members are locked without it (E4E and pot expand). GCT gives an extra spot in team really useful (Ampharos in my case) and the fiablity of cooking all the biggest recioes (if you have the right ingredients).

Finally, I just wanted to thanks to all  that people that gave me advices, the ones that encouraged me and the ones that asked me for my progress. I know so many people reached M20 and it's not something extraordinary, but it was a big challenge for me!

Casually said the hippie. Marie was livid that her iced coffee wasn't sweet enough. Marie had her hands on her hips. Before the barista could grab the cup, Marie roared again ""And for pete sakes Larissa where in the yellow hell is my sugar cube!"" Larissa smiled and grabbed the ice coffee and poured out it's liquid contents. An old man was observing the whole ordeal while shaking his head. The manager stepped out of his office and gave a growl expression towards his baristas. Chad put his hands up  challenging his manager's  facial expression. The manager pointed to the exit, Chad immediately put his hands down and resumed taking the drive through orders. 


The entrance door opened and suddenly everybody plugged their nose. The whole entire coffee shop reaked. A bum with stained pants walked in. Marie quickly took out her pocket sized air freshener and sprayed while yelling so loud that God could hear. ""You nasty sick, decroded, no penny having piece of shit, you smell of cat shit. Wash your filthy body then come back you prick!"" The bum slowly backed up, as he backed out the  entire way out of the coffee shop, a turd fell out of his pants legs. ""Dude is that chocolate?"" The hippie asked. ""Yes that is chocolate you should have a bite."" said Marie as she smiled with a devilish  grin. The hippie was walking close to the turd, but before he could bend down and grab the ""chocolate"" the old man slapped him in the back of the head. ""Dude what's your issue?"" The hippie asked while rubbing the back of his head. The old man didn't utter a word, carefully disposed of the turd  and retreated back to his seat. 


He glared at Marie, but she could give two shits about how he felt. Larissa handed Marie her special custom made ice coffee with the sugar cube on top. Marie gleefully grabbed the cup and drank away. After twenty five seconds she was still drinking, everybody was surprised. The hippie observed but this time didn't say a word. The old man nodded and focused his attention back on the newspaper. Marie was finished with her iced coffee and placed a hundred dollar bill for the tip, she then turned around and smiled at everyone, while skipping her way out the coffee shop. Shockingly outside, the bum smelt new with fresh clothes. Marie gave him a hug with a few twenty dollar bills. She continued to skip towards her fancy bmw.  The bum jumped up and started skipping the opposite way to the liquor store.

I was ""diagnosed"" with gastritis back in July 2024 when all of a sudden I would have acid reflux so bad and so constant I thought I was dying. Prior in March 2024 I had similar symptoms and ended up having appendicitis. I did a ppi for a month recommended by my doctor, felt fine until October 2024 when I lost my ability to swallow. Thankfully my GI got me into an endoscopy quickly and I found out I had mild gastritis with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). Cut to December 2024 when all of a sudden I was waking up nauseous, shaking, and barely sleeping. I was on 80mg of ppi for the EoE - I changed GIs since mine wasn't well versed in EoE and got a second scope done that said ""chronic inactive gastritis"". I then was told to cut my PPI to 40mg but my GI said it's not much to worry about and that it'll go away. 

I feel like I'm in a rut. I was feeling good for 11 weeks after the second scope and now I'm either having a flare, the stomach flu, or both. I was eating a smoothie every day during this time and then all of a sudden it began to hurt my stomach. I'm at a loss because now I don't know what to do for breakfast. I can't cut dairy or gluten at the moment as we're trying to figure out if my EoE is caused by allergy or by acid reflux. This was more than a rant but I'm tired of feeling so sick all of the time. I follow everything I'm pretty much supposed to. No coffee, alcohol, fried, fatty, or tomato. The only thing I indulge regularly is chocolate which I know is bad. I'm meant to rescope in March for my EoE but they will check my stomach. Does anyone else have the label ""chronic inactive gastritis"" and if so is it possible to cure it? I've had a gut feeling for awhile I might have a parasite but that's a second line idea. I'm exhausted because I was doing so well and then I wasn't. Thank you in advance.

Bruh, I'm thinking about how Roy missed out on *so much* about Lian's life. She disappeared when she was five. She's now-- what, thirteen or fourteen? He missed most of her baby teeth falling out, her first period, her starting middle school (heck, maybe her first graduation, *period*?) etc, etc.

And think about Mia! Mia was the one who found Lian's body. Mia left Lian alone and wasn't there to save Lian from the building crashing (or, tbqh, dying alongside her 10/1). Mia has lived with so much guilt and survivor these last few... years? I have no clue how old Mia is. She should be the same age as Tim and Rose (18-19), but Lian and Sin's ages are all messed up.

Now, we just have Lian making funny quips-- to *Mia*-- about how she began drinking coffee after a building crashed on her.

On top of that, imagine Mia's thoughts on Lian living alone on the streets for years on end. Mia *knows* how the streets are. When she was on the streets as a tweenage and teenage girl, she ended up on drugs and being sexually abused. She wouldn't want that all for Lian.

We also know that Catwoman sorta watched over Lian for a while, which opens up a lot of questions there. 

I have heard theories that Shoes originally wasn't planned to be Lian, but they decided to make them the same character sometime down the line. Maybe that's true. Even if so, Lian being Shoes is canon *now*.",0,1739734415.0,DCcomics,3,0.25,False
1ir0dth,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ir0dth/at_what_point_do_police_help_someone_being_held/,At What Point Do Police Help Someone Being Held Against Their Will?,"I'm 22. I'm in the USA. My mom has... issues letting go. She's put me in a very tricky situation and I'm kind of desperate.

So, all my life I've been isolated and forced to do what she wants. I can't make friends, go to the movies, volunteer, or anything without her. She also forbid me from getting a job. This was easily enforced by refusing to teach me how to drive, because I live in a somewhat rural midwestern area. Nearest bus stop is miles away. As a teenager, it was just strict parenting, a couple moments where she snapped and physically hurt me, and some emotional abuse. As an adult, it's become much more physical. Plus financial abuse and physical imprisonment.

At 20, I got a big scholarship to a school in DC, but my mom pushed me down the stairs. I didn't report it at the time, but the injury plus a couple medical issues resulted me being put in a wheelchair. As a result, I had to go on medical leave. I did manage to make some savings while away at college, but those have now run out. My parents left no room for arguments and took me back home. So now I'm back in the abusive home at 22.

I physically cannot leave. There is no ramp outside and there's stone steps and snow covered ground. My parents swore and promised they'd make a path through the garage so I could get an uber or something to take me places, but... they didn't do that. Whenever I ask, it's ""on the todo list"".

I've been frantically applying to jobs, but I can't get to interviews. They refuse to take me and they refuse to clean a path or anything. I'm physically and financially contained and trapped.

On top of that, the house is not accessible. The only bathrooms are on the second floor along with the bedroom. The first floor has the kitchen. To even get through the front door, you have to go up six  huge concrete steps. Each step goes almost up to my knee. The garage has a curb-sized step down and I'd need a small ramp or something to get through that. The backdoor goes out to a raised wooden deck with eight wooden steps. The windows don't open all the way. I am literally trapped. I physically cannot leave. I risk my life everyday and get bruised/scraped sliding down the carpeted stairs of the house just to get dinner. My wrist has been really sore from dragging myself around, because they won't help me. They refuse to bring food to me. They yell for me to come to them instead of coming to me. Like, I'll be all the way upstairs and they'll be downstairs on the couch. They will scream for me and yell and yell until I come to them... just to ask one question and then demand that I go away and stop bothering them. And this happens multiple times a day.

They also refuse to let me use the cover for the litterbox in my room and they won't let me move the furniture so it's not so close to my bed. I clean it everyday, but it smells so bad. It's only a yard from my bed. I keep waking up wheezing, because my asthma can't take it.

I called the police after my mom started physically shoving me away from the fridge and refusing to let me eat. I begged them to help me get out, give me a ride to the nearest homeless shelter or a 24/hour coffee shop. They said since I had a phone that I could call a friend and that they couldn't fit a wheelchair in the cop cars.

I called a friend. I have exactly one friend that isn't actually my mom's friend. She can't do anything. I asked if she knew anyone that could help me at least get down the steps and out of the house.

I'm scared. I'm stuck. I can't protect myself and mom's getting increasingly agitated with me. If she snaps and shoves me down the stairs again, I'm not in a state to survive that this time. How bad does this have to get before the police decide to help me?

FYI: I've tried calling APS, but was told there was nothing they can do until I have a note from my primary care doctor confirming my disability. I called the domestic violence hotline and a few domestic violence shelters, but they either don't have room, only handle intimate abuse, or don't have transportation to the shelter. The hotline said they only can help with intimate domestic abuse between partners.

I'm being constantly gaslit and I'm questioning my reality. I feel paranoid and crazy, but... this isn't normal, right? Normal people do not think this is okay, right?

I'm kind of debating whether I should try to cause an emergency to force police to come get me out of the house. If I die in the process, at least it's over. If I get arrested for arson, at least I'm away from them. But... That's definitely a last resort for in case mom gets too rough again.

I'm getting desperate, though. I need help and now my phone's missing. I don't have proof that it was stolen, but... I can't find it anywhere and there's definitely a good reason for my parents to not want me to be able to call people. They also suddenly unplugged the landline (which they've had my whole life) just before I moved back.

What do I do? How do I get help? If I get seriously injured and can't get to a phone, what do I do?

Quick Add on/Edit: In case it wasn't clear, I'm not able to leave the house. So I can't get a job, can't get picked up by a friend, can't get an uber/lift/taxi... So I can't see doctors, go to job interviews, see friends, or go anywhere at all unless they help me. They don't help me if I ask. They say they will, but then they just don't. Like, the day comes and they're in bed or watching tv instead. So... yeah. That's a problem. ",3,1739734380.0,legaladvice,1,0.8,False

Maintaining healthy plants can be a rewarding experience, and utilizing DIY plant fertilizers is an effective way to nourish your greenery. Creating your own natural fertilizers not only saves money but also ensures that your plants receive wholesome nutrients without harmful chemicals. Here are some excellent DIY plant fertilizers you can easily prepare at home.

**1. Coffee Grounds**

Used coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, making them a great addition to your compost pile or directly into your garden soil. Simply spread the grounds around your plants or mix them into the soil to enhance their nutrient content.

**2. Eggshells**

Crushed eggshells are an excellent source of calcium, which is essential for strong cell walls in plants. Rinse and dry the eggshells, then crush them into a powder. Sprinkle this around your plants or mix it into the soil for an added calcium boost.

**3. Banana Peels**

Banana peels contain potassium and phosphorus, both vital for flowering and fruiting plants. Cut the peels into small pieces and bury them in the soil near your plants. This slow-release fertilizer helps promote healthy growth.

**4. Molasses**

Unsulfured molasses can be diluted in water and used to feed beneficial soil microbes. Mix one tablespoon of molasses in a gallon of water, and apply it to your plants every few weeks for a nutrient boost that supports healthy soil ecology.

**5. Compost Tea**

Using compost tea is a fantastic way to give your plants the nutrients they need in a liquid form. Steep finished compost in water for a few days, strain the liquid, and water your plants with this nutrient-rich tea to stimulate growth.

Utilizing these DIY plant fertilizers can transform your gardening experience, ensuring your plants thrive naturally. With simple ingredients from your kitchen and yard, you can cultivate a robust and lush garden that flourishes season after season.

I really did not want nor planned to have a hoe phase after the breakup pero I did go out with casual dates with some guys I met on instagram. I replied to this one guy (he's on my dms na for a while) then I gave him a chance to meet me last week, casual coffee date lang. The date went well, I like him after that date, he's super funny, tall, he's gwapo rin, respectful, gentleman & he has a car. He wanted to court me, he's very vocal about how he want to be in a serious committed relationship with me but I just brushed it off kasi I didn't think na he was that serious about me but I do like him too. Then, saturday last week, we meet up ulit, in his house naman kasi he wanted to cook for me daw. After we ate, pumunta kami sa kwarto nya (take in mind na alam nya na I don't do hookups and he's very respectful about my boundaries din). We cuddled and sleep lang, he was very sweet sakin, he's looking at me with love while we're cuddling and he's kissing me all over my face until I french kissed him, I did the first move, got on top of him then asked if we can do it, he said na ako daw bahala (something like that) then asked him if he has condoms, tapos he answered he don't have any daw kasi this was not planned naman daw at all (so that means he didn't really plan to do it no? he just wants to cuddle and sleep lang 🥹). We're talking about if we should do it or not, I was hesitant kasi wala ngang condoms and he's very okay about my decisions either way, but we still did it raw, that was one of the best sex I've ever had. After that, he got up and cleaned me first then we cuddled for a bit, he wanted to cook for me ulit before ako ihatid pauwi but it was late na ng onti and I need to go home na, so I insisted na wag na sya mag cook for me. While we're on my way home I asked if ano ba kami, same answer na I always received from him, he wants me to be his girlfriend, but I don't know if he's really serious about me, so I brushed it off nanaman.

I don't know if he's being really serious about me kasi yes he's sweet in person, but through messages he's a bit dry na (he's not like this when we're first started talking) so I'm a bit confused. I don't know what to do so I just returned the same energy back to him. I didn't think he was serious enough to pursue me because he was acting that way na, I'm already attached to him so my solution to that is to hook up with another guy. And I regret it right after we've done it, it was not enjoyable when it was with him, there's no intimacy, pure sex out of lust. After the first round I got up and dressed then umuwi na. I wanted to try having a hoe phase in my early 20s but I think I can't do it.


The reason bakit hindi ko ma seryoso yung first guy na I was talking about here because of his history din, he's a party guy and admits na he had a hoe phase too. My only body count is with my serious long term relationship only, so I overthought na baka he's just messing with me.

I really want to try hookups and casual sex for fun but I think I can't do it talaga, any tips please? 🙏🏻 ",0,1739734080.0,hoegress,1,0.5,False

Room 101 The Big Payback Connecticut:

First Room 101 cigar I've ever had and I have to say I see why people speak so highly of their cigars. This is definitely one of the more flavorful Connecticut's that I've ever had. I had a cup of coffee with this and it brought out the creamy notes very well. Definitely going to try to keep a few of these on hand at all times. Also even though this was a Toro I was able to enjoy it for well over 1 1/2 hours. Great smoke!

CAO Brazilia:

Not bad, very earthy almost a dark fruit note. Not sure what happened but the wrapper started cracking all over the place, thankfully though I had some cigar glue on hand and I was able to touch up the problem areas and carry on. Construction issues aside this was ok but I don't know if I'd buy it again.

MF La Gran Oferta:

Wonderful smoke. Peppery, leathery, but not over powering smoke, burned great and smoked this to a nub. I have yet to have a bad cigar from MF.

Paris, the city of lights, romance, and… Picasso?  Yes!  While the Eiffel Tower and Louvre might hog the spotlight, the Picasso Museum offers a unique and captivating glimpse into the life and work of one of history's most influential artists. This isn't just a museum; it's a journey through the evolution of a genius.

**What to Expect:**

Forget stuffy galleries and hushed whispers. The Picasso Museum is surprisingly approachable.  Housed in the Marais district's stunning Hôtel Salé, a 17th-century mansion, the building itself is a work of art.  Wander through its elegant courtyards and discover Picasso's incredible collection spanning his entire career.

You'll see his early works, showcasing his classical training and the influences that shaped his unique style.  Then, witness the explosive energy of his Cubist period, followed by the vibrant colours and forms of his later years.  Don't just expect paintings; the museum boasts a rich collection of sculptures, ceramics, drawings, and even some of his personal belongings, giving you a truly intimate view of the man behind the masterpieces.

**Tips for Your Visit:**

* **Book your tickets in advance:** Avoid long queues, especially during peak season, by booking your tickets online.  This saves you precious time to soak in the art.
* **Allow ample time:**  Don't rush your visit. The museum is extensive, and you'll want to savour each piece.  Plan for at least 2-3 hours, maybe more if you're truly captivated.
* **Take a guided tour (optional):**  While exploring independently is perfectly fine, a guided tour can provide valuable context and insights into Picasso's life and work, deepening your appreciation.
* **Explore the Hôtel Salé:**  Don't just focus on the art; take some time to appreciate the museum's beautiful setting.  The building itself is a historical gem.
* **Grab a coffee or snack:**  The museum has a cafe, perfect for a relaxing break midway through your visit.
* **Consider visiting the nearby Marais district:** The Picasso Museum is located in the charming Marais district, known for its trendy boutiques, delicious restaurants, and historic architecture.  Make a day of it!


**Beyond the Masterpieces:**

The Picasso Museum is more than just a collection of art; it's an immersive experience.  It allows you to connect with the artist on a deeper level, understanding his creative process and the influences that shaped his legacy.  It's a reminder that art isn't just something to be observed, but something to be felt and understood.  So, if you're planning a trip to Paris, make sure the Picasso Museum is on your list. You won't regret it!

1ir03ze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ir03ze,I've created an adorable monster,"Long story! Tl;Dr: my cat was very timid and I taught her to cuddle me by gradually introducing pets and holding before meals. Now she climbs into my arms whenever she wants attention and it's adorable and terribly inconvenient. 

The brown cat you see is named Andromeda. 

I've had many cats before her, and they were all cuddly fluff balls. I got her after losing my other cats, star and Nefeli. I was heart broken and spent weeks trying to find a long haired kitten in my area. We tried to look at older cats but most of them had trauma with dogs, and they didn't recommend we adopt due to our German shepherd and mini doodle we also have. Fair enough, those dogs are a handful. Eventually, I found her. She had a sister, and they were both described as skittish. My brother and I lived together at the time. He hasn't had a cat since his died when we were 16. (A long story behind that too.. maybe for a different day.) I asked if possibly he'd help me take care of the other kitten. I was biased, yeah, but I genuinely thought a cat would bring a lot of love into his life. 

We got the 2 home. They were very skittish and hid under my bed for a few weeks at least. They'd come out for food, or when we weren't there, but hid every other time. We gave them space, and realized quickly Andromeda was a lot more comfortable coming out, but stayed with her sister to socialize. We realized the dogs, while calm and keeping their distance, would freak out the smaller and less brave baby, Nebula. She struggled in our room. We eventually gained some sort of trust and put them into my brother's room. Nebula still took a great deal of time to acclimate, immediately showed growth and improvement in the room. Andromeda didn't. She hissed at everything, including Nebula. We brought Andromeda into our room. 

I wanted to connect with her, and maybe selfishly, I wanted cuddles like my other cats. I started with pets before meal times. Things she liked already, and would not shy away from. Then immediately I'd feed her. This graduated to holding her before meals and petting her. Eventually, when she was hungry, she'd cuddle with me as a way of saying she wanted food. I rewarded this behavior with treats when it wasn't meal time. She was doing it occasionally for fun, or as a way to tell us she wanted to play, needed water, etc. She was still reserved, but was a lot more receptive to attention. 

I found this kitten in the parking lot a few months ago. She's great. She was very very young, and I slept holding her in the bathroom that night because she'd get anxious when I tried to leave. With food and love, she grew to be confident and curious. Andromeda hisses at her for the first 2 weeks, then instantly became her big sister. They are the best of friends. At first, when the kitten was very skinny, she wouldn't eat until the kitten was full and stopped. The baby would eat all of her food, then some of her sisters. When she was done Andy waited for us to refill her bowl and then she would eat. They play, they cuddle, groom eachother. Now Andromeda is becoming more confident and curious. She constantly gives me and her dad cuddles. We think it's for food, or water, or litter, or even play - (I bought my husband a lightsaber and they fight with it in the dark and have a great time... she always wants it.) But now it's really just for cuddles. She climbs into my arms every chance she gets. Shell meow for pick ups and will contently fall asleep in your arms when you finally give in. 

The other day she pounced on me from the coffee table, and crawled onto my shoulder. Just to purr and fall asleep. This kitten, (asteroid, aster for short) has made her so much more expressive and affectionate, and it's all cute except sometimes I need to do human responsibilities without a cat on my shoulder haha. I've got 2 parrots disguising themselves as cats constantly climbing over me and laying on my shoulder,, but I can't being myself to tell them to stop! It's just too cute !

Each of her children had at least two kids, except for my aunt, who never had children, and my mother, who only had me. In total, we were eleven grandchildren. Every year, during the holidays, it was our tradition to gather and travel as a family. But the year 2009 would be different.

My uncle Alejandro, a man with an adventurous spirit, had bought a farm in a rural area with a warm and temperate climate. The farm seemed like something out of a dream: a white house on top of a small hill, with two floors and balconies in every room, from which you could see the entire valley. At the bottom of the hill, there was a large parking area, and a little further away, a big, lonely one-story house hidden among trees. The landscape was so beautiful that sometimes we felt as if we were in another world, one where time stood still.

But what impressed me the most were the sounds. The whisper of the wind through the trees, the singing of geese and ducks in the small lake, the distant neighing of the horses. It was a place that, although seemingly perfect, had something in its stillness that I couldn’t quite understand. Something I couldn’t name, just like when a child feels fear but can’t explain why—it’s just… instinct.

My uncle Alejandro invited us to spend a few days at the farm. We were all excited. My cousins and I played and laughed nonstop. We swam in the pool, explored every corner of the property, and the fresh morning air was the perfect refuge for our endless games. Everything seemed idyllic, almost unreal. But after those days of fun, we had to return to the city.

The children had to go back to school, and the adults to their jobs. My uncle, due to his commitments, couldn’t be there all the time, so he decided to hire someone to take care of the farm and the animals in his absence. Mr. Ramón, a sturdy man with a deep voice, arrived with his wife—a woman with an expressionless face—and their two children, Esteban and Sara. Esteban, a boy of about nine or ten years old, had a sad look in his eyes, as if childhood laughter had slipped away from him too quickly. Sara, his sister, was a mystery. Though she was about our age, her behavior was more like that of someone much older—quiet, distant, lost in thoughts we couldn’t understand.

Mr. Ramón’s family stayed at the farm whenever my uncle wasn’t there. But when we or other guests arrived, they moved to a set of rooms my uncle had built especially for them, a place separate from the main house. Even so, we shared the kitchen and the rest of the farm, and although it was sometimes difficult to ignore the fleeting glances or the awkward silence of Mr. Ramón’s wife, the adults acted kindly, as if everything was fine.

For us children, it seemed like the perfect situation—so much freedom, so much space to play and explore. During that year’s holiday season, when the whole family gathered at the farm again, we ran excitedly toward the pool, laughing and chatting. We invited Mr. Ramón’s children to join us, but their response was less enthusiastic than we expected. Esteban was shy, but his eyes sparkled with the curiosity of someone who wanted to belong but couldn’t. Sara, on the other hand… she always seemed miles away, as if her body was at the farm, but her mind was elsewhere, in another time. Most of the day, we saw her sitting alone in a quiet corner or staring at the horizon.

What unsettled me the most was the relationship between Sara and her mother. The woman was always cold and distant with us children. Never a smile, never an invitation to play. Her attitude was entirely different when she interacted with the adults—then she became a charming, warm woman who made everyone laugh. But in the presence of children, her face would turn blank, as if she didn’t know how to interact with us. It wasn’t just my imagination; my mother and my aunts noticed it too, though they never spoke about it openly.

Night came quickly, as it often does in remote places, where the sun sets without a trace. We were exhausted, gathering in our rooms to sleep, while the adults stayed outside on the terrace, surrounded by the murmurs of the night. They laughed, shared cold beers and snacks, but something in the air, something in the stillness of the farm, made me uneasy. I, gripped by an inexplicable curiosity, got out of bed without knowing exactly why. I just felt an urgent need to get closer, to hear more. Maybe I wanted to ask my mother for something, but as I approached the balcony, something in the air made me stop. Instead of stepping forward, I stayed hidden in the shadows, unnoticed.

That was when I heard the conversation. Mr. Ramón, with his deep voice, was talking to my uncle Alejandro and the other adults. Something in his words made my skin crawl. Apparently, before our arrival, the farm had been rented out to a parish or a center that organized spiritual retreats. During one of these retreats, a group of nuns and young novices—women preparing to enter the convent—had arrived, hoping to find peace and tranquility in that remote setting. But things hadn’t gone as expected.

Mr. Ramón recounted that the nuns hadn’t even spent a single night at the farm. Just hours after arriving, they began packing their belongings in a hurry, their desperation palpable. They rushed to the entrance and, between nervous whispers and hurried prayers, demanded to leave immediately. Mr. Ramón, surprised, tried to stop them. He explained that the road to town was long and that he couldn’t drive them, as his truck wasn’t available at the time. But the women, visibly terrified, refused to stay another minute in that place. They called someone, though Mr. Ramón never knew who. The only thing he remembered was that, after hours of waiting, a young man arrived in a truck—the kind used to transport crops or livestock.

The nuns climbed into the vehicle as if the ground beneath them was burning, afraid to touch any part of that land. At that moment, the mother superior approached Mr. Ramón and, before getting into the truck, told him something that left him paralyzed:

“Leave this place. Your family is being watched.”

The weight of those words left Mr. Ramón speechless. He had never noticed anything strange in his family, though his eyes had been clouded by the routine of tending the farm, and no one in the family had mentioned anything unusual. But that warning from the mother superior kept echoing in his mind—something didn’t add up. And later, when our family arrived, things began happening that he could no longer ignore.

My mother and my uncle’s wife, Estrella, had noticed something strange about Mrs. Ramón’s behavior and her daughter, Sara. The way she looked at us children—that coldness, that detachment—and how Sara always seemed absent, as if she lived in another world. It made them uneasy, and they decided to speak to Mr. Ramón, to share their concerns. That was when he started to remember, to connect the dots, and realized that something deeper, something darker, was happening at the farm, something hidden until that moment.

Then, I heard Mr. Ramón ask the adults about some crosses. Crosses? What crosses? His face was tense with worry. He described finding crosses in different parts of the farm—some buried, others partially visible, as if they had been deliberately hidden. In places we had never noticed before: near the fountain, between the two houses, behind the hilltop house, among the trees, by the geese’s lake, near the horse stable, even by the main entrance.

Who had put them there? And why?

A heavy silence settled over the night, as if something unseen was lurking in the shadows. Then, in a low, almost whispering voice, Mr. Ramón asked my uncle Alejandro: —“Has anyone else been here when we weren’t? Has someone entered without us knowing?” My uncle, with a furrowed brow, shook his head, but there was a spark of doubt in his eyes. He didn’t know how to respond because he, too, had noticed something strange. It wasn’t just the presence of the crosses but something in the air—something intangible and invisible, yet everyone could feel it.

It was my mother who finally broke the silence, looking at Mr. Ramón with a serious, almost sorrowful expression.

“That’s not normal. We haven’t placed crosses on the farm, and we hadn’t seen them before. And now, suddenly, they appear. What’s going on here?”

But there were no answers. No one knew what to think. We only knew that something was out of place—something we couldn’t comprehend.

The next day, I was no longer myself. I couldn’t behave normally after that conversation. My eyes wandered everywhere; I needed to confirm the presence of the crosses. I managed to find the ones in the garden, the one among the trees near the lake, and the one behind the main house. They were very rudimentary crosses, made of branches with a very dark hue, almost ebony, tied together with twine or some type of rope. I couldn’t bring myself to approach them—something told me I shouldn’t touch them. But at least now I knew they were real.

That same night, the air was thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself were breathing over us. Outside, the adults continued searching with their flashlights for something no one could see—whispers and uneasy glances as they tried to decipher the source of a noise that had broken the night’s silence on the farm. I watched from the half-open door, my heart pounding in my chest. That’s when I saw her.

Sara.

She passed in front of us without making a sound, as if floating in the shadows. Her dark hair was tied in a braid. I could see that her gaze was fixed on a point beyond, a destination invisible to everyone except her. She walked with unsettling confidence—without hesitation, without even glancing at us.

“Why is she going to the lake?” my little cousin Andrés whispered, his voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. It didn’t make sense. It was too late, the night was dense, the farm was immersed in almost complete darkness… and yet, Sara walked as if she knew every inch of the ground beneath her feet, as if something were guiding her.

My eyes instinctively turned to Mr. Ramón’s wife. She remained standing at the doorway, holding her flashlight unlit in her hands. She made no move to stop her daughter. She didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to follow her. She just stood there, motionless. And the most terrifying thing was her expression. There was no fear in her eyes, no concern… only resignation.

A chill ran down my spine. My body urged me to act, to call her name, to run after her… but something—something I couldn’t explain—kept me anchored to the ground, as if interfering would be a mistake.

“I’m going to tell my mom,” I whispered, and without waiting for an answer, I ran upstairs.

My mother was lying down, but when I told her what I had seen, her expression changed immediately. She got up and said she would go tell Mr. Ramón. I clung to her arm as I followed her, but I never knew if she actually did.

The next morning, breakfast at the farm took place in tense silence. Amid the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, I heard something that made me shudder. Someone would come to take care of the crosses.

My uncle Alejandro said it with firm resolve, as if it were the only possible solution. His wife, Estrella, looked at him with reproach and concern. My mother and my aunt simply averted their gazes and continued eating, avoiding the topic. I, on the other hand, felt immense helplessness. It seemed like I was the only child who couldn’t ignore what was happening on the farm. My little cousins remained silent, avoiding any contact with Ramón’s family. And Sara… I never saw her again.

Her absence also unsettled my mother, who asked Ramón’s wife about her daughter. The woman responded with a kind, serene smile:

“She’s sick, but she’s recovering.”

As she spoke, she took my mother’s hands in hers with a tenderness that made no sense. She seemed so genuine, so empathetic… but when I looked closely, I knew she was lying. The truth wasn’t in her smile—it was in her eyes. You always have to look at people’s eyes; that’s where their real thoughts hide.

The next day, we left the farm and went to the town. We needed a distraction, to get away from that suffocating atmosphere. We walked through the plaza, visited the church, and bought some traditional pastries. For the first time in days, everything seemed fine. But when we returned, night had already fallen over the farm, and the first thing we noticed was the light on in the house on the plain.

“Ramón and his family left this morning for his parents’ house,” my uncle Alejandro said, frowning. “No one should be here.”

We stopped in front of the house, staring at that single illuminated window in the darkness.

“Ramón must have forgotten to turn off the light,” he tried to reassure us.

Without hesitation, he walked towards the house, determined to check that everything was in order. My aunt Carla, for some reason, took out her camera and snapped a picture of the scene. Minutes passed before my uncle returned.

“There’s nothing strange, just a light left on,” he said naturally, as if there was nothing to worry about.

But my aunt didn’t reply. She was staring at her camera screen, her expression turning to pure horror.

“Oh my God…” my mother whispered, covering her mouth with a hand.

I moved closer, trying to see what they were looking at. In the photo, in the lit window, there was a clear silhouette of a man—or something resembling a man. He was sitting sideways, his profile barely outlined by the light. But the most disturbing thing was his abdomen—it protruded unnaturally, swollen or deformed. Silence fell over us. My uncle Alejandro checked the image and shook his head.

“There was no one there… I went in, I checked every room. There was no one.”

But the image didn’t lie. Fear took hold of the adults. They grabbed our hands and hurried us into the main house. That night, no one slept alone. They pulled mattresses onto the floor, brought blankets and pillows, and we all stayed in the same room, with the lights on and the adults keeping watch. No one mentioned the photo. No one spoke of the shadow in the window. And I don’t know why we simply didn’t leave that very night.

By morning, the decision had been made. They woke us before dawn, everything was packed and ready. We had a quick breakfast, and without looking back, we left the farm. The journey back to the city was long and silent. But once home, everything seemed to return to normal—or so we thought.

A few days later, my aunt Carla was reviewing the photos she had taken during the trip. She connected her camera to the TV to project them. Only she, my mother, and I were in the room, watching the screen. The first images were normal—us playing, exploring, laughing at the farm. But then, something changed. Spots appeared in the photos.

Circles—some dark, others whitish, like shadows floating in the air. At first, we thought it was a camera glitch. But as we kept looking, the spots became clearer. If you stopped and looked closely… if you got close enough… you could see human features in them.

Eyes. Mouths open in anguish. Figures that hadn’t been there when the photos were taken.

My aunt Carla turned off the screen immediately.

A year later, my uncle put the farm up for sale. It wasn’t easy to sell. More than a year passed before someone showed interest. And during that time… more things happened. But that’s another story. The truth is, we never found out what really happened.

What were those crosses?

What was that figure in the window?

And what were those dark and white spheres?",1,1739733549.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I'm a minority (asian) in my country thats not very receptive of minorities, I  was dirt poor when I met my gf in uni, I'm short (5'7), and at best I'm like a 5 to a 6.

The first time I met my GF it was literally like a movie scene. She greeted me by my name out of the blue. She was smiling and the sun rays literally was shining on her and she was so beautiful. You know those scenes in tv shows or movies that plays when a cute girl is on scene and it's slow mo with some sexy/romantic music. I literally experienced that. She's blonde, blue eyes, and fit 

Apparently she knew me because I was a teachers aid to her twin sisters for a programming class (I was a senior in uni). For some reason she kept on greeting me every time we met very consistently. I chalked this up to her being very friendly like her sisters as they did the same too. Nothing ever really materialised from this.

Around 12 months ago I returned to uni to get some documents, and I met up with her sisters and they invited me to get some coffee with them sometime. When that happened they also brought my gf with them and one thing led to another and we'd go out of dates alone after that.

Back to the present day. Almost every day I wonder why my gf even likes me. As I said I'm a 5'7 Asian, slightly thinning hair, acne scars, very socially awkward until recently when I started working, etc... I was also dirt poor. I only slightly got better when I started working after uni. I only got to be in a really good position right now (4x the avg salary of my country) 7 months into my relationship with her. Meanwhile she's nearly my height, comes from a very rich background (goes on trips multiple times a year whereas I've never been rich enough to travel), an extrovert, is an amazing woman, and at the risk of sounding superficial she has a US citizenship which many here in my country would kill for. She has guys in her DMs all the time too but tells me she never responds, but we spend most of our time together I haven't ever felt like she's been unfaithful. 


Literally sometimes I think the only reasons she ever dated me in the first place was because she thought since I'm very smart and good at what I do so it must've been an investment from her side in case I got a good job. But I know that thinking is toxic which is why I keep these feelings to myself. 

I asked her once why she likes me she gives me the generic responses like I'm kind, caring, handsome, smart etc... honestly, its hard for me to believe any of that other than the smart part. Every morning I wake up and I'm like shit this just be some kind of long term prank or con. But nothing other than my own feelings of inadequacy is justifying that. I met her parents 3 months ago and she's gonna meet mines soon and things are getting really serious. But it's getting harder and harder for me to understand how any of this is going on.",1,1739733275.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.6,False

1iqzp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iqzp9z/have_you_ever_stumbled_across_good_supermarket/,Have you ever stumbled across good supermarket coffee? (UK),"I only buy supermarket coffee when I have to, or to make coffee with milk. Union is normally fine. But a couple of months ago I found Roastworks' Velo de Novia at waitrose and kept going back to it, most of the time it was genuinely sweet and very smooth brewed with a clever dripper (a bit harder to get right with the V60), and is probably one of the nicest medium roast I've had.

So what's your experience with good supermarket coffee, whether you think it's a great find, a guilty pleasure, or good brewed a certain way?

Also as someone who doesn't have an espresso machine, I wonder if it's more likely for espresso folk to take chances with supermarket coffee - if you brew both ways let me know.

One of the first videos that popped on my feed was a girl talking about her boyfriend who treated her poorly. In one of their conversations he told her he wasn't going to change. 

Various memories filtered through my head. I can remember you being so loving but I can also remember you being really hurtful. Near the end of us you admitted you knew you were hurting me deliberately but that you wouldn't change. 

That might be the memory that hurts the most. Being told that I'm not worth changing for. That I'm not worth putting in the effort for. 

Nothing quite makes me want to live in solitude and swear off people quite like being told either implicitly or explicitly that I'm worthless and treating me right just isn't worth the effort.

Why am I deserving of any of that? Why do you not care? Please tell me that so that I can maybe break my heart enough that I never fall in love ever again. 

In the aftermath of you, I've been thinking that I don't really want to be here anymore. Sometimes I feel like I'm merely waiting for the end. 

I loved you. Why were you so cruel?

I have this feeling that you moved on immediately. I feel like you forgot me and jumped into another relationship with some other girl. Why do I feel like that? Why do I feel like you'll change for someone else? Why am I not so beneath you?",1,1739732501.0,UnsentLetters,3,1.0,False

Our budget is $800k max and we would like a safe area that has minimal petty/property crimes and thefts. 

Purely based off internet research, it looks like South Minneapolis or western St Paul is going to be the best fit for us- to be confirmed during our scouting trip. I've identified some commercial hubs in these regions to check out, and was wondering if there were any that I missed:

* Uptown, Longfellow - the concern with this area would be regarding petty and property crimes. It seems like Lake St may be a petty crime divider? 

* Linden Hills near 44th & France, 44th & Upton

1iqzlgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheerTerror/comments/1iqzlgx/noise/,Noise,"Laura arrived at her new home full of hope. She had moved into a beautiful apartment with large windows that let in the golden afternoon light. From her room, she could admire a garden overflowing with life: lush trees, brightly colored flowers, butterflies, and birds singing melodies at dawn. Sometimes, if she left the window open, a curious butterfly would venture inside, filling her with a serene happiness. Her home was her sanctuary, decorated with all kinds of plants, which had also begun to take over her private terrace. There, she could enjoy the sun, the breeze, and the rain in the company of her dogs. It seemed like an idyllic life, a perfect refuge in the big city. But the night brought with it a very different reality.

Two bars flanked the building where Laura lived. When the sun set, the music exploded in a roar that made the walls tremble. Laughter, shouting, and the deafening thump of bass plunged her into a whirlwind of noise that kept her awake until the early hours of the morning. She tried everything: thick blinds, earplugs, white noise… but nothing could drown out the relentless clamor. The worst was when the neighbors turned on their modified cars with powerful speakers. At those moments, Laura felt like she couldn’t even hear her own thoughts. How could others sleep through such an acoustic torment? Was she the only one suffering from it?

After a week without rest, exhaustion consumed her. Should she leave? She had invested all her money in that apartment. Moving out meant abandoning her dream of independence and returning to her mother’s house. It wasn’t fair. A soft knock pulled her out of her thoughts. She approached the door and checked the security camera. Outside, an older woman waited, her face adorned with a kind smile and wrinkles that spoke of years lived. Laura opened the door.

“Hello, dear,” the woman said warmly. “I’m Margarita, your neighbor. I wanted to welcome you.”

In her hands, she held a small box from a famous local bakery. Laura returned her smile and invited her in. She made tea, and between sips and sweet bites, their conversation flowed naturally. Margarita was around her mother’s age, making it easy to talk to her. Soon, the topic of noise came up.

“Doesn’t it bother you?” Laura asked in frustration.

Margarita’s expression darkened. She lowered her gaze and sighed.

“My husband and I have had a hard time because of it,” she confessed. “We installed soundproof windows to lessen the noise. Even then, we still hear it sometimes.”

Laura’s eyes widened in disbelief. Soundproof windows… that cost a fortune.

“But why hasn’t anyone done anything?” she protested. “It’s unfair! Why should we spend more money just to have peace in our own home?”

Margarita looked at her with a strange glint in her eyes. It wasn’t just exhaustion. It was fear.

“Nothing can be done,” she whispered. “Not against the Echeverri family.”

Laura frowned; she didn’t understand why her neighbor spoke with such fear. Then, Margarita told her story.

Four years ago, when she and her husband Roberto moved in, they also suffered from the unbearable noise. Annoyed and believing in the authorities, she called the police several times to report the problem. With each call, they asked for details and if she wanted to remain anonymous… But in her naivety, Margarita gave them her name. The complaints were never addressed. The police never showed up. But someone else did.

The morning after a particularly loud night, someone knocked on the door. On the security camera, they saw a young man, tall, with a mustache. Margarita thought he might be a new neighbor since she hadn’t seen him in the building before. She opened the door, and the man introduced himself with a stiff, artificial smile: Gustavo Echeverri.

“I heard that the noise from the bars bothers you,” he said in a friendly tone.

Believing she had found an ally, Margarita openly complained. Gustavo listened with an understanding expression. But when she finished speaking, his smile changed. It became rigid, empty. His eyes hardened.

“Listen, old lady,” he said in a low but firm voice, “don’t get involved in things that don’t concern you. You can call whoever you want, but no one will do anything for you. You’d better try to sleep or move out.”

A chill ran down Margarita’s spine. She was about to reply when Gustavo, in a slow gesture, lifted his shirt to reveal a gun tucked into his belt. When she looked up, he was smirking. Heart pounding, Margarita tried to close the door, but Gustavo placed his foot in the way, stopping it. With a push, he stepped inside the apartment. Margarita stumbled backward, bumping into the living room table. Her husband, distracted by his book, looked up at the commotion. Seeing his wife’s terrified expression, he silently asked who the man was.

Before she could answer, Gustavo slowly advanced and grabbed Margarita’s chin, forcing her to look into his eyes. His voice was a chilling whisper:

“Try to live a quiet life. I don’t like being the bad guy, and you remind me of my grandmother… but you are not her. And I wouldn’t hesitate to take care of you… of both of you.”

He let her go abruptly, turned to Roberto, and extended his hand with a fake smile. Roberto, paralyzed, barely managed to shake it. Gustavo squeezed his hand with excessive force before yanking it away. He walked to the door and, before leaving, slammed it shut.

Laura was stunned. That wasn’t possible—the building owner should be able to do something about it. Margarita looked at her kindly, took her hand, and explained that there was nothing they could do. The building owner had sold the property years ago, and the new owner was a known associate of the Echeverri family. No one dared to intervene because everyone had been threatened or harassed by the Echeverris’ “watchdogs,” and apparently, the authorities were bought.

Margarita left after giving Laura a hug and welcoming her once more. When the door closed, Laura let out a strangled sigh. How had she ended up living in that place? A damn hell disguised as paradise.

Weeks passed, and Laura noticed how her quality of life deteriorated. On days off, she slept in to recover some energy, but her workdays were a nightmare. She felt like a zombie, and not even the multiple cups of coffee she drank daily helped. She was exhausted, too tired to fight for her peace anymore.

That Saturday morning, she left her apartment, heading to the nearest bakery. It was 11 AM, and she was just about to have breakfast. “Damn Echeverris,” she thought angrily.

She walked in, greeting the bakery workers, picked her favorite bread, and a poppy seed and red fruit cake. She lined up to pay… right behind a man. He was taller than her, with thick black hair, broad shoulders, and strong arms. From the side… his face was truly handsome, his smile too. Laura was captivated by the sight of him. He noticed her staring and let out a small chuckle—not mocking, but slightly embarrassed.

Laura snapped out of her reverie, cleared her throat, and apologized, feeling her cheeks flush. She extended her hand and introduced herself. He returned the gesture with a smile and said his name was Sebastián. He told her he was new to the area, that he had moved in the night before and had gone out to buy something for breakfast, just like she had.

""Where do you live?"" Laura asked curiously.

""In the Golden Alps Building,"" he replied.

Laura reacted with surprise and delight.

""Then we're neighbors! I've been living there for about three months. I'm in 313.""

""Wow! I'm in 406,"" Sebastián said with a charming smile.

They paid and walked together toward the building. They shared the elevator, and just as Laura was saying goodbye to step out, Sebastián stopped her with some hesitation.

""Would you like to have breakfast with me?""

Laura nodded and, smiling, took his hand and led him out of the elevator toward her apartment.

As soon as they entered, they were greeted by three little dogs. One of them was friendlier than the others, though they were all adorable. Sebastián greeted them and petted them gently, which touched Laura’s heart.

They sat down for breakfast, with steaming cups of coffee and a plate of sliced fruit on the table. As they ate, Sebastián wanted to know more about the area and the building’s residents. Laura enthusiastically told him about the perks of living there: the proximity to nature, the fresh air, the peaceful atmosphere that seemed to embrace the place... But as she spoke, her expression changed. She remembered what the nights in that building were really like.

With a sigh, she confessed that the early hours were interrupted by blaring music, shouting, fights, and chaos coming from the bars owned by the Echeverri family. The more details she gave Sebastián, the darker his expression became. His jaw clenched, and his brows furrowed with a mix of anger and… disgust?

Laura noticed and, worried, asked if he was okay.

Sebastián let out a sigh he had been holding in during the entire conversation about the noise. He hesitated for a moment and then slowly removed a small device from his left ear. Laura looked at him, confused.

He noticed and let out a small chuckle, as if he knew how strange the scene must have seemed to her. He sighed again before explaining:

""It’s a noise-canceling earplug.""

Laura still didn’t fully understand.

""I’ve had phonophobia since I was a child,"" Sebastián continued. ""Basically, it’s an anxiety disorder that causes an irrational fear of loud, sudden noises. I’ve tried many things to improve my quality of life, and these earplugs help me cope. That’s why I decided to move here.""

He paused and looked at Laura, frustration flickering in his eyes.

""I visited the area several times before moving in. I liked the calm atmosphere, away from the main streets… but I never came at night. I had no idea about the noise.""

Laura watched him with concern. She gently took his hand and, with a warm, sincere voice, said:

""I’m so sorry, Sebastián. I didn’t know noise affected you like that. It’s driving me crazy, too. I can’t sleep well, I’m exhausted all the time, I need several cups of coffee just to stay awake… and even then, I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.""

Sebastián saw genuine concern in her eyes, and it moved him.

""Has anyone tried doing something? Calling the police or talking to the building manager?"" he asked, still trying to process the situation.

Laura sighed, weary, and told him what had happened with Mrs. Margarita, her husband, and the sale of the building. She explained how the new owner was a partner of the Echeverri family and how everyone had been threatened or harassed.

Sebastián listened in disbelief.

""How is that possible?"" he muttered, more to himself than to Laura. ""Who are these people to have so much power? How can they threaten people in their own homes with weapons and get away with it?""

Laura didn’t know what to say. No one could do anything. She had tried calling emergency services a couple of times, and things had turned out just as they had when Mrs. Margarita had called… except that Laura had never given her name. She didn’t want armed visitors from the Echeverri family showing up at her door.

The conversation ended. Sebastián mentioned he was going to finish unpacking and organizing his apartment. Laura noticed the discomfort and worry on his face… it was understandable, so she didn’t take his ""escape"" personally. They said goodbye with tired smiles before the door closed behind him.

Laura sighed and decided to take her dogs to the park. She walked with them to the garden in front of the building and watched them play, run around, sit on the grass, and drink water. She sat on one of the benches, enjoying a moment of peace… or so she thought.

She didn’t notice when someone else sat beside her. It was a faint sound, just a small throat-clearing, that made her turn her head. She didn’t know him personally, but she had seen him before. An Echeverri. A chill ran down her spine. Aware that her annoyed expression might give her away, Laura forced a half-smile.

The man chuckled, with calculated calm, and asked:

""How are you enjoying your new neighborhood?""

Laura held his gaze and answered with irony:

""It’s a beautiful place… though at night, there are some really annoying mosquitoes that keep me from sleeping.""

The man nodded with an amused air.

""That’s part of the charm of the place. It was designed that way, you know?"" He paused as if sharing a secret. ""Like a rat trap.""

Laura felt a knot in her stomach. She was about to protest, but he interrupted her.

""You can’t waste money building a paradise if there are no residents in it. It’s a matter of supply and demand. So, naturally, you have to train the rats to stay in place.""

His tone was calm, almost instructional. Laura looked at him with disgust, but he only smiled.

""I consider myself an expert on the behavior of those kinds of animals,"" he continued. ""And believe me… I can prove it.""

The tension in the air became unbearable. The man leaned slightly toward her, his gaze dark and challenging.

""There are always rewards for the best individuals in my experiment,"" he said with a twisted smile. ""Many little rats have a great time… you could be one of them. It just takes a little effort.""

Laura felt a wave of nausea and rage.

""I would never do something like that,"" she spat, her voice tense. ""You’re sick.""

For an instant, something changed in the man’s eyes. The amusement vanished. What remained was something colder, more dangerous.

He stood up slowly, but before leaving, he tilted his head slightly and whispered:

""Don’t say I didn’t warn you… little rat.""

Laura watched him walk away, a mix of revulsion and fear tightening in her chest. Her heart pounded. Quickly, she called her dogs, grabbed her things, and hurried back to the building.

From the window of apartment 406, someone had witnessed the scene. His eyes followed the man’s every move—the way he leaned toward Laura, the tension on her face, the fear in her eyes. When he saw her heading to the building with a hardened expression, he pulled the curtain shut and stepped away from the window. His jaw clenched. Something inside him told him that encounter wouldn’t be the last.

Laura entered her apartment, breathing heavily.

""Who the hell does that bastard think he is?"" she muttered through clenched teeth, slamming the door shut.

The Echeverris. That damned family. It wasn’t just the noise anymore. It wasn’t just the neighborhood nuisances. Now it was threats, harassment, and the sheer disgust they caused her.

A knock on the door made her turn immediately. Without thinking, without even checking who it was, she yanked it open.

Sebastián stood on the other side, surprised, his fist still raised, ready to knock again. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Laura blinked, trying to calm her fury.

""I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to startle you,"" she said, exhaling tiredly.

Sebastián lowered his hand and shook his head.

""Don’t worry,"" he replied calmly. ""I just wanted to know… what happened?""

The door opened without resistance. Laura frowned. Was Sebastián so careless as to leave the door unlocked? Cautiously, she stepped into the apartment. It was half-lived-in. Open boxes scattered across the floor, some filled with clothes, others with books and kitchen utensils. Of course, he was still moving in. Laura moved forward slowly.

""Sebastián?"" she whispered.

No response.

She headed toward the master bedroom, knowing exactly where it was. All the apartments in the building had the same layout. She stopped in front of the closed door and knocked softly. Nothing. The silence sent a chill down her spine. She turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open. The dim light from the street filtered through a poorly closed curtain, illuminating the unmade bed. But there was no sign of him. Laura felt her breathing quicken. Sebastián wasn’t there.

Laura approached the bedroom window. Surely, just like her earlier, Sebastián had heard the noise and opened the curtains to see what was going on. From there, her gaze locked onto the bar’s entrance. And there he was. Echeverri. Standing with a relaxed posture, as if everything around him was a spectacle staged for his amusement.

Then Laura saw the movement. A man in a black hoodie was approaching the bar’s entrance. Something about the way he walked made her stomach tighten. Echeverri noticed him and said something. Then, suddenly, he shoved him violently, sending him stumbling backward until he fell to the ground. The hood slipped off, revealing his face. Sebastián. It was Sebastián.

Her mind struggled to process it. What the hell was he doing there? After everything he had told her, after the way he had spoken about his phonophobia, his anxiety, his need to avoid noise… But he was there. In the middle of it all.

The scene unfolded too quickly, and Laura felt panic crawling up her throat. Sebastián didn’t move. He remained still on the ground for a few seconds, his head lowered, as if something inside him had broken. Echeverri said something else. Laura couldn’t hear it, but she saw the mockery in his expression, the way he laughed with scorn.

And then Sebastián stood up. Not with fear, not with nervousness, not with the trembling demeanor Laura had seen before. No. There was something different about him… something dark, something restrained, something that, in that instant, exploded.

Laura watched as Sebastián reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled out something that glinted under the streetlight… a knife. Her breath caught in her throat.

No.

No.

No.

Before she could react, Sebastián lunged at Echeverri. Laura thought it would be a fistfight, but no… It wasn’t. The first strike was precise. The knife plunged into Echeverri’s abdomen with a dull thud. Echeverri grunted in pain and tried to pull away, but Sebastián didn’t stop. The second strike was more violent. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth. The street filled with screams, but Sebastián kept going. Blow after blow, the knife sank into flesh with savage brutality. Echeverri had stopped moving long ago, but Sebastián didn’t stop. His breathing was an animalistic pant, his face shadowed by something unrecognizable.

Laura felt her legs trembling. Then Sebastián lifted his gaze toward her window. And he saw her. Their eyes met, but there was no remorse in his expression, no fear, nothing human—only raw, unrestrained fury.

And for the first time, Laura felt true terror.

Because in that moment, she knew Sebastián had no intention of stopping. Not tonight. Not until everything burned. Not until nothing was left.

He wouldn’t stop—she knew it, especially after the smile he gave her.

He attacked anyone who tried to stop him. A man was injured in the leg by one of Sebastián’s sharp blows, and others were also wounded.

Laura felt the air grow thick, as if she were suddenly breathing ashes. From the window, with her face pale and her fingers gripping the glass, she watched Sebastián move among the bushes, searching for something. Her heart pounded violently in her chest.

She didn’t want to know what he was looking for.

She didn’t want to see it, but she couldn’t look away.

Then, Sebastián straightened up, and in his right hand, he held a red container.

Laura felt the blood drain from her face. The plastic reflected the firelight, revealing the thick liquid inside.

Gasoline.

""No…""

The word escaped her lips like a breath with no strength.

Sebastián moved with calm, as if there weren’t bodies around him, as if the screams of pain were mere whispers in the night. He walked to the bar’s entrance, stopping just at the threshold. Laura watched as he unscrewed the cap of the container with a fluid, almost mechanical motion. He wasn’t in a hurry. He had no doubts.

Then, he tilted the container, letting the gasoline spill. The liquid spread quickly, darkening the wooden floor. The stench rose in a suffocating wave. Sebastián didn’t stop; he took a few steps inside the bar, splashing gasoline over the tables, the chairs, the agonizing bodies on the floor.

One of them, the man with the injured leg, stretched out a hand toward Sebastián and said something Laura couldn’t hear. Sebastián looked at him with a smile and poured gasoline directly onto him. The man let out a muffled scream, his eyes wide with terror.

Laura covered her mouth with both hands. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. Sebastián kept moving through the place, spreading gasoline in a perfect circle. Nothing was left untouched by the liquid. The stench was unbearable, even from where Laura stood. Her stomach churned. The screams inside the bar intensified. Those still alive understood what was about to happen. What Sebastián was about to do. And then, he took the final step outside the bar.

He stood at the entrance, the empty container hanging from his hand. He remained still for a moment, as if admiring his work. Laura was trembling uncontrollably. Sebastián let the container fall to the ground, reached into his jacket pocket, and… pulled something out. A cigarette. He placed it between his lips, lit it with a silver lighter, took a deep drag, then exhaled the smoke slowly, with terrifying peace. And with a simple flick of his fingers, he dropped the cigarette into the bar.

The explosion was instant.

The fire roared like a starving beast.

The flames devoured the bar’s interior in seconds, climbing the walls, licking the bodies, engulfing everything in its infernal heat. The windows shattered with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying into the street. The screams inside the bar turned into wails of pure terror. Laura felt her world collapse.

She couldn’t breathe.

She couldn’t move.

She could only watch.

Watch as those still inside tried to escape. Watch as Sebastián waited for them. When someone managed to crawl out, their skin reddened by the heat, Sebastián greeted them. With his knife. Without mercy. He plunged the blade into their bodies, over and over, then shoved them back into the fire. Laura gasped, her chest tightening, feeling the air abandon her. Tears filled her eyes. This wasn’t Sebastián. This couldn’t be him. But it was. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t doubt. He had no mercy.

Laura trembled from head to toe as she backed away, searching for something, anything. She ran out of the room toward the living room. There, she saw a phone on the table and rushed toward it. She dialed with clumsy fingers as she returned to the window and looked at the scene.

""Emergency services!""

The voice on the other end sounded calm. Too calm.

""A MAN IS KILLING EVERYONE! HE'S SETTING A BAR ON FIRE! PLEASE, SEND SOMEONE!""

""Address?""

Laura gave it desperately.

""Name""

""ANONYMOUS! JUST SEND SOMEONE!""

From the window, she saw Sebastián stepping away from the fire, his hands covered in blood. But he didn’t look tired. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look… human. His eyes met Laura’s. And he smiled. A wide smile, filled with peace, filled with devotion, filled with… madness. And with the calmest voice in the world, he shouted:

""Our peace, Laura… It’s beautiful!""

Laura felt the air leave her lungs. She felt the phone slip from her fingers. Her legs gave out. And she saw how Sebastián, unhurried, turned around and began to walk. Into the darkness. Into nothingness. Into his next destination. Laura stayed there, trembling, with tears running down her face. And for the first time in her life… she wondered if she would ever see him again. If she did… who would be the next to burn?

Dawn arrived in heavy silence, as if the earth itself was holding its breath. The bar, or what was left of it, was nothing but a blackened, smoldering shell. The bodies inside were no longer bodies; they were charred shadows, reduced to unrecognizable forms. The firefighters arrived as the sun rose on the horizon, but there was nothing left to save. No one left to rescue. The sirens did not wail with urgency, because urgency had died along with everyone trapped in that inferno.

The police never arrived. No official call was made. No one dared to speak. Because, after all, that place did not exist for the authorities. That territory, that cursed land, belonged to the Echeverris, and the Echeverri family had perished in their own trap. Ironic.

For years, they had ruled through fear. They had woven a web of silence and threats, ensuring that no outsider, no law, dared to intervene in their domain. They created a world where no one called for help. Where no one reported anything. A world they controlled with an iron fist. And now, that very world had become their tomb. A perfect cage. A cage that burned down to its foundations, consuming its masters.

Laura never heard from Sebastián again. She didn’t try to find him. She didn’t want to know. That very morning, before the scent of ash had even settled over the land, she left. She packed only the essentials—clothes, documents, whatever fit in a suitcase. And her dogs. She didn’t look back as she got into her car. She didn’t see the columns of black smoke still rising on the horizon. She didn’t want to remember. She didn’t want to give that place any space in her memory.

She drove without stopping to her mother’s house, far, far away from that nightmare disguised as home. She knew she would have to send someone later to collect her things, her furniture, the remnants of the life she had built there. But she would never return.

She would never make the mistake of trusting the daylight atmosphere of a new place. Because she had learned the lesson. The true face of a place is not seen under the sun—night is what reveals the truth. Night is what exposes the invisible cages. The traps disguised as paradises. The rats who believe themselves untouchable… until the fire reaches them.

Laura understood that now, and she would make sure never to fall into another cage again. No matter how beautiful it seemed. No matter how safe the day felt.

Because night always comes.

1iqzl74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1iqzl74/noise/,Noise,"Laura arrived at her new home full of hope. She had moved into a beautiful apartment with large windows that let in the golden afternoon light. From her room, she could admire a garden overflowing with life: lush trees, brightly colored flowers, butterflies, and birds singing melodies at dawn. Sometimes, if she left the window open, a curious butterfly would venture inside, filling her with a serene happiness. Her home was her sanctuary, decorated with all kinds of plants, which had also begun to take over her private terrace. There, she could enjoy the sun, the breeze, and the rain in the company of her dogs. It seemed like an idyllic life, a perfect refuge in the big city. But the night brought with it a very different reality.

Two bars flanked the building where Laura lived. When the sun set, the music exploded in a roar that made the walls tremble. Laughter, shouting, and the deafening thump of bass plunged her into a whirlwind of noise that kept her awake until the early hours of the morning. She tried everything: thick blinds, earplugs, white noise… but nothing could drown out the relentless clamor. The worst was when the neighbors turned on their modified cars with powerful speakers. At those moments, Laura felt like she couldn’t even hear her own thoughts. How could others sleep through such an acoustic torment? Was she the only one suffering from it?

After a week without rest, exhaustion consumed her. Should she leave? She had invested all her money in that apartment. Moving out meant abandoning her dream of independence and returning to her mother’s house. It wasn’t fair. A soft knock pulled her out of her thoughts. She approached the door and checked the security camera. Outside, an older woman waited, her face adorned with a kind smile and wrinkles that spoke of years lived. Laura opened the door.

“Hello, dear,” the woman said warmly. “I’m Margarita, your neighbor. I wanted to welcome you.”

In her hands, she held a small box from a famous local bakery. Laura returned her smile and invited her in. She made tea, and between sips and sweet bites, their conversation flowed naturally. Margarita was around her mother’s age, making it easy to talk to her. Soon, the topic of noise came up.

“Doesn’t it bother you?” Laura asked in frustration.

Margarita’s expression darkened. She lowered her gaze and sighed.

“My husband and I have had a hard time because of it,” she confessed. “We installed soundproof windows to lessen the noise. Even then, we still hear it sometimes.”

Laura’s eyes widened in disbelief. Soundproof windows… that cost a fortune.

“But why hasn’t anyone done anything?” she protested. “It’s unfair! Why should we spend more money just to have peace in our own home?”

Margarita looked at her with a strange glint in her eyes. It wasn’t just exhaustion. It was fear.

“Nothing can be done,” she whispered. “Not against the Echeverri family.”

Laura frowned; she didn’t understand why her neighbor spoke with such fear. Then, Margarita told her story.

Four years ago, when she and her husband Roberto moved in, they also suffered from the unbearable noise. Annoyed and believing in the authorities, she called the police several times to report the problem. With each call, they asked for details and if she wanted to remain anonymous… But in her naivety, Margarita gave them her name. The complaints were never addressed. The police never showed up. But someone else did.

The morning after a particularly loud night, someone knocked on the door. On the security camera, they saw a young man, tall, with a mustache. Margarita thought he might be a new neighbor since she hadn’t seen him in the building before. She opened the door, and the man introduced himself with a stiff, artificial smile: Gustavo Echeverri.

“I heard that the noise from the bars bothers you,” he said in a friendly tone.

Believing she had found an ally, Margarita openly complained. Gustavo listened with an understanding expression. But when she finished speaking, his smile changed. It became rigid, empty. His eyes hardened.

“Listen, old lady,” he said in a low but firm voice, “don’t get involved in things that don’t concern you. You can call whoever you want, but no one will do anything for you. You’d better try to sleep or move out.”

A chill ran down Margarita’s spine. She was about to reply when Gustavo, in a slow gesture, lifted his shirt to reveal a gun tucked into his belt. When she looked up, he was smirking. Heart pounding, Margarita tried to close the door, but Gustavo placed his foot in the way, stopping it. With a push, he stepped inside the apartment. Margarita stumbled backward, bumping into the living room table. Her husband, distracted by his book, looked up at the commotion. Seeing his wife’s terrified expression, he silently asked who the man was.

Before she could answer, Gustavo slowly advanced and grabbed Margarita’s chin, forcing her to look into his eyes. His voice was a chilling whisper:

“Try to live a quiet life. I don’t like being the bad guy, and you remind me of my grandmother… but you are not her. And I wouldn’t hesitate to take care of you… of both of you.”

He let her go abruptly, turned to Roberto, and extended his hand with a fake smile. Roberto, paralyzed, barely managed to shake it. Gustavo squeezed his hand with excessive force before yanking it away. He walked to the door and, before leaving, slammed it shut.

Laura was stunned. That wasn’t possible—the building owner should be able to do something about it. Margarita looked at her kindly, took her hand, and explained that there was nothing they could do. The building owner had sold the property years ago, and the new owner was a known associate of the Echeverri family. No one dared to intervene because everyone had been threatened or harassed by the Echeverris’ “watchdogs,” and apparently, the authorities were bought.

Margarita left after giving Laura a hug and welcoming her once more. When the door closed, Laura let out a strangled sigh. How had she ended up living in that place? A damn hell disguised as paradise.

Weeks passed, and Laura noticed how her quality of life deteriorated. On days off, she slept in to recover some energy, but her workdays were a nightmare. She felt like a zombie, and not even the multiple cups of coffee she drank daily helped. She was exhausted, too tired to fight for her peace anymore.

That Saturday morning, she left her apartment, heading to the nearest bakery. It was 11 AM, and she was just about to have breakfast. “Damn Echeverris,” she thought angrily.

She walked in, greeting the bakery workers, picked her favorite bread, and a poppy seed and red fruit cake. She lined up to pay… right behind a man. He was taller than her, with thick black hair, broad shoulders, and strong arms. From the side… his face was truly handsome, his smile too. Laura was captivated by the sight of him. He noticed her staring and let out a small chuckle—not mocking, but slightly embarrassed.

Laura snapped out of her reverie, cleared her throat, and apologized, feeling her cheeks flush. She extended her hand and introduced herself. He returned the gesture with a smile and said his name was Sebastián. He told her he was new to the area, that he had moved in the night before and had gone out to buy something for breakfast, just like she had.

""Where do you live?"" Laura asked curiously.

""In the Golden Alps Building,"" he replied.

Laura reacted with surprise and delight.

""Then we're neighbors! I've been living there for about three months. I'm in 313.""

""Wow! I'm in 406,"" Sebastián said with a charming smile.

They paid and walked together toward the building. They shared the elevator, and just as Laura was saying goodbye to step out, Sebastián stopped her with some hesitation.

""Would you like to have breakfast with me?""

Laura nodded and, smiling, took his hand and led him out of the elevator toward her apartment.

As soon as they entered, they were greeted by three little dogs. One of them was friendlier than the others, though they were all adorable. Sebastián greeted them and petted them gently, which touched Laura’s heart.

They sat down for breakfast, with steaming cups of coffee and a plate of sliced fruit on the table. As they ate, Sebastián wanted to know more about the area and the building’s residents. Laura enthusiastically told him about the perks of living there: the proximity to nature, the fresh air, the peaceful atmosphere that seemed to embrace the place... But as she spoke, her expression changed. She remembered what the nights in that building were really like.

With a sigh, she confessed that the early hours were interrupted by blaring music, shouting, fights, and chaos coming from the bars owned by the Echeverri family. The more details she gave Sebastián, the darker his expression became. His jaw clenched, and his brows furrowed with a mix of anger and… disgust?

Laura noticed and, worried, asked if he was okay.

Sebastián let out a sigh he had been holding in during the entire conversation about the noise. He hesitated for a moment and then slowly removed a small device from his left ear. Laura looked at him, confused.

He noticed and let out a small chuckle, as if he knew how strange the scene must have seemed to her. He sighed again before explaining:

""It’s a noise-canceling earplug.""

Laura still didn’t fully understand.

""I’ve had phonophobia since I was a child,"" Sebastián continued. ""Basically, it’s an anxiety disorder that causes an irrational fear of loud, sudden noises. I’ve tried many things to improve my quality of life, and these earplugs help me cope. That’s why I decided to move here.""

He paused and looked at Laura, frustration flickering in his eyes.

""I visited the area several times before moving in. I liked the calm atmosphere, away from the main streets… but I never came at night. I had no idea about the noise.""

Laura watched him with concern. She gently took his hand and, with a warm, sincere voice, said:

""I’m so sorry, Sebastián. I didn’t know noise affected you like that. It’s driving me crazy, too. I can’t sleep well, I’m exhausted all the time, I need several cups of coffee just to stay awake… and even then, I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.""

Sebastián saw genuine concern in her eyes, and it moved him.

""Has anyone tried doing something? Calling the police or talking to the building manager?"" he asked, still trying to process the situation.

Laura sighed, weary, and told him what had happened with Mrs. Margarita, her husband, and the sale of the building. She explained how the new owner was a partner of the Echeverri family and how everyone had been threatened or harassed.

Sebastián listened in disbelief.

""How is that possible?"" he muttered, more to himself than to Laura. ""Who are these people to have so much power? How can they threaten people in their own homes with weapons and get away with it?""

Laura didn’t know what to say. No one could do anything. She had tried calling emergency services a couple of times, and things had turned out just as they had when Mrs. Margarita had called… except that Laura had never given her name. She didn’t want armed visitors from the Echeverri family showing up at her door.

The conversation ended. Sebastián mentioned he was going to finish unpacking and organizing his apartment. Laura noticed the discomfort and worry on his face… it was understandable, so she didn’t take his ""escape"" personally. They said goodbye with tired smiles before the door closed behind him.

Laura sighed and decided to take her dogs to the park. She walked with them to the garden in front of the building and watched them play, run around, sit on the grass, and drink water. She sat on one of the benches, enjoying a moment of peace… or so she thought.

She didn’t notice when someone else sat beside her. It was a faint sound, just a small throat-clearing, that made her turn her head. She didn’t know him personally, but she had seen him before. An Echeverri. A chill ran down her spine. Aware that her annoyed expression might give her away, Laura forced a half-smile.

The man chuckled, with calculated calm, and asked:

""How are you enjoying your new neighborhood?""

Laura held his gaze and answered with irony:

""It’s a beautiful place… though at night, there are some really annoying mosquitoes that keep me from sleeping.""

The man nodded with an amused air.

""That’s part of the charm of the place. It was designed that way, you know?"" He paused as if sharing a secret. ""Like a rat trap.""

Laura felt a knot in her stomach. She was about to protest, but he interrupted her.

""You can’t waste money building a paradise if there are no residents in it. It’s a matter of supply and demand. So, naturally, you have to train the rats to stay in place.""

His tone was calm, almost instructional. Laura looked at him with disgust, but he only smiled.

""I consider myself an expert on the behavior of those kinds of animals,"" he continued. ""And believe me… I can prove it.""

The tension in the air became unbearable. The man leaned slightly toward her, his gaze dark and challenging.

""There are always rewards for the best individuals in my experiment,"" he said with a twisted smile. ""Many little rats have a great time… you could be one of them. It just takes a little effort.""

Laura felt a wave of nausea and rage.

""I would never do something like that,"" she spat, her voice tense. ""You’re sick.""

For an instant, something changed in the man’s eyes. The amusement vanished. What remained was something colder, more dangerous.

He stood up slowly, but before leaving, he tilted his head slightly and whispered:

""Don’t say I didn’t warn you… little rat.""

Laura watched him walk away, a mix of revulsion and fear tightening in her chest. Her heart pounded. Quickly, she called her dogs, grabbed her things, and hurried back to the building.

From the window of apartment 406, someone had witnessed the scene. His eyes followed the man’s every move—the way he leaned toward Laura, the tension on her face, the fear in her eyes. When he saw her heading to the building with a hardened expression, he pulled the curtain shut and stepped away from the window. His jaw clenched. Something inside him told him that encounter wouldn’t be the last.

Laura entered her apartment, breathing heavily.

""Who the hell does that bastard think he is?"" she muttered through clenched teeth, slamming the door shut.

The Echeverris. That damned family. It wasn’t just the noise anymore. It wasn’t just the neighborhood nuisances. Now it was threats, harassment, and the sheer disgust they caused her.

A knock on the door made her turn immediately. Without thinking, without even checking who it was, she yanked it open.

Sebastián stood on the other side, surprised, his fist still raised, ready to knock again. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Laura blinked, trying to calm her fury.

""I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to startle you,"" she said, exhaling tiredly.

Sebastián lowered his hand and shook his head.

""Don’t worry,"" he replied calmly. ""I just wanted to know… what happened?""

The door opened without resistance. Laura frowned. Was Sebastián so careless as to leave the door unlocked? Cautiously, she stepped into the apartment. It was half-lived-in. Open boxes scattered across the floor, some filled with clothes, others with books and kitchen utensils. Of course, he was still moving in. Laura moved forward slowly.

""Sebastián?"" she whispered.

No response.

She headed toward the master bedroom, knowing exactly where it was. All the apartments in the building had the same layout. She stopped in front of the closed door and knocked softly. Nothing. The silence sent a chill down her spine. She turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open. The dim light from the street filtered through a poorly closed curtain, illuminating the unmade bed. But there was no sign of him. Laura felt her breathing quicken. Sebastián wasn’t there.

Laura approached the bedroom window. Surely, just like her earlier, Sebastián had heard the noise and opened the curtains to see what was going on. From there, her gaze locked onto the bar’s entrance. And there he was. Echeverri. Standing with a relaxed posture, as if everything around him was a spectacle staged for his amusement.

Then Laura saw the movement. A man in a black hoodie was approaching the bar’s entrance. Something about the way he walked made her stomach tighten. Echeverri noticed him and said something. Then, suddenly, he shoved him violently, sending him stumbling backward until he fell to the ground. The hood slipped off, revealing his face. Sebastián. It was Sebastián.

Her mind struggled to process it. What the hell was he doing there? After everything he had told her, after the way he had spoken about his phonophobia, his anxiety, his need to avoid noise… But he was there. In the middle of it all.

The scene unfolded too quickly, and Laura felt panic crawling up her throat. Sebastián didn’t move. He remained still on the ground for a few seconds, his head lowered, as if something inside him had broken. Echeverri said something else. Laura couldn’t hear it, but she saw the mockery in his expression, the way he laughed with scorn.

And then Sebastián stood up. Not with fear, not with nervousness, not with the trembling demeanor Laura had seen before. No. There was something different about him… something dark, something restrained, something that, in that instant, exploded.

Laura watched as Sebastián reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled out something that glinted under the streetlight… a knife. Her breath caught in her throat.

No.

No.

No.

Before she could react, Sebastián lunged at Echeverri. Laura thought it would be a fistfight, but no… It wasn’t. The first strike was precise. The knife plunged into Echeverri’s abdomen with a dull thud. Echeverri grunted in pain and tried to pull away, but Sebastián didn’t stop. The second strike was more violent. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth. The street filled with screams, but Sebastián kept going. Blow after blow, the knife sank into flesh with savage brutality. Echeverri had stopped moving long ago, but Sebastián didn’t stop. His breathing was an animalistic pant, his face shadowed by something unrecognizable.

Laura felt her legs trembling. Then Sebastián lifted his gaze toward her window. And he saw her. Their eyes met, but there was no remorse in his expression, no fear, nothing human—only raw, unrestrained fury.

And for the first time, Laura felt true terror.

Because in that moment, she knew Sebastián had no intention of stopping. Not tonight. Not until everything burned. Not until nothing was left.

He wouldn’t stop—she knew it, especially after the smile he gave her.

He attacked anyone who tried to stop him. A man was injured in the leg by one of Sebastián’s sharp blows, and others were also wounded.

Laura felt the air grow thick, as if she were suddenly breathing ashes. From the window, with her face pale and her fingers gripping the glass, she watched Sebastián move among the bushes, searching for something. Her heart pounded violently in her chest.

She didn’t want to know what he was looking for.

She didn’t want to see it, but she couldn’t look away.

Then, Sebastián straightened up, and in his right hand, he held a red container.

Laura felt the blood drain from her face. The plastic reflected the firelight, revealing the thick liquid inside.

Gasoline.

""No…""

The word escaped her lips like a breath with no strength.

Sebastián moved with calm, as if there weren’t bodies around him, as if the screams of pain were mere whispers in the night. He walked to the bar’s entrance, stopping just at the threshold. Laura watched as he unscrewed the cap of the container with a fluid, almost mechanical motion. He wasn’t in a hurry. He had no doubts.

Then, he tilted the container, letting the gasoline spill. The liquid spread quickly, darkening the wooden floor. The stench rose in a suffocating wave. Sebastián didn’t stop; he took a few steps inside the bar, splashing gasoline over the tables, the chairs, the agonizing bodies on the floor.

One of them, the man with the injured leg, stretched out a hand toward Sebastián and said something Laura couldn’t hear. Sebastián looked at him with a smile and poured gasoline directly onto him. The man let out a muffled scream, his eyes wide with terror.

Laura covered her mouth with both hands. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. Sebastián kept moving through the place, spreading gasoline in a perfect circle. Nothing was left untouched by the liquid. The stench was unbearable, even from where Laura stood. Her stomach churned. The screams inside the bar intensified. Those still alive understood what was about to happen. What Sebastián was about to do. And then, he took the final step outside the bar.

He stood at the entrance, the empty container hanging from his hand. He remained still for a moment, as if admiring his work. Laura was trembling uncontrollably. Sebastián let the container fall to the ground, reached into his jacket pocket, and… pulled something out. A cigarette. He placed it between his lips, lit it with a silver lighter, took a deep drag, then exhaled the smoke slowly, with terrifying peace. And with a simple flick of his fingers, he dropped the cigarette into the bar.

The explosion was instant.

The fire roared like a starving beast.

The flames devoured the bar’s interior in seconds, climbing the walls, licking the bodies, engulfing everything in its infernal heat. The windows shattered with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying into the street. The screams inside the bar turned into wails of pure terror. Laura felt her world collapse.

She couldn’t breathe.

She couldn’t move.

She could only watch.

Watch as those still inside tried to escape. Watch as Sebastián waited for them. When someone managed to crawl out, their skin reddened by the heat, Sebastián greeted them. With his knife. Without mercy. He plunged the blade into their bodies, over and over, then shoved them back into the fire. Laura gasped, her chest tightening, feeling the air abandon her. Tears filled her eyes. This wasn’t Sebastián. This couldn’t be him. But it was. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t doubt. He had no mercy.

Laura trembled from head to toe as she backed away, searching for something, anything. She ran out of the room toward the living room. There, she saw a phone on the table and rushed toward it. She dialed with clumsy fingers as she returned to the window and looked at the scene.

""Emergency services!""

The voice on the other end sounded calm. Too calm.

""A MAN IS KILLING EVERYONE! HE'S SETTING A BAR ON FIRE! PLEASE, SEND SOMEONE!""

""Address?""

Laura gave it desperately.

""Name""

""ANONYMOUS! JUST SEND SOMEONE!""

From the window, she saw Sebastián stepping away from the fire, his hands covered in blood. But he didn’t look tired. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look… human. His eyes met Laura’s. And he smiled. A wide smile, filled with peace, filled with devotion, filled with… madness. And with the calmest voice in the world, he shouted:

""Our peace, Laura… It’s beautiful!""

Laura felt the air leave her lungs. She felt the phone slip from her fingers. Her legs gave out. And she saw how Sebastián, unhurried, turned around and began to walk. Into the darkness. Into nothingness. Into his next destination. Laura stayed there, trembling, with tears running down her face. And for the first time in her life… she wondered if she would ever see him again. If she did… who would be the next to burn?

Dawn arrived in heavy silence, as if the earth itself was holding its breath. The bar, or what was left of it, was nothing but a blackened, smoldering shell. The bodies inside were no longer bodies; they were charred shadows, reduced to unrecognizable forms. The firefighters arrived as the sun rose on the horizon, but there was nothing left to save. No one left to rescue. The sirens did not wail with urgency, because urgency had died along with everyone trapped in that inferno.

Before she could answer, Gustavo slowly advanced and grabbed Margarita’s chin, forcing her to look into his eyes. His voice was a chilling whisper:

“Try to live a quiet life. I don’t like being the bad guy, and you remind me of my grandmother… but you are not her. And I wouldn’t hesitate to take care of you… of both of you.”

He let her go abruptly, turned to Roberto, and extended his hand with a fake smile. Roberto, paralyzed, barely managed to shake it. Gustavo squeezed his hand with excessive force before yanking it away. He walked to the door and, before leaving, slammed it shut.

Laura was stunned. That wasn’t possible—the building owner should be able to do something about it. Margarita looked at her kindly, took her hand, and explained that there was nothing they could do. The building owner had sold the property years ago, and the new owner was a known associate of the Echeverri family. No one dared to intervene because everyone had been threatened or harassed by the Echeverris’ “watchdogs,” and apparently, the authorities were bought.

Margarita left after giving Laura a hug and welcoming her once more. When the door closed, Laura let out a strangled sigh. How had she ended up living in that place? A damn hell disguised as paradise.

Weeks passed, and Laura noticed how her quality of life deteriorated. On days off, she slept in to recover some energy, but her workdays were a nightmare. She felt like a zombie, and not even the multiple cups of coffee she drank daily helped. She was exhausted, too tired to fight for her peace anymore.

That Saturday morning, she left her apartment, heading to the nearest bakery. It was 11 AM, and she was just about to have breakfast. “Damn Echeverris,” she thought angrily.

She walked in, greeting the bakery workers, picked her favorite bread, and a poppy seed and red fruit cake. She lined up to pay… right behind a man. He was taller than her, with thick black hair, broad shoulders, and strong arms. From the side… his face was truly handsome, his smile too. Laura was captivated by the sight of him. He noticed her staring and let out a small chuckle—not mocking, but slightly embarrassed.

Laura snapped out of her reverie, cleared her throat, and apologized, feeling her cheeks flush. She extended her hand and introduced herself. He returned the gesture with a smile and said his name was Sebastián. He told her he was new to the area, that he had moved in the night before and had gone out to buy something for breakfast, just like she had.

""Where do you live?"" Laura asked curiously.

""In the Golden Alps Building,"" he replied.

Laura reacted with surprise and delight.

""Then we're neighbors! I've been living there for about three months. I'm in 313.""

""Wow! I'm in 406,"" Sebastián said with a charming smile.

They paid and walked together toward the building. They shared the elevator, and just as Laura was saying goodbye to step out, Sebastián stopped her with some hesitation.

""Would you like to have breakfast with me?""

Laura nodded and, smiling, took his hand and led him out of the elevator toward her apartment.

As soon as they entered, they were greeted by three little dogs. One of them was friendlier than the others, though they were all adorable. Sebastián greeted them and petted them gently, which touched Laura’s heart.

They sat down for breakfast, with steaming cups of coffee and a plate of sliced fruit on the table. As they ate, Sebastián wanted to know more about the area and the building’s residents. Laura enthusiastically told him about the perks of living there: the proximity to nature, the fresh air, the peaceful atmosphere that seemed to embrace the place... But as she spoke, her expression changed. She remembered what the nights in that building were really like.

With a sigh, she confessed that the early hours were interrupted by blaring music, shouting, fights, and chaos coming from the bars owned by the Echeverri family. The more details she gave Sebastián, the darker his expression became. His jaw clenched, and his brows furrowed with a mix of anger and… disgust?

Laura noticed and, worried, asked if he was okay.

Sebastián let out a sigh he had been holding in during the entire conversation about the noise. He hesitated for a moment and then slowly removed a small device from his left ear. Laura looked at him, confused.

He noticed and let out a small chuckle, as if he knew how strange the scene must have seemed to her. He sighed again before explaining:

""It’s a noise-canceling earplug.""

Laura still didn’t fully understand.

""I’ve had phonophobia since I was a child,"" Sebastián continued. ""Basically, it’s an anxiety disorder that causes an irrational fear of loud, sudden noises. I’ve tried many things to improve my quality of life, and these earplugs help me cope. That’s why I decided to move here.""

He paused and looked at Laura, frustration flickering in his eyes.

""I visited the area several times before moving in. I liked the calm atmosphere, away from the main streets… but I never came at night. I had no idea about the noise.""

Laura watched him with concern. She gently took his hand and, with a warm, sincere voice, said:

""I’m so sorry, Sebastián. I didn’t know noise affected you like that. It’s driving me crazy, too. I can’t sleep well, I’m exhausted all the time, I need several cups of coffee just to stay awake… and even then, I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.""

Sebastián saw genuine concern in her eyes, and it moved him.

""Has anyone tried doing something? Calling the police or talking to the building manager?"" he asked, still trying to process the situation.

Laura sighed, weary, and told him what had happened with Mrs. Margarita, her husband, and the sale of the building. She explained how the new owner was a partner of the Echeverri family and how everyone had been threatened or harassed.

Sebastián listened in disbelief.

""How is that possible?"" he muttered, more to himself than to Laura. ""Who are these people to have so much power? How can they threaten people in their own homes with weapons and get away with it?""

Laura didn’t know what to say. No one could do anything. She had tried calling emergency services a couple of times, and things had turned out just as they had when Mrs. Margarita had called… except that Laura had never given her name. She didn’t want armed visitors from the Echeverri family showing up at her door.

The conversation ended. Sebastián mentioned he was going to finish unpacking and organizing his apartment. Laura noticed the discomfort and worry on his face… it was understandable, so she didn’t take his ""escape"" personally. They said goodbye with tired smiles before the door closed behind him.

Laura sighed and decided to take her dogs to the park. She walked with them to the garden in front of the building and watched them play, run around, sit on the grass, and drink water. She sat on one of the benches, enjoying a moment of peace… or so she thought.

She didn’t notice when someone else sat beside her. It was a faint sound, just a small throat-clearing, that made her turn her head. She didn’t know him personally, but she had seen him before. An Echeverri. A chill ran down her spine. Aware that her annoyed expression might give her away, Laura forced a half-smile.

The man chuckled, with calculated calm, and asked:

""How are you enjoying your new neighborhood?""

Laura held his gaze and answered with irony:

""It’s a beautiful place… though at night, there are some really annoying mosquitoes that keep me from sleeping.""

The man nodded with an amused air.

""That’s part of the charm of the place. It was designed that way, you know?"" He paused as if sharing a secret. ""Like a rat trap.""

Laura felt a knot in her stomach. She was about to protest, but he interrupted her.

""You can’t waste money building a paradise if there are no residents in it. It’s a matter of supply and demand. So, naturally, you have to train the rats to stay in place.""

His tone was calm, almost instructional. Laura looked at him with disgust, but he only smiled.

""I consider myself an expert on the behavior of those kinds of animals,"" he continued. ""And believe me… I can prove it.""

The tension in the air became unbearable. The man leaned slightly toward her, his gaze dark and challenging.

""There are always rewards for the best individuals in my experiment,"" he said with a twisted smile. ""Many little rats have a great time… you could be one of them. It just takes a little effort.""

Laura felt a wave of nausea and rage.

""I would never do something like that,"" she spat, her voice tense. ""You’re sick.""

For an instant, something changed in the man’s eyes. The amusement vanished. What remained was something colder, more dangerous.

He stood up slowly, but before leaving, he tilted his head slightly and whispered:

""Don’t say I didn’t warn you… little rat.""

Laura watched him walk away, a mix of revulsion and fear tightening in her chest. Her heart pounded. Quickly, she called her dogs, grabbed her things, and hurried back to the building.

From the window of apartment 406, someone had witnessed the scene. His eyes followed the man’s every move—the way he leaned toward Laura, the tension on her face, the fear in her eyes. When he saw her heading to the building with a hardened expression, he pulled the curtain shut and stepped away from the window. His jaw clenched. Something inside him told him that encounter wouldn’t be the last.

Laura entered her apartment, breathing heavily.

""Who the hell does that bastard think he is?"" she muttered through clenched teeth, slamming the door shut.

The Echeverris. That damned family. It wasn’t just the noise anymore. It wasn’t just the neighborhood nuisances. Now it was threats, harassment, and the sheer disgust they caused her.

A knock on the door made her turn immediately. Without thinking, without even checking who it was, she yanked it open.

Sebastián stood on the other side, surprised, his fist still raised, ready to knock again. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Laura blinked, trying to calm her fury.

""I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to startle you,"" she said, exhaling tiredly.

Sebastián lowered his hand and shook his head.

""Don’t worry,"" he replied calmly. ""I just wanted to know… what happened?""

The door opened without resistance. Laura frowned. Was Sebastián so careless as to leave the door unlocked? Cautiously, she stepped into the apartment. It was half-lived-in. Open boxes scattered across the floor, some filled with clothes, others with books and kitchen utensils. Of course, he was still moving in. Laura moved forward slowly.

""Sebastián?"" she whispered.

No response.

She headed toward the master bedroom, knowing exactly where it was. All the apartments in the building had the same layout. She stopped in front of the closed door and knocked softly. Nothing. The silence sent a chill down her spine. She turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open. The dim light from the street filtered through a poorly closed curtain, illuminating the unmade bed. But there was no sign of him. Laura felt her breathing quicken. Sebastián wasn’t there.

Laura approached the bedroom window. Surely, just like her earlier, Sebastián had heard the noise and opened the curtains to see what was going on. From there, her gaze locked onto the bar’s entrance. And there he was. Echeverri. Standing with a relaxed posture, as if everything around him was a spectacle staged for his amusement.

Then Laura saw the movement. A man in a black hoodie was approaching the bar’s entrance. Something about the way he walked made her stomach tighten. Echeverri noticed him and said something. Then, suddenly, he shoved him violently, sending him stumbling backward until he fell to the ground. The hood slipped off, revealing his face. Sebastián. It was Sebastián.

Her mind struggled to process it. What the hell was he doing there? After everything he had told her, after the way he had spoken about his phonophobia, his anxiety, his need to avoid noise… But he was there. In the middle of it all.

The scene unfolded too quickly, and Laura felt panic crawling up her throat. Sebastián didn’t move. He remained still on the ground for a few seconds, his head lowered, as if something inside him had broken. Echeverri said something else. Laura couldn’t hear it, but she saw the mockery in his expression, the way he laughed with scorn.

And then Sebastián stood up. Not with fear, not with nervousness, not with the trembling demeanor Laura had seen before. No. There was something different about him… something dark, something restrained, something that, in that instant, exploded.

Laura watched as Sebastián reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled out something that glinted under the streetlight… a knife. Her breath caught in her throat.

No.

No.

No.

Before she could react, Sebastián lunged at Echeverri. Laura thought it would be a fistfight, but no… It wasn’t. The first strike was precise. The knife plunged into Echeverri’s abdomen with a dull thud. Echeverri grunted in pain and tried to pull away, but Sebastián didn’t stop. The second strike was more violent. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth. The street filled with screams, but Sebastián kept going. Blow after blow, the knife sank into flesh with savage brutality. Echeverri had stopped moving long ago, but Sebastián didn’t stop. His breathing was an animalistic pant, his face shadowed by something unrecognizable.

Laura felt her legs trembling. Then Sebastián lifted his gaze toward her window. And he saw her. Their eyes met, but there was no remorse in his expression, no fear, nothing human—only raw, unrestrained fury.

And for the first time, Laura felt true terror.

Because in that moment, she knew Sebastián had no intention of stopping. Not tonight. Not until everything burned. Not until nothing was left.

He wouldn’t stop—she knew it, especially after the smile he gave her.

He attacked anyone who tried to stop him. A man was injured in the leg by one of Sebastián’s sharp blows, and others were also wounded.

Laura felt the air grow thick, as if she were suddenly breathing ashes. From the window, with her face pale and her fingers gripping the glass, she watched Sebastián move among the bushes, searching for something. Her heart pounded violently in her chest.

She didn’t want to know what he was looking for.

She didn’t want to see it, but she couldn’t look away.

Then, Sebastián straightened up, and in his right hand, he held a red container.

Laura felt the blood drain from her face. The plastic reflected the firelight, revealing the thick liquid inside.

Gasoline.

""No…""

The word escaped her lips like a breath with no strength.

Sebastián moved with calm, as if there weren’t bodies around him, as if the screams of pain were mere whispers in the night. He walked to the bar’s entrance, stopping just at the threshold. Laura watched as he unscrewed the cap of the container with a fluid, almost mechanical motion. He wasn’t in a hurry. He had no doubts.

Then, he tilted the container, letting the gasoline spill. The liquid spread quickly, darkening the wooden floor. The stench rose in a suffocating wave. Sebastián didn’t stop; he took a few steps inside the bar, splashing gasoline over the tables, the chairs, the agonizing bodies on the floor.

One of them, the man with the injured leg, stretched out a hand toward Sebastián and said something Laura couldn’t hear. Sebastián looked at him with a smile and poured gasoline directly onto him. The man let out a muffled scream, his eyes wide with terror.

Laura covered her mouth with both hands. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. Sebastián kept moving through the place, spreading gasoline in a perfect circle. Nothing was left untouched by the liquid. The stench was unbearable, even from where Laura stood. Her stomach churned. The screams inside the bar intensified. Those still alive understood what was about to happen. What Sebastián was about to do. And then, he took the final step outside the bar.

He stood at the entrance, the empty container hanging from his hand. He remained still for a moment, as if admiring his work. Laura was trembling uncontrollably. Sebastián let the container fall to the ground, reached into his jacket pocket, and… pulled something out. A cigarette. He placed it between his lips, lit it with a silver lighter, took a deep drag, then exhaled the smoke slowly, with terrifying peace. And with a simple flick of his fingers, he dropped the cigarette into the bar.

The explosion was instant.

The fire roared like a starving beast.

The flames devoured the bar’s interior in seconds, climbing the walls, licking the bodies, engulfing everything in its infernal heat. The windows shattered with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying into the street. The screams inside the bar turned into wails of pure terror. Laura felt her world collapse.

She couldn’t breathe.

She couldn’t move.

She could only watch.

Watch as those still inside tried to escape. Watch as Sebastián waited for them. When someone managed to crawl out, their skin reddened by the heat, Sebastián greeted them. With his knife. Without mercy. He plunged the blade into their bodies, over and over, then shoved them back into the fire. Laura gasped, her chest tightening, feeling the air abandon her. Tears filled her eyes. This wasn’t Sebastián. This couldn’t be him. But it was. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t doubt. He had no mercy.

Laura trembled from head to toe as she backed away, searching for something, anything. She ran out of the room toward the living room. There, she saw a phone on the table and rushed toward it. She dialed with clumsy fingers as she returned to the window and looked at the scene.

""Emergency services!""

The voice on the other end sounded calm. Too calm.

""A MAN IS KILLING EVERYONE! HE'S SETTING A BAR ON FIRE! PLEASE, SEND SOMEONE!""

""Address?""

Laura gave it desperately.

""Name""

""ANONYMOUS! JUST SEND SOMEONE!""

From the window, she saw Sebastián stepping away from the fire, his hands covered in blood. But he didn’t look tired. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look… human. His eyes met Laura’s. And he smiled. A wide smile, filled with peace, filled with devotion, filled with… madness. And with the calmest voice in the world, he shouted:

""Our peace, Laura… It’s beautiful!""

Laura felt the air leave her lungs. She felt the phone slip from her fingers. Her legs gave out. And she saw how Sebastián, unhurried, turned around and began to walk. Into the darkness. Into nothingness. Into his next destination. Laura stayed there, trembling, with tears running down her face. And for the first time in her life… she wondered if she would ever see him again. If she did… who would be the next to burn?

Dawn arrived in heavy silence, as if the earth itself was holding its breath. The bar, or what was left of it, was nothing but a blackened, smoldering shell. The bodies inside were no longer bodies; they were charred shadows, reduced to unrecognizable forms. The firefighters arrived as the sun rose on the horizon, but there was nothing left to save. No one left to rescue. The sirens did not wail with urgency, because urgency had died along with everyone trapped in that inferno.

The police never arrived. No official call was made. No one dared to speak. Because, after all, that place did not exist for the authorities. That territory, that cursed land, belonged to the Echeverris, and the Echeverri family had perished in their own trap. Ironic.

For years, they had ruled through fear. They had woven a web of silence and threats, ensuring that no outsider, no law, dared to intervene in their domain. They created a world where no one called for help. Where no one reported anything. A world they controlled with an iron fist. And now, that very world had become their tomb. A perfect cage. A cage that burned down to its foundations, consuming its masters.

Laura never heard from Sebastián again. She didn’t try to find him. She didn’t want to know. That very morning, before the scent of ash had even settled over the land, she left. She packed only the essentials—clothes, documents, whatever fit in a suitcase. And her dogs. She didn’t look back as she got into her car. She didn’t see the columns of black smoke still rising on the horizon. She didn’t want to remember. She didn’t want to give that place any space in her memory.

She drove without stopping to her mother’s house, far, far away from that nightmare disguised as home. She knew she would have to send someone later to collect her things, her furniture, the remnants of the life she had built there. But she would never return.

She would never make the mistake of trusting the daylight atmosphere of a new place. Because she had learned the lesson. The true face of a place is not seen under the sun—night is what reveals the truth. Night is what exposes the invisible cages. The traps disguised as paradises. The rats who believe themselves untouchable… until the fire reaches them.

Laura understood that now, and she would make sure never to fall into another cage again. No matter how beautiful it seemed. No matter how safe the day felt.

Because night always comes.

1iqzkf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1iqzkf8/noise/,Noise,"Laura arrived at her new home full of hope. She had moved into a beautiful apartment with large windows that let in the golden afternoon light. From her room, she could admire a garden overflowing with life: lush trees, brightly colored flowers, butterflies, and birds singing melodies at dawn. Sometimes, if she left the window open, a curious butterfly would venture inside, filling her with a serene happiness. Her home was her sanctuary, decorated with all kinds of plants, which had also begun to take over her private terrace. There, she could enjoy the sun, the breeze, and the rain in the company of her dogs. It seemed like an idyllic life, a perfect refuge in the big city. But the night brought with it a very different reality.

Two bars flanked the building where Laura lived. When the sun set, the music exploded in a roar that made the walls tremble. Laughter, shouting, and the deafening thump of bass plunged her into a whirlwind of noise that kept her awake until the early hours of the morning. She tried everything: thick blinds, earplugs, white noise… but nothing could drown out the relentless clamor. The worst was when the neighbors turned on their modified cars with powerful speakers. At those moments, Laura felt like she couldn’t even hear her own thoughts. How could others sleep through such an acoustic torment? Was she the only one suffering from it?

After a week without rest, exhaustion consumed her. Should she leave? She had invested all her money in that apartment. Moving out meant abandoning her dream of independence and returning to her mother’s house. It wasn’t fair. A soft knock pulled her out of her thoughts. She approached the door and checked the security camera. Outside, an older woman waited, her face adorned with a kind smile and wrinkles that spoke of years lived. Laura opened the door.

“Hello, dear,” the woman said warmly. “I’m Margarita, your neighbor. I wanted to welcome you.”

In her hands, she held a small box from a famous local bakery. Laura returned her smile and invited her in. She made tea, and between sips and sweet bites, their conversation flowed naturally. Margarita was around her mother’s age, making it easy to talk to her. Soon, the topic of noise came up.

“Doesn’t it bother you?” Laura asked in frustration.

Margarita’s expression darkened. She lowered her gaze and sighed.

“My husband and I have had a hard time because of it,” she confessed. “We installed soundproof windows to lessen the noise. Even then, we still hear it sometimes.”

Laura’s eyes widened in disbelief. Soundproof windows… that cost a fortune.

“But why hasn’t anyone done anything?” she protested. “It’s unfair! Why should we spend more money just to have peace in our own home?”

Margarita looked at her with a strange glint in her eyes. It wasn’t just exhaustion. It was fear.

“Nothing can be done,” she whispered. “Not against the Echeverri family.”

Laura frowned; she didn’t understand why her neighbor spoke with such fear. Then, Margarita told her story.

Four years ago, when she and her husband Roberto moved in, they also suffered from the unbearable noise. Annoyed and believing in the authorities, she called the police several times to report the problem. With each call, they asked for details and if she wanted to remain anonymous… But in her naivety, Margarita gave them her name. The complaints were never addressed. The police never showed up. But someone else did.

The morning after a particularly loud night, someone knocked on the door. On the security camera, they saw a young man, tall, with a mustache. Margarita thought he might be a new neighbor since she hadn’t seen him in the building before. She opened the door, and the man introduced himself with a stiff, artificial smile: Gustavo Echeverri.

“I heard that the noise from the bars bothers you,” he said in a friendly tone.

Believing she had found an ally, Margarita openly complained. Gustavo listened with an understanding expression. But when she finished speaking, his smile changed. It became rigid, empty. His eyes hardened.

“Listen, old lady,” he said in a low but firm voice, “don’t get involved in things that don’t concern you. You can call whoever you want, but no one will do anything for you. You’d better try to sleep or move out.”

A chill ran down Margarita’s spine. She was about to reply when Gustavo, in a slow gesture, lifted his shirt to reveal a gun tucked into his belt. When she looked up, he was smirking. Heart pounding, Margarita tried to close the door, but Gustavo placed his foot in the way, stopping it. With a push, he stepped inside the apartment. Margarita stumbled backward, bumping into the living room table. Her husband, distracted by his book, looked up at the commotion. Seeing his wife’s terrified expression, he silently asked who the man was.

Before she could answer, Gustavo slowly advanced and grabbed Margarita’s chin, forcing her to look into his eyes. His voice was a chilling whisper:

“Try to live a quiet life. I don’t like being the bad guy, and you remind me of my grandmother… but you are not her. And I wouldn’t hesitate to take care of you… of both of you.”

He let her go abruptly, turned to Roberto, and extended his hand with a fake smile. Roberto, paralyzed, barely managed to shake it. Gustavo squeezed his hand with excessive force before yanking it away. He walked to the door and, before leaving, slammed it shut.

Laura was stunned. That wasn’t possible—the building owner should be able to do something about it. Margarita looked at her kindly, took her hand, and explained that there was nothing they could do. The building owner had sold the property years ago, and the new owner was a known associate of the Echeverri family. No one dared to intervene because everyone had been threatened or harassed by the Echeverris’ “watchdogs,” and apparently, the authorities were bought.

""I consider myself an expert on the behavior of those kinds of animals,"" he continued. ""And believe me… I can prove it.""

The tension in the air became unbearable. The man leaned slightly toward her, his gaze dark and challenging.

""There are always rewards for the best individuals in my experiment,"" he said with a twisted smile. ""Many little rats have a great time… you could be one of them. It just takes a little effort.""

Laura felt a wave of nausea and rage.

""I would never do something like that,"" she spat, her voice tense. ""You’re sick.""

For an instant, something changed in the man’s eyes. The amusement vanished. What remained was something colder, more dangerous.

He stood up slowly, but before leaving, he tilted his head slightly and whispered:

""Don’t say I didn’t warn you… little rat.""

Laura watched him walk away, a mix of revulsion and fear tightening in her chest. Her heart pounded. Quickly, she called her dogs, grabbed her things, and hurried back to the building.

From the window of apartment 406, someone had witnessed the scene. His eyes followed the man’s every move—the way he leaned toward Laura, the tension on her face, the fear in her eyes. When he saw her heading to the building with a hardened expression, he pulled the curtain shut and stepped away from the window. His jaw clenched. Something inside him told him that encounter wouldn’t be the last.

Laura entered her apartment, breathing heavily.

""Who the hell does that bastard think he is?"" she muttered through clenched teeth, slamming the door shut.

The Echeverris. That damned family. It wasn’t just the noise anymore. It wasn’t just the neighborhood nuisances. Now it was threats, harassment, and the sheer disgust they caused her.

A knock on the door made her turn immediately. Without thinking, without even checking who it was, she yanked it open.

Sebastián stood on the other side, surprised, his fist still raised, ready to knock again. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Laura blinked, trying to calm her fury.

""I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to startle you,"" she said, exhaling tiredly.

Sebastián lowered his hand and shook his head.

""Don’t worry,"" he replied calmly. ""I just wanted to know… what happened?""

The door opened without resistance. Laura frowned. Was Sebastián so careless as to leave the door unlocked? Cautiously, she stepped into the apartment. It was half-lived-in. Open boxes scattered across the floor, some filled with clothes, others with books and kitchen utensils. Of course, he was still moving in. Laura moved forward slowly.

""Sebastián?"" she whispered.

No response.

She headed toward the master bedroom, knowing exactly where it was. All the apartments in the building had the same layout. She stopped in front of the closed door and knocked softly. Nothing. The silence sent a chill down her spine. She turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open. The dim light from the street filtered through a poorly closed curtain, illuminating the unmade bed. But there was no sign of him. Laura felt her breathing quicken. Sebastián wasn’t there.

Laura approached the bedroom window. Surely, just like her earlier, Sebastián had heard the noise and opened the curtains to see what was going on. From there, her gaze locked onto the bar’s entrance. And there he was. Echeverri. Standing with a relaxed posture, as if everything around him was a spectacle staged for his amusement.

Then Laura saw the movement. A man in a black hoodie was approaching the bar’s entrance. Something about the way he walked made her stomach tighten. Echeverri noticed him and said something. Then, suddenly, he shoved him violently, sending him stumbling backward until he fell to the ground. The hood slipped off, revealing his face. Sebastián. It was Sebastián.

Her mind struggled to process it. What the hell was he doing there? After everything he had told her, after the way he had spoken about his phonophobia, his anxiety, his need to avoid noise… But he was there. In the middle of it all.

The scene unfolded too quickly, and Laura felt panic crawling up her throat. Sebastián didn’t move. He remained still on the ground for a few seconds, his head lowered, as if something inside him had broken. Echeverri said something else. Laura couldn’t hear it, but she saw the mockery in his expression, the way he laughed with scorn.

And then Sebastián stood up. Not with fear, not with nervousness, not with the trembling demeanor Laura had seen before. No. There was something different about him… something dark, something restrained, something that, in that instant, exploded.

Laura watched as Sebastián reached into his hoodie pocket and pulled out something that glinted under the streetlight… a knife. Her breath caught in her throat.

No.

No.

No.

Before she could react, Sebastián lunged at Echeverri. Laura thought it would be a fistfight, but no… It wasn’t. The first strike was precise. The knife plunged into Echeverri’s abdomen with a dull thud. Echeverri grunted in pain and tried to pull away, but Sebastián didn’t stop. The second strike was more violent. Then the third. The fourth. The fifth. The street filled with screams, but Sebastián kept going. Blow after blow, the knife sank into flesh with savage brutality. Echeverri had stopped moving long ago, but Sebastián didn’t stop. His breathing was an animalistic pant, his face shadowed by something unrecognizable.

Laura felt her legs trembling. Then Sebastián lifted his gaze toward her window. And he saw her. Their eyes met, but there was no remorse in his expression, no fear, nothing human—only raw, unrestrained fury.

And for the first time, Laura felt true terror.

Because in that moment, she knew Sebastián had no intention of stopping. Not tonight. Not until everything burned. Not until nothing was left.

He wouldn’t stop—she knew it, especially after the smile he gave her.

He attacked anyone who tried to stop him. A man was injured in the leg by one of Sebastián’s sharp blows, and others were also wounded.

Laura felt the air grow thick, as if she were suddenly breathing ashes. From the window, with her face pale and her fingers gripping the glass, she watched Sebastián move among the bushes, searching for something. Her heart pounded violently in her chest.

She didn’t want to know what he was looking for.

She didn’t want to see it, but she couldn’t look away.

Then, Sebastián straightened up, and in his right hand, he held a red container.

Laura felt the blood drain from her face. The plastic reflected the firelight, revealing the thick liquid inside.

Gasoline.

""No…""

The word escaped her lips like a breath with no strength.

Sebastián moved with calm, as if there weren’t bodies around him, as if the screams of pain were mere whispers in the night. He walked to the bar’s entrance, stopping just at the threshold. Laura watched as he unscrewed the cap of the container with a fluid, almost mechanical motion. He wasn’t in a hurry. He had no doubts.

Then, he tilted the container, letting the gasoline spill. The liquid spread quickly, darkening the wooden floor. The stench rose in a suffocating wave. Sebastián didn’t stop; he took a few steps inside the bar, splashing gasoline over the tables, the chairs, the agonizing bodies on the floor.

One of them, the man with the injured leg, stretched out a hand toward Sebastián and said something Laura couldn’t hear. Sebastián looked at him with a smile and poured gasoline directly onto him. The man let out a muffled scream, his eyes wide with terror.

Laura covered her mouth with both hands. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. Sebastián kept moving through the place, spreading gasoline in a perfect circle. Nothing was left untouched by the liquid. The stench was unbearable, even from where Laura stood. Her stomach churned. The screams inside the bar intensified. Those still alive understood what was about to happen. What Sebastián was about to do. And then, he took the final step outside the bar.

He stood at the entrance, the empty container hanging from his hand. He remained still for a moment, as if admiring his work. Laura was trembling uncontrollably. Sebastián let the container fall to the ground, reached into his jacket pocket, and… pulled something out. A cigarette. He placed it between his lips, lit it with a silver lighter, took a deep drag, then exhaled the smoke slowly, with terrifying peace. And with a simple flick of his fingers, he dropped the cigarette into the bar.

The explosion was instant.

The fire roared like a starving beast.

The flames devoured the bar’s interior in seconds, climbing the walls, licking the bodies, engulfing everything in its infernal heat. The windows shattered with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying into the street. The screams inside the bar turned into wails of pure terror. Laura felt her world collapse.

She couldn’t breathe.

She couldn’t move.

She could only watch.

Watch as those still inside tried to escape. Watch as Sebastián waited for them. When someone managed to crawl out, their skin reddened by the heat, Sebastián greeted them. With his knife. Without mercy. He plunged the blade into their bodies, over and over, then shoved them back into the fire. Laura gasped, her chest tightening, feeling the air abandon her. Tears filled her eyes. This wasn’t Sebastián. This couldn’t be him. But it was. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t doubt. He had no mercy.

Laura trembled from head to toe as she backed away, searching for something, anything. She ran out of the room toward the living room. There, she saw a phone on the table and rushed toward it. She dialed with clumsy fingers as she returned to the window and looked at the scene.

""Emergency services!""

The voice on the other end sounded calm. Too calm.

""A MAN IS KILLING EVERYONE! HE'S SETTING A BAR ON FIRE! PLEASE, SEND SOMEONE!""

""Address?""

Laura gave it desperately.

""Name""

""ANONYMOUS! JUST SEND SOMEONE!""

From the window, she saw Sebastián stepping away from the fire, his hands covered in blood. But he didn’t look tired. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look… human. His eyes met Laura’s. And he smiled. A wide smile, filled with peace, filled with devotion, filled with… madness. And with the calmest voice in the world, he shouted:

""Our peace, Laura… It’s beautiful!""

Laura felt the air leave her lungs. She felt the phone slip from her fingers. Her legs gave out. And she saw how Sebastián, unhurried, turned around and began to walk. Into the darkness. Into nothingness. Into his next destination. Laura stayed there, trembling, with tears running down her face. And for the first time in her life… she wondered if she would ever see him again. If she did… who would be the next to burn?

Dawn arrived in heavy silence, as if the earth itself was holding its breath. The bar, or what was left of it, was nothing but a blackened, smoldering shell. The bodies inside were no longer bodies; they were charred shadows, reduced to unrecognizable forms. The firefighters arrived as the sun rose on the horizon, but there was nothing left to save. No one left to rescue. The sirens did not wail with urgency, because urgency had died along with everyone trapped in that inferno.

The police never arrived. No official call was made. No one dared to speak. Because, after all, that place did not exist for the authorities. That territory, that cursed land, belonged to the Echeverris, and the Echeverri family had perished in their own trap. Ironic.

For years, they had ruled through fear. They had woven a web of silence and threats, ensuring that no outsider, no law, dared to intervene in their domain. They created a world where no one called for help. Where no one reported anything. A world they controlled with an iron fist. And now, that very world had become their tomb. A perfect cage. A cage that burned down to its foundations, consuming its masters.

Laura never heard from Sebastián again. She didn’t try to find him. She didn’t want to know. That very morning, before the scent of ash had even settled over the land, she left. She packed only the essentials—clothes, documents, whatever fit in a suitcase. And her dogs. She didn’t look back as she got into her car. She didn’t see the columns of black smoke still rising on the horizon. She didn’t want to remember. She didn’t want to give that place any space in her memory.

She drove without stopping to her mother’s house, far, far away from that nightmare disguised as home. She knew she would have to send someone later to collect her things, her furniture, the remnants of the life she had built there. But she would never return.

She would never make the mistake of trusting the daylight atmosphere of a new place. Because she had learned the lesson. The true face of a place is not seen under the sun—night is what reveals the truth. Night is what exposes the invisible cages. The traps disguised as paradises. The rats who believe themselves untouchable… until the fire reaches them.

Laura understood that now, and she would make sure never to fall into another cage again. No matter how beautiful it seemed. No matter how safe the day felt.

Because night always comes.

Since I single-dose, the Eureka Oro Mignon Single Dose, Single Dose Pro, and Mignon Zero 65 grinders caught my eye with their 65mm burr sets. But I have some questions and am hoping for feedback from folks who have used these grinders, and how they would compare to a standard Mignon Zero with 55mm burrs.

# For background:

**Beans I enjoy:**  I love to try different beans, so I don't really standardize on light, medium or dark roasts or washed vs natural at all, though I do tend toward medium roasts with ripe fruit or cocoa flavors over tea-like or floral coffees.  I just love trying and tinkering with anything that sounds tasty. My wife does enjoy a good, syrupy, chocolatey shot, though, so that may influence things a bit.

**Drinks:** espresso double-shots, cortados, cappuccinos, lattes.  An aside, I also make filter coffee (pour-over and Aeropress), but I have an Ode Gen 2 for filter brewing.  This grinder would be primarily, or exclusively, for espresso.

**Workflow:** Single-dosing.  No need for grind-by-weight or timed grind options.  I prefer to grind into a catch cup, not my portafilter.

**Current machine:** Cafelat Robot lever machine

**Current Grinder:** 1Zpresso J-Ultra hand grinder

**Other notes:** I want to single-dose for espresso, since I'm only making one or two shots at a time.

# Questions:

1. First, I see a standard and a Pro model of the Oro SD. I see different features  listed for these two on their individual product pages (links to [the SD](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/products/eureka+oro/prosumer+grinders/prosumer/71.aspx) and [SD Pro](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/products/eureka+oro/prosumer+grinders/prosumer/119.aspx)), but the comparison tool indicates they have the same burrs, same motor specs, they seem identical. I don't know what the differences are between the two models. I also only see the standard Single Dose listed on Clive Coffee, and ECS only has 220V for the Pro. **Can any one elaborate on the differences? Or are these the same grinder for different markets?**
2. **Secondly, are the 65mm burrs in the Oro SD/SD Pro and Zero 65 going to be a noticeable upgrade over less-expensive 55mm burr models like the Mignon Zero?** Or should I save my money and go with the standard Zero? I've noticed comments about the Zero being a quieter grinder than the Oro, which is attractive to me, but not a deal-breaker. I would love a more-nuanced cup, but I do enjoy a thicker espresso and don't know that I want the super-high clarity that large flat burrs are striving for.
3. Lastly, **has anyone tried tilting the standard Zero to help with retention, similar to the Oro?** Or is retention not really an issue with the Zero?
4. Or **should I consider a totally different option?**  I'm deliberately avoiding Chinese-made grinders, both from a quality standpoint and because of the recent tariff war.  So, no DF, Turin, Niche, etc. in the mix.",1,1739732316.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
1iqzipt,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1iqzipt/they_are_trying_to_pin_it_all_on_me/,They are trying to pin it all on me,"Throwaway account for reasons. I will probably delete this after some time. Please be gentle, it's been a really rough few days.

I'm a pretty quiet, observant smaller woman, so I've got used to people assuming that I'm a pushover. Sometimes however, they get angry when I show that I have a spine and won't bend over easily. I just never expected it to happen to this degree.

An acquaintance of my spouse started a cafe and needed someone to help with their front-of-house. My spouse is excited to have me work there because it's a chance for me to help set up a business from the ground up. We even brought one of our good friends to help set up their coffee operations and be their head barista (important for later).

From the start, I have objectively been nothing but kind and generous. Knowing that they're just a new small business, I offered to do unpaid labour, like cleaning, admin work, even picking up props and furniture at no cost - I wanted to set them up for success as much as possible, even if it means reducing my own paid labour hours. I let the business owners hang out in our home, let them borrow blankets and pillows, consulted them on look and feel, gave them free decorations.

One week to opening day, the main owner (a guy) blew up at me over text for printing the menus wrongly. The kicker is I'm not even the graphic designer, I only printed whatever file was given to me. In his blow up he let out that they were expecting me to pick up more slack, essentially doing managerial duties, WITHOUT even telling me that I've been hired as a manager.

In response I told the co-owner (a woman) that regardless of how they view my role right now, I will not take this and thus I will be scaling back my involvement massively. Instead of being there everyday, now I asked to be scheduled for fewer days, and I iterated that I will only be working in a server capacity. I even printed menus for free  using my own supplies to make up for the inconvenience. This really rubbed them off the wrong way and they started mistreating me since.

The abusive treatment gets to a point where other staff members are even asking questions about it because it's being done so blatantly. These other staff members are noticeably younger by at least 10 years. I go above and beyond, doing work that other staff don't even have initiative to like extra cleaning, yet the owners only ever give me snappy responses and treated me with silent bullying. They send me home early, pick on me excessively for checking my phone, complain that I don't do stuff according to their wants which was never conveyed to me. I get cut off from all communications and then get blamed for not doing things ""properly"". The cherry on top is the two owners are not even on the same page about this. The male owner told me that I ""gave up my managerial position"" by cutting my shift although he expects me to still lead the team. The female owner straight up told me to leave the managing to the owners and to be less directive to the other staff.

It all came to a head when one morning I walked in and they fired me effective immediately, citing that I've not been a good fit. No prior warning whatsoever (This also happened within days of my relative passing away and me asking for a day off for a funeral event). Later that day, the male owner contacted both my spouse and our barista friend (both of whom are bigger taller males) to tell them that I've been fired for missing expectations, giving them random examples like ""she doesn't know how to mop"" or ""her visions for decor are wrong"". Pretty clear that he's trying to wash his hands off this and shifting all the blame on me, when I did not even know what my job was. He cited that the owners ""wanted to watch me work first before laying out standard operations procedure"".

He then dropped the bomb on my spouse: The major reason I got fired is because they have foreign investors who are convinced that I stole money. The till was off in the first few days due to their own glitchy POS system. I also was never the sole person who had access to the till. When my spouse asked if they have proof, he could not say - just that the foreign investors kept watching the cctv footage and found no one else to blame but me. They are now considering taking legal actions against me for theft - yes, after firing me with no cause and no warning and during my grieving period.

My spouse and everybody who knows the situation, including other local business owners, are utterly baffled. The cafe is so new that so far none of us have even got paid for the week that we've worked. I know that I did not steal and the law is on my side, but I still have been crying on and off ever since. Whatever the amount was, it would've been less than $40 since the cash till have never had more than that. I've shown them so much generosity and they are fixated on things they perceive I did wrongly.

My spouse and I are ready to take them to the cleaners, but doesn't mean it will be a fun ride. I know the cafe is not doing good financially due to so much mismanagement. The male owner has stated that these foreign investors will keep going until either I or they are ruined. I am so tired already. Everyone tells me I have objectively done nothing wrong. My spouse even asked the owner if he really thinks I would steal after all the free labour I've done, and he has no answer. I don't know why I'm posting, I guess I'm just looking for sympathy and some kind words especially from fellow softer women. It won't be an easy battle but I can't let some people I've never even met use me as a doormat.",4,1739732246.0,internetparents,8,0.83,False
1iqzimj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqzimj,Trip to Cottonwood and Jerome Arizona,"I commented on another user's post but now that I'm home and laundry is put away doing my own. 

We traveled to Cottonwood this past Sunday, returning home on the east coast shortly after midnight Saturday morning. After ariving on Sunday we watched our team win the Super Bowl at a local bar in Cottonwood so we were already off to a great start to our vacation. 

Monday morning we headed to the Queen B Vinyl Cafe for coffee and breakfast. We were greeted by Maynard's wife. We take a seat in the middle of the Cafe. Order our cappacinos from the very friendly barista/waitress and look over the menu. People are walking in and out from the backroom and my husband whispers to me, ""Babe, he's here, don't panic and don't look"". Five feet from us Maynard is seated at a table with his laptop discussing what I assume is restraunt business with two other men. He was super soft spoken and honestly I wasn't even trying to listen. At some point my husband smiled and nodded and just turned back to our conversation. I get up a little later to use the restroom and glance over that way and just give a quick smile. We eat our breakfast and thank the waitress. I snap a few pics of the place but try not to take too many and make sure my body was blocking the camera so there was no way there was even a thought that I was taking a picture of him. My husband got sick of hearing the joke that. ""We ate breakfast with Maynard"" for the rest of our trip. We did get coffee from the Cafe daily.

Over the next couple of days we went to a few other local sites. Slide Rock State Park is beautiful and I'd highly recommend it during the warmer months especially. We also did Mead tasting in Sedona at the Savanah Bee Store and took the 2.5 hour each way trip to the Grand Canyon.

 If you can, check out Brewha Social Eatery. Awesome atmophere and the food was fantastic. 

We also went to Jerome which was an awesome little town with really cool shops. I could have spent the day in the kaleidoscope store. I'm a VSC member so we went to Caduceus for my free flights. We ended up also getting the cheese board which was tasty. First time trying cashew cheese and would def buy it for myself. 

We also went to Merkin for dinner one night. Was a pretty big disappointment. They had a Wagyu steak special that my husband got. He asked for medium and it was cooked well, not a bit of pink in the entire steak. They also pre cut it for him which is not something we're use to. I got  the cavatelli pesto and asked for chicken with  it. They served the chicken on the side which was strange to me. The pasta was rather bland and after taking a few bites I found a hair in it. The general manager was very apologetic and removed my entree from our bill. He also offered to make me anything else I wanted off the menu but I declined. By that point I was kind of turned off and  was just ready to go bit they did the roght thing and took care of it professionaly. The traditional bruschetta was really good. 

We didn't get a change to go to Four 8 Fried Chicken but if we ever go back we'll certainly check it out. ",16,1739732240.0,ToolBand,0,0.94,False

So that’s what we did we moved in together, I moved into your place because my lease was ending and we were just going to ride out your lease and move into a bigger place or a house.
We merged our lives we merged our things we got to cuddle every night now we finally got to go from come over to come home.
Our schedules were so opposite we were lucky if you had more than one day off a week to spend with me in the evening. 
Here and there you were able to request days off on the weekends and we would have some event to go to whether with your or my friends. But the nature of everything was that I woke up at 6 AM to work 8-3/4/5 and you would have to go into work at 3 or 5 to work until almost midnight because you bartended even though you kept saying “I’m tired of bartending I don’t want to do this forever”
The intimacy didn’t fully stop but it was not near as much as it was in the beginning, but you fight for these things right? 

I just took a trip with friends for my birthday and you were so thoughtful as you always were and had a collage for not only me but my 2 friends whose birthdays we were celebrating too. You set this up with another one of our friends and wow everyone was so in awe. That was just 3 months back…
We also celebrated our 2 years in that same month. You wrote to me thank you for choosing US everyday not just on the easy days but on the hard days too. YOU wrote that in that card who knew 3 months later you wouldn’t choose US. 


Fast forward we once again went to each of our families’ thanksgiving and Christmas’s and we just went to Europe at the beginning of December. 
You sent me a meme “you were my favorite part of the year” we still texted throughout the day and yes it was becoming not as frequent but we have different schedules and responsibilities. We would cook together or I spent once a week meal prepping for us to make our lives easier. We would sit at home and watch tv, but we never really dove much into each other’s day just a how was your day. 
Or I would try and stay awake until you were off work and you would come get into bed with me and I would tell you you can turn your show on and I would lay with you because I was already supposed to be on my way to sleep. You brought up while we were breaking up this didn’t make you feel close to me, but why couldn’t you initiate anything? 


I realized that we had hit a place of complacency and I told myself I want to work on this and ignite that spark we once had when we were so in love. So I made us a couples challenge. 
That same night I made that you were at work, you then texted me hey babe gonna get a drink with some coworkers but we all have to be up early I’ll be home soon I hope you get some sleep babe. 
Well, you weren’t home soon. As a matter of fact you got too drunk and slept on your coworkers couch. But you could’ve got an Uber or your coworker could’ve dropped you off.
Why were we so easy to disrespect?

You did not text me the next day with any type of apology. So I in my anger text you and said you not texting me tells me a lot. And your response was what do you want me to say you’re at work and this isn’t a convo we should have while you’re working.
I told you I would be staying at my friend’s house that night because I didn’t want to be angry and have a blow up fight and you worked anyways.
The next day I had a friends fathers funeral to attend and I did and you didn’t text me I hope we can talk today or anything at all. 
Then you picked up at work that night..
I stayed at our home and woke up in the middle of the night to you sleeping on the couch. Why couldn’t you come to bed and apologize..
I left for work the next morning and got home around 3:30 and you were home.

We both mustered a hey and you said do you want to talk and I said well we should and you said but do you want to right now? And I said well, yes we haven’t seen each other since Monday morning and we need to talk. The conversation started off with you apologizing and saying you know that you are in the wrong and you could’ve Uber and you don’t know why you didn’t. And I said, I didn’t understand how you could so easily disrespect our relationship When you said you were gonna be home soon but then you stayed out all night and didn’t even text me an apology didn’t even double down in the morning an additional apology and be like I’m so sorry this is what happened. And you understood where I was coming from. You were very apologetic.
And I guess what messes me up is that I started bringing up how you got home that day after you stayed out and it took you almost 6 hours to walk our dog and I know because we have a patio camera and I said maybe I want to get home from work and not have to worry that he needs to go on a 30 minute walk why can’t you do that more often? And you just said he doesn’t have to go on a 30 minute walk every day and I said but why not you said I don’t know I guess I just don’t think he does. And then I said maybe I want to come home to dinner already made I’ve been meal prepping for us. How come you can’t do it sometimes and you again said I don’t know. I guess I haven’t felt like it. I said I feel like you’re so inclined to leave your friends notes all the time and I feel like you stopped doing that for me. 
And you said, I guess I just haven’t felt like it. You said I feel like we’re just playing House some days. I said well yes our opposite schedules don’t help this very much. I said I realize we’ve become complacent so I made this and I showed her the couples challenge that I made. And she said well we used to do this all the time and I said well yes that’s why I made it so that we can get back to doing this. And then this is where it all started falling apart. 

You started saying well I can’t promise you that I’ll put in the effort to do this. And I said well why not. And you said I don’t know. I just can’t promise you that I will. And then you said I don’t want it to be a waste of our time in a few months if I don’t put in effort. Our conversation lasted almost 4 hours, but we didn’t talk the entire time. There was a lot of silence and tears. I said I don’t understand how you can’t approach this from a positive mindset and say yes I’m willing to put this effort in and we’ll see where we are after.

You said we’ll come home and hardly talk to each other. We’ll just watch TV or we’ll get in the car after hanging out with friends and listen to music and hardly talk and you feel like I feel like our relationship is one way when it’s really not. And I said I don’t feel like our relationship is better than it appears but I do think that we do need to work on things. And you once again said I can’t promise you I’ll put in that effort.

Then you said you had to convince me once before to stay in a relationship and I said I didn’t realize that I had to convince you to stay with me you chose to I said so you’ve wanted to be done since that argument and you said no not at all so I feel like you’re just grasping for straws. 
You said I know you gave up a lot to move in here and I know you gave up a lot of your stuff and I’m sorry and this is all really shitty to say to somebody. And I said I don’t understand how you’re not able to approach this from a positive mindset. I’m sitting here willing to work on something and you just don’t want to. You’re just checked out so I guess my question now is what was true in the last couple of months because it seems like you’re three steps ahead in this.

You then said OK well we’ve been sitting here for hours and I’m hungry and I’m tired and we’re not really getting anywhere and I said well what are we then what is this? I need you to say it. I said you’re just willing to throw away 2 1/2 years together just like that just that easy. And then I guess you thought I was trying to argue at this point because I was trying to fight for us and you said quit trying to drag me back into a relationship that I don’t know if I wanna be in. So that hurt. So then I said, why did you even have me move in? It’s only been six months. And you said I don’t know. Then you said well it didn’t make sense for you to sign another lease when I was always at your house. So that’s hurtful because you move in with somebody because you’re ready to not because you don’t want me to sign another lease. Maybe we wouldn’t be here right now if that was the case.
You said we just have different personalities which isn’t a bad thing but that I can be dry sometimes or sarcastic and you can’t tell if I’m being serious or in a mood, you always loved that I loved to do research but then you threw it in my face while you were ending things you said you’ll tell me something and then I just have to look it up right away. You said you didn’t feel the need to tell me some stuff anymore because I would also chime in with my own story, isn’t that how normal conversations work? 

Obviously, theres still tears at this point so i’m crying and I’m like I don’t understand how you’re just willing to throw away 2 1/2 years I don’t wanna start over at my age and you said yeah try being my age cause you’re 2 1/2 years older than me. And I said well you’re choosing this. You’re the one choosing to throw this away. And you said oh my God quit trying to argue with me and grabbed your stuff and left to your friends house. So that night I spent a lot of time crying. The next day I hadn’t heard from you yet so I texted you I don’t want to lose you. And you finally text back last night was a lot emotionally for the both of us. I’m not feeling any different today than I was last night and I’m hurting too. Then you said This will be hard for me too, but I still can’t say I’m willing to put the work in. Then you said I’m going to lunch with my friends and then I’m staying at their house to get ready for Galentine‘s tomorrow. I don’t know if you still plan on going to that or not and then you said again I’m sorry.
I know you knew I was on the way home from work at that time too, so why couldn’t you stay and just talk again even if it was more of a closure conversation.

Maybe if I wouldn’t have brought up the things that were irritating me about needing additional help then we wouldn’t have spiraled into all of what was bothering us. I can’t understand how you could look me in the eyes and say you weren’t willing to put any more effort into us.
We just went on several double dates in January and a solo date and a friends wedding, you just got me flowered for our monthaversary. I just set your mornings up where you would just have to click brew on the coffee start on the microwave. 
You told me you felt like I would mom you sometimes? I was just always trying to do stuff to make your life easier, i would ask you if you were going to clean your car because you brought it up first. I made you a resume to apply to jobs because you constantly said you hated bartending and don’t want to forever.


So that night, I started packing my stuff because why would I stay in a one bedroom apartment with somebody who told me that they didn’t know if they want to be in this relationship? And then I moved out the next day. And then I text you back and I said I understand we both have different personalities and there’s things we need to work on together and I really think couples therapy would be great for the both of us and I don’t think this is where our story ends and we don’t see each other again or talk. I don’t know what to say or do right now and I don’t want you to see this as me trying to convince you, but I really don’t think this is our end. you of course we’re out for Galentine‘s all day and then had to go to work afterwards and I was pretty much 99% moved out by the time you got home. 

And then you text me the next day and said hey, I’m sorry for the late response. I hear what you’re saying and everything you’re saying is valid but I still can’t say I am/was ready to. You said we’ve had great memories and ups and downs like any other relationship and you’ll always be thankful for things, but you still can’t say that you were willing to put the effort in and you think this is best for the both of us in the long run. And if we didn’t put the additional effort in what makes me think we would now? You said I’m sorry for hurting you and hurting you in this way but I think we will both heal and move on. You said I’m a little shocked. This all happened so fast but again I think this is best in the long run. And you said I’ll find someone deserving of my love because we both know I have a lot to give and you said I’m not your person. you said you were a little shocked that I got so much done yesterday and you weren’t sure if I was picking up anything else but you probably wouldn’t be there and then you had a company party to go to and then you work the next day and then you said again, I am really sorry.

I went back-and-forth on how to even respond and what way would be best and I landed on I’m gonna write you a letter with my feelings and final thoughts. So I grabbed a few things I forgot and I left the letter with your key on top of it and a trinket that said you’re my person that I’ve been saving for a while that I found on a walk one day.

In the letter, I didn’t undermine your feelings. I said you’re allowed to feel however you want, but please don’t say that you think this is best for the both of us because that is not how I feel. I said it hurts that you don’t think that I am worth fighting for and it really hurts that you think we are not worth fighting for. I said because I believe that we are and I believe that you are. I said it wasn’t fair for you to say that you’re not my person when I feel like you are I said next time just say I’m not your person because that’s what it seems. I said to you that it feels like you’re three steps ahead in this and I thought I was planning our future and I guess you were planning your exit I said maybe this is not the case but that’s sure what it seems like from my end. I said what hurts is that the last image I have of you now is you leaving to go to your friends house and not looking back and not having another conversation with me. I said I really hope this isn’t the last time we see or talk to each other and maybe who knows somewhere down the road when we’re better versions of ourselves we can rekindle because we wanted to be with each other so bad I don’t think that this is the end of our story. But I said I can’t hold out that hope forever that you’ll even reach out to me because I can’t break my own heart every day if you don’t.

Well, I left the letter. I’ve never heard from you like I thought. I didn’t know if I expected I would, but I knew at least a letter would more than likely not get a response and at least that may not upset me as much but unfortunately it does. You have now blocked me on all social media. I’m unsure if my number is blocked or not, but I’m fighting with the fact that I feel abandoned Because I feel like you were able to give this away so easily. 

I really want to text you and ask if you know there’s resentment or you’re mad at me but I don’t know what reason you would have to be mad. Maybe you’re mad that I moved out so quickly, but I’m not sure what you expected after some of the things you said. But nothing I wrote in the letter could’ve made you mad and I asked you in the letter to reach out if you wanted to so I guess you don’t want to. Now I’m grieving that what could’ve been in all the future memories I had planned for us And it hurts that it seems like you were able to block me so easily and that it seems like you never wanna talk or see me again. Maybe that’s not the case and maybe you’re hurting too, but I really don’t know. all I know is I miss you terribly and I don’t know how long this is gonna take me to get over even though I should get over it because you didn’t want us. You didn’t want to fight for us. You didn’t wanna put in the effort. 

Relationships are not a cakewalk the honeymoon phase ends and you’re supposed to fight for that every day and put in that effort you wanted me so bad for so long and then it’s like you got me and then you just gave it all away.
Anyways, do I reach out to you or do I let it go? 
I don’t know why I want to text you and say I harbor know ill feelings toward you. But again, I can’t help this feeling of it didn’t have to end so fast this way.
I hope you can realize the love that we shared and I hope that you can sit with that and realize that if we just talk to a couples therapist and we actively work on us then we are so good together. Even all of my friends were so shocked they all said we did not see this coming. Y’all always seem to head over heels for each other. And I’m so shocked that it doesn’t seem like any of your friends have asked you what on earth you’re doing and why aren’t you fighting for this because your friends all loved me and vocalize this to you all the time. Anyways, I hated having all these thoughts, and I hate this is  over and I miss you terribly..but it really seems you no longer love me. 

I wish you would’ve shared how you were feeling with me sooner. I asked you at the beginning of January did we still make sense to you, and you told me yes. Fast forward 4 weeks later and you broke my heart. ",1,1739731971.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1iqzek8,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1iqzek8/help_is_it_normal_to_feel_constantly_hungry_after/,HELP! Is it normal to feel constantly hungry after starting weight training?,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and excited to join this community. I love the support and hype in this community! 

I’m just getting back into weight training after many years of neglecting it. For context, I’m turning 38 in March, I’m a parent of two, and I already incorporate a good amount of cardio and high-intensity training into my routine each week. 

My activity in a week looks something like this: 
2-3 days intense bouldering 
2-3 days weight training 
1-2 active rest days hike or brisk walk with hills 
At least 1 “lazy rest day” no expectations but the normal daily living activities and house cleaning plus chasing a toddler around lol 

Since starting weight training about two weeks ago, I’ve noticed that I am ravenous all the time...like a bottomless pit. Sometimes, I even wake up in the middle of the night “starving”, which is completely abnormal for me and honestly kind of scary. Is this normal? I am making sure that I am drinking lots of water as well. Will it taper off, or should I be taking a closer look at my calorie intake and macros? I feel like something might be missing.

For reference:
*I’m 5’7” and around 128 lbs (depending on the time of the month, lol).
*I’m not 100% sure of my body fat percentage, but based on measurements, I’d estimate around 18%.
*My goal with weight training is to FEEL strong, and attempt a proper body recomposition for the first time in my life. I have long-term health and wellness goals, but also, let’s be real—some slightly vain ones too! I’d love to be in the best shape of my life before 40. More than anything, I want to keep up with my kids, stay strong for my active hobbies, and feel great while remaining injury-free.

For supplements, I’m currently taking:
*A daily multivitamin
*Magnesium and electrolyte powder in a glass of water
*5g of creatine (split into two servings throughout the day, just started about a week ago)
*100% pure whey isolate protein powder to help boost my protein intake, especially on crazy busy days chasing a toddler around
*BCAAs for extra support
*A scoop of MCT marine collagen in my daily coffee
*On workout days, I take a really nice pre-workout with BCAAs, some adaptogens, and a hint of caffeine, it gives me an even boost without making me feel jittery or buzzy

I’d love any insight or advice from those who’ve been through this! Does the hunger level out? Am I just not eating enough? I am averaging at least 2000 calories a day which seems like a lot…and a good amount of protein (like 120-140+ grams) I should add that I have been doing Keto for nearly 2 months, so my macros look a bit different. 

Thanks in advance for any insight and support ",11,1739731958.0,xxfitness,16,0.87,False

I would be looking for an under-sink solution that can plumb into a tri-flow tap.

  
I'm in the South of the UK with hard water at 313ppm of calcium carbonate (17.5 DH), 25mg/l of chloride, 0.41mg/l chlorine and 12mg/l of sodium (I can provide other info from my local water report if useful). I'm planning to get a whole house salt based softener. I have read that this just swaps calcium and magnesium for sodium, which means the water ends up containing a lot of sodium. As much as this would be less damaging to the espresso machine, it probably wouldn't taste great.

I am currently aware of BWT BestMax filters, which seem to commonly be used for coffee, but I'm not sure if these are suitable for the amount of sodium coming from the softener, and whether that would shorten the lifespan. The other option I'm considering is a RO system, followed by remineralisation. I have read mixed things about remineralisation, many people say it's not consistent. Another option would be to mix RO + unsoftened water to the filtered tap at a ratio of 5:1 (assuming RO is 0 TDS), if a device exists that could mix these in an adjustable way. This undoes some of the work of the RO unit removing chloride etc but would still end up much lower than the unsoftened water. Another option would be RO without any mixing then using TWW / DIY remin, but I would rather the water coming out of the filter tap is drinkable so I can use it for drinking water + filling up ice cube trays etc.

Would love to hear if anyone else living in a very hard water area has solved this problem and what you would recommend!",1,1739731902.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I'm a pretty quiet, observant smaller woman, so I've got used to people assuming that I'm a pushover. Sometimes however, they get angry when I show that I have a spine and won't bend over easily. I just never expected it to happen to this degree.

An acquaintance of my spouse started a cafe and needed someone to help with their front-of-house. My spouse is excited to have me work there because it's a chance for me to help set up a business from the ground up. We even brought one of our good friends to help set up their coffee operations and be their head barista (important for later).

From the start, I have objectively been nothing but kind and generous. Knowing that they're just a new small business, I offered to do unpaid labour, like cleaning, admin work, even picking up props and furniture at no cost - I wanted to set them up for success as much as possible, even if it means reducing my own paid labour hours. I let the business owners hang out in our home, let them borrow blankets and pillows, consulted them on look and feel, gave them free decorations.

One week to opening day, the main owner (a guy) blew up at me over text for printing the menus wrongly. The kicker is I'm not even the graphic designer, I only printed whatever file was given to me. In his blow up he let out that they were expecting me to pick up more slack, essentially doing managerial duties, WITHOUT even telling me that I've been hired as a manager.

In response I told the co-owner (a woman) that regardless of how they view my role right now, I will not take this and thus I will be scaling back my involvement massively. Instead of being there everyday, now I asked to be scheduled for fewer days, and I iterated that I will only be working in a server capacity. I even printed menus for free  using my own supplies to make up for the inconvenience. This really rubbed them off the wrong way and they started mistreating me since.

The abusive treatment gets to a point where other staff members are even asking questions about it because it's being done so blatantly. These other staff members are noticeably younger by at least 10 years. I go above and beyond, doing work that other staff don't even have initiative to like extra cleaning, yet the owners only ever give me snappy responses and treated me with silent bullying. They send me home early, pick on me excessively for checking my phone, complain that I don't do stuff according to their wants which was never conveyed to me. I get cut off from all communications and then get blamed for not doing things ""properly"". The cherry on top is the two owners are not even on the same page about this. The male owner told me that I ""gave up my managerial position"" by cutting my shift although he expects me to still lead the team. The female owner straight up told me to leave the managing to the owners and to be less directive to the other staff.

It all came to a head when one morning I walked in and they fired me effective immediately, citing that I've not been a good fit. No prior warning whatsoever (This also happened within days of my relative passing away and me asking for a day off for a funeral event). Later that day, the male owner contacted both my spouse and our barista friend (both of whom are bigger taller males) to tell them that I've been fired for missing expectations, giving them random examples like ""she doesn't know how to mop"" or ""her visions for decor are wrong"". Pretty clear that he's trying to wash his hands off this and shifting all the blame on me, when I did not even know what my job was. He cited that the owners ""wanted to watch me work first before laying out standard operations procedure"".

He then dropped the bomb on my spouse: The major reason I got fired is because they have foreign investors who are convinced that I stole money. The till was off in the first few days due to their own glitchy POS system. I also was never the sole person who had access to the till. When my spouse asked if they have proof, he could not say - just that the foreign investors kept watching the cctv footage and found no one else to blame but me. They are now considering taking legal actions against me for theft - yes, after firing me with no cause and no warning and during my grieving period.

My spouse and everybody who knows the situation, including other local business owners, are utterly baffled. The cafe is so new that so far none of us have even got paid for the week that we've worked. I know that I did not steal and the law is on my side, but I still have been crying on and off ever since. Whatever the amount was, it would've been less than $40 since the cash till have never had more than that. I've shown them so much generosity and they are fixated on things they perceive I did wrongly.

My spouse and I are ready to take them to the cleaners, but doesn't mean it will be a fun ride. I know the cafe is not doing good financially due to so much mismanagement. The male owner has stated that these foreign investors will keep going until either I or they are ruined. I am so tired already. Everyone tells me I have objectively done nothing wrong. My spouse even asked the owner if he really thinks I would steal after all the free labour I've done, and he has no answer. I don't know why I'm posting, I guess I'm just looking for sympathy and some kind words especially from fellow softer women. It won't be an easy battle but I can't let some people I've never even met use me as a doormat.",8,1739731856.0,asiantwoX,1,1.0,False

Instead of being there everyday, now I asked to be scheduled for fewer days, and I iterated that I will only be working in a server capacity. I even printed menus for free  using my own supplies to make up for the inconvenience. This really rubbed them off the wrong way and they started mistreating me since.

The abusive treatment gets to a point where other staff members are even asking questions about it because it's being done so blatantly. These other staff members are noticeably younger by at least 10 years. I go above and beyond, doing work that other staff don't even have initiative to like extra cleaning, yet the owners only ever give me snappy responses and treated me with silent bullying. They send me home early, pick on me excessively for checking my phone, complain that I don't do stuff according to their wants which was never conveyed to me. I get cut off from all communications and then get blamed for not doing things ""properly"". The cherry on top is the two owners are not even on the same page about this. The male owner told me that I ""gave up my managerial position"" by cutting my shift although he expects me to still lead the team. The female owner straight up told me to leave the managing to the owners and to be less directive to the other staff.

It all came to a head when one morning I walked in and they fired me effective immediately, citing that I've not been a good fit. No prior warning whatsoever (This also happened within days of my relative passing away and me asking for a day off for a funeral event). Later that day, the male owner contacted both my spouse and our barista friend (both of whom are bigger taller males) to tell them that I've been fired for missing expectations, giving them random examples like ""she doesn't know how to mop"" or ""her visions for decor are wrong"". Pretty clear that he's trying to wash his hands off this and shifting all the blame on me, when I did not even know what my job was. He cited that the owners ""wanted to watch me work first before laying out standard operations procedure"".

He then dropped the bomb on my spouse: The major reason I got fired is because they have foreign investors who are convinced that I stole money. The till was off in the first few days due to their own glitchy POS system. I also was never the sole person who had access to the till. When my spouse asked if they have proof, he could not say - just that the foreign investors kept watching the cctv footage and found no one else to blame but me. They are now considering taking legal actions against me for theft - yes, after firing me with no cause and no warning and during my grieving period.

My spouse and everybody who knows the situation, including other local business owners, are utterly baffled. The cafe is so new that so far none of us have even got paid for the week that we've worked. I know that I did not steal and the law is on my side, but I still have been crying on and off ever since. Whatever the amount was, it would've been less than $40 since the cash till have never had more than that. I've shown them so much generosity and they are fixated on things they perceive I did wrongly.

My spouse and I are ready to take them to the cleaners, but doesn't mean it will be a fun ride. I know the cafe is not doing good financially due to so much mismanagement. The male owner has stated that these foreign investors will keep going until either I or they are ruined. I am so tired already. Everyone tells me I have objectively done nothing wrong. My spouse even asked the owner if he really thinks I would steal after all the free labour I've done, and he has no answer. I don't know why I'm posting, I guess I'm just looking for sympathy and some kind words especially from fellow softer women. It won't be an easy battle but I can't let some people I've never even met use me as a doormat.",1,1739731777.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1iqz86h,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1iqz86h/im_having_a_bad_day/,I'm having a bad day.,"I started the day by feeling good. It's rainy here in NY and I got my apartment straightened out and tended to my dog. It's the second day this week that I've had for myself so I'm feeling more 'laxxed after a really crazy, crazy week. 

I get ready and noticed that one of my back molars is half-black. I've never seen my teeth look any other color other than yellow (we love that <3). I probably have to get it pulled. It cost me 3k to get another tooth pulled and crowned and I'm not even finished paying that off. I know what i need to do but can't think about it now. Just going to put it on my calendar once I sit down to make an appointment. My lashes need a fill and I need to get my roots done. All a reminder of living above my means and making a decision to even have both done to begin with without acknowledging my budget. I grab my laptop and my calendar because I was gonna do some extra cleansing of my notes and photos. FIgure out the week coming and feel more organized. I go get my eyebrows done first. Easy. I find a new cafe to visit and I head there. Parking is difficult which would usually make me just ditch but I didn't really mind spending the time looking. I find parking right in front of the place and figure, it was worth the 7-10 minutes I spent looking.

I'm inside and notice a man looking right at me, he was at the front and closest to me but was on the phone. He ended up just walking away. I didn't even think he worked there. A man from the bar came up to me and told me that he didn't know about the table availability but there was room at the bar. I told him I'd wait for a tbale. I wait another 3 minutes of just standing at the front door facing the whole restaurant. Holding my laptop and books. The man from the start of my walking in is now walking towards me with purpose. I realize that kind of walk and energy means he works there. I look at him in the eyes with no smile as I was really put off by the fact that he didn't even acknowledge me when I came in. I let him begin the interaction and when I tell him I'd like a table for just one, he cut me off and said there was no space for that. Just at the bar. I didn't let him finish either and said ""okay, thank you, bye."" and walked next door to another cafe. 

This other cafe was practically empty and had one employee behind the front. He is ringing out one woman and I am behind her looking at the menus and food that was prepared. I realize it really is just one employee on staff today and accept that there's going to be a wait. Its been about 3-4 minutes when a man walks in and starts walking around. I see him see me and that's enough for me to know that, he knows I'm on line. I start looking at the menu again and another 3-4 minutes go by. I look to the side of me and realize that the man just went ahead of me and the man at the register just let him. I'm looking at both of them to make sure I understand the scenario and say out loud but only loud enough for me to hear ""I was before him"" to myself. I see them both look at me with questioning faces and start walking back to get my things. I say ""That's really rude, I was before him."" The employee puts up a finger and says ""yes, one minute."" Why would I wait any longer than I already have? I'm also already leaving. 

I get to my car and I figure I'm just gonna try somehwere else completely but not let my attitude get in the way of my time. My friends text me and I brief them on how I am going to stay centered and calm. I end up losing my cool while venting to them about what happened. At this point, I arrive to one of my favorite cafes in town. As I'm walking in, my phone falls out of my pocket and won't turn on. I keep walking as in I'm just thinking ""great!"". I'm in less of an angry mood and just accepted my phone's broken. I sit down and order my go-tos. I open my laptop to my good friend who just went through a dramatic and violent break up (hence why my week was so crazy by supporting her during the busiest weeks of the year as of yet for me) is now back with the dude. Losing sleep, not taking care of my dog to the best of my abilities, rushing everywhere and taking half-showers, not having a second to myself, etc. this week was all just for her to take the dude back. My salad - no exaggeration because of course this would happen - has rotting lettuce. The kind where it's wet and black. My sandwich that I always get had iceberg lettuce (huh?!), no prosciutto, and none of the mustard spread. I just ask for the mustard spread on the side and a side of the vinaigrette from the salad to dip my 'wich in. I'm not eating the salad. The waiter brings me a bowl of the mustard spread which looks like butter (typically just mustard seeds and oil mixed together) and the dressing on top of that. In one bowl. Why would I want that. I settled and dipped my sandwich in it but ... why would you put two sauces in one bowl. I guess I was going to do that anyway on my own. My drink was a mint lemonade. Paper straw. Mint leaves were all brown and it made the lemonade look overly yellow - almost brown itself. 

I'm still here and I'm cold so I'm going to order a coffee and ask for the lemonade to be taken off. I'm going to get my phone fixed. That's another hurdle. It's not the end of the world. Just should be the end of the day. ",1,1739731531.0,venting,1,1.0,False

It all began with a photo. I received a letter from the elementary school, even though Juno Cook, my son, had just started kindergarten.

I thought they'd mixed up the address, but when I looked at the recipient's name—no, it was my husband, Dexter Cook.

I opened it, and inside was a photo along with a thank-you note from the school. There was also a small piece of paper. It read, [Sylvia, don't you think this photo of him and me looks more fitting than yours?]

My heart sank. I quickly glanced at the photo. It was a family portrait, but the faces of the woman and child had been scratched out, leaving only the smiling man. That man was someone I knew all too well—Dexter.

The child in the picture looked to be about ten, several years older than my son. I thought, 'What the hell is this? Is someone playing a prank on me? Or... has Dexter really betrayed me?'

My phone suddenly rang, making me jump. The photo slipped from my hands and fell to the floor, sliding under the cabinet. In a panic, I didn't have time to pick it up and grabbed the phone.

""Hello, darling, I'll be home tonight. If it's too late, don't wait up for me."" Dexter's warm, familiar voice was a small comfort to my racing heart.

""What time's your flight?"" I asked.

""After five. I'll be back once I finish my work. I'm skipping the dinner. How are you and Juno?""

""We're... fine."" I held back my unease. ""I'll wait for you.""

""Alright, love you."" Dexter hung up.

I exhaled. That was Dexter, the one who loved me. We'd been married for six years, and our relationship had always been strong. I thought, 'No man who cheats could ever be Dexter. But that photo...'

Suddenly, a colleague knocked and opened the door. ""Sylvia, hurry up! The boss is waiting for us in the meeting room.""

""Okay, I'm coming."" There was no time to pick up the photo. I grabbed my folder and hurried out.

Two hours later, after a nonstop meeting, I finally made it back to my office. My legs ached from standing in high heels for so long.

I rushed to check under the cabinet, but it was empty—nothing was there. For a moment, I thought I was dreaming.

I thought, 'No one ever comes into my office, and I was the only one in the room when the photo fell. How could it have disappeared?'

I searched every corner of my office, but the photo was gone—vanished without a trace. Not only the photo, but the envelope I'd left on my desk was missing too.

That crucial piece of evidence—the one that had stirred up all those emotions—was gone. I sat there, stunned, wondering if I was imagining things.

Then my phone rang again—it was Juno's teacher, Vivian Paige.

""Mrs. Cook, when will you come pick him up?"" Vivian asked.

'Oh no! I almost forget about my son!' I thought.

""I'll be right there. Please keep an eye on him for a little longer.""

I wondered, 'How can I be so absent-minded? No matter how busy or upset I am, I shouldn't have forgotten to pick up Juno.'

The housekeeper had the day off, and I'd reminded myself this morning, but the letter completely threw me off track.

I rushed to the kindergarten, and the campus was already deserted. Not a soul in sight. Juno, with his little backpack, was waiting for me, blinking his big eyes at me.

""Mom!"" The moment Juno saw me, his eyes lit up. ""Why are you so late? All the other kids have already been picked up by their parents.""

I felt a rush of guilt. I hugged him and kissed his cheek. ""I'm sorry, sweetie. Mommy had a sudden meeting. I didn't mean to make you wait so long.""

Vivian smiled. ""Juno was such a good boy. He didn't cry at all while waiting for you.""

""Thank you so much, Ms. Paige.""

""You're welcome. Oh, by the way, this was delivered to the school for you. They said it's for your family,"" she said, a bit confused, as she handed me a cardboard box. The label read, [Sprout Class, Juno Cook's Mother.]

'How strange.' I felt a little confused, but I thanked her and took the box.

On my way home, I suddenly remembered the letter I had received earlier, and an unsettling feeling settled in my chest.

Today, I was alone at home. As soon as I walked in, I had to get dinner ready for Juno, give him a bath, tell him a story, play with him, and then put him to bed. By the time I finished tidying up, I was completely drained.

I saw a text message from Dexter saying he had already boarded the plane. I felt an overwhelming weariness, staring at the package, and decided to open it.

Inside was a lace thong—sexy and delicate—and it had been sprayed with perfume. I didn't even need to get close to recognize the scent. It was a high-end, niche brand known for its sensual allure.

There was also a card. It read, ""Try it on. Your husband loves it like this. Last time I wore it, he wouldn't let me out of bed all day.""

My hands started to shake. I recognized every word on the card, but when I put them together, I couldn't understand what they meant. I wondered, 'What is going on? Is Dexter really... betraying me?'

I quickly called him, but his phone was off. Right, he was on a plane, so he couldn't take my call.

'What should I do?' My heart was racing, and all I could think about was confronting him—storming right up to him and demanding answers.

The night stretched on, each minute of waiting for Dexter to come home feeling like an eternity. I sank onto the couch, exhausted, and eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up, it was already past 2 a.m. Dexter still hadn't come home.

I had a voicemail. It was from him. ""Hey, honey, my flight was delayed. I haven't even boarded yet. Don't wait up for me, go to bed.""

The message had been sent at 12:30 a.m. I thought, 'A flight that is supposed to leave at 5 p.m. delayed until after midnight? That doesn't add up.'

Before I could process it, my email pinged—an anonymous message. It contained just one photo.

The photographer had a good eye. The picture showed a lavish candlelit dinner and a big bouquet of roses. In the background, two people were embracing, but their faces were blurred.

My heart sank. Others might not recognize them, but I... I only needed one glance to know that man was Dexter.

Dexter's phone was still off. I couldn't reach him. Outside, the night was calm, but inside, my mind was in turmoil. I wondered, 'Where is he?'

I tried to force myself to stay calm. I still had Juno to take care of, and I couldn't just go searching for him now.

Fairhaven was huge, and finding one person would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. I made myself go to bed, but sleep wouldn't come.

Around dawn, half-awake, I heard my phone ding. It was another voicemail from Dexter. I opened it quickly, but the message made my blood run cold.

""Honey! Dexter, whose man are you?"" A woman's voice, sweet but dripping with flirtation, practically pierced my ears.

What froze my heart was the man's reply. It was Dexter's voice. ""Do I need to say? Of course, it's you.""

2.Chapter 2 You Got A Woman?
By the time I came to my senses, the message had already been deleted. The screen was blank as if everything that had just happened had been a bad dream.

At that point, it was laughable to keep pretending that Dexter hadn't betrayed me. I loved him, but not enough to turn a blind eye to the truth.

The next morning, I woke up with dark circles under my eyes. It was a workday, and I still had to go to the office and take Juno to kindergarten.

Juno was such a perceptive little guy. He hugged me and kissed my cheek. ""Mommy, why aren't you smiling? Are you sad?""

I forced a tired smile and tugged at the corners of my mouth. ""Mommy's just a little tired. It's nothing.""

I thought, 'I'm sorry, my dear. I really can't smile right now. Our whole world is about to come crashing down... I want to protect my child, and I want to protect this family. He's still so young. How can I bear to let him get hurt?'

Just as we were about to leave, Dexter came through the door. He looked worn out, carrying a briefcase.

The moment he saw me, he gave me a big hug and then took Juno from my arms. ""Sorry, I'm late. Let me take Juno to kindergarten.""

""No need,"" I said, trying to sound composed. ""You probably didn't get much sleep last night, right?""

""Yeah, it's been a nightmare. I've never had anything like this happen. I was hoping to come home earlier to spend time with you and Juno, but look at this mess.

""You've been waiting for me too, right? You've got dark circles under your eyes."" Dexter gently touched my face, his eyes full of the same tenderness as always.

I hesitated, wondering, 'How could this man, who has always been so kind and loving toward me, possibly cheat?' But everything that happened yesterday was still fresh in my mind. I forced myself to stay strong.

I smiled faintly. ""It's okay, go ahead and take Juno. I need to get to work.""

""Okay."" Dexter kissed my forehead.

As he leaned in, I couldn't help but notice—there was an unfamiliar scent of shower gel on him. Even though I had mentally braced myself, I nearly lost control right then.

I told myself I had to focus, so I hurried to my car and drove off.

It was pathetic. I didn't even have time to cry. I had work to do, and if I divorced Dexter, I'd have to fight for custody of Juno. Emotionally, I needed an outlet, but practically, I didn't have the time or space for one.

The thought of divorce flashed through my mind, and it startled me. My mind had been in a fog all night, but the moment I saw Dexter this morning, everything became clear.

I had to find out who that woman was. Even if I had to divorce him, I needed to know the whole truth.

At the office, I searched everywhere again, but the photo was still nowhere to be found.

Whoever took that photo had to be connected to the woman. She must have been lurking around me all along—maybe she was someone close to me.

I forced myself to focus on work. The whole morning passed in a blur. Dexter sent me two messages, but I couldn't bring myself to reply. The first one said, [I'm off today, just staying home to rest. I'll pick up Juno tonight.]

I didn't respond, so about half an hour later, another message came through. [Tonight, I'll make your favorite prawns. You can taste your husband's cooking.] Reading that message made my chest tighten.

""Ms. Moreno, have you made your decision?"" a voice sounded.

The sound of my name snapped me back to reality. I blinked and realized I was in the surveillance room. It was time to review the footage from yesterday to see who had entered my office after I left.

""All the footage is here, right?"" I asked.

""Yes, everything's ready. Three people entered your office yesterday afternoon. Take a look.""

Our company was a Fortune 500, and the surveillance quality was top-notch, so the faces of the three people were clear as day.

One was my assistant, Sheila Santos. The second was Holly Jimenez, who had taken over my work after the previous person left. The last one was the janitor—she was an outsourced contractor who came every afternoon to clean.

I quickly ruled out the janitor. That left Sheila and Holly. Age-wise, Sheila was the newest addition to the team, having joined last year. She's young and beautiful, so I should've suspected her right away.

But her age didn't match the photo. The child in the family photo looked to be in elementary school, and Sheila was only 24. There was no way she could have a child that age.

Holly, on the other hand, was different. She'd been divorced for two years and was currently single.

Unlike Sheila, she had a more mature, alluring presence. While her features weren't as delicate as Sheila's, she'd been in the workplace for years and was skilled at getting any man she set her sights on.

So during lunch, I specifically invited Holly out for a meal.

""Wow, you're actually inviting me to lunch. What's going on?"" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Nothing, just wanted to see how you've been,"" I replied, my mind swirling with uncertainty, not knowing where to begin.

Holly scoffed. ""Cut the crap. We started the same year, and we've been at each other's throats in the office for so long. Now you're suddenly being nice and inviting me to lunch? I'm more worried about whether you're trying to poison me.""

""Well, you still came, didn't you? If you're so confident, you shouldn't have shown up."" My temper flared. Holly only ever acted sweet and charming in front of men. To me, she was cold and calculating.

Holly looked me over and then let out a sharp laugh. ""I'm just here to see what you're up to.""

I was at a loss for words. Normally quick-witted, I was completely dumbstruck in this situation.

Holly raised an eyebrow. ""Your husband has someone else, doesn't he?""

I froze. ""How did you know?""

As soon as the words left my mouth, I knew I'd made a mistake. I was rattled, and Holly had cut right through my defenses.

She let out a dismissive laugh. ""Who else could have you, Ms. Moreno, so distracted? Besides your husband and son, I can't think of anyone else. So, what's this about? Don't tell me you want me to teach you how to keep a man interested?""

I was speechless. I suddenly regretted opening up to her. Holly didn't seem like the type to be Dexter's mistress. I had been wrong to suspect her.

""I think it's you,"" I said, hesitating before quickly explaining the situation with the photo.

Before I could even finish, Holly slammed her hand on the table, visibly angry. ""Are you out of your mind? Even if I were after a man, I wouldn't go after your leftovers!

""I came to drop off some documents for you—don't you remember? Didn't you see me when you came back to the office?""

I smiled bitterly and nodded. I was starting to remember; all these recent events had muddled my brain.

""But are you sure? Your husband, Dexter, is such a model husband,"" she said with a mocking smile.

I took a sip of my bitter coffee and fell silent. At that moment, I caught a glimpse of a figure passing by the street corner outside.

It was Dexter. And there was a petite woman with him. They were walking close together, obviously more than just friends.

Panic surged through me. Without thinking, I dashed out of the café, not even bothering to explain to Holly.

1iqz4t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1iqz4t2/how_did_you_know/,How did you know?,"People call me witchy cos of the things I see or dream that come true. Truthfully speaking I don't know what I am, for sure. 

Ever since I can remember, I've been afraid of it. I had a rough up bringing and I was always able to bring on an out of body experience to escape. I am much older now and it seems to be getting stronger. Except for the out of body experiences. I can't get my mind to quiet to do do this or even meditate. 

I know I am intuitive, sensitive, and an empath.

I can read people's energy, and I can feel what someone's feeling. I can see things in reflective surfaces like water, glass, or a mirror (sometimes). I can see things in coffee grounds and tea leaves (not mine, but in someone else's cup). I've never tried it on my own. 

When I dream I see things. Mostly, I don't  know who the people are in my dreams, but sometimes I get bombarded with all these visions one right after another. I feel like I'm supposed to know them. There have been a few recurring ones that were me. I think they were remnants of my past lives. I'm not sure, but I feel it's me.

When I dream things of people I know or close  to, I can see things happening in real time or they end up coming true. 

They say my great grandmother was a medicine woman and could dream walk, but I never met her. I can dream walk, but only with people close to me who have passed on. It's the only part of all this that has brought comfort to me.

I'm not hugely into astrology, but I always ask bday because I tend to get along better with some signs over others. I asked his bday and when I told him mine he was so excited.  He said ""oh we're gonna get along great"". We talked on the phone first. We had a very casual coffee date the next night. 

It's been about 3 mnths. While we both have deep traumatic things that have happened in relationships, we agreed we aren't gonna call this anything more than dating for now. 

I'm not gonna lie, the sex is amazing and intense. I've never met anyone like him, and I've told him this. He looks into my eyes and it's so fierce. Sometimes he even takes my face so he can stare at me. I think it's hot. 

He looks at me like a mom who thinks a baby is so cute she wants to squeeze him, and like a lion who just wants to dominate me - I'm in love.

At first, I thought it was my period, but after a few days I think it is something else. No other symptoms- no nausea. I’ve successfully eaten two meals. I eat pretty much the same foods every day so it’s not any other new things. I stopped taking magnesium or anything else promoting bowel movements, but it’s still happening.

Anyways they refused saying that it was 'my choice, my responsibility.' So I worked as a broke college student barley making ends meet whilst juggling working 2-3 part time jobs and keeping up my grades and now own a small art program.

So now I (32) And my hubby (34) have a happy family, my husband's family became my second family they helped me through college and weren't monster in laws or anything like that crap.

My mom, (66) And dad, (69) reached out with their demands, Demand 1, Meet their grand kids. Demand 2, Move in with us or cover their rent. Demand 3, Pay for hospital/medical bills.

Their reasons? They ""did so much for me and deserve their happy ending to."" I told them of saying it was their bad choices their responsibility and they needed to work like I did to get by since I wasn't gonna help some stuck up pieces of work.

I know that’s never a given but I decided to do what I can anyway. 

One of the things I pay a lot of attention to is my exposure to plastic that touches my food. I have a flip-straw Stanley cup that is finally making me drink enough water consistently. I exchanged the inner straw with a glass straw but the top will always be plastic. I don’t know how to replace it without it conflicting with one of my ND needs. I can’t drink out of metal, it’s a huge sensory aversion for me, same with silicone (it always feels dirty!). I can’t just grab glasses of water because I have ADHD and will honestly just starve myself for hours if I’m in the middle of something. 

Now with coffee. I absolutely love coffee and I had a specific brand of cups for a dolce gusto machine that was such a big comfort drink for me (and my ND husband) however the cups are straight up plastic that are put under pressure with hot water so I don’t want to know how many chemicals I’ve gotten in my blood stream from them. We quit those and switched to a mocha pot + milk frother but now it’s not the same exact cup of coffee all the time like it was with the plastic cups. Some days it’s good, some days it’s bad, I don’t know why sometimes it’s bad and it makes me feel a bit nervous every morning and if it’s bad I can’t drink it and then I miss out on my most important morning routine which is to have a cup of coffee with my husband. 

I don’t know what to do? I’m sure someone here relates. Health and our brain’s needs don’t always match up very well. Convenience foods are often not the healthiest but so essential when you have far less energy than others. 

I’m not even 30 and on the way to being an orphan and I have a child. I have several friends with children under 6 who are battling cancer. This is why it’s important to me to try and take in less toxins. ",21,1739730709.0,AutismInWomen,11,0.9,False

I am convinced that I am asexual and bf has no problems as such with this. However, i was active before I met him, which he knows about.

Apart from my relationship as well i feel socially drained where i just want to be at home and not talk to anyone. My bf recognized this and asked me to take a break from social media - which I did. Nothing has changed yet though. 

I still love talking to him and sharing my stories with him but seeing that he doesnt get the same love back makes me sad for him. He handles my commute - makes sure i get coffee and in general is super supportive.

I also log into government sites to review client info and file certain items.

I have a website that I maintain, an online crm, online lead generator , canva and zoom.

YouTube may or may not be in my future. I would like it to be if i could find the time. I try my best to keep my files in drop box. 

I do dabble in water colors and photography as a personal hobby when time permits that I scan lol 

I do have several Apple products, phone, watch, iPad so am not unfamiliar with the Apple eco system. I have a two year old MacBook Air that is kept in my VO booth for recording. I tried using it for a day in the office but could only use one of the two screens on the desk. I understand that if I close the laptop the third screen should appear. (Just heard this in a YT video) but i do prefer to have the three screens. It was also difficult because I did not have a proper keyboard and had to learn some new shortcuts for somethings I do on the PC.   I do think it handled the processes although I probably had less windows open due to not having the additional screen to use. 

Do I need to be portable? Yes and No. I am not working in a coffee shop. I go out of town every so often and think the MacBook Air would be a ok for a few days. Other than that I am going somewhere where I can set it up for a week or have access to at least one monitor. 

Am I missing a consideration. What’s your thoughts? 

So the question- 

Use the MacBook Air - get appropriate keyboard and give up the third screen. What are the issues I haven’t considered? Only cost is keyboard $229. 

Mac mini - 16/512 - still don’t have third screen. Can I add a third screen?  $1049 plus keyboard $229 

iMac - 16/512 solves third screen issue and bonus is a 24” screen, not portable for short duration trips. Can be taken when I am out of the house for a week? $2499 with updated screen and keyboard with numeric keypad.

1iqymmo,https://i.redd.it/hu9myglkmjje1.jpeg,Storytelling with Hebrew.,"Hebrew isn’t just a language — it’s a journey through time, a bridge between past and present, the spoken pulse of an ancient people still shaping their future.

Every word in Hebrew carries echoes of history, layers of meaning, and connections that stretch from biblical scrolls to the streets of modern Tel Aviv.

Take the word “aliyah” — today, it means immigrating to Israel, but at its root, it means “going up.” Not just physically, but spiritually, emotionally — returning to something higher. 

Or “shalom”, a simple greeting that also means peace, wholeness, and completion. 

In Hebrew, words don’t just describe; they reveal.

Hebrew’s roots are more than linguistic — they’re the roots of a people, a land, and a story thousands of years in the making. 

A word written in ancient stone finds new life in WhatsApp messages. 

The same letters that carried divine wisdom in Kabbalah now spell out coffee orders in Tel Aviv. 

The Bible and a Tel Aviv newspaper use the same language, separated by millennia but bound by continuity.

For centuries, Hebrew lived in books, in prayers, in whispered dreams of return.

Then, in an act of linguistic revival unparalleled in history, it was reborn as a living, breathing language — an ancient tongue shaping modern life.

Words once read in parchment scrolls now echo through playgrounds, markets, and music lyrics.

And the beauty of Hebrew? 

It never loses its depth. 

Every modern word is connected to its biblical ancestor, every slang phrase still carries a trace of something ancient. 

In Kabbalah, the letters themselves hold cosmic secrets. 

In daily life, the language reminds us that words aren’t just sounds — they carry meaning, history, and power.

To learn Hebrew is to tap into something greater than vocabulary and grammar.

It’s to step into a story still being written, a journey of resilience, revival, and endless depth.

Because in Hebrew, every word has a story. And that story is still unfolding.

I have a coffee percolator that I want to use to trade at markets and wondered if there’s a battery powered power source that can be used instead of the likes of a petrol/diesel generator?

Explains that she wants to put a coffee bar in one corner of her kitchen, and that maybe one day it will store her coffee. 

Now let's contrast that with Macarona starting a candle brand. She dropped it out of nowhere and claimed she had been leaving Easter eggs in videos for months, and that her love of candles was well-established on her channel. People were like, huh? Really? Where are the hidden references? She connected to one weird squiggle on an intro to a video, as proof. It felt forced and made up.

1iqyhv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1iqyhv7/been_told_im_the_worst_parent/,"Been told I'm the ""worst parent""","I (22F) was on call to my big sister (24F). I have a 3 year old toddler and pregnant with my second (22w) she has a less than 1 year old baby. My baby is due around her daughters 1st birthday - which my big sister isn't too chuffed about. But it's not like it can be helped. 

I will start this rant off by saying I'm absolutely not a perfect parent, I have lost my temper before, I give her TV sometimes, of course I let her eat sweets (within reason) dentist says her teeth are perfect. Meals are not always nutritious, or just give her her safe foods for lunch or dinner (pasta and super noodles). But I absolutely do try my best, my daughter is well mannered, picks up after herself and is overall just super caring, and funny. 

It started off with how I was having a rant to my sister cause my daughter went to her great granny's for a visit (my mum brought her so I could have half an hour chill) and came back already eaten like 2 different sweets and was handed super hard toffee and quite a few other sweets as well as also eating an open pack of ice gems. My big sister literally says how I'm the worst parent cause I never like her having it. I told her ""I don't care about her having it, I care about limiting it and keeping her teeth actually healthy and her actually having a nutritional diet. Im trying to change the ways we were raised"". And then how I said how I make her 'a cup of tea' which is just weak diluted juice filled with warm water from the kettle and topped off with cold water. And then she brings up how my mum gives her lemon tea, the type that my mum gets is some with a bit of caffeine in it. I of course do not want her drinking any caffeine, shes 3, her energy is like shes had 5 black coffees in 3 hours. but my mum is not willing to give it up cause its just ""one tiny cup"" and she enjoys it. My mum's a sole babysitter that lives 3 doors away, so it's hard to just go no contact without all my family banging on my door.  My mum's also the type that says ""what happens at granny's, stays at grannys"". 

Between my mum and big sister and their opinion on how I raise my child, makes me feel extremely disrespected. I went to college when I was younger for nursery practitioner work, I was taught a lot of things that I use in practice towards my child now that has made her the child she is now. I am currently in school for nursing, so I am trying to have my household a bitty healthier purely because im learning so many things about keeping our human bodies healthy and would like to take part in it

If I spoke to them about this, I get told how I'm so emotional and hormonal. They do not understand the benefits of not always giving children sweets and caffeiene. They just want to be favourited by her. Give her what she wants. I'm sick of it. ",11,1739729693.0,Parenting,20,0.72,False

1iqyfvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1iqyfvc/do_you_think_youre_above_advertising_tactics/,Do you think you're above advertising tactics?,"So I asked the question of 'is it possible to be above advertising?' to two friends recently. It was understood that by this, I didn't mean that such a person wouldn't be affected by advertising, but that they'd only be affected in a way that is to their benefit... i.e, that if I do see an ad that intrigues me, that I'll be capable of scrutinising it carefully so that I don't get taken advantage of. I feel that I am above it. Firstly, due hyper aware of the methodologies employed by advertising/merchandising at this stage of my life, and due to the fact I would be a better critical thinker than most.

Anyway the response of the first guy was something like this:

*""Everyone is influenced by advertising in some way shape or form even if they do not realise it. If you think you're not affected by advertising you should relook at things & become aware of how they do"".*

The second person's response was to say *""everyone including you are influenced by advertising and you don’t even seem to recognize it! Everything from the ad that reminds you to pick up a loaf of bread on the way home, to feeling like a take away when you see the menu in the window, enough said*"".

So this guy was trying to tell me that I’m not above advertising, and the best example he was able to refer to was a takeaway! I had already explained to him that I don't eat fast food. I also tried to explain that I think about what I want before going to a store, but he didn't believe me!

When it comes to the things I own, I don't think advertising has affected any of the decisions behind any of them. Certainly not the phone I have, or the car I drive, as they're both second hand. If a supermarket I go to rearranges all their aisles, it never affects me what I buy. I eat real food; broccoli in one chain isn't chosen by me based on its brand, any more than broccoli in another chain. When I shop for the wife, the offers she gets on her rewards card (to spend a high amount to get a reduction) don't cause me to throw in some chocolates at the till, like most others do. Instead I have a list of possible non perishable products in my head that we'll inevitably need anyway, and I just buy a whole load of those to get it over the mark.

When it comes to clothes I am to some extent influenced by my peers, but not by advertising. If I saw someone I think is cool wearing a reasonably nice jacket, then that image will stay in my head quite strongly the next time I'm clothing shopping, and I might have a slightly distorted view about how nice that jacket is because of the association.

The only thing that I can think of is that I do find myself being influenced by scenes or characters from old movies, which were perhaps geared to advertise to people of that time. If I were to see a watch for example in such a film; that watch would now be twice as appealing as otherwise would be because it's not sold any more, and thereby unique. I also find myself being influenced by characters of old... it could be David Bowie or Sean Connery. Perhaps some of this is the illusion that the older times were better, but you simply don't get ideas from modern public figures. I remember seeing Connery in one film (Marnie) say to a woman to ""clean up your face""! Well seeing as this would be something that I would feel like I'm not allowed to say, is what caused me to realise that I am in fact influenced by society somewhat... but not advertising. There is no way a modern Bond - no matter how macho - would say those exact words to a woman.

I can't think of one thing I buy that could possibly be affected by advertising. Things like food, petrol, electricity bills, haircuts, hobbies, the music I listen to, my bank, or whatever else there is. I don't pay for anything that's unnecessary, whether it be coffee, alcohol, fast food, vaping, gambling, porn, netflix and the like of it, or anything in a filling station that's not fuel! That last movie I watched in the cinema was 'Richard Jewell', and it was from hearing a discussion about it on radio! I'm under the impression that billboards are just for franchise movies anyway.

Getting back to the talk I had with the two guys. One of them eventually tried to argue that I have a habit of buying certain brands due to advertising, which I do. He said ""go to Chinese shop and see, if it will be easy for you to do your shopping as quick"". So I explained to him that if you were to take something like kitchen roll; I might choose a particular brand given that it gives satisfactory results, and as the years would go by, that I might still keep picking that item off the shelf without thinking about it. But that does not prove that the reason I bought that product first day was due to advertising. So the fact that I'd be slower in a Chinese shop doesn't prove anything!

I was also told that ad agencies and big-data companies have your sort psychologically profiled to an absolute tee. I said that actually only proves how pointless their tactics are on me, and that if everyone was like me, that they'd be losing money. So in all, I think too many make the mistake of thinking that just because you buy a product, that you've been influenced by an ad.

1iqyffk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1iqyffk/teenager_allowance/,Teenager allowance,"We have a 16 yo teenager daughter. We give her allowance in order to teach her budgeting. She expends money daily in coffee, sushi... 
I want to be fair, how much money should I give her weekly so she can pay for her own things like going out, makeup, clothes.... I come from a 3rd world country and learned to save very young, I didn't have an allowance, my father gave me money for transportation and I used to walk or take public transportation to be able to have some money. I work and don't expend much since I'm always planning for the future, credit card debts are not a choice for me. It's difficult for me to understand how it works here (US). I see entitlement instead of gratitude very often in teenagers.
Transportation, health insurance, home expenses not included, we pay for necessities. I'm looking for a fair number. Background: teenager cleans apartment once a month, school grades are very poor. Manipulates family to get money when she wants things, so far incapable of saving a few weeks to buy things she wants. The reason I want a fair (unbiased) number is so her father stops feeling guilty when she decides she ""needs"" something. I'm not very optimistic that her ability to save money will improve but want to avoid more marriage drama regarding this subject. I'm very concerned about how our future will look if she doesn't learn to plan ahead and budget. My influence is limited since I'm her step mother, I try to be a reference for her but not very successful so far.
My biological daughter is 17, always saving, outstanding grades (A+ student), scholarship for her graduate studies. All the gifts she has received from her dad and myself at the end of school year have been well deserved. To my 16 yo daughter we buy the same so she doesn't feel less, but with 0 effort from her. I cannot rectify this part (I love my husband and do my best to express my concerns and stay married 🥹). I want to give her a fair allowance amount so when she expends it all, she and her father understand there is nothing to talk, learn to save your money.
