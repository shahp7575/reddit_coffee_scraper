When I looked to buy one, I realised there‚Äôs a decent amount of ‚Äòtypes‚Äô of pourover setups.



Is there a quick run down of the benefits/ differences of each?? 

Or are they mostly visual? If so, what should I pay attention to when buying one

We hit it off and met about once a week or so for three months. 

For some context, I knew when we met that I would be moving away 3 months later to a different place a little under 1.5 hours drive away (only for 12 months before I would be moving back, but still). So from the start we both had this in mind as a possible end date. But things definitely did get more intense as time went on. We generally avoided the topic until the week before the move when I arranged for us to sit down together and talk it out. Ultimately, he told me he couldn‚Äôt make the time to commit to me and making he journey to seeing me so we ended things but decided to stay in touch as friends as we didn‚Äôt want to lose each other. 

I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is going.. we stayed in touch. We didn‚Äôt message as often as we had been, but every couple of days we‚Äôd send a long voice message catching each other up on our lives. A sort of a para social relationship almost. Then we met a month after the move for a coffee that became a hook up and a coffee and it was like nothing had changed. Before we parted ways that day he told me he was due to come up to visit me and that he‚Äôd do it some time in the near future on his way to visit his family - he‚Äôd have to pass through where I currently live to get there. That happened this weekend. We got food and went for a few drinks before he stayed over at my place and it was better than it ever had been. Like nothing had changed. All my hopes that it would rekindle and that he would want to commit to me now were renewed and now I‚Äôm more invested than ever. But I just know he won‚Äôt change his mind and he won‚Äôt want to commit and I‚Äôm letting him have his cake and eat it too. 

I keep telling myself I need to move on now and try to meet someone else who will not see that distance as an obstacle (especially because holy crap it‚Äôs minuscule in the scheme of distance). But all I want is for someone to tell me that it will work out. Should I live my life and wait until I move back and see if we rekindle, maybe meeting now and then like those two times in the meantime. Or should I move on, leave him in the past and when I move back if something happens it happens? Or maybe I‚Äôll meet someone who‚Äôll treat me better in the meantime. What makes me think he‚Äôd commit to me then if he won‚Äôt now. Am I just being deluded? Genuinely so addled at what to do. Any thoughts?",1,1728324648.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

(First time and repeatedly post that),"Hey folks, this post might not be related to coffee specifically but I plan on opening a cafe at my native in Jodhpur (yeah, a tier 2 city).

The plans are at a really initial stage, however I would like to understand from you folks - what are the most important pointers for you all to go for a new cafe? I have made some observations that I am listing below: 

1. Speciality coffee (obviously)

2. Croissant or food items that go with coffee (need your help here)

3. Ambience (Instagram friendly?) - I prefer natural light of a glass door kinda setting but would love to know what do people like?

4. Ergonomic seating (I have personally faced this - as table are sometimes too small and not in line with elbows)

5. Activities to go along with coffee - helps?

6. Music/Vibe

7. Concept Cafe (does that help? - like sending a postcard/sports/sitcom)

- Also, what makes you go back to a cafe again? Like what does a third wave/Starbucks/ Blue tokai do differently that gets you back there?

- Customer Obsession can be the only USP that I can think of right now that can set me apart here. 

Would you all be up to fill an anonymous google form to know consumer mindset well? 
PS. Coffee on me, if I open a cafe and you folks visit Jodhpur ü§ù

PPS. If anyone is into cafe consultancy, we need to talk! :)

1fye9xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1fye9xw/early_jobs_and_career_outlook/,Early Jobs and Career Outlook,"I graduated with a Bachelors in Chemistry in May. I got a job during my last semester working for a precious metal refinery doing analysis via Fire Assay. Initially I felt completely out of my element but quickly picked it up and began an R&D project after my manager noticed my growth and proficiency in a short amount of time. I fell in love with the freedom I was given and that I had something that kept my brain grinding. 

I ended up leaving the position in August because my girlfriend and I moved to Chicago for her schooling.

Since then I have been working in Pharma QC and after only 5-6 weeks it‚Äôs starting to really take a toll on my mental health. I only took the position for future prospects and pay, knowing that it would be repetitive. But after seeing the day to day workflow post-‚Äútraining‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I can stick it out even for promotion or the resume material. My coworkers are great, but management is so disorganized considering the strictness of the regulations. Any failed test results in a laboratory investigation yet the training is so poor you essentially aren‚Äôt taught the proper way until you fuck up. I dread the work week beginning and no part of the position is science to me. I‚Äôve never felt this way about a job ever, not even while working at coffee shops or restaurants during school.

I know that I won‚Äôt be staying in this position and have already begun applying elsewhere and for roles that avoid QC. The problem is that I know these R&D jobs are a crapshoot and want years of experience or MS degrees minimum. At this rate with these massively underwhelming entry level jobs I would honestly consider a career transition to something relatively analogous, even if it‚Äôs just temporary while I find a job I want in the Chem field. I just need a job where I‚Äôm required to problem solve, process, or do research. I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm forced to dedicate brainpower to a task and not simply plug into spreadsheets and following test methods step by step. 

I‚Äôm really just hoping for some advice on how to navigate the entry level job market while avoiding mundanity (if that‚Äôs even possible in Chem). What are some common career transitions where a chem degree gets you in the door? I‚Äôm unable to go back for a Masters currently, but would this be a logical move in the future or is it truly PhD or bust? Any outside of the box ideas or job opportunities that I‚Äôm missing?

Like everybody else I‚Äôve been counting calories. I do well on the weekdays but as soon as that weekend hits it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stop eating. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the weekend but I go ham with the food and snacking. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because of me not having anything to do. Since I am in high school, school gives me something to do over the weekdays but since that element is gone during the weekends I guess I just need something to do and that thing is binging. I think the trigger is me being bored and procrastinating on my school work.

Over the summer was the only time that I didn‚Äôt binge at all. My routine was to go on a walk every morning (10k steps), eat breakfast, which was coffee and something sweet (I.e. a croissant or some cookies) and then have dinner. I allowed myself one snack but I never counted my calories. I think the reason for me not binging is because I wasn‚Äôt obsessed with the numbers.

On the weekdays I usually stay under my calorie limit. So this makes me wonder whether I should just ditch calorie counting all together. Over the summer I did reach my lw but as soon as school started I binged myself back up. Maybe I need to eat mindfully like I did in the summer and implement my walks again?

","i have a friend, we're the same age and we attend the same art academy but we're polar opposites. she approached me one day telling me she had been gathering up the courage to talk to me all week. we started going out for coffee and sometimes food after classes, even making new friends together. the thing with me is, i make friends very easily but thats almost always where i draw the line. surface level friendships, dont call me, dont text me and dont involve yourself in my life. im pretty sure i developed this approach because of the abuse i endured as a kid. i dont let myself care about anyone. 

but this girl wiggled her way into my heart somehow. she insistently called me, texted me even outside of class. she introduced me to her boyfriend, even to her mom. i usually suck at taking care of myself despite being the mom friend in large friend groups, but she has consistently been reminding me to eat, not smoke so much and even offered to cook for me. (i am a pretty good cook myself but the offer was super sweet)

but what really solidified it was yesterday. i was alone staring at my ceiling questioning why i had no one to turn to during dark times, then it clicked, if i let people care about me they would care. my behavior is the issue. if i push away everyone who is nice to me i cant complain about not having friends to turn to.  anyway, we were texting today and i told her that one of the girls from the academy joked about my trauma (she didnt know but its still a sensitive topic. sexual assault) and my friend took it upon herself to put the girl in her place today because she could tell i was scared. 

(also, side note. i am a woman who likes women. she is straight and engaged, but she instantly understood without me even telling her and instead of distancing herself from me like most other straight girls do, she got more affectionate telling me she trusted me which made my heart warm ngl.)

long story short, im starting to enjoy her company a lot and i havent let myself care about anyone like this in a while and this is scary lol. ",1,1728324093.0,DadForAMinute,0,1.0,False

A couple months ago I had three of his friends text me within a week of each other  asking if I was okay. The texts all started out innocent enough. I was, however, surprised by them reaching out bc I had never personally texted them. They‚Äôd been at my place for game nights and such over the last decade, but I wouldn‚Äôt call us close. Of the 3, 1 is my ex‚Äôs colleague (I‚Äôll call him L).

After the first couple texts each of them starting probing a bit further and all of them asked to come over to ‚Äúbe there for me‚Äù. I sorta farted around the questions and maneuvered my way into not having them come over.

About a week ago L (after I asked him if my ex knew he was texting me) confessed that my ex had put him and the others up to this to see‚Äùif I‚Äôd try and fuck one of his friends‚Äù. I was shocked, but also strangely not. I thought I knew my ex but his cheating literally re-set something deep inside me and now I‚Äôm jaded. 

I immediately stopped texted the other guys but L asked to meet for coffee which I agreed bc I wanted to hear more about the plan my ex concocted.

Coffee went really well and honestly L is handsome. I caught myself thinking ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù and at the end of coffee L asked if I wanted to meet for drinks later and I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Honestly, I was thinking in my head ‚Äúmaybe I should have sex with him tonight.‚Äù 

Call me an idiot bc hours later my ex rage texts me about how much of a hussy and whore I am for   ‚ÄúDating L‚Äù. L called me and said he did not tell my ex about meeting up and still wanted to get drinks but I declined. If L didn‚Äôt tell him, how would my ex know??

I‚Äôm hurt and just exhausted with all this. Now close friends are calling me the AH. Am I? I‚Äôm pretty stupid, I‚Äôll admit that, for trusting L.

With very little community in a such a populous place I felt at home in the riot. 

While marching was important,  I thought seizing the streets from the hoards of armed blue lives matter thugs and cops was much more necessary. 
Four years later looking back I‚Äôm still bitter about the tactics we were admonished and demanded not ever to use. Private Property and enterprise were preserved, through a top down self policing that was present at nearly every protest.

At a few protests I watched leadership take strong crowds of riotous protestors directly into a kettle. Scores of them were arrested. The protest crumbled and some still shouted not to fight back.

This was new for everyone I told myself, we were all learning- some slower than others.

A tentative success, but no real change from the systemic violence that the police hold in NYC and all over the country. 

A few years after the protests began I watched Eric Adams rise to power. I still went to some events, but never found a real community in it. All of the heinous things I saw Adams do felt to me like an end to a very long and difficult road, and I lost hope in the movement. 

I left New York City that same year- dropped out of college and tried to get my mind right.

So after 6 or so months of this. (IDK why it took me so long) But I started researching again true to my nature in general. I even got a masterclass subscription which had a course on sleep as well. All te research I found neglected what I feel are 2 most important components.  Your minerals and your sleep diet.

The first thing I tried was Magnesium. From working at my float center years back I remembered that the best way to get magnesium was through the skin. So I made myself a squeeze bottle of epsom salt water and started spraying it on my legs and feet. I didn't notice anything for a few days but at least there were improvements although intermittent.

Long story short about Magnesium is that it was caffeine that depletes it. It's why people feel like coffee dehydrates them. It doesn't dehydrate you but it causes cramps just the same by making your liver use your magnesium to clear the caffeine. So I kissed that amazing wonderful and well missed drink good bye.

Boom! The effects were great I started getting that awesome feeling when going to sleep.

This helped when I got to sleep but it was getting to sleep that was messing with me the most. Just wired and tired. Not enough energy to be productive and too alert to sleep. DAMN IT back to the drawing board. So I researched other nutrients involved in sleep.

Here they are and what they do:

Vitamin D and light discipline keeps your circadian rythmes in line. Get sunlight early in the morning. Turn off your lights at sundown. If you can afford to get red lights or something to simulate candles that works best. Get a f.lux to block the blue light from your screen.

Zinc: Building up your zinc stores with nuts, and supplements. I was taking 600% in a few supplements a day because zinc deficiency made sense. Take it with vitamin C though!

Iron: Oxygen baby! More oxygen = better sleep. Why do you think we breath like we do when sleeping? It's maximally efficient!

Magnesium: Of course my favorite since it's so cheap and easy to just spray and go.

The finaly piece was the mental state when falling asleep. Thoughts can be divided into 2 sections largely. Task oriented thoughts and experiential/ mind wandering thoughts. If your mind is overwhelmed with thoughts about your plans tomorrow the best thing I know how to do is write them down. But make sure when you wake up you refer to them AND execute on what was bothering you the most. You'll begin to trust yourself and your mind will start leaving you alone once you build this habit but that's a whole other post for sure.

If you're past that one what I like to do is relax each part of my body from toe to head and only focus on my eyes and the little red and black dots that flicker around. Boom I'm out

Last but not least is sleep debt:
About 4 hours after you wake up there's a dip in energy. The more sleep deprived you are the more severe this feels and the more pressure there is to sleep. This has nothing to do with your food. This happens ON TOP OF what youre body does with the food you eat. Some foods will make you tired and others will pep you up. Most of us like I did would reach for the 2nd cup of coffee. I'm telling you, please nap. If you wake up early enough say 7 or 8am you can nap at noon and be fine to sleep again at night when your 2nd energy dip will occur. The duration you'll need will lower the more you do it. For me a 2 hour nap was a godsend when I was only getting a few each night. As time went on my dips were less severe and I just need to sit and read or listen to music to pass the time instead of the uncontrollable urge to knock out.  Going to bed a little earlier each night will help as well. Recognizing when a dip was coming and not inturupting them with caffeine was the capstone.

Months of research and suffering for this post. HOPE THIS HELPS! PS: Anyone know a way I can make this a carreer? This is just the latest piece of the health puzzle I've solved for myself and others.  I really like seeing people improve and do well. Thanks

TLDR:  Zinc to fall asleep, Transdermal Magnesium for sleep quality, and Iron to stay asleep. Pay down your sleep debt with strategic naps and going to bed a little earlier",1,1728323620.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1fydy10,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1fydy10/story_of_my_depressing_life/,Story of my Depressing life,"Idk how you're going to take this... but I suggest you not take it seriously because I don't even care or think much. But as my life is going, I would consider this thing should've been done in the first place.

When I was a kid... I was wild. When I say wild, it means I never stopped myself from going on a war [verbally or physically]. My folks advised me and kinda pleased me not to lose my cool. They sensed that I had major anger issues... probably more than a normal teen's hold. I was frustrated about this thing that I couldn't do at that period, and people around me were cool and lovely, but they always did stupid stuff, which made me angry. So, as a good kid, I listened to my folks and stopped being angry, stopped engaging myself in fights. 

And one day I fought again with somebody... my life was not going well at that period. Holding that anger was quite tough. And letting it go makes the situation worse. Again, my folks confronted me and asked me to stop engaging myself in fights as it was not doing good. Never worked to conclude. They told me the consequences that I might face if I ever fought again... because they thought that I was immature and pushed people on purpose. They never understand that it's the other person saying stuff to me first, then I say something, and I sort things out by punching and making people bleed. I never wanted to hurt anybody, but if someone is poking me unnecessarily I would fuck 'em up. Else, I am a quiet kid. Avoid fights if possible, but still fight.

 At university... I decided to make some friends. My folks, they said, always participate in some activities... don't just sit in the corner of the room. And DON'T FIGHT. Most importantly, DO NOT HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS VERBALLY. I promised them that I wouldn't fight. As a good kid who obeys and respects their mum and dad. So, I made friends, we were cool, we cracked jokes, sat with each other and all. The great period of my life. I thought maybe this is what I have been looking for my whole life. Good people, with a bit different opinions and interests, but respect others too.

But these friends that I made had some different intentions. Firstly, they crack jokes about some shit and later unfriended me and asked me to stay away from them because they think that I am not fitting in with them. 

Now, the devil on my left shoulder has always whispered in my ears that this is not where you belong, these fuckers have low standards... you don't fit here. But, still, I chose to listen to the angel on my right shoulder, who was saying ""Be good, stick to these people.""

After 2 months, I got to know that these fuckers are spreading rumors about the things that I never said or done. Firstly, I didn't pay attention to it. I thought, who cares? But, just a week later, I noticed that every single person who I know is ignoring me on my face... in the lecture halls and laboratories. People who used to greet me whenever we crossed paths don't even look at me. Barely makes eye contact or responds to my texts or calls.

Now, because of the promises that I made to my folks... I can't do anything. Otherwise, I can single-handedly take these fuckers out in a both verbal and physical way. I don't need help to fight these guys.

After that, I met this girl online last year in October on Discord. She's cool, smart, and adorable. She REAL GIRL. We used to chat with each other till midnight. Late-night talking. It was fun. We were cool. Until one day, I was quite frustrated about something, and she was upset because she was having a hard time. Instead of listening to her, I asked her to leave me and come back whenever she felt right. I was a little curt that day, but nowadays, whenever I think about this incident, I feel like an asshole. I lost my cool again because she was whining about how nobody was treating me nicely these days. 

If you read our chats of that day... you can simply see the difference that she's in pain and I am shouting. But, I couldn't help myself, and eventually, we parted.

[She's one of the best human beings that I have ever met in my life. We were just friends...].

With all that shit carrying on my shoulders... I lost a few other online friends because this gay person was trying to get close to me. So, I simply asked him to fuck off. Now, the server members didn't appreciate that and banned me. So, I lost more friends.

The idea was to be a nice person, but every time, some idiot showed up and ruined it all. 10 years ago, LGBTQ people were considered mentally ill people. But they managed to get into the society. And they ruined this, too.

So, if I have to describe my life... I can say that I don't have friends in real life or online. I sit in my darkened room with my arms around my knees... thinking about how scary life is.

I never hurt anyone. I was always good with people I love, and people I cared about. People who I helped in every stage of my life... I was always good to them... still, they decided to abandon me. There are some days when I feel completely alone. 

However, I managed to stick with some people who are kind to me... they help me with my assignments and projects... sometimes sit next to me because their friends are absent. I am the last choice of every single person I have known. They are friends with me because they think that I am brave and capable of taking high risks. Sometimes for the money... for fun. Because I have a food humor too.

I want to jump off the cliff, but, I can't do that. I've got loving parents who have worked so hard their whole life. They sacrificed their happiness and worked extra hours to make a little more money to give me all the comfort. They want to see me as a successful and happy person. But I feel like I don't have anything to offer 'em yet. My life is so scary. I always wonder before going to bed... that, if am dying tomorrow, will my death be painful or peaceful? I am putting good out in this world in the hope that one day good will come back to me.

I never wanted to talk about this... but sometimes it's quite hard. If these things happened 3 or 4 years ago, it wouldn't affect me. But, nowadays it's quite hard to bear the hate and ignorance for the things that I never said or did.

So the final words are I don't know if am jumping off the cliff... but I am seeking happiness which I will never get in this life.

I‚Äôve been doing lots of research on how to best soothe my PCOS symptoms and inflammation, especially as I struggle to lose weight like a good chunk of people with PCOS.

I‚Äôve heard that dairy can be inflammatory for people with PCOS, and it wouldn‚Äôt shock me if that was the case for me (there was a time during high school where I straight up couldn‚Äôt have milk in the morning for a full year). However, I find the idea of giving up regular dairy incredibly hard. I constantly crave milk and dairy based drinks (I drink more than I eat things) such as matcha, chai, and coffee. I also will eat cereal a lot and use a lot of milk with it too. I know this is probably because I crave sugar a lot and I have a vitamin D deficiency. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to move from regular dairy to dairy alternatives, even though I‚Äôm no stranger to drinking them (used to drink almond milk back during that phase in high school). I‚Äôm gonna have to still keep regular milk in the house for my roommate, so how do I switch from regular dairy to dairy alternatives without being tempted? I‚Äôm also worried I won‚Äôt like it as much, or it won‚Äôt satisfy those milk cravings I get. Plus aren‚Äôt dairy alternatives expensive?

My symptoms were onset incredibly quickly so a lot of this is new to me and I‚Äôm trying to learn.

At the beginning of the month I started feeling the same extreme fatigue that everyone talks about here, no matter how much I slept. My face got incredibly puffy, my voice was hoarse, and I am having issues mentally processing/remembering things (the brain fog I guess?). I honestly looked and felt like I had been out partying until 3am in the morning every night, when in reality I was sleeping 10+ hours. I normally work out every day and my muscles were feeling so‚Ä¶.heavy and tired like I was in a weighted blanket that it was SO hard to exercise, but I gained ~5-6lbs in that month so I forced myself to anyway.

I got my blood checked early last week and on Thursday it came back with my TSH at 181 with a T4 of 0.1. (Just for information, I had my TSH checked 9 months ago and it was 2). My cholesterol has doubled since December with no change to diet or exercise. Resting heart rate had dropped 15bpm. Was diagnosed with hypothyroidism pretty much right away and am being referred to an endocrinologist. 

I‚Äôm on the medication now and I understand it may take time to get everything under control, but is there anything people have found helpful on the meantime to ease some of the symptoms?

Physically I constantly look like I‚Äôve been out partying‚Ä¶face puffy, pale‚Ä¶I have makeup, cold presses and undereye caffeine cream to try and conceal some of it but they‚Äôre all pretty ineffective. I‚Äôve tried gargling with hot salt water for my hoarse voice but it doesn‚Äôt do much.

Mentally I‚Äôve got near constant brain fog and a general lack of energy, but at the worst it‚Äôs extreme fatigue and straight up confusion. I‚Äôve never been big on caffeine but I‚Äôve started adding a cup of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù to the afternoon (Diet Coke, coffee, tea), to try and perk me up a little and get through the day.

I‚Äôve DEFINITELY noticed this affecting my work but since all of this has been so rapidly onset it hasn‚Äôt been too evident in the big picture, but my bigger concern is that the months it‚Äôll take for my health to normalize I might put my job in jeopardy.

1fyds5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fyds5t/girl_im_seeing_is_not_very_happy_with_my/,Girl I'm seeing is not very happy with my decisions at work,"Hi, I (26M) started seeing this girl (21F) a bit over a month ago. We've worked together for a bit over a year but never really spoke, until she moved in with another coworker who I know better, just down the street from me. When I heard this I told her ""oh hey I heard you guys live down the street, if you ever need anything don't hesitate to reach out, I've always got food"" yada yada. I've always thought she was cute but at this time I was just looking to be friends, as I had been told she was a lesbian.

So after a little bit, she adds me on Snapchat, getting it through my other coworker, and we start talking and decide to hang out, the first hangout was very chill and I liked her vibe, she told me we should hang out again, so we did. The second hangout I noticed she was moving a lot closer to me on the couch while sitting together watching TV, so I put my arm around her as it seemed that's what she was subtly hinting at, asked her if that was fine and she moved closer and we cuddled until 3am watching TV. We texted more and made it more obvious we were interested in each other, and have hung out alone a few times since, getting closer and opening up to each other about everything about our lives. 

I eventually asked her to go on a date that happened on Saturday, it was the most wholesome date I think I'd ever been on, we went to a museum, walked around, had coffee, held hands and talked a lot, then we went back to her house, baked cookies, binged a show from 7pm-4am, and then she kissed me before I left, and the way she kissed me was extremely cute, she held my face, kissed me, stepped back and stared into my eyes, went and kissed me again, and did that 3 times, I was extremely giddy walking back home after that.

For context, I have a lot of presumably close co-workers who I tell my achievements to, I had explained to 3 of them what we'd been doing and that we are seeing each other, as I'm genuinely very excited and very happy to be seeing someone who has passion, and who I have so much in common with, she apparently also talks to her supervisor about me bc they're close. So eventually, the stuff I'd told my coworkers, possibly got twisted through the grapevine and there may be rumours that made it back to her roommate about the things I've been saying about her. I know for a fact I haven't said anything sensitive to my coworkers so I have genuinely no clue what might've been said. Her roommate told her about what she'd heard and she texted me last night asking what I've been saying about us at work.

This kinda sent me into a panic, because I've heard some genuinely ridiculous rumours around my workplace, and she wouldn't tell me what she was told. I was honest with her and told her exactly who I'd talked to and what I remember saying, but she's still upset bc her family is pretty intertwined into our workplace and those rumours could make it back to her family, which no one wants. After id explained everything she told me she's not mad at me but just needs time to process this, as she's got a busy week ahead and doesn't want this on her mind.

I am left kinda paralyzed bc things were going so well, but I jumped the gun and told the wrong people about us. It is mostly on me but I am kinda blaming one coworker in particular, her roommate I hold nothing against for filling her in bc I would've done the same thing in this situation. But this one coworker, I know is a yapper and probably misinterpreted me telling him I had a date with her, and ran with the assumption that meant we were banging and that I was bragging about banging her. All I had said to him was that we had a date, not implying anything by it, and I explained this to her. But she is still upset and I really do understand why she is. I feel I did a pretty decent job explaining myself to her, but I told her we should talk in person when she's ready, and she said we can.

The way she's putting it makes me believe that maybe this is something she's willing to get passed with me but I still feel I have more explaining to do, I need to ask around and see what might have been exaggerated or misinterpreted if anything. I really like her and was so happy to have found someone like her, but I fucked up and told the wrong people. I wasn't thinking and I know now I crossed a boundary with her, I shared our private business too soon and now I realize that was a terrible decision. And I'm just kinda panicking about it and don't really know how to handle this situation.

I have to go to work in 2 hours, I might run into her during my shift but I may not, and if I do I want to apologize to her in person but tell her that we don't have to actually talk about it until she's ready. I want this to work out so badly but it just seems like we hit a rift and this could've soured any possibility of this moving forward. I just feel like shit now.

I have ADHD, chronic dysthymia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, extreme noise sensitivity and am very prone to being overstimulated. I used to be vegan, very fit, optimistic, saying to myself that I will live long and run marathons at the age of 60. Somehow reality hit I guess. Maybe living in a big city and studying destroyed me. 

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and have lately been faced with that question again. I got a bachelor's degree in humanities, went to university abroad (a neighboring country), but moved back home with my parents to a small town in my last semester due to financial and mental health issues. I finished my bachelor paper from home while working at a small NGO in HR. This was the worst year of my life so far. I basically didn't have any social contact with anyone other than my parents and my 40+ year old small town collegues. Plus, I am very queer and was in an extremely conservative setting. 

After finishing my degree, I started looking for 'real' entry level jobs in bigger cities in order to be able to live on my own and have a life again. As finding a job turned out to be more difficult than I thought, I decided to just move to any city I like. I found a shared apartment, got unemployment benefits and started looking for a job from there. I soon found a part time position as a university secretary. I then recently found my own one bedroom apartment, which I consider a huge success. 

Writing this now, I feel like things don't sound as bad as they might seem to me. Still, I struggle getting out of bed in the morning. I struggle with money. I come from a lower middle class immigrant family with lots of mental health issues. I struggle with making decisions. Making friends. I feel exhausted most of the time. I am very addicted to social media (reels and YouTube). I am constantly questioning myself. I don't know what I live for. I don't want to become a mom and I don't really see myself having a 'career'. But I also don't have a creative passion, that some people pursue instead of a traditional path. I don't dress for the male gaze anymore, which used to be my anchor. Sadly, getting more and more pretty for male validation was what I liked doing in my free time. I don't take care of my looks anymore, although I would like to find a (non male) partner. Everything feels like too much of an effort. Even eating feels painful to me sometimes. I have periods of times, where I just drink coffee and rot in bed all day.

I guess I got severely burned out from studying and living in a big and loud city, finishing my bachelor's took me five years, as I have ADHD and had to work in order to finance myself. Maybe I'm not completely healed yet, one year after having finished my degree, but I pressure myself into figuring out my next steps. Am I going to work full time in order to be able to travel? Should I get a master's degree? Should I do unpaid internships and work as a barista? I am so sick of living on a budget and trying to achieve some kind of ideal of a career though. Looking back, I don't really do much with my time, but it feels like so much is happening inside of my brain. So many thoughts and emotions that distract me from taking actions and just living. 

I would like to take suggestions on how to keep moving forward. How to just do the things, even if you over intellectualize them and conclude that they might be useless. How to just get up and eat breakfast without it hurting so badly. How do I find meaning in a meaningless life?

Physically I‚Äôm quite tall (I promise lol you can bring a measuring tape) and I‚Äôm average size, going to the gym more to get some muscle but by no means a gym rat. I‚Äôm a big fan of archery as well as finding abandoned places and fun walks along the coast. My  introvert side is also good with board games or video games if the mood strikes. 

I‚Äôve seen a couple cool things downtown like mini golf and board game cafes. Anyone want to join me for a fun first date? ",1,1728323052.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

The last time I was in Zimbabwe I was 17 years old, I am 29 now. I currently live in the U.K and my parents moved me here when I was 6 years old. 

I will be there for 2 weeks and in that 2 weeks I am hoping to lay some seeds that would allow me to build a life back home. I want to network as I plan to one day own a coffee farm. 

I would appreciate any advice people have around building a network in Zim, particularly in the Gweru, Harare, Bulawayo and Bindura areas as I will be frequenting between these areas. 

Any other advice around places (gyms etc) to visit would be much appreciated!

I take a stimulant in order to stay awake (due to a severe sleep disorder), and it basically makes me not want to eat all day. So if I were to fast from food for a day, it wouldn‚Äôt really be that hard for me. But also, I feel that because I already eat so little, it‚Äôs probably not a good idea for me to fast from food at all.

I could fast from coffee, and it would be kinda hard, but it wouldn‚Äôt be THAT hard.

What I did:
 I laid flat for four days , only getting up to go to the bathroom. 
I took stool softener so I wouldn‚Äôt strain. 
I took Tylenol and used a heating pad on my butt (that was really sore after the patch). 
I am being really careful to not bend/lift/twist.
Wore a belly band compression thing the whole time. 
I did drink coffee, just one cup a day. 

Initially I had some weird pressure changes in my skull as I bent/moved around, but realized it was because I was still wearing the belly band, and after a week with it on , post-patch, I took it off and allowed my CSF pressure to fix itself. I still have some small swelling and tenderness at the patch site, but it‚Äôs improving. 

So far so good. It could all be blown later today for all I know, but I wanted to post this because I was SO anxious and depressed reading endless stories of failed patches online.

When the bag becomes fully engorged I stop the flow of gas and push down with my hand until I push as much gas as I can out of the bag, and then I repeat this ""pump"" process. Based on readings from the BW Clip after 1 pump O2 is 3.5% vol, after 2 pumps it is 1.2% vol, after 3 pumps it is 0.7% vol, and after 4 pumps it is 0.4% vol. The book ""Espresso Coffee The Science of Quality"" 2nd edition on page 241 states that ""...the rate of oxygen uptake increases 10-fold, from 0.1 to 1.1%; above 1.1% of oxygen concentration, for each 1% increase of oxygen there is a consequent increase for the rate of degradation of 10%."" I would really like to get the O2 at or below 0.1% vol in that case, but using the procedure above it would probably require 6-7 pumps. That would waste too much nitrogen in my opinion, is there a more efficient way to flush O2 from a plastic bag, or any container, using a nitrogen cylinder?

1fyd9db,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1fyd9db/a_short_vent_with_a_commitment_to_action_as_soon/,"A short vent, with a commitment to action as soon as I get this out of my system. ","Hi everyone,

Once again -- huge appreciation for this community, who I am certain will just get it. I just got off of a check-in call with my manager and it's sending me into a spiral that I think only people on this group will understand. My goal is to vent a bit, let myself wallow for a few minutes, grab a cup of coffee or some sort of dopamine kick and try to keep pushing through.

**The short version:** I'm a contractor. I've been in conversations with my current client, who has casually mentioned hiring me on full-time. I had been doing well for a while at work and then in the last few weeks, my body / mind has been in a freeze state for the last few weeks, I'm moving really slowly on work and I KNOW that I am and I'm trying to get out of it but I feel like I'm in a fog. I finally took a holiday a week and a half ago, but I've come back to work and I feel like the dynamics have all changed and I'm overthinking every conversation I am having with every colleague because I'm afraid that my moving too slowly is making them rethink hiring me. I asked to have a casual catch up with my boss about my performance / potentially being hired today at the end of our Monday check-in and she wants to save it for our check-in next week. I have to wait A WHOLE WEEK in a puddle of anxiety about this lol.

**The long version:** I am recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD (30 something female) and I'm trying every second of the day to build better habits and understand what I need to do to take more action in my life and make concrete change for myself. I feel both gratitude for finally understanding ""what is wrong with me"" and also immensely frustrated that no one noticed that I suddenly went from this little high achieving elementary school girl who LOVED school and learning and wanted to strive for everything to the girl who -- within six months, after a very traumatic (I promise I'm not using this word casually) experience with a few bad grades in math class that caused my parents to first shout at me at length about failing, then stop speaking to me for a period of time -  who could barely focus in class and had no interest in doing anything at all.

For as long as I can remember, I start off strong with EVERYTHING -- school, internships, new job, attempts at being a social media influencer (lol). I'll put in 1000% effort into whatever project it is I'm doing. I'll be organized, on it, impress all with my incredible work prowess. I am the star of school / work / life. And then, somehow, for reasons I'm still trying to understand, my energy starts to fizzle and I inevitably start the rollercoaster downward, as soon as I've hit a pinnacle where it looks like I'm going to be the top of the class / get promoted / get an award, etc.

Clearly, I have a lot of childhood trauma around success (I had a lot of pressure put on me as a small kid to meet my immigrant parents' expectations of me and it caused me to crash quite early in life) that I'm still working through and also have struggled with deep mental illness for many years (depression, anxiety, now realizing how many of these things were rooted in undiagnosed ADHD). I am really trying my best, in this less-than-a-year-ish of ADHD discovery, to take more action when my body freezes like this instead of just be listless.

But as I'm sure many of you can relate to, it's not always that easy. Everyone tells me, ""Just pick up the pace! Move faster!"" It's not so easy. 

Anyway, today. I'm a contractor and I have been I hit a pinnacle with one of the clients I have been working with around June. Everything had been going okay and well. They have been chatting with me about hiring me full-time. And somehow, I think reflectively, purely out of burnout (it's my first time being a contractor and I have just been working nonstop without giving myself a break), I started to drop action items, forget to do things, OR WORST OF ALL, go into weeks-long freezes where I KNOW I have to do something and I just... can't.

And it's not even that I'm uninterested in this work! I LOVE work! I love every work I have ever done. But somehow my body and brain just shut down and I don't feel like doing a dang thing.

My boss called me out on my moving slowly at the beginning of August and on dropping the ball on things, and questioned whether or not I still had interested in being part of the company. Of course I do! I told her I was burned out and at the beginning of September, said that I was going to take a week-long break and finally hit a reset button. I do feel better, feel more energized and my habits and routines are better than they have been. In the week and a half since I have returned to work, I have been trying to pick the pace back up, trying to make sure there are no gaps in my work, and when my body feels like it's freezing, I'm really trying to recalibrate so I can get back into work quickly.

Anyway, I had a check-in with my boss today and asked at the end of our call if we could debrief on where I'm at and if there any updates about what's next in my trajectory. I'm so scared that my slowing down has impacted their impression of me, because the way many of the people I work with regularly has shifted. My boss has been a little more distant (she used to be more warm / open / friendly); one of the priorities I was supposed to be part of more intimately now has another colleague more focused on it (that shifted while I was on holiday). I'm super nervous about the call on Monday.

I know what my responsibilities are here. I know what I need to change. So after hitting ""post"" on this, that's exactly what I'm going to work on and do. But I just needed to put this here, because I have a feeling that many of you on this group can relate to what I'm going through.

Thanks for providing a space where I can share my vulnerabilities. :)",2,1728321883.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

I work at a luxury hotel in midtown manhattan, this is my first union property so I had to adapt quick. Im about 2 years in so far.

In my time, I‚Äôve seen 4 managers and 1 intern fired because union employees made it happen. 1-2 were justified, the others not so much.

I understand the whole ‚Äúyou have to earn their respect‚Äù idea, but how does one maintain any motivation in a work environment like this? I hear the past practices and internal issues at my property are worse than most. Thankfully, ive managed to maintain a good relationship with a lot of the staff here. With some others, I get verbally disrespected, sarcasm, I get berated, and flat out told what to do by staff ‚Äúor else‚Äù. One time a guest was waiting for his drink order at our restaurant inside the hotel, the barista was chilling with staff paying no mind to coffee orders while another server assistant was picking up everyone‚Äôs slack. I asked the SA barista to please assist with making the coffee for the guest as they were waiting for 10+ mins and their fellow union waiter was receiving the complaint from the guest directly. I got taken down to HR for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù a few days later lol.

Ive seen managers get fired for simply trying to uphold standards and hold staff accountable for literally not doing their job correctly, directly impacting the guests experience.

Ive learned a ton here. Working in NYC really shapes you. At the same time though, the confidence and morale amongst the management team isn‚Äôt very great. And I love hospitality, but everything is nickel and dime with the team I work with. Hospitality is selfless, and a lot of these people could care less about taking care of our guests.

I dont want to give up. I also dont expect to come in and ‚Äúmake change‚Äù to a work environment thats been operating that way it has well before ive come along. So how do you guys do it?",2,1728321794.0,hotels,2,1.0,False

I've researched things pretty thoroughly but was curious if there's something I could do to optimise my practise.

-7 day water fast, at least 3 months apart.

-For supplements I take a Centrum, calcium, magnesium, and a cod liver oil capsule, as well as a tsp of salt every day. (Wondering if this is overkill and if I can get by on just basic electrolytes.)

-Drink 3L of water per day, well as one black coffee in the morning.

-Limit physical activity after day 3, do very light calisthenics to maintain muscle mass and maybe a short walk.

Refeed as follows:

Day 1:
750ml Chicken broth
750ml Broccoli soup with a little olive oil
1 tbsp Peanut butter

Day 2:
750ml Broccoli soup
1 tbsp peanut butter
Boiled vegetables

Day 3:
1 can Chickpeas or houmous
1 Cucumber
1/4 Cabbage
1 Carrot
Celery
1 tin Sardines

Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it‚Äôs essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body‚Äôs circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it‚Äôs time to sleep and stops production when it‚Äôs time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you‚Äôve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

All the ingredients in Pineal Guardian are designed to achieve two main effects:

Support memory function  
Enhance overall brain health  
Unlike some pineal supplements that promise to ""supercharge"" your pineal gland or attract immense wealth, the makers of Pineal Guardian focus on supporting memory function and brain health.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it‚Äôs essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body‚Äôs circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it‚Äôs time to sleep and stops production when it‚Äôs time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you‚Äôve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you‚Äôve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you‚Äôve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

All the ingredients in Pineal Guardian are designed to achieve two main effects:

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it‚Äôs essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body‚Äôs circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it‚Äôs time to sleep and stops production when it‚Äôs time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

All the ingredients in Pineal Guardian are designed to achieve two main effects:

Support memory function  
Enhance overall brain health  
Unlike some pineal supplements that promise to ""supercharge"" your pineal gland or attract immense wealth, the makers of Pineal Guardian focus on supporting memory function and brain health.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it‚Äôs essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body‚Äôs circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it‚Äôs time to sleep and stops production when it‚Äôs time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you‚Äôve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

1fyd3tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1fyd3tg/my_story_a_cautionary_tale/,My story ‚Äì a cautionary tale,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been lurking these subs for a while and now that certain events have transpired I think it‚Äôs time I post this. Grab a cup of coffee and strap in for a hell of a ride because this is going to be a long one, these events span almost two decades, I‚Äôll try to stick to the main events but still expect a solid 20-30 minute read.

¬†Our story begins in 2001, when I was a chubby 12 year old geek who did nothing but play video games all day. I‚Äôm starting 7^(th) grade and there‚Äôs lots of kids in my class I hadn‚Äôt met before. Among them is a girl we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúC‚Äù. C seems to be from the same class from the previous year as all the other new kids and they all know each other. She‚Äôs highly extroverted, casually hits up conversation with anyone with ease, including all the boys while most of the other girls seem content just gossiping amongst each other (teenagers!), and while‚Äôs she‚Äôs just average-looking she seems to have this strange aura about her that just draws you in. By random chance when the teachers start assigning us our seats she is placed right next to me up front ‚Äì I think because we both wore glasses at the time ‚Äì and as she‚Äôs sitting down I make some snarky remark I can barely remember, a bad joke but in good humour to break the ice. She didn‚Äôt seem to appreciate it :D

Sitting next to each other we start talking and I find it strangely easy to interact with her ‚Äì unlike the other girls who seem repelled by my skinnyfat physique, braces and acne riddled face. We joke and play around a lot, she is funny, and we‚Äôre always pulling pranks on each other. Not gonna lie ‚Äì I develop a bit of a crush on C. But I had never had a girlfriend and have no confidence talking to girls so I keep it to myself. C ends up dating a couple of guys over the next three years ‚Äì just teen stuff, hand holding and kissing and lots of drama. Middle school ends and it‚Äôs time to pick a highschool ‚Äì now where I lived there were several different highschools around so the class all got split up, but C and I just happened to go to the same one. In the new school we don‚Äôt know anyone else, so we hang out a lot. C is single now, we grow close and start dating. We were 16 years old. I‚Äôd kissed a couple girls before but never had a girlfriend proper. Things develop between us and we end up having sex ‚Äì we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs first ‚Äì and we‚Äôre together throughout all of highschool. Now at numerous times over 3 years we had fights over silly things, things that seemed petty to me that she was just blowing out of proportion but hey she‚Äôs my first girlfriend, what do I know about girls really, and besides teenagers are always making a big deal out of everything isn‚Äôt it? I ignore the red flags.

Now immediately after high school, over the Christmas period, she and I both get a part-time job at the same retail store. I sign up for the army at the time, but we want to stick together and make it work, and I just get this job to basically buy her a good Christmas gift. While working there this other girl just seemed a bit‚Ä¶friendly with me. Things like, I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve got something on my shirt so she just comes over and brushes it off. I think nothing of it ‚Äì she‚Äôs just being nice ‚Äì but C is fuming. She‚Äôs convinced this girl likes me. Even if that‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt like her and haven‚Äôt done anything, so why is she mad at me? I ignore the red flags. 

Another girl at the store lived close to us, literally just a few houses down from mine, and one day when I‚Äôm working a shift with this other girl and C has the day off, when I get off work I give the girl a ride home instead of letting her take the bus ‚Äì we‚Äôre going to the same place, seems only logical. When I get home I drop her off, park up and head inside. Just as I‚Äôm sending C a text to let her know I‚Äôm home and where to meet up she walks through the door (she has a key to my parents‚Äô house by now), throws the keys at me, screams at me that we‚Äôre through and storms out. I am stupefied. I try to call her but there‚Äôs no answer, I text her and no replies. A day goes by, two, three, eventually she texts me back. She saw us arrived and was convinced I was cheating on her with this girl I gave a ride home. Even though she knew we both had just got off work, and literally only had time to drive home. Hours of texts later she comes around, apologizes, we make up and all is well. I ignore the red flags.

A few months later I‚Äôm in boot camp. And what do you know ‚Äì remember that other girl from the store that seemed to have a crush on me? By sheer coincidence she‚Äôs in my platoon. At the end of the day, back at the barracks I‚Äôm texting C about how my first day went, and innocently tell her this fact. She does not reply. I text again, no reply. I call, no answer. She doesn‚Äôt say anything for days, I‚Äôm locked in the base and have no way to get out and contact her, I‚Äôm freaking out. Several days later she replies, she‚Äôs furious and jealous about this other girl, and about me telling her she was here. Would she prefer I keep it a secret? In my mind that would be the suspicious thing to do. We talk, she calms down, we make up. Meanwhile C has been struggling with stress and depression, she gets prescribed medication for it ‚Äì she will be on meds for mental health issues for the rest of her life. I ignore the red flags. 

I didn‚Äôt stay in the army for very long, it wasn‚Äôt for me and I got a job elsewhere near home. C and I are together every day, things are good, still the occasional fights over stupid things but we make it work. A couple years later I‚Äôm in a dead end job with no hope of career advancement and I decide I‚Äôm doing to college. I study up on my spare time after work, apply and get in. College is a couple of hours away. Now we‚Äôre in our early 20s, we want to be together and have our privacy at this point, I start doing some math, if C gets a job near my college and with what I can bring in we can just about afford to rent a little place of our own. She loves the idea, we‚Äôre finally moving in together, it‚Äôs like a honeymoon. We move, school year starts, she gets a job, we live together and life is good. Except only a few weeks in C is taking time off work, off sick over stress/anxiety. Two weeks turn into four, six‚Ä¶money is tight, she goes back to work and we‚Äôre just about recovering from that time she was off when she‚Äôs off sick again. Stress at work, manager doesn‚Äôt like her, complains about her colleagues - these will be a constant throughout her life. Money was tight before, now it‚Äôs really bad. There‚Äôs no food in the fridge, rent is due. We swallow our pride and ask our parents for help, they send over some money, we can make it another month or two and she goes back to work. Except she‚Äôs not at work for very long before - you guessed it ‚Äì she‚Äôs off sick again. It gets bad, really bad. We‚Äôre both really stressed over money.

One day classes finished early, and I head straight home. When I walk through the door C is lying on the floor, gasping and moaning, an empty box of pills on the table. I put her in the car and rush her to the hospital, I hand them the empty box, they pump her stomach, put her on an IV and whatever else they do in these cases, I‚Äôm in the waiting room freaking out and call our parents. Her parents get in the car and start driving down. I talk to the nurse, C is awake but they‚Äôre keeping her on suicide watch, I talk to her and tell her she‚Äôll have to stay, we say goodbye and I go home. I can‚Äôt get a minute of sleep, and next morning I‚Äôm back in the hospital. C is being put in a psychiatric ward, she can‚Äôt leave, she‚Äôs getting counselling and having her meds reviewed. She ends up being there for three months. I‚Äôm leaving our house and finding a room near campus, arranging for removals, looking after all the legal stuff all after school while trying to visit her in the hospital, juggling everything and freaking out. Eventually she‚Äôs discharged and moves back in with her parents, and for whatever reason‚Ä¶is breaking up with me. Nothing makes sense, I‚Äôm trying to get through college while all this is happening, I‚Äôm spiralling into depression myself, I have two weeks of pure hell, and then I drive up to my parents‚Äô for the weekend. C wants to talk, she apologizes, says it was her meds talking and we get back together ‚Äì I go down for college during the week and drive back up every Friday evening to be with her. We do this for another 3 years and things are good, when we don‚Äôt have those silly little fights now and then. I ignore the red flags.

I graduate, get a job, I move back into my parents‚Äô house and C moves in with us. Things start out good but start to deteriorate between us and my parents, mainly between C and my mom. C seems to make a big deal out of everything and always has to have her way. Lots of small to medium fights. I ignore the red flags.

Meanwhile my best friend is getting married ‚Äì the four of us all know each other from middle school and still hang out a lot - and asks me to be best man. C was not invited to be maid of honour, and is upset about it. Not long after he‚Äôs going to be a father, and asks me to be the child‚Äôs godfather. C is VERY upset that she‚Äôs not asked to be godmother, and stops talking to them. Situation gets a bit tense between us all, I still talk to my friend now and then but things were never the same again. I ignore the red flags.

We want our own place again, this living together with parents arrangement won‚Äôt do any more, especially after we‚Äôve had a taste of freedom. Now the economy where we lived was shit, and C goes through a few jobs but for some reason can never hold them down for very long, it‚Äôs always too stressful, it‚Äôs always some conflict with the people at work. I ignore the red flags.

There is no way in hell we‚Äôre going to afford our place any time soon, so I suggest to C we move to a different country, where we can afford a much better life. I put a bit of money aside, get myself a plane ticket and just go for it ‚Äì not knowing were I was even going to sleep that night. I did find a place to sleep ‚Äì I get with a friend from college and his girlfriend, and we live together for a while to save money. I quickly find a job and start saving. 3 months later C is flying over to join me, and we can start our new life together. She gets a job, we get a place just for ourselves ‚Äì it‚Äôs small but cosy, and it‚Äôs home. Life is good. Until C is off work sick again, anxiety/depression again, money is tight again, things get ugly, again. Fortunately I can work as much overtime as I like in my new job, so I start working 60-70 hour weeks and keep us afloat. Now C is resentful with me because she‚Äôs always alone at home (off sick) and feels abandoned because I‚Äôm never with her (working tons of overtime to pay the bills all on my own). This issue will repeat itself over and over again for the next 8 years. I ignore the red flags.

The cycle repeats itself for a few years ‚Äì C goes back to work and things are good (minus the small silly fights), eventually she‚Äôs off sick with her anxiety and depression and money gets tight, I have to work overtime to make up for it and things get strained between us because I‚Äôm never home, leading to big fights. Now I love C, she‚Äôs my world, but the constant ups and downs starts taking a toll on my mental health too. But I persevere. I ignore the red flags.

Eventually we save up enough money to upgrade house ‚Äì we‚Äôre still renting, we can‚Äôt afford the downpayment on a mortgage ‚Äì C‚Äôs repeated cycles of time off sick always end up eating into our savings which we then end up spending months trying to put back ‚Äì but we can afford to rent a pretty good house, 3 bedrooms, spacious, with a garden and garage. Kinda our dream home. Life is good. After moving to the new house, one day I‚Äôm outside working on my car and a neighbour approaches me, interested in what I‚Äôm doing ‚Äì let‚Äôs call him P. Now remember that C and I are immigrants, when P and I introduce each other we notice our names are from the same language ‚Äì we‚Äôre both immigrants from the same country, what a coincidence! P and I hit it off and become friends, not great friends but friendly enough that we have dinner at his place, I play with his kids and the four of us (P is married) and the kids spend Christmas together. Put a pin on this.

Life is good except C is terrible with money. Her meds seem to be kind of right now and she doesn‚Äôt take time off work very often any more, but the more she makes the more she spends and we struggle to save up. We meant to save up for the downpayment on that mortgage but sometimes it seems like I‚Äôm the only one trying. I ignore the red flags.

When the end of our lease is getting close it‚Äôs clear we haven‚Äôt saved up enough so we renew the lease. This was around the time of Covid. I propose to C, she says yes, life is really good. We grow really close during Covid, closer than ever before because we get to spend so much time together during lockdown. We decide it‚Äôs time to start a family, and start trying. We try for months and months, but nothing happens, one negative pregnancy test after another is really bringing C down. She decides to call it quits, she doesn‚Äôt want to try any more. I‚Äôm fine with it, I liked the idea of being a father but I‚Äôm perfectly happy with just the two of us.

After Covid we go back to work full time, things are still good even though obviously we‚Äôre not spending as much time together. The little fights start happening again. A few months later C is breaking up with me. It shook me to my very core, I did not see it coming, I things were fine but she says she‚Äôs not happy, she feels like our relationship isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I am devastated. We‚Äôre stuck in this house for the time being, we just renewed the lease, she moves to the spare room, things are very tense, we barely talk.

Fast forward past the worst three months of my life (up until that point) and one evening C texts me, her car broke down, battery is dead and it won‚Äôt start, she‚Äôs crying, all alone in the dark and freezing (this is around November). We‚Äôre not really talking at this point, but I can‚Äôt say no to her, I drive over quick as I can and jump start her car, on the way home I buy a new battery for her car - off my own money, I know money is very tight for her, but since breaking up I‚Äôve actually saved up a lot (remember she‚Äôs terrible with money, she‚Äôd spend all of hers and plenty of mine every month while we were together) - so she can go to work the next morning. When I get home she‚Äôs sitting on the kitchen floor crying. I comfort her, we hug, make up, we obviously still love each other and decide to get back together. As we‚Äôre getting ready for bed I notice she has a large bruise on her thigh, she says she hurt herself at work, put a pin on this. I ignore the red flags.

Things are good for a few months, it‚Äôs like a new honeymoon period, I propose to C again, she says yes. Meanwhile she decides to see a psychiatrist for her mental health issues and is diagnosed with BPD, and starts on new medication ‚Äì supposedly the best they‚Äôve got for this condition, but it takes while to start working. I propose to C, she says yes. About a month later she‚Äôs breaking up again, took me completely by surprise, again. I ask her why, she says she just doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. We‚Äôre separated but living together again, things are very tense again.

Fast forward a few weeks C wants to talk. Says she‚Äôs sorry, she‚Äôs been very unstable because of the new meds, this emotional instability is because of her condition and when she ‚Äúsplits‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs doing. She begs me to get back together, begs me to not let go of her again because it‚Äôs her condition talking when she does this. I take her back. I ignore the red flags.

Over the next year and a half or so things are good, small fights, C is a bit distant at times but we‚Äôre OK. She seems more‚Ä¶private than before, her phone has a password now for some reason, and I don‚Äôt know it. Sometimes I want to look something up online and don‚Äôt have my phone with me, ask her to use hers and instead of handing it over she asks me what I want to look up and does it herself. Strange, but I guess she‚Äôs talking with her girl friends about girls stuff and work, it‚Äôs fine I don‚Äôt need to know, I‚Äôm not one for gossip. I ignore the red flags.

She spends a lot of time now on her phone, smoking in the garage (she set up a nice cosy corner with our old couch), on tiktok or talking to her friends on evenings and weekends, that‚Äôs fine she likes her alone time, I do too. She rolls her cigarettes and sometimes just sits down for an hour rolling lots of them to have ready to go. P (remember him) rolls too so sometimes she‚Äôll go over to roll cigarettes and chat, sometimes I‚Äôll come back from the gym and she‚Äôs not home, I‚Äôll message her and says she‚Äôs over there rolling and will be right back. I ignore the red flags.

Now and then she keeps showing up with strange bruises, on her thighs, buttocks, breasts. How does a woman bruise her breasts exactly? She says she doesn‚Äôt know, she just bruises easily. That‚Äôs true I have noticed that. I think nothing of it. I ignore the red flags.

Late last year P had some problems at home. He lost his job, he had a bit of a drinking problem, there as some domestic violence and his wife kicked him out and got a restraining order. He was sleeping in his car under an overpass. I wasn‚Äôt about to leave a friend in need out on the streets so I took him in, let him stay at our place for a few weeks. He was going back home, and he already had a job lined up working with some old friends in Austria. He stayed for a while and then flew back, and that was the last time I saw him. Put a pin on this.

A few months after that C says she‚Äôs going to visit her friend, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúK‚Äù. K was from Denmark, they met at work. She was getting married and pregnant, and wanted to move back home. C was going to visit for a couple of days after the baby was born. She bought the tickets, and a few weeks later flew over and stayed for two nights. I work out on the road and that day I wanted to have lunch with her before she drove to the airport, brought us lunch and we said goodbye, kissed, hugged, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll miss you‚Äù, the works. We talked over messages that night, she got there late, after 10, wish me good night and we‚Äôd talk more in the morning. Next morning I messaged her, but the messages were left on unread. I was working and busy so wasn‚Äôt exactly checking, and I figured she‚Äôs catching up with her friend. She didn‚Äôt get back to me until the evening, said they had been out all day at the park with the baby, reception was terrible, she didn‚Äôt have much time to talk but we‚Äôd see each other tomorrow and then I‚Äôd have her full attention. I ignored the red flags.

Around three months ago C seems distant again. She always complained I didn‚Äôt talk to her, I didn‚Äôt open up, I was ‚Äúemotionally unavailable‚Äù so I‚Äôm making an effort. I ask her about her day and now she doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it. She doesn‚Äôt seem to want to spend much time together. One day she‚Äôs in the garage in the afternoon and I go over, sit down next to her and ask her what‚Äôs wrong. First she insists nothing is wrong but I press her on it, remind her she made me promise not to let her go again. Eventually she opens up, she‚Äôs not happy, she‚Äôs planning to leave, she‚Äôs been looking at houses online to move out. At this point I‚Äôm not surprised any more. I keep pressing her on why, why is she distant, why is this happening again, what am I doing wrong? We talk for ages and eventually she confesses: those three months or so we were separated, around two years ago, she had sex with P. I am floored. I storm off, we don‚Äôt talk again for hours. At night I ask her if she wants to talk, and we just sit outside in the dark, smoking and talking. She says she felt so lonely and abandoned, one night she just needed a friend, asked him to come over to talk, she was high on coke (she used to do that from time to time, not very often ‚Äì largely his influence and that of her friend, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúB‚Äù, but she‚Äôs a whole other story), he made advances and she couldn‚Äôt say no, couldn‚Äôt help herself. This was a very hard pill to swallow. Remember C and I were each other‚Äôs first, we had never been with anyone else, we had a special bond. She didn‚Äôt tell me anything when we got back together, said she was afraid of my reaction. I would have punched P in the face, repeatedly, but he was long gone. But OK it was a mistake, she was on drugs, vulnerable, lonely, and we were separated. It was an adjustment but I pushed through, I loved her and wanted to make it work. I struggled with this for weeks. I ignored the red flags.

Three weeks ago we booked a BnB for the weekend, to spend some special time together. We went over Friday and had sex, lots of sex, great sex. Things were really great between us now, on every level. We were talking a lot, sharing everything, really in tune. Now after the last talk she‚Äôd given me full access to her phone again, and Saturday I woke up very early ‚Äì I struggle to sleep much anyway, as soon as the light hits the window I‚Äôm awake and can‚Äôt go back to sleep, and on a different bed I sleep even less. I had loads of time before she woke up so I made myself a coffee, her phone was on the table, and I started reading through her messages. She had a long conversation with her friend, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúR‚Äù. Going back over her old messages with him two things struck me: 1) R clearly wanted to be more than friends, and 2) she talked about P, how she‚Äôd blocked his number and on social media, but ‚Äúhe probably had hundreds of pictures of her, he can jerk off to them for all she cared‚Äù. My stomach was turning, anxiety was through the roof. I waited for her to wake up and asked her what she meant by that. The look on her face was that of someone obviously caught in a lie, a serious lie. She confessed she and P had been sexting after their encounter, when asked when and if it happened after we got back together‚Ä¶she ""couldn‚Äôt remember"". But it was all over now. I was not OK, told her we were going home (I had booked the whole weekend). I was shaking the whole drive home, when I got home I locked myself in the office, I needed to think.

In the evening she was in the garage and I went over to talk. She confessed she had been sexting with him every now and then up until early this year. Said he would pressure her, blackmail her, threaten to tell me the truth, so she obliged and sent him explicit photos (she had blocked him and deleted all their conversation history long ago). I was fuming, last time we talked, when the one night stand came out, we insisted on full honesty, and she had lied and kept things from me. I pressed her for the full truth, I could smell she was still telling me half truths. She took a deep breath and confessed: when she went to visit her friend in Denmark, she didn‚Äôt actually go to Denmark, she went to Austria, to visit P. I was physically sick. Multiple times over the past two years, ever since we got back together, they‚Äôd been having an affair (hate that word, downplays the severity of it so much). When she was over ‚Äúrolling cigarettes‚Äù, they weren‚Äôt rolling cigarettes. It happened numerous times. Eventually we got into the gory details, and what they were doing‚Ä¶it was basically hardcore porn. Apparently he liked it rough, very rough. Remember those bruises? He hit her, hard. On her ass, her thighs, her breasts, sometimes even her face.

For days I didn‚Äôt know what hit me. My whole world was upside down. Two weeks ago I tried to kill myself. I failed, obviously. A few days ago I told her we were done, what she did was unforgivable. The next day I went out, but I suspected something so I drove back 10 minutes later. She was in the bathroom with the razor blades, trying to kill herself.

We have both hit rock bottom. My entire world view has been shattered, I never imagined she could do this to me, the person I loved and dedicated my entire adult life to wasn‚Äôt real, our relationship was not as meaningful as I though it was, we didn‚Äôt have the deep, indestructible bond that I thought we did, I spent the last two years living a lie and everything I have worked for for almost two decades gone overnight. She‚Äôs dying with guilt and shame, begged me to try to save our relationship, but there is no coming back from this and I have since made that clear, and she says she can never live without me.

We have talked for dozens, maybe hundreds of hours about this by now. It‚Äôs all we can talk about. It‚Äôs all I can think about. She says she was out of control, it was the change in her medication that made her unstable, she felt alone and abandoned (she was working from home up until late last year), that he manipulated her and blackmailed her (bullshit, we have since established she wanted it ‚Äì she fucking planned to go spend two days fucking with him in another country), she was splitting, she couldn‚Äôt see things clearly and it was only recently, with therapy, that she realized the severity of what she had done. She‚Äôd always loved me and I was who she wanted to spend her life with.

When she says she loves me, I believe her. When she says she‚Äôs filled with guilt, shame and remorse, I believe her. But when she went over to his house she didn‚Äôt love me. When she flew over to visit him she didn‚Äôt love me.

What I hope people can take away from my story is: love for them is not like love for us. Love for us is a deeply rooted thing that builds up over time, and it‚Äôs always there. When she was with me she loved me, but when she was with him she didn‚Äôt love me, for her it comes and goes. Because of her insecurities and attachment/abandonment issues, when he gave her any attention she switched, stopped loving me and loved him instead. Sometimes all it took was a minor fight between us for her to switch, and she ran back to him.

Now the life I‚Äôve spent almost 20 years working on is in ruins. I have to start a new life from scratch. They say learning from other people‚Äôs mistakes is less painful than learning from your own. I hope people read this and learn from mine. Life with someone with BPD is a rollercoaster. During the highs it seems idyllic, like they are perfect and your love together is so strong. But you never know when a switch will flip in their heads and they forget all about you until it switches back. Even before she betrayed me in the worst way possible there were countless fights, several big ones, and she left me several times, and because I loved her so much I ignored all the red flags. Over time a relationship like this wears you down, makes you numb and emotionally exhausted. And all it takes is bad timing for them to do something catastrophic. So if you‚Äôre considering a future with someone with BPD, think very carefully if this is what you want.

1fyd314,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1fyd314/rafters_guide_sheffield_uk/,"Rafters (guide), Sheffield, UK.","Rafters is one of a handful of fine dining restaurants in Sheffield. It has been open since 1989 and Michelin guide listed since 1996, although a star still eludes them. For my full write up please visit my blog [here](https://medium.com/@eatingsheffield/rafters-38919f737e9d).

Rafters offers modern British cuisine in a relatively small (a cover of 26) dining area. There is a single tasting menu priced at ¬£110 with no optional additions, although you can choose to dine at the kitchen bench for ¬£135 (with one additional course) and also dine midweek for ¬£65, albeit with a scaled back menu.

The wine list is compact - 3 pages for whites, 5 for reds including a full 2 pages devoted to cabernet and cabernet blends, 1 for sparkling wines, and 1 apiece for rose and dessert wines. Prices range from ¬£40 to ¬£850 and seem fairly marked up, with a handful of bargains.

**Pic 1**: Goat's curd, Granny Smith & eel tart was acidic and bright on the tongue, but had no real rounded flavours. Much more impressive was the chicken liver parfait disguised to look like a cherry- a clever bit of kitchen intervention and had a very rich flavour.

**Pic 2**: Tempura cod cheek with shichimi togarashi. Light and airy batter and the cod was very delicately prepared.

**Pic 3**: bread course was treacle stout loaf with henderson's relish butter. An appreciative nod to local ingredients, but easily suprpassed by the shokupan served with beef butter.

**Pic 4**: Loch Duart salmon crudo, with gordal olive, and a charred gazpacho made with IOW tomatoes. The salmon was clearly of good quality but some of the delicate flavours got lost here.

**Pic 5**: BBQ English potato featuring Lincolnshire poacher cheese, turnip, and nasturtium. A highlight of the meal which demonstrated the chef's ability to elevate simple ingredients. Rich and well balanced.

**Pic 6**: Orkney Scallop with Thai green curry, kimchi, & coriander. Anyone familiar with the UK restaurant scene won't be surprised to see Orkney scallops make an appearance. Rafters kept it novel here by serving with a rich Thai green sauce, and the scallop was expertly seared. The kimchi flavours were undiscernable.

**Pic 7 & 8**: Herdwick hogget served two ways. First up was lamb kofta with potato flatbread, labneh, and pickled red onion. The taste profile was well rounded- the rich taste of the lamb worked well with the other elements involved and the execution was novel. The second preparation of the hogget featured roasted loin served with gravy, and BBQ belly served with a caesar salad. The loin had been cooked perfectly, and this contrasted well with the flavour forward BBQ belly.

**Pic 9**: English strawberries with sorrel, rice pudding, & 12 year balsamic. The tartness of the vinegar played off the other ingredients well here.

Missing course - chocolate with artichoke, ginger, coffee, & mascarpone. I did not take a photograph of this course nor did I make notes, and unfortunately my memory is a little impaired for this time of the evening.

**Pic 10**: a selection of fudge petit fours to go with coffee (¬£3.50), courtesy of local roasters Cupper's Choice

The total bill for me was ¬£162 - this includes the tasting menu, two bottles of wine split between 3, two additional glasses of wine, and a coffee, rounded off by a 12.5% service charge. This was a very enjoyable meal, with no real weak links other than the salmon, and some very memorable courses. I suspect that Rafters may be a way off getting a star; there doesn't seem to be quite the level of kitchen skill on display compared to some local 1\* venues, but the menu is priced accordingly. Rafters continues to be one of the better dining choices locally.

1fyd2gp,https://i.redd.it/hyq3vhewadtd1.jpeg,Color combinations for my new apartment (with oak wood floors),"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm furnishing my small apartment and need help with the design. I have natural oak parquet floors and am planning a kitchen with light kashmir/sand cabinets (mockup attached). I‚Äôm stuck on the wooden cabinets, dining table, and countertop - should I match the wood to the floor or try something different?

The carpenter making the kitchen will also build my bed and coffee table, so I want everything to flow nicely. The only other decision I‚Äôve made is a brick/barn red sofa for the living room.

Any suggestions on wood finishes, color combos, or materials to go with the oak floor and red sofa?

Thanks a lot! :)

the thing is i'm making this for my boyfriend's mom's birthday with a bunch of his family there so it needs to be like... phenomenal lol. and i've never made it before so i don't really have a frame of reference. any knowledge from experienced tiramisu bakers would be much appreciated! thank you!!",3,1728321359.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

The ""problem"" is that I am not sure whether I will go out during the weekend since I am probably the only one that can not drink.

I'm hosting a visitor from abroad and want to impress. A cafe in Montreal (Crew Collective & Cafe, built inside an old 'cathedral style' bank building) was a gorgeous experience I personally had with high end aesthetics and on top of that, some pretty decent cappuccino.

[Crew Collective & Cafe](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=116b66c83e832583&sxsrf=ADLYWIIS_wDw5KyrkEp8KjQ2FfoPt6RR3A:1728322064085&q=crew+collective+montreal&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J3ppPdoHI1O-XvbXbpNjYYwWUVH6qTfR1Lpek5F-7GS5G77zCDGUiyO9thp-XYOUMbcFKhVjBmWiBjrk_CeO5FeR902XjlfKme9IUuo-RkGmYwMfdckVS1YSig45llqcDConY_0PJixjIalv6Pd97s0xoefgXcbnDc9tDu7y9KXK996Z2A&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSn7-15fyIAxV7EFkFHeCSG1QQtKgLegQICxAB&biw=1706&bih=942&dpr=1.5)

I'm familiar with a lot of local shops - SJCB, Pilot, De Mello, Ethica, T3, Dineen, Maman, Fika, Jimmy's, Found, Library, Brickroom, etc. I mostly brew my own coffee at home with Hatch/Subtext/De Mello/Cafe William beans.

Matt from Robinson House back with my next batch of Wisdom!  These two aren't INHERENTLY qualified to be representative of a ""Magick"" wisdom, but they can teach you essentials about understanding that will benefit you for life.  We already know the wisdom of a Sauna, this is just better than getting comfortable with hot water in another way.  It's all good, you know? :)

Anyway, here are the ""Wisdom Wheels"", as we'll call them, much like the Black Wisdom Hydra they promise an experience to get with so that your subconscious does it's elementary wisdom building, just by observing scientific phenomena in action.  Have fun!

Fire Wisdom Pentacle

Conventional S\*\*\* (Read like a half-sung poem):  Eat that Oreo, drink that coffee, strike a wooden Redbird match, smoke that cig, check that ember burrrnin'.

Eat that Oreo - Represents what it feels like when you eat a burning ember, just sweetened because that is wrong for a human.  It is in a way perfect because the Oreo breaks up in texture the same way.  I would say this is the more FUN part of the ritual.

Drink that Coffee - You appreciate here that you saturated a roasted element, as though to celebrate fire's product conventionally and subliminally. This brings a remedial focus into things, more wisdom for the tinker.

Strike a wooden Redbird match - This is to illustrate something about a metaphor that comes to life (I guess one could relate it to Brimstone but that's on the individual). Inhaling the sulfur is like understanding the bitterness of smoke in a way that is not entirely unenjoyable but certainly pungent and not really wanted. It's the liberation in just enjoying what it is as a product of something unique like the combustible material igniting that way, to even produce it.

Smoke that cig - Though I don't often engage in talking about smoking as a good thing, I would say to remediate the lesson of smoke that is at least able to be ""gotten over"" as something desired to be inhaled, this vapor lesson is also subconscious in a way, as the effects of the smoke take place in the body.  This brings you to a level of understanding with smoke, that it is a humble part of the process and you appreciate it this way, understanding it's fundamental process of being smoke first, not a help.  If one does not want to smoke Cigarettes, an hour in some White Sage or Buffalo Grass smoke would help, keep a window open for proper ventilation when surrounded by walls and a roof.

Check that ember burning - This is really truly to appreciate the uniqueness of the universe in a way related to the burn of the cigarette or other thing you're smoking/burning. Watch it with your eyes, while you smoke it and while it's just sitting there, interesting thoughts will come your way, but I guess try not to stare at little faces that seem to appear in the ash for too long or in any way that would lead you to maybe think there are faces in it.

=================

White  Water Wisdom:

At the center of a Compass Rose is the letters H302.  You would drink and experience this water in whatever way you want because it is the purest  that water can get, and it would also be used in both Wheels as base water for anything.  We know it as Exclusion Zone (EZ) water from other sources on Google.

At the Septenrio point, there is the concept of warm  water that is comforting.  We place you in a sauna for this, watching  every bit of steam but more or less becoming extremely comfortable with warm water.  People do this all the time for comfort and it shows it  really works for raw wisdom.

At the Oriens point we have Chamomile Tea.  Embrace everything about it, because it isn't burned and it's so loved  by so many, it's like an adequate representation of what can be beautiful about water.

At the Meridies point we have Chaga Tea, which  will do another thing so long as you realize the fungus in it was  helpful, whereas we commonly see fungus as harmful outside of known edible foods.  Discovery is in it you know?

Anyway, at the Occidens point we have degrees of wisdom to represent the redness of  things, but in a nice way.  One will set up an evaporator/condenser  coil, one that is clear glass so you can see it like an alembic does.

Anyway, you would do the process to Peroxide, Butane,  Coffee (Black), Red Koolaid and Soap Water (Glycerin based, one may have  to use a cheesegrater on a block of soap for it I guess, mixing it in).

You would use the H302 in all of these cases, but that's the  White Water Wisdom Rose.  Now onto the next one.

Black Water Wisdom

This is a seven pointed pentacle.  It is made up of things you would drink to experience the ""attacker"" nature of water, emphasized extremely as one would hope to do in a thing like this.  One of these you don't drink (You don't have to drink any, to be honest) but the rest  should be fine as long as quantities are measured.  For example, you might only take a shot with the Tomst, but maybe some good ol' Yuba Juice would do it right (If you're allergic then skip that part).

The top point is Murkan, which can be equated to  drinking Yuba Juice (Make juice from Yuba itself).

The next point is Dudu Tha, which is like drinking an Avocado Smoothie with a  spoon, not drinking the water unless it's in the spoon (Drain the spoon  if you can).

The next point is Tomst, which is basically Beet Juice  with some ashes in it, I guess mix to taste but the color cannot be red  anymore.

The next point is Hlor, which could not be reproduced with  wisdom (No drinking Lysol with a specific additive, after being distilled in the sun) so we made a chemical process to visualize.  Place normal clay in a jar  which looks beautiful and fill it with H302.  Let it do the process it does in the sun, whatever forms will be effective.  Just watching  it is like looking at the attacker water is.

The next one is Yubst.   Sand smoothie unfortunately, take more than you're comfortable with but  don't be excessive, and you would freeze the sand in the ice to be used.  It's just that freezing sand  does something almost meaningless to it and the effect is real.  This is meant to represent things that don't dissolve in water, for those still confused about the logic of the sand in ice.  Anyway, this one is a bit tough to chew, for lack of a better word, only those seeking this should really be the ones to try this one.

The next one  is Shtang.  Never curse to say Shtang instead of S\*\*\*, because they  mean the same thing.  Regardless, we chose not to use it and replaced it  with Chaga Tea, as though to mirror the other White Water Wisdom in a Back way.

The  final point is Hubst, which can be equated to Turkiko, if you've ever  heard of it (Hope it's not a racist term, Turkish Coffee is popular in many places).  Just a gentle reminder of the toughness water can obtain, when you reach the bottom of the coffee, plus the taste helps remedy something.",1,1728321277.0,magick,0,0.67,False

1) how much are you paying? I‚Äôm in a medium to high cost of living area and we pay $30/hour plus a $20 tip. House typically takes 3-3 1/2 hours so 140-160. 

2) what do they do for you? Our person dry dusts (which is honestly useless), cleans the bathrooms - okayish, kitchen (but again the dry dusting makes the cleaning of the kitchen kind of useless), vacuums most but not all of the carpets, swifters the floors that arent carpets and remakes my kids beds (which feels unnecessary to me‚Ä¶. ) They don‚Äôt move any furniture or vacuum under anything (like the couch) or vacumn right up to the walls‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt always move the kitchen chairs to vacuum/mop around it. Honestly I‚Äôm not super happy with it.

I‚Äôm trying to decide if it‚Äôs worth looking for another person‚Ä¶ trouble is I‚Äôm in a really small community so I‚Äôd have to not have someone for a while and then get someone new. I run into our cleaner at a lot of community events 

My family is pretty clean and I don‚Äôt feel like this service is adding a ton of value other than the bathrooms. Like I always have to clean the stove and sink afterwords because they don‚Äôt do any scrubbing‚Ä¶ so like it‚Äôll still have a coffee stain from pouring out my morning coffee‚Ä¶. Or if there is any food stuck on the sink or stove, I have to remove it.  They don‚Äôt wipe down shower shelves, they just pour a cup of hot water on it and put the shampoo back. 

My other pet peeve is that they always round the hours up. So if they‚Äôre there 2 hours 35 mins, I pay for 3 hours. And in my head I think‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt you have spent those 20 mins I paid for wiping the fan blades, vacuuming the stairs or cleaning the kitchen sink? They‚Äôre always there about 5-10 minutes on the half hour. So I‚Äôm always paying more, it never works in my favor.

Hello Everyone,

Just wanted to share my results from my PSMF cycle I ran this summer which lasted around 4 weeks. I was happy with the results, and am considering running another burst to get clear abs and down to 170-ish pounds. I do not have all the statistics, but feel free to ask any questions. 

See my outline from my previous post below:

Starting PSMF again. 

Had a successful PSMFun earlier this year, but got in a car accident and due to inactivity, lifting/exercise restrictions, and general fatigue/laziness, my diet slipped and gained a lot of weight. Summer is the best time of year to cut for me (from Minnesota so it‚Äôs actually warm and can get lots of steps), so figured it‚Äôs time to get shredded-ish. Will try to log most of my stats from here on. I‚Äôm also going to try a heavily skewed - IF approach, and while not optimal for protein sparing, I believe it will be best for adherence. Yes, this will look crazy, and give me any advice (let me hear the ‚Äúspace out your meals‚Äù you‚Äôre probably correct). This plan will likely change once a few days pass, but based off lifestyle, I think it‚Äôs achievable. Cheers. 

**Stats and Goals**

5'10‚Äù 
Start weight: 205lbs, Goal weight: 175-185lbs


**Planned Routine**

Track Food using MFP
Lift 2x per week per body part, 2-4 days lifting a week
12-15k steps/day, as much as possible by the day
Use TRT as provided by doc - 100mg/week
Supplement with electrolyte drinks, drink caffeine in energy drink/coffee
Psyllium husk for fiber, add low cal veggies for hunger/fiber as needed
Daily multivitamin, fish oil
Start low on calories, reverse out at end of diet


Meals-

Meal 1 (mid-day)- 1 scoop whey, 1/2 scoop casein shake
155 calories, 2 fat, 2 carb, 31 protein

Meal 2 (dinner)- 1 large container 0% fage unsweetened Greek yogurt, 1/2 carton (460g) liquid egg whites.
700 calories, 140 protein, 25 carb, 0 fat

Total: 850 calories, 171p, 27c, 2fat

Slightly higher carbs then recommended, but not concerned about it due to still being in a large deficit.

As stated, this is not a 'product' just a thing I made, if anything its an alpha/beta grade idea at that. I tend to just do it live if I build out an idea, and find it easier to just work it up than write it out. I have been investing since I was a teen in the 1900s so the experience gave me enough to make a working model vs a mockup and it hit the good enough for what I wanted point. 

I am happy to get any input or better ideas on how to make it work or use for accurate calculations. The logic at this point is dead simple, taking the 1,2,3,5,7,10,15,30 day change from dividend dates to get an average, and then use the average to guess a best day to buy and how many days you would have to hold. Most of my dividend invest is the boring vanilla buy and hold, this requires a swing trade like system, so again happy to hear others ideas.

There is no signup, I have no email list, no pro version coming, I don't even have a 'buy me a coffee' beg. If its useful or helpful for another avg trader, cool. If it ain't, I'm using it as intended, so its all gravy baby.

I‚Äôm a design student currently working on a tea or coffee set, and I‚Äôm basing the function of the teapot (or coffeepot) on the *assassin‚Äôs teapot*‚Äîthe one with two chambers for pouring different liquids depending on how you tilt it.

I‚Äôve been brainstorming forms for the set, and while I‚Äôm leaning toward using different potion vial designs for the cups (which feels like a fun nod to fantasy), I‚Äôm really stuck on the design of the teapot/coffeepot itself. I want it to be visually engaging, but I‚Äôm unsure how to capture function and form effectively.

Additionally, I‚Äôm trying to figure out practical solutions for how to clean both chambers efficiently, so any ideas on that front would be helpful too!

This has been going on for a couple of days he was even struggling with the downward dog stretch thing and would do the inverted one like a cat whenever he'd wake up.

For the past few years, I've been falling deep into the rabbit hole of home-brewed pourover coffee. As we all know, Vancouver roasters are fairly well-known for their Third Wave coffees that are roasted lighter and often lean towards tart, fruity and bright tasting notes. These are very fun and interesting to brew - but alas, I recently returned from a trip to Athens, Greece whereupon I stumbled across The Underdog coffee roasters and had potentially the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted. I can't recall the origin of the beans (I don't read Greek), but I vividly remember the tasting notes -- slightly nutty, brown sugar and chocolate with slight hints of syrupy red fruit on the tail end, but PERFECTLY balanced. No overwhelming tartness from the red fruit, a pleasant but not cloying sweetness and just all around a very full bodied experience. I'm obsessed, if you can't tell.

This experience made me realize that -- while third wave coffees are fun and interesting to brew -- I really don't know where to get a really good and well balanced medium roast here. Most roasters do either quite bright, or very dark with not much in-between. I long for the middle ground. Any suggestions?

1fycfxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1fycfxf/what_do_i_do_about_this_bully/,what do i do about this bully?,"
I‚Äôve (f 18) been working at a small bakery for over a year now, and I have been given consistent signs that the owners aunty (f 60) is engaging in bullying behaviours when it comes to. 

there‚Äôs two shops to the bakery, with our smaller one in a more populated part of the area, which is the one she works in and the one i learnt in, so i‚Äôm more comfortable with it. she only came after about 6 months of me working there, however i feel like i‚Äôm consistently on egg shells whenever she‚Äôs around. 

some shifts she goes out the back to our stairs and sits on her phone, on call with her husband talking badly about me in vietnamese, to which i can understand enough to know what she‚Äôs saying. i‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs easier to ask her to make coffees or sandwiches, especially if i need to continue to serve, however if it‚Äôs busy and she‚Äôs serving, i‚Äôll begin making whatever is needed. 

we‚Äôve never had complaints about my coffees, and when im rostered at our bigger store it‚Äôs never been an issue that i make coffees or sandwiches; however recently it‚Äôs been getting worse. 

on a recent shift, we were both with another lady (f 40) who i‚Äôve been close with since i was young, and who mentored me when i first started at the bakery, showing me where everything is - who knows the extent of my abilities and how much i love my job. on this shift however, the aunty began getting physical with me and would force herself between me and either the coffee machine, or the sandwich bar - and at one point, thought it was okay to slap my hands rather harshly in front of some of our customers. 

at one point, i was making a coffee for one of our regulars, in particular, my favourite one, and i did it differently to how she would have - so she tipped the entire cup out and went over to the regular to tell him that i didn‚Äôt make it right and i needed to do it again - to which he looked at me confused and so i just remade it, to which he told me it was a totally fine coffee. 

i also overheard her, and then was told by the other lady working with us that the aunty was going on about how i can‚Äôt make anything and i‚Äôm only good for serving - which isn‚Äôt true and has been disproven many times. 

however, today i had a shift at our bigger store where the boss came in to assist with making our pastries, and every time i made a coffee, he would come and check and remind me about the desired time it had to pour - although it‚Äôs never been an issue before, and i‚Äôve made plenty of coffees in my lifetime as i worked at cafe for 3 years before i started at the bakery. it also became apparent to one of the other co workers there, who i often joke around with, that i was asking him for assistance with basic tasks that i‚Äôve done millions of times before - as he not only questioned me as i left, but sent me a message too. 

i can‚Äôt help but feel insecure, but i also don‚Äôt know how to approach it considering the bullying behaviour is coming from my bosses aunty. i really love my job and the people i work with, and it‚Äôs becoming noticeable that i‚Äôm losing my love for it. i can always send a message, but i don‚Äôt know how to approach it, as this is the first time ive dealt with something like this in the workplace - and considering how close viet families are, that doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety. 

at this point, i don‚Äôt even know if i should bring it up as I leave for university in Feb, and i can just endure it for a few more months - but id rather not, ive got enough stress with my HSC and university approaching. 

any advice is helpful, honestly. 

tldr; my bosses aunty is bullying me at work and im not sure how to bring it up to him.

I just want to start by saying thanks to all the folks who were kind in the comments on that post. You may have been able to tell, but I was spiraling. Embarrassingly, I spiraled a little in the comments as well. On the advice of my amazing partner, I stepped away from the post and didn‚Äôt come back to it until this past week to really process the whole thing, and I‚Äôm glad I did.

1.) My friend‚Äôs anger is justified, but misplaced. My instinct should have been to empathize, not to defend myself or even to try to redirect the anger, not at first. That was a failure on my part. Empathy should always come first.¬†

2.) I have a LOT of internalized guilt over my salary. I grew up in an absolute shithole trailer park in south Florida, the textbook definition of white trash. I had one goal my entire life: to make sure that I never felt that kind of poverty again. I feel in love with academia during my undergrad in Tampa, and decided a finance PhD would help me earn the most money while also letting me work in academia, the first place I ever really felt at home. I know what it‚Äôs like to be desperately poor, and now that I‚Äôm not that anymore, being well-off feels like a betrayal of some part of my core identity. I need to explore this more in therapy, because there's still a hint of an inferiority complex there which got SERIOUSLY inflamed by this whole thing with my colleague.¬†

3.) A lot of people in this sub subscribe to the Labor Theory of Value. This is equal parts unexpected and unsurprising, but kind of threw me a little bit. I got very distracted by those conversations in an unproductive way, but I think I understand the position of people who disagree with me a little more. There are always going to be folks who believe professors of every discipline should earn the same amount, despite all other factors, and reasonable people can disagree on that. What we can all likely agree on is that a 100% pay differential is probably too much. The tricky question is one I leave to my colleagues over in economics and philosophy: how much of a pay gap is ""fair?""

Ok, the update. It‚Äôs a mostly good one.¬†

Unbeknownst to me, my partner and my colleague‚Äôs partner had been doing a little back-channeling. Turns out my colleague had been feeling embarrassed about her reaction (the mean comments she made about my scholarship and teaching, telling people my salary, other stuff I didn't mention but that's not worth relitigating), but was too mad about the wage gap to apologize. I mean, to put it bluntly, she thought she'd blown up the friendship beyond repair and didn't even want to bother apologizing because in her mind, it wouldn't have made a difference because there was no coming back from some of the stuff she said (I didn't detail fully what exactly went down, but suffice it to say I could understand why she would think that).

You all were somewhat hard on my partner for insisting that I fix things, but I really need to give her the lion's share of credit here, because thanks to her backchanneling, things worked out.

What happened was, on the advice of my partner and my colleague's partner, I arranged to ""bump into"" my colleague last Friday during her post office-hours coffee run. I was set up grading exams in the coffee shop we both frequent and when I saw her, I waved enthusiastically and motioned her over. She looked pretty nervous, but I started out with a big apology for not being more supportive, and explained that I was just taken aback by (a) how stark the wage gap was and (b) the strength of her reaction that I wasn't as supportive in the moment as I should have been, and that I wish I would have been a better friend for her then.

She took my apology really well, and then apologized for the mean stuff she said and for telling other people my salary (and the other stuff). I told her she shouldn't apologize for telling people my salary, and that we should all be talking more about our salaries to improve transparency. I repeated what a lot of you all said that, were we at public universities, this would all be public information, which she agreed with. She was really, really upset with herself for the stuff she said about my scholarship and teaching and really went above and beyond on trying to make that part right, which I really appreciated.

We didn't talk long because she had to get back to another meeting, but we are back to texting regularly, and we have a meeting set for this week to talk about starting an internal spreadsheet we all share with all faculty (and maybe staff? still trying to figure that out) of all of our pay so that we can improve transparency and make the egregious pay difference between us all a little more transparent. Overall, I feel pretty good about how things ended up.

On the other hand, this has forced me to think about what it means now to be in the B-school and be friends with folks in schools that are paid way less. Some of you said ""colleagues are not friends"" and I don't agree with that. That doesn't align with my personal values, and I refuse to live that way. I'd rather navigate the messiness of it all than to keep my colleagues at some arbitrary distance just because they're colleagues. Some of you said that people in the B-school can't be friends with people outside the B-school, and I don't agree with that either. Friendships are not deterministic based on how much you earn, at least not for normal, well-adjusted people. I've also decided that my hyperfocus on the critical comments rather than the overwhelming majority of people who said this was an overreaction and no my fault is valuable insight into myself that I need to think about some more, and the ease with which I'm baited into behaving unreasonably. Anyway, really nice resolution to a tough situation.

**He slept at his friend‚Äôs place and just gave her his bed and apt for the night, so they weren‚Äôt under the same roof or in bed together** 

He  (m/33) says they say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù platonically and that he loves her (f/35) but is no longer in love with her. The thing is, they were together for 8 years and engaged til they split up only a 2 years ago. They‚Äôve been in contact since, they never stopped keeping in touch, only lessened the frequency. Never went no contact. They share custody of a pets and have many mutual friends She lives 2 hours away.

Last year he said he wasn't over her yet, so we began dating in the summer when he said he finally was and the tension was building between us.

They go into town to bring each other the pets for shared custody. Last time she was in town, she arrived at 2am, because 1 of their dogs had been cleared for surgery ‚Ä¶ and she was bringing the dog to my ex and she had a bunch of gear in her car. She was staying at her friend‚Äôs place about 25 minute drive from my boyfriend‚Äôs place. Her friend has a huge dog, so she couldn‚Äôt spend the night there with their tiny, sick dog. 

She told my boyfriend  that she‚Äôd need his help at 2am to bring the dog in since the dog gets hyper. And she‚Äôll be super tired once she stops for the hand off and just wants to crash at his place. He said yes. She offered to sleep on the couch and he rejected it. I was trying to brainstorm ways to make the handoff/situation easier for everyone (ie. lockbox, etc), and when I did, he said ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôll call her to ask‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then he‚Äôd message or call me back to say it won‚Äôt work for her, and that she needs his help when she arrives. I let him know I felt really uncomfortable with it, and he understood. 

So she spent the first night, as of 2am that night, at my boyfriend‚Äôs place with the small dog so the dog wouldn‚Äôt be too confused‚Ä¶ and because she was too tired to drive the extra 25 mins to her friend‚Äôs place. So she slept in my boyfriend‚Äôs bed, while he crashed on the couch of his friend who lives nearby. He texted and called me when he walked home. He went over in the morning, the ex left for her friend‚Äôs place 25 mins away. 

My boyfriend was so exhausted the next day, he canceled plans to have coffee with her and they rain checked for the next time she‚Äôs in town. According to him, she knows about me. 

Thoughts? What should I do, break up with him or talk to him or her about this, and if so - how? 

TL;DR: my (F/37) new bf (m/33) has shared custody of pets with his his ex-fianc√©e (f/35) and he let her stay over at his place after she drove 2 hrs to be in town to bring 1 of their dogs to him, and insisted he stay up til 2am on a work night to help her. He crashed on his friend‚Äôs couch nearby while his ex slept in his bed with their dog. he can‚Äôt set boundaries with her, and they even still say ‚Äúi love you‚Äù to each other but he says it‚Äôs platonic.

It probably has the best transportation system, has good job opportunities, and is the only truly ""international"" city in Italy.

Also:

* The historical center is very beautiful.
* The Sempione park and a few neighborhoods such as Brera are very nice.
* The modern new architecture of Porta Nuova and City life is very cool too.

HOWEVER, the rest of the city is ugly:

* That post WWII architecture with grey buildings everywhere, glued one after the another, is depressing.
* Residential buildings facades look dirty.
* The city is riddled with graffiti everywhere, even in affluent neighborhoods.
* Gardens and piazzas are very badly maintained.
* Sidewalks seem like they were built by people with no skills or desire to do it right.
* Trash everywhere on the ground. Italians specifically litter with cigarette butts, cigarette packages, supermarket tickets, etc. Immigrants throw away coffee cups, beer bottles, etc.
* The Milanesi leave their dog shit on the streets. They will just collect it if someone is near by.

If you go to cities such as Z√ºrich, M√ºnich, and Viena, they are much more beautiful and clean overall. To me the main difference is the architecture that is more pleasing to the eye. I felt depressing walking around Milan (excluding the places I mentioned above), whereas it's so pleasing to walk around Z√ºrich, with the exception of the Langstrasse.

Anyway, is it just me that thinks Milan is ugly? **This is not a Milan hating post**, just an opinion on the general aesthetics of Milan. If it was possible, I would torn down these post-WWII buildings and rebuilt following a classical inspiration from the historical center and a modern look just like City Life and Porta Nuova.",10,1728319391.0,milano,20,0.59,False

It‚Äôs partly because of coffee on a mostly empty stomach. Even acknowledging and writing that down tempered the feeling immediately, and is why I put the word anxious in quotes. I have a specific desire in writing this, to feel better, and I know how to get there, by being incredibly specific in my word choices.
   
   
 I‚Äôm waiting to hear back about a job. (I learned approximately 30 minutes later I didn‚Äôt get it.) I‚Äôve managed to back myself into another corner, and if I don‚Äôt get the job (for what would certainly be some left-field universe nut-kicking-me reason) I‚Äôm staring down the prospect of taking literally anything that hires immediately. I‚Äôve done that and ran that experiment in the past, and I have little faith if I found myself on a production line that I would last any longer than the 2 and half days I did back then.
   
   
 I had what felt like 2 good interviews. I‚Äôm not a pie-in-the-sky type who pretends things went better than they did, nor would I discount any particularly egregious missteps or misspeaking. I had a couple decent conversations with people of what appeared to be similar dispositions for roles I‚Äôm told they are fairly ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to fill. I have the credentials and experience, a friend already works there, and I‚Äôve patiently and professionally navigated an initial red flag where my second interviewer didn‚Äôt notice or show up for our first meeting.
   
   
 The pause, doubt, and pain of the waiting game is tied directly to the amount of debt I‚Äôve gotten into. It‚Äôs tied to my 2 or 3 failed attempts to get other roles or even volunteer in similar social work roles. One for certain fell apart for small-town political reasons, and I suspect another did as well. I‚Äôm one of those people who, on paper, should not have the kinds of ‚Äúproblems‚Äù or type of ‚Äúfinancial insecurity‚Äù that I do.
   
   
 It‚Äôs all self-imposed. I leave secure work environments when they start to degrade my sense of responsibility to values and standards. I‚Äôve broken the dam of self-indulgence and being conservative in my spending. I‚Äôve made bets on my ideals in starting the counseling nonprofit, LLC before that, and attempts to hire people to get them to a sustainable place. I sometimes talk about myself like, ‚ÄúIf I could just shut up and deal, relearn how to eat time playing video games instead of leaving the house, go back to eating nothing but hotdogs and ramen for a year like in college, and just ‚Äòbe normal,‚Äô I‚Äôd have my bills paid years in advance, all kinds of insurance, and the money to modestly explore my hobbies.‚Äù
   
   
 What happens instead, is I experience too many of these heightened moments back-to-back. I find myself in a chronic state of stress as the boiling frog water inches towards cooked. I find it nearly impossible to justify any given moment of my day. I play in the dramatic and despotic dialogues of colleagues who all have their take on why they‚Äôre stuck dealing with the inadequate support, pay, or basic dignity.
   
   
 I am properly exhausted by a ‚Äúlook on the bright side‚Äù or ‚Äúof course they‚Äôll hire you!‚Äù narratives. Anything that smells of hope is extremely off-putting. Anything that tries to matter-of-factly describe my potential or worth is off the table. Any remotely positive impression I get from someone I haven‚Äôt known for longer than an hour is beyond suspect. So much of my interactions contribute to this deep and gaping hole at the heart of my ability to trust things that ‚Äúshould‚Äù go a certain way, ever will.
   
   
 I‚Äôm not the first person to complain about job hunting. I‚Äôm not on the verge of being homeless. I‚Äôm not interested in making a dozen qualifying statements about my privileges and options.
   
   
 I want to fit. I just want to fit. I think it‚Äôs incredibly stupid to exist in this society that‚Äôs constantly swinging from crazy presumptive talking point to the next, bastardizing all language, and pulling up drawbridges after our luck nets the right status. I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice every waking minute of my life with thoughts consumed by work for the hour or 2 a month to myself or 2 weeks vacation. I don‚Äôt want to keep playing dress-up as though there aren‚Äôt sincere and capable ways we could be using resources and rewarding those with the capacity to efficiently execute the task.
   
   
 I‚Äôm so fucking angry, all the time. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many fun things I go to. It doesn‚Äôt matter how creative I get with a woodworking project or song. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I write. I‚Äôm so. fucking. angry.
   
   
 I can learn how to incorporate abuses from the past. I can swallow all kind of logistic shit when it comes to trying something new or coordinating with someone. I can stomach the darkness and ambivalence of life broadly. I‚Äôve never been able to drop my fundamental anger. I know that because when the ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of circumstances highlight the details and history that inform the anger, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the helpless child getting wailed on growing up all over again.
   
   
 And it‚Äôs fucking STUPID. Nothing should be this hard or complicated, and it‚Äôs not. If we actually gave a fuck, it would not be this hard and stupid. It doesn‚Äôt need to be some series of abstract parables passed down through time. It doesn‚Äôt need to be abstracted economic equations pretending at bottom there‚Äôs rational actors with perfect information. We don‚Äôt have to celebrate greed. We don‚Äôt have to cross our fingers fascism versus any alternative isn‚Äôt a ‚Äútoss up.‚Äù We don‚Äôt have to do any of the shit that makes it so we all suffer the same shit, but a handful complain about it, and the rest try to get them to shut up and deal like they are.
   
   
 The point is, you‚Äôre not dealing. You‚Äôre not dealing any better than I am. 48.5 million Americans battled a substance use disorder in the past year. That‚Äôs 16.7% of the population, or close to 1 in 5 if you consider how many people hide and pretend. That means whether it is you, or someone in your family, everyone is chronically coping in a series of unhealthy ways that permeate through families and work environments. What if a fifth of your body didn‚Äôt work? Or your brain? Or the words you use? Every fifth one just drops or confuses and steers the conversation awry. 41.9% of Americans are obese. Almost half are not the type to take the stairs, let alone entertain the vicissitudes of class struggle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù don‚Äôt have the inclination or headspace to even google ‚Äúvicissitudes.‚Äù
   
   
 I feel like a fucking joke and failure. Not because I actually am, but because I suffer my idealism and let that shit play out in dramatic ways when it comes to accounting for practical shit. I could‚Äôve worked harder to find something remote and paying even peanuts. I could‚Äôve looked harder for something part-time. I could‚Äôve leaned into efforts advertising and side-hustling. These are the thoughts you can suffocate under as though you didn‚Äôt have reasons and feelings and obligations every moment you weren‚Äôt attending to fixing the latest issue.
   
   
 I‚Äôm constantly trying to remind myself and others that it‚Äôs never ‚Äúeither/or.‚Äù No situation is all bad or good. No decisions come without strings. No moment can you confidently claim the sum total of knowledge and potential about it. Those are brute facts that should temper any enthusiasm for belaboring the worst version of the story you tell yourself. I still don‚Äôt know shit, and never will. I‚Äôve made long-term friends from ‚Äúbad‚Äù work environments. I‚Äôve gained perspective and demonstrated persistent resilience. I‚Äôd rather have money and hopes not consistently betrayed.

On Friday I broke company-issued Macbook air #2 (I've worked at this company for less than a year). The first time, I spilled coffee in my bag while commuting. This time, my gremlin cat actually BIT the edge of the screen and managed to wipe out the display.

I am clumsy and can't be relied upon to guard my device with my life 24/7. I travel a lot so keeping it docked in one place at all times isn't an option.   
  
I need a case that wraps around the outside and inside and doesn't budge. Those little silicone keyboard protectors don't work for me, I just lose them. I'm assuming a simple screen protector isn't cat bite-proof.

Does anyone have any recommendations for the otter-box of Macbook protectors?",0,1728319257.0,macbook,1,0.5,False

narayana ke reviews ke baare me sure nahi hu, kuch log accha bol rahe hain, kuch bura. aaj gaya tha main, and thoda jaan liya. ek sawaal: ye nsat se hota kya hain? easy sa paper hain, website pe likha tha ki bahut scholarship mil sakti hain. ye log keh rahe hain ki sirf boards result par scholarship milti hain. thoda confused hun. nsat se kuch hota bhi hain ki nahi samajh nahi aa raha. entrance exam ki baat hui hain (unka khudka) par kuch logo ne kaha ki it's only a formality and anyone can get in.

i know ki vo log 6th ya 7th se padhne vale baccho ko prefer karte hain, par mere basics acche hain. physics aur math badhiya hain (11th/12th ka (math aur physics tournaments me calculus aur discrete rounds me badhiya score aate he.)). in subjects mein hamesha interest raha hain, aur bahut explore bhi kar chuka hoon. kuch knowledge gaps hain, par thik hain. 

considering this ki mere basics badhiya hain (jee level ke saval jyadatar nahi kiye, kabhi koi log yaha pe ya discord me bhejte hain, toh karne ki koshish karta hu), kya mujhe narayana join karna chahiye? mere kuch aur extracurriculars bhi hain jinpe main focus karna chahta hu. abhi main coffee pike pura din kar leta hoon, par narayana ke baad pata nahi. agar koi narayana bangalore gaya hain to pls dm karo. 

tldr (all my questions)  
1) whats the nsat all about?  
2) is it worth it to join narayana?  
3) is it possible to maintain other activities along with narayana?

Not trying to burn and churn here but SUBs have been a major focus for me and led me to expand my wallet quite a bit. When I started building out my credit 12 or so years ago, I was strictly cash back but now I am 100% awards travel. I used to just have an Amex BCE, C1 SavorOne, Chase Freedom, and Chase Freedom Unlimited.

Now, having moved to an awards travel strategy, all of those other cards fit into this usage below, however, BCE is pretty much useless. I don't use it at all but it is my oldest credit account and I'd hate for it to get closed from inactivity. Aside from the suggestion to just swipe it for something stupid each month, any real suggestions as to what I could do here? Does anyone see an area I could PC the card to something useful in the Amex Ecosystem (if that is even an option)?



My current cards and how I use them:  
Amex  
Amex Gold - Dining, Takeout, Groceries (currently on hold with groceries) - Spend over $40K/yr on dining. Also utilize all credits every month without work.

Amex Plat - Misc Purchases that I want protection on, all flights, spend about $35K/yr on flights. Also utilize all benefits each year

  
Capital One

Venture X - All Hotels & Car Rentals go on here. We have no brand loyalty to hotel chains so the 10x are worth it and we always get price match. This is also my 2x Catchall

SavorOne - Ubers are huge right now but we will see what happens next month. Like $200/mo goes on just that. I also sometimes default to this card if they don't accept Amex at a restaurant but currently giving a little love to Chase for United Transfers. I transfer all CB on this card to Miles on Venture X

  
Chase

Chase Freedom OG - I just use the 5x cats that rotate

Chase Freedom Unlimited - Basically just Walgreens and CVS now, my 3rd oldest card from back in the day, used to be my catchall before Venture X

Chase Freedom Flex - Opened solely because of intro 10x groceries for 1 year and then the 5x cat

CSP - Hit the Sub, Lyfts for 5x through March (hope they renew), I diversify my dining spend from time to time just to get the card some usage but the entire point of this card is to be used as an engine to get UR from Chase to United. I often book flights with Amex Plat direct with United and then transfer UR points from Chase out to upgrade the flight to Polaris (done this 2x now and waitlisted on a third).





Open to any thoughts to keep this Amex slot alive on my credit history but understand if I need to just suck it up and put a coffee on it a couple times a month.

Thought I'd post because this sub has been really useful - and because I used a bit of an unusual technique to handle the nerves, which may be helpful for anyone out there who has anxiety or just needs a bit more self-belief.

...I've been listening to a self-hypnosis recording at bedtime. Intermittently while I was learning, and most nights in the week running up to the test. I lay on the bed and listened once more this morning before my instructor picked me up and was very calm. Without it,  I think I would have got frantically stressed out. The recording I used was Mark Tyrell, Pass Your Driving Test. 

Also, had the legendary banana:) switched my usual strong coffee for decaf. Plus I  made a bit of extra effort with my clothes, makeup and hair so I felt properly put together.

I was totally relaxed and drove perfectly in the lesson before my test. The test itself was a bit less smooth to say the least, but I was totally focused and didn't sweat the small stuff so the examiner could tell that i was basically a safe, competent driver.

Hope this helps! Good luck to you all.

there‚Äôs two shops to the bakery, with our smaller one in a more populated part of the area, which is the one she works in and the one i learnt in, so i‚Äôm more comfortable with it. she only came after about 6 months of me working there, however i feel like i‚Äôm consistently on egg shells whenever she‚Äôs around. 

some shifts she goes out the back to our stairs and sits on her phone, on call with her husband talking badly about me in vietnamese, to which i can understand enough to know what she‚Äôs saying. i‚Äôve learnt that it‚Äôs easier to ask her to make coffees or sandwiches, especially if i need to continue to serve, however if it‚Äôs busy and she‚Äôs serving, i‚Äôll begin making whatever is needed. 

we‚Äôve never had complaints about my coffees, and when im rostered at our bigger store it‚Äôs never been an issue that i make coffees or sandwiches; however recently it‚Äôs been getting worse. 

on a recent shift, we were both with another lady (f 40) who i‚Äôve been close with since i was young, and who mentored me when i first started at the bakery, showing me where everything is - who knows the extent of my abilities and how much i love my job. on this shift however, the aunty began getting physical with me and would force herself between me and either the coffee machine, or the sandwich bar - and at one point, thought it was okay to slap my hands rather harshly in front of some of our customers. 

at one point, i was making a coffee for one of our regulars, in particular, my favourite one, and i did it differently to how she would have - so she tipped the entire cup out and went over to the regular to tell him that i didn‚Äôt make it right and i needed to do it again - to which he looked at me confused and so i just remade it, to which he told me it was a totally fine coffee. 

i also overheard her, and then was told by the other lady working with us that the aunty was going on about how i can‚Äôt make anything and i‚Äôm only good for serving - which isn‚Äôt true and has been disproven many times. 

however, today i had a shift at our bigger store where the boss came in to assist with making our pastries, and every time i made a coffee, he would come and check and remind me about the desired time it had to pour - although it‚Äôs never been an issue before, and i‚Äôve made plenty of coffees in my lifetime as i worked at cafe for 3 years before i started at the bakery. it also became apparent to one of the other co workers there, who i often joke around with, that i was asking him for assistance with basic tasks that i‚Äôve done millions of times before - as he not only questioned me as i left, but sent me a message too. 

i can‚Äôt help but feel insecure, but i also don‚Äôt know how to approach it considering the bullying behaviour is coming from my bosses aunty. i really love my job and the people i work with, and it‚Äôs becoming noticeable that i‚Äôm losing my love for it. i can always send a message, but i don‚Äôt know how to approach it, as this is the first time ive dealt with something like this in the workplace - and considering how close viet families are, that doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety. 

at this point, i don‚Äôt even know if i should bring it up as I leave for university in Feb, and i can just endure it for a few more months - but id rather not, ive got enough stress with my HSC and university approaching. 

any advice is helpful, honestly.

Okay, I know this story is going to sound really dumb but I promise, this is 100% true. The names and places have been changed for privacy, but everything else happened exactly as I‚Äôm about to describe. It‚Äôs easily the weirdest, dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced, and I still don‚Äôt have an explanation for it.

It was fall in 2012. My roommate, Ellen, and I were staying in a borrowed house near a small, quiet town in Montana. At the time, we were both working part-time for a local organization connected to a community of Seventh-day Adventists. When the homeowners went out of state, they generously offered to let us stay in their house while they were away.

The house itself was cozy‚Äîsingle-story, ranch-style, with a back entrance that led right into the kitchen. Ellen and I made ourselves comfortable, settling in and learning the quirks of the place. But almost right away, things felt a little *off*. Not spooky, just... strange.

See, Adventists are known for having strict religious guidelines, especially when it comes to things like avoiding anything considered occult or ‚Äúworldly.‚Äù So you can imagine our surprise when we started finding items around the house that made no sense for devout Adventists to own. In the living room, there were Native American dream catchers hanging from the ceiling and small totem carvings on display. But Ellen really didn't like the Masonic Bible we found in the drawers of their coffee table. It had their rules or whatever at the beginning and I think it said something about the guy's rank.

Now, personally, I‚Äôm not superstitious at all. I‚Äôm fine with dream catchers, totems, and I didn‚Äôt really care about Masons. But Ellen‚Äîwho had grown up in a deeply religious Adventist family and shared their strong beliefs‚Äîwas immediately suspicious. It wasn‚Äôt that the objects themselves were *bad*, but in the context of an Adventist household, they were kind of a red flag. Adventists just don't usually have that kind of stuff, but we brushed it off and continued with our lives.

One afternoon, Ellen asked me if I had seen the house pair of scissors. They were large, metal, and perfect for any project, so we were both surprised that they had seemingly vanished. We turned the house upside down, checking every drawer and cabinet, but they were gone. Eventually, we gave up and moved on.

The very next day, we came home from running errands. We walked through the back door into the kitchen, like we always did, and that‚Äôs when we saw it.

The scissors.

Not just lying on the counter, though. They were *balanced*‚Äîwith the handle hanging off the counter, the blades not even touching the surface. They were somehow resting on a single focal point in the middle of the scissors, like a seesaw. It defied gravity in the weirdest way. It made no sense. They should have fallen. The whole thing seemed impossible.

Ellen looked at me and rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOkay, *very* funny,‚Äù she said.

I had no idea what she was talking about. I thought she had put them there, trying to mess with me. But the more I laughed it off, the more serious she got. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this,‚Äù she said with complete sincerity.

Now, I don‚Äôt consider myself a paranoid person, but I had just finished a gig teaching self-defense classes, so my immediate reaction was to secure the house. I grabbed a heavy fireplace poker and started checking closets, under beds, and every corner that could hide a person or... something else. Nothing. There was no sign anyone had been in the house except for us.

Once I felt certain we were alone, I went back to the scissors. I moved them, trying to recreate the position they had been in, to see if maybe it was some kind of fluke. But no matter how carefully I tried, I couldn‚Äôt get them to balance the way we had found them.

Finally, I turned to Ellen and half-joked, ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs a demon?‚Äù Her eyes widened, and she immediately threw up her hands. ‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt say that!‚Äù I laughed and kept teasing her, but she refused to entertain the idea and left the room.

Months later, Ellen moved out to take on a new role. I was alone in the house, packing up for the next day. It was dark, and the stillness of being by myself started to gnaw at me. The whole mood of the place felt different. I had some music on to break the silence, but even that started glitching. I felt a rising sense of unease, as if the house was suddenly aware of me. There were a couple of moments where I could have sworn my stuff was moving from where I'd set it down‚Äîbut I told myself it was just nerves.

The thing is, even after all these years, Ellen still swears up and down that she didn‚Äôt put those scissors there. And I know I didn‚Äôt either.

To this day, I have no explanation. If it was a prank, by whom? If it was a ghost or demon, balancing scissors? Really? If it was just chance, how? Why? Was it somehow connected to all those strange items we found? Had we missed something even stranger?

So, what do you think? Dumbest haunting ever? I‚Äôd love to hear some theories.

**edited to add tl;dr:** My roommate and I couldn‚Äôt find our scissors one day, only to come home the next and find them *perfectly balanced* on the edge of the kitchen counter in a way that seemed physically impossible. Neither of us put them there, and no one else was in the house. Years later, we still have no explanation for how they got there or why.

And here are the infamous scissors. This picture was taken and shared on the same day we found them *just like this*, back in 2012:

1fybygf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedMethodistChurch/comments/1fybygf/weird_experience_at_a_a_newcomers_meeting/,Weird experience at a a newcomer's meeting,"My husband and I went to this newcomer's gathering before church yesterday. It was called ""Coffee with the clergy."" I was advertised as just chatting with the clergy and getting to know each other.  However, it was a pretty negative experience. It felt more like the minister running it just wanted a checklist of who needs baptizing. His questions seemed to be focused on that and joining the church.  I've only been 3 times and just wanted more information.  

There were only two couples there. Me and my husband are a gay couple with no kids. My question was mainly about the Methodist split and same-sex marriage. I think that's a legitimate question to ask if we are a gay couple and looking for church, however the minister seemed to skirt around my question and didn't really answer it.  He also cut us off when we were telling about ourselves. I noticed he didn't do this with the other couple. It make me feel like they valued the other couple more bc they were more normal church goers and sorta of ignored us bc we were different. Maybe that's not what happened, but it's exactly what it felt like.  White couple with kids vs a gay interracial couple with cats.

It left me feeling really weird and if going to this church was a good idea.  The main minister there is very nice. The church also has on their main website that they embrace everyone regardless of sexual orientation, so I don't understand this whole interaction the other day.  This main who was at the meeting was the assistant pastor who was older. 

I've been really struggling with what happened and didn't really know where to go to discuss this or get answers.  I would message the main minister, but I've found in the past that rocking the boat any at all in a church just leads to trouble.

Life is not going very well, and I don't feel like there's anything to celebrate right now. I told my friends that if they'd like, they could get me a gift, but a party is off the table and to NOT throw me a surprise birthday party. First off, I hate surprises. Second, I don't want a party, I don't want to be ""celebrated"" and if a party was thrown for me, that obviously wouldn't be for me as it goes against what I want. Third, if my friends insisted on disrespecting that, I'm too much of a people pleaser to stand up for myself. I'd probably stay at the party feeling shitty so I wouldn't ruin anyone's mood.

Most years my friends forget my birthday, and I'm lucky if I even get a text, so this is not something I'm usually concerned about. This year, for some reason, a friend I made in uni texted me asking when my birthday was. I told her when it was and restated that I didn't want any surprises. She told me she just wanted to invite me over to give me a gift. I had a bad feeling about this, as she's never done anything for my birthday since we met a few years back. Yesterday, she texted me asking what kind of food I like, what are my favorite colors and that she's so excited about what she's planning. I texted her that I did not want a party. She told me to chill out, that she was just planning a small get-together with her best friend and her best friend's boyfriend. I left her on read and I don't know what to do. I clearly told her multiple times I don't want any surprises or any sort of party/gathering to celebrate me/my birthday. I find it disrespectful she'd go behind my back and text people and plan something that's obviously not going to be for me at all. 

And top of that, every time I've hung out with them, I'm the only one sober. They drink, vape, and smoke weed, none of which I do, and I'm fine with that but not when every time I'm invited somewhere I become the designated ""drunk girl minder"" because I won't partake. I will literally bet money that if I do show up to her house on my birthday, they'll get drunk and high and instead of being celebrated, I'll be holding someone's hair while they hug the toilet. But the point is, I don't want a party period. If they wanted to celebrate me or make me feel appreciated, I'd rather they actually be present and there for me during the other 364 days of the year. 

I hate having to beg people to respect my boundaries, but I just feel like she doesn't have my best interests in mind, or else she would've planned something lowkey like coffee if she really just wanted to treat me. I do feel like I'd be the asshole for asking people to not celebrate me, like I'm taking some sort of right away. But then again, this year's been awful, and I feel most of my friends don't genuinely care about me anyway, so what's the point of putting on a fa√ßade? I don't know what to do or how to feel, I just want to be left alone, just like any other day.

Like even when I‚Äôm in social events half the time I‚Äôm not even hungry and I‚Äôm STILL eating. What am I doing wrong?? I fast a lot, and even when I‚Äôm not hungry during the fast I still reach for those chips or those snacks. I feel like it‚Äôs what I use to cure my boredom; having different tastes and yummy flavors in your mouth I have been hitting my protein goals and have been eating healthy bc when I allow myself that sweet treat i binge so it‚Äôs better off not to have them in range. also Like when I get food I feel like I inhale it. Or when I study at a coffee shop or get any drink in general I feel like I‚Äôm thinking how it‚Äôs there instead of focusing on my work and inhale my drinks. And idk what‚Äôs wrong with me help

Adam woke up the next day. He had a nightmare, but it was not as bad this time.¬† It had stopped before they killed the police officer. He sat in bed, looked at the wall, and pressed his knuckle at the spot. ‚ÄúNot today, today's a good day.‚Äù¬† Then he got up and got ready. It was six in the morning.¬† It was a habit from when he was a child. Get up and¬†make sure everybody is there, then use the few hours before they wake up to get the monsters out of his head. He managed to get those monsters out long¬†ago, but the habit stayed. Morning coffee in silence.

When he got to the administration office, he sat down and turned on the screen, then checked the report.

Last night had been strange. Jork and Mirker had greeted the new family, and the girls had immediately taken to Mirker, but he didn‚Äôt like the attention and hid. The funny part had been how Mirker had treated him. At first, he was really upset with him, refusing to look at him and deliberately looking away when Adam had talked to him.¬† Then suddenly, he cried and ran over to hug him, and Adam had to hold him until he fell asleep. Jork said he had always asked about him when he was away. He really started to love the little one. The students had asked for a meeting today to discuss what they had found out. The farms had managed to plant seeds in the first dome, and he had seen saplings there. The plan was to make the second dome into more of a forest, trying out different trees, flowers, and bushes. Even if the planet didn‚Äôt go green, they had managed to start growing things.

The biggest shock was Jork‚Äôs new army of droids. Now he had twenty maid droids moving around, taking care of everyone's needs. Apparently, he found the maid's blueprint and built a 3D printer that could build them; then he hacked it, so Adam‚Äôs permission for five droids turned into 500. He officially blamed it on a bad copy of the blueprint program. He had also managed to build five speeders. Adam was glad the base had a garage, but he had to tell Jork that he could not copy more Speeders as they might be fined for abusing the copyrights.¬† Jork had sworn he would not copy any more speeders, and Adam had a feeling he would regret not asking more about Jork's other projects, which he apparently had a lot of.¬†

He was lost in thought when he noticed four children walked in and sat down at different desks. They all had a cup of juice and some food. Kywar nodded to him. ‚ÄúMorning, sir, just getting the morning scan runs done.¬† We won't make too much noise.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo music today? Damnit, "" one of the Wossier kids said, and Adam sipped his coffee and walked over to them.

‚ÄúSo, what are you checking today? Music is okay as long as it's not too loud.‚Äù The kid grinned and turned on the music, which wasn‚Äôt too bad, as Kywar explained today's missions. They had ten places to scan, and after that, according to Vorts and Jork, they had an hour of¬†free time to play with the drones. It wasn‚Äôt a bad idea, and the kids seemed to like it, so he told them to carry on as he went to check the updates.¬† The problem was always the same. No nitrogen. He needed that, or it all would be pointless. Without it, the plants would not grow. The kids worked quickly, and he could hear Kywar telling Bendy, the Wossir kid, to do a proper job, or they would not be allowed to come tomorrow. When Vorts and Jork arrived, they walked over to him.

‚ÄúIf what my brother-in-law said is correct, then I am humbly asking that my wife and me to be allowed to join your clan when we are freed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI humble ask that my son would be allowed to join your clan.‚Äù

Adam looked between them. ‚ÄúNo! You're not waiting until you're freed; I accept you now. If you ask, then I humbly accept. Having you both in my clan would be a great honor.‚Äù Adam replied as he stood up and placed his hand on their shoulder. ‚ÄúYou are¬†part of this world just as much as I am.‚Äù

Both men looked at him, Jork with tears and Vorts with a genuine smile, all of them not noticing the small ears that heard everything.

‚ÄúSo let's get to work, okay? Later today, we can sign the paper and send it to get legally notarized. That way, you will have¬†clan protection in the eyes of the court. ‚Äú They both smiled and immediately went to work; Adam sat down and suddenly noticed Kywar standing next to him.

‚ÄúYes Kywar? What is it?‚Äù He ask as he could see the boy had a question.

‚ÄúWhy does being part of a clan give you more protection?‚Äù¬† He asked, and Adam tilted his head. The boy was smart for his age.

‚ÄúWell, if somebody comes here and tries¬†to steal somebody from the clan, then we can send out¬†distress and bounty on the kidnappers. If they are rescued before they reach the slave market, they will be returned here, and law enforcement will see it as a legal action. And it means that if you are freed from slavery, I, as the clan leader, is dutybound to make sure you have a place to live and food to eat.‚Äù¬† Adam could see the boy's mind working overtime.

‚ÄúSo its protection and a future home? Can anybody ask?‚Äù Kywar asked and Adam smiled.

‚ÄúYou are a little too young to ask. You have to be of legal age, but you don‚Äôt have to worry. You have a home and food as long as your parents stay here.‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúBut if they leave after the five years? Then we are on our own?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúWell, yes, but they won't leave empty-handed. They can even stay and just work if they want.‚Äù

Kywar nodded slowly and started to walk away, then stopped, turned, and looked at him as he ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Wrangler,‚Äù before taking a few steps and then running like crazy out the door. The other kids finished playing around with the drones and ran out as well, after saying their goodbyes.

¬†

Adam looked after them and¬†then went back to work. He small-talked with the two, getting the latest gossip.¬† The farmers were excited about the potential and seemed happy with the freedom they had been given. Adam had only given them some grass seeds and potato and carrot seeds to see if they could get it to work. All were growing.

The father of Jywar turned out to be a mechanic, so Jork had put him to work in the garage. They were working on a project, and Adam was not yet allowed to know what it was.¬† Adam told him they could continue as long as it would not blow up or use too many resources.¬† The Bylgyno couple were a teacher and farmer who also were a priest. ¬†He had asked for a room to hold sermons, and they had given him one; they had listened in, and he was open-minded, according to Jork. The Wossir fishers had been working on making one of the pools into an algae soup that they could later use for fish food.¬† Jork had also found the plots and started on the new large dome. It would take one month just to make. It was, after all, just a dome 5 km wide; the hard part was the foundation where all the cabling and plumbing was,¬†but they had already worked on it for a month. What the droids could do was amazing. Work 48 hours in one go, 1-hour recharge break, and back at it. It was almost a 3D printing building.¬† The dome would be big enough to build a small town inside, and he was planning to build a few; with double the number of droids, he would get one up monthly as long as he had the resources. He needed more drone ships. Two more would do the trick; he could spend five million on a¬†mining platform, which would attract unwanted attention. It would allow him to sell off some minerals, but again. Unwanted attention. Once he got a decent defence up, he could do it. He spent the time before lunch reviewing the different scans and¬†found a few things of interest. Then they went for lunch, and he took Mikar for a swim. The other kids wanted to join but had been told it was Adams's pool, which made Adam laugh and told them they were wrong. It was the community pool, and¬†everybody was allowed to use it for recreation; the two other pools were for research and food production. The hour in the pool was quite wild, and then when he left, Miker wanted to stay, so Hara took over as the babysitter.

He got himself cleaned up and headed to the student's wing as it was now called, and knocked at the door.

‚ÄúCome in Sir‚Äù Mir-ra said on the other side and he entered, finding the three students all working at their own research desk, there was a maid droid in the room with the 012 tag on the shoulder.  
  


‚ÄúI hope I'm not disturbing. And please forgive me for leaving you guys alone for such a long time. I had things to do, and then other things happened.‚Äù

Mir-ra laughed. The blue-skinned haran, who apparently was his lawyer's granddaughter, got up. She was elegantly dressed in white jeans-like pants and a blue top under a light reddish lab coat. They all seem to wear the same type of labcoat. ‚ÄúIt is your planet and your base. We are simply guests, so of course you are not disturbing.‚Äù

[Kinita Sumina](), the Sandorian, looked up from the holographic map of the tectonic plates and volcanoes. He wore grey cargo pants and a blue T-shirt with some alien text and logo under his lab coat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad I get to examine this planet; it's so interesting. It‚Äôs rare to have the opportunity to study this type of planet. I mean, we have increased the atmosphere, and the pressure of it affects the plates.‚Äù

The last one chuckled. [Ced-dry Miga]() wore a yellow jumpsuit over her plastic body and a blue belt, and like the other, she wore the lab coat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get him started. He just loves to get away from the university. He can't wait to graduate so we can explore unknown regions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I'm glad you all enjoyed it,‚Äù Adam replied as he looked around the room. ‚ÄúNow that you have spent a month here and explored the planet, what do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs going to fail.‚Äù Ced-dry replied; there was no malice or disdain in her voice, just a fact to be stated.

‚ÄúHey, be nice.‚Äù Kinita replied. ‚ÄúIt's not going to fail on all parts, its just never going to be a planet with life. All have to be in a dome, but you seem to have understood that considering your latest plan.‚Äù

Adam looked at Mir-ra. ‚ÄúYou agree with this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sadly. The planet doesn‚Äôt have Nitrogen. Without it, you can‚Äôt get the planet to grow properly, so forget about the¬†outdoor production of plants. ¬†There are a few other problems but they can all be fixed with spending resources, the nitrogen part is whats stopping you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, how much nitrogen do I need?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúBetween 4000 to 45000 trillion tons.‚Äú Ced-dry replied.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just for the atmosphere; add some more trillions for the ground.‚Äù Mir-ra added, and Adam whistled.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot, to much to buy.‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you got the planet cheap. There is nothing here to build on, and lots of minerals, so it would be¬†good for mining operations if it had been closer to the hub. Or if it had any really valuable minerals like Francium, Osmium, Hafnium, iridium or palladium. Heck even gold would make it valuable. We only seen small trace of it. ¬†Less then expected. ‚Äú Kinita explained. Adam nodded slowly to hide his smile.¬† Vorts and Jork had done a good job, maybe a too good job.

‚ÄúIf we found nitrogen we could make the planet breathable right?‚Äù He asked and Ced-dry seemed shocked.

‚Äú4000 trillion tons, where are you going to get that? And how are you going to transport it?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúFreeze it and use a tow line? Its in space so I don‚Äôt need to worry to much about the energy needed. I mean once we get it away from any major gravity pulls.‚Äù Adam replied, Ced-dry and Kinita laughed but Mir-ra watched him quietly.

‚ÄúYou can pull something on a tow through a hyperlane. That‚Äôs faster than light travel.‚Äù Ced-dry replied but Mir-ra tilted her head as she studied Adam.

‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt need to, he has already found it in the system. Haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù She asked him and Adam nodded.

There are two gas giants in the system, as you remember. One of them has a Nitrogen pocket the size of Dirt, so when they scanned the system, they checked this planet as it's in the habitable zone, probably scanned the asteroid field for minerals and metals. They probably also scanned the gas giants but didn‚Äôt think about pulling out the nitrogen from it to seed Dirt. ¬†So, when they tried to scam me and ended up selling it for cheap. As you know. People don‚Äôt do terraforming here. They don‚Äôt think about it. ‚Äú He smiled and winked at Mir-ra. ‚ÄúAnd as your grandmother can tell you, a deal is a deal when it's signed and notarized.‚Äú

Mir-ra started to laugh and the others seemed shocked then Kinita started to laugh as well. Ced-dry took some time to get her head around it before she ran to her desk. So how much can your ship pull? We need to do the calculations.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should talk to Jork, he is the engineer here.‚Äù Adam replied.

‚ÄúBy the way what level of engineer? We need at least a level three for this, four would be better.‚Äù ¬†Mir-ra asked as she went to help her friend.

‚ÄúLevel five. I think he should be good enough.‚Äù Adam said and they all stopped and looked at him. ¬†

¬†‚ÄúLevel five? That‚Äôs a research-level engineer. Wait Jork? Jork Wirk?‚Äù Kinita replied, confused.

‚ÄúYes, that's his name. Why?‚Äù Adam asked, confused.

‚ÄúThe Jork? The guy who singlehandedly built customized research vessels for¬†Alpha University from scratch? The guy who went berserk and killed a bunch of criminals? He is a legend. The university tried to find what slavepen he was sent to so they could buy him. That‚Äôs him? Gods be damn.¬† They are going to offer to buy him off you.‚Äù ¬†Kinita was ecstatic now as he realized he had been speaking with Jork many times and never asked for his last name or made the connection.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù Mir-ra said and Kinita turned to her.¬†

‚ÄúHe built the Gunstaron explorer and the Wornuran as well. Everybody drools to get too severe on those ships, and he built them when he was only 20. He is a genius, and he is here.‚Äù

Adam started to laugh. ‚ÄúThe slavepen did not know that. Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to sell him; he is part of my clan. I consider him family.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we talk to him? And can he build ships here? ¬†Wait, he built the speeders, didn't he? That‚Äôs why the scanners are so good. Oh my good!‚Äù Kinita was having a full-on stress attack as he had to sit down.

‚ÄúYou can talk to him when you calm down; I guess I need to talk to him as well, as I only knew he was a level five engineer. ¬†¬†Please don‚Äôt tell the university about him unless he allows it. ‚Äú

Mir-ra nodded. ‚ÄúYes, of course. Now that we have the new information, we just need to readjust our prediction models. And Kinita needs to breathe a little.‚Äù

¬†Adam left them and walked back to the administration room. ‚ÄúJork? Did you use to work for the Alpha University?‚Äù

Jork turned and looked at him. ‚ÄúShitt, they found out? They are going to hassle you now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey told me you build research ships. Is that what you're building? Your own ship?‚Äù Adam asked as he poured a cup of coffee and gave it to Jork, then made one for himself. Vorts was already deep in his fifth.

‚ÄúWell, yes. You need a hauler that can pull large nitrogen out of the Gasgiant and lower the ice safely to the planet to be melted. So, I have been tinkering with a few ideas. It is probably best to have two or three gas extractors due to the massive gravity pull for the gas giant; then we can use a smaller vessel for the transport, which could even be a large drone ship, and lastly, a ship to cut the ice, in the¬†proper size and lower to the planet. It should take a year once it's all up and working. ‚Äú He explained as he took the cup and showed rough designs of the plan on the screen.

‚ÄúHow long to build the ships?‚Äù Adam asked

‚ÄúTwo months. Musby Jord will be a great help; people tend to ignore the Outlander mechanics. I found they sometimes know more about engines than most engineers.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, what?‚Äù Jork asked, and Vorts chuckled.

‚ÄúOkay, you can do it. That project is your priority. ¬†The faster you can get some nitrogen down, the better.‚Äù

‚Äú I can get you a couple of tons with what we have within a week. ‚Äú Jork replied.

‚ÄúGood, do that. We need it for the domes and the planets. As well as our oxygen production. It's about to run out, you know.‚Äù Adam said as he looked at the screen, and they both stared at him.

‚ÄúShit, yeah, we need it fast.‚Äú Jork said as he ran to the garage to work on the craft.

While I liked ‚Äúthe process‚Äù, some days I really just coffee with minimal work on my part. Also, even after years of striving to improve, and get consistency in my technique, I have always been chasing better results. Even over one bag of single-origin Ethiopian, I never could get a single cup to match any of the others of that batch. Third wave water, etc etc, I tried it all. 

Fast forward to last week, and I saw a review of the Fellow Aiden, and I was dubious. I haven‚Äôt been following the device or others, so I knew nothing about it. Despite that, my local Crate & Barrel had a number of them in stock, so I picked one up. 

Here are my results from the last few days‚Ä¶

I started with a single cup using the guided brew process. Once it was complete, I remove that cup and instantly was hit with the floral aroma that was as intense as only a few of my best brewed pour overs over the past 4 years, and the taste matched those as well. I was flabbergasted. These great results were matched over my subsequent single brews with the Aiden. 

Next, I tried the guided brew for a larger batch of about 1.2 liters. I watched a Fellow video about grind size with the Aiden and larger batches, and it recommended larger grinds due to the extraction it achieves. So I looked up the conversion from the recommended Fellow Ode grind setting, and set my Baratza Virtuoso+ to 30 (much larger than I had ever used before), and followed the steps of the Aiden. 9ish minutes later, I remove the carafe and pour, to be met with the same fruity aroma that I got with my single cup brews, and the taste again matched those previous day single cups. 

Needless to say, I‚Äôm a fan of the Aiden. Being able to get the consistency that I never attained with manual pour overs, along with the process being easier, was something I didn‚Äôt think was possible. 

TLDR: The Fellow Aiden does a remarkable job right out of the box. ",13,1728317745.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

I've known my closest friend for 18 years and we recently planned to attend a concert together. However, another friend of mine, whom I've known for 10 years, reached out, expressing that she missed me and wanted to spend one-on-one time due to some struggles she was facing. To accommodate both friendships, we compromised: I'd spend Friday with my 10-year friend, Saturday at the concert with my 18-year friend, and Sunday all together.

On Friday, I picked up my 10-year friend from the airport, bringing along surprises for her birthday‚Äîcake, balloons, flowers, and her favorite coffee. Initially, things were great, but as the evening progressed, she began discussing a guy she was interested in, who coincidentally lives in my city. This brought back uncomfortable memories of our college years when she often engaged with men and would expect me to manage the aftermath, whether driving them home or taking care of them in other ways. I distinctly remember one night when she hooked up with a mutual friend, and despite my exhaustion as the designated driver, I was pressured into driving him two hours away at 3AM. I ended up sleeping in a parking lot because he wouldn‚Äôt let me stay with him.

That night, she casually mentioned she would only be staying with me for one night instead of three. This was surprising, but I rolled with it. Once we returned to my apartment, she spent much of her time glued to her phone, texting this guy.

The next day, while I was at the concert with my 18-year friend, I learned that my 10-year friend had brought a stranger into my home. I felt violated and deeply uncomfortable, as my home is my sanctuary. My friend B expressed concern that my friend A might not have mentioned it to avoid me saying no, but acknowledged that her actions were inappropriate.

The following day, we had a goodbye brunch where my 10-year friend invited the guy she had just hooked up with. His first comment to me was about how clean and organized my apartment was and I felt very uncomfortable having this stranger talk about my place when I hadn‚Äôt invited him there. Throughout brunch, the situation grew increasingly bizarre. My friend was supposed to leave with him but then decided to come back to my apartment instead. Again, none of this was communicated to me and I just kept rolling with it. Apparently he had to run some errands before he could pick up my friend.

Later, all of us as girls were hanging out and having a good time when all of a sudden, she started packing and getting ready to leave out of nowhere. Turns out, he was coming to pick her up‚Ä¶

When he entered my apartment with his shoes on, I asked him to take them off‚Äîmy one rule in my home‚Äîand they looked at me as if I were overreacting.

As they were leaving, my friend announced she was leaving behind the birthday gifts I had given her, I felt hurt and angry. She casually tossed the balloons into my trash can as she left.

Afterward, my longtime friend and I had a heartfelt discussion. She expressed her sadness at seeing me being used and even suggested that my 10-year friend exhibits narcissistic traits, emotionally manipulating me for her benefit. This situation has left me heartbroken. I care for my friends and have always tried to support them, but I can't shake the feeling of being taken advantage of. 

How should I navigate this situation? Should I confront my 10-year friend about her behavior, or is it time to reassess our friendship? Thank you for any guidance you can offer.",1,1728317715.0,AskWomenOver30,3,1.0,False
