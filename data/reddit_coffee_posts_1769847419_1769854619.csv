1qrynfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1qrynfr/aita_for_divorcing_my_husband_over_my_cat/,AITA for divorcing my husband over my cat?,"Trigger Warning: Domestic violence, animal abuse, financial and emotional abuse.

I really need perspective because I feel like I am losing my mind.

I (34) recently separated from my husband, A, (41). He has now filed for divorce, but the final straw for me was an incident involving our cat. I want to explain the full picture because people keep telling me I might be blowing one moment out of proportion.

For years, I have felt controlled financially. We never truly shared money. At first we kept everything separate, then it turned into where he handled most of the finances, and I gave him a set amount every month to cover bills. At the same time, I paid for groceries, household necessities, things for our child, and anything that made the house feel like a home. No matter how much we tried to budget or fix things, I always ended up paying for more of the daily essentials.

I racked up credit card debt trying to keep everything running while also paying for therapy and medical needs. He constantly complained about how much therapy cost and pressured me to stop going, even though I was struggling mentally and actively trying to get help.

He saved money and invested while I drowned in debt. When I tried to talk about it, I was made to feel irresponsible, dramatic, or incapable. Eventually I started believing it. I even suggested at one point that he take more control of finances because I felt ashamed and overwhelmed, and now I wonder if that just gave him more power over me.

I could never be fully honest with him about how bad my debt really was, because I was scared of his reaction. That fear alone should probably say something. I hid the severity not because I wanted to deceive him, but because I knew the conversation would turn into anger, criticism, or punishment.

Emotionally and psychologically, the abuse escalated slowly over time. It started with shaming and constant criticism. Then I began walking on eggshells, afraid of setting him off. That turned into yelling, withholding affection, name calling, and ridiculing me in ways that destroyed my confidence. Eventually he started throwing chairs and slamming things during arguments. Never once was he concerned about where my brain was or how all of this was affecting me. I felt small in my own home. My confidence eroded year by year. Over the course of our relationship I gained nearly eighty pounds, going from 180 to 260, and my depression spiraled. I barely recognized myself anymore.

I am not pretending I was perfect in this marriage. I had an affair. I did not only spend money on household needs. I also bought personal items and made poor financial decisions that added to my debt. After I dropped out of intensive outpatient treatment for my eating disorder, I tried to keep working on my shopping addiction in therapy because he was constantly on me about how expensive treatment was. During that time I developed a gambling problem and lost ten thousand dollars. I own that. I am ashamed of it. I am still working on it.

But I do not think those mistakes justify fear, control, or violence.

Okay, so the cat incident. It started after we got back from a very tumultuous Christmas vacation with his family in CA. We arrived home Monday morning around 3am. Our 3 y/o son, B, and I went straight to bed, but Anthony stayed up. I remember seeing him in the kitchen with the cat. He was leaning on the counter holding her close, almost nuzzling her. I did not think anything of it because the cat was quiet and not reacting.

There had been times in the past where he would purposely agitate the cat, and once I noticed she had a bloody lip, but I brushed it off and assumed the cat had gotten hurt doing cat things.

The next morning he woke me up because he was leaving to pick up the dog from boarding. After he left, I started coffee and made breakfast, and that is when I realized the cat could barely walk. I brought it up to Anthony when he returned, and he said he had no idea what happened and suggested maybe Ben had played with her too rough. That made no sense to me. The cat had been completely fine before Ben went to bed, and Ben had not even been awake that morning.

I set the cat up with food and water near her bed. Later that day I found her sitting in the litter box and she looked like she was dying. I panicked and confronted Anthony, telling him I knew he had done something. He tried to gaslight me and insisted he did not see anything wrong with her. Her eye was blood shot, she had blood coming from her mouth. 

I told him I was taking her to the emergency vet and started getting ready and arranging care for Ben. As I was doing that, he suddenly admitted he had hurt the cat. Then he admitted he had been hurting the cat. When I asked why, he said because it felt good. I was in complete shock.

We took her to be examined, and the vet explained the severity of her injuries. It was horrifying. 2 broken ribs, a degloved lip, a broken leg that they thought they were going to amputate. 

The next day I went to work and spoke with the counselor at the school where I work. She urged me to get him help immediately. I took him to the VA and had him admitted inpatient for a psychological evaluation. Later, his therapist contacted me and advised me to seek a protective order based on things he had been saying about me and our child. It was serious enough for her to break HIPAA and warn me.

I went into see him the next day, and I mentioned that maybe it would be beneficial if we talked about a trial separation. He flipped out and I left. I didnt go back to see him.

That Friday and I filed for the protective order.

Then his mother called me right after I just got done. I completely broke down and told her about the protective order and what had happened. She told me she would not tell him.
She told him anyway before he was served.
When I called to confront her, she hung up on me.

After I filed for protection and started documenting everything because I am terrified of raising my child in a home where fear and explosions are normal. Without him here, my house is so peaceful. We had one joint savings account. I took the money out of that account so I could pay for the attorney, I invested some of it, and I got things to make the house run better. It was a disaster when we got back from vacation. He stays at home and I work. It was like he hadn't done anything for months.

Here is where I am stuck. I keep asking myself if I caused this. If my spending, gambling, or my affair made him this angry. If I destroyed my family and now I am hiding behind the cat incident to justify leaving.

Part of me knows that none of this excuses control or violence. Another part of me still hears his voice telling me this is my fault.

So AITA for divorcing my husband after years of escalating financial, emotional, and psychological abuse, with the final straw being what he did to our cat?

BG info:

My husband and I got married 3 months after we met eachother in 2019. We've been married for 6 years now. We were in the Navy and he and I were going to be stationed on the otherside of the world. We were together 15 days as a married couple and we both shipped off. We didnt move in with eachother until the end of 2021, and he got deployed through 2022. 

The affair was December 2019. I came clean the day after it happened. It doesnt make it better, but I was developing a very bad alcohol problem and I still was in party mode Versus wife.  After this incident, I cut back on drinking and I would be on the phone with him constantly. I would work while he would video chat me while he was sleeping... 

I am $65,000 dollars in debt and he has none. I was very honest about my financial ignorance from the start, before we got married. 

We have been through his Mental Health episodes before, where he was having SI and had to stay inpatient, he is a recovering alcoholic. I have ADHD/MDD/Anxiety/ PTSD. He is diagnosed with OCD/Manic Depression/ Maybe Bipolar/PTSD. We both take medications to regulate ourselves. ",1,1769854325.0,abusesurvivors,0,1.0,False

1qrylvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/a1th0ughts/comments/1qrylvk/biopower_foucault/,biopower Foucault,"Michel Foucault introduced **biopower** (or *biopolitique*) in the mid-1970s—most systematically in *The History of Sexuality, Volume 1* (1976) and his Collège de France lectures (*Society Must Be Defended*, 1975–76; *Security, Territory, Population*, 1977–78)—to describe a fundamental transformation in how Western states exercise power over human life.

# Core Distinction: Two Modalities of Power Over Life

Foucault identified **two complementary techniques** that emerged from the 17th–18th centuries onward:

1. **Anatomo-politics of the body** (disciplinary power)
   * Focuses on the *individual body* as a machine to be trained, optimized, and controlled
   * Operates through institutions: schools, factories, prisons, armies
   * Techniques: surveillance, timetables, examinations, normalization
2. **Biopolitics of the population** (biopower proper)
   * Focuses on the *population* as a biological species with collective processes: birth/death rates, health, longevity, migration, fertility
   * Operates through *security apparatuses*: statistics, public health, urban planning, welfare policies, epidemiology
   * Goal: regulation, optimization, and fostering of life—not punishment or prohibition

# The Sovereign vs. Biopower Shift

Foucault contrasted biopower with **sovereign power**, whose emblematic right was *""to take life or let live""* (*droit de glaive*). Biopower inverts this: it is the power *""to foster life or disallow it to the point of death""* (*laisser vivre ou faire mourir*). Rather than spectacular displays of violence (execution), modern power works through:

* Public hygiene campaigns
* Insurance systems and actuarial tables
* Demographic management (e.g., pronatalist policies)
* Medicalization of social problems
* Risk calculation and prevention

# Racism as a Biopolitical Mechanism

In *Society Must Be Defended*, Foucault provocatively argued that **state racism** became functionally necessary for biopower. Why? Because biopower's imperative is to ""make live,"" yet the state sometimes must kill (in war, purge ""threatening"" groups). Racism provides the logic to reconcile this contradiction: by dividing the population into ""good/bad,"" ""superior/inferior"" biological groups, the state can justify killing some (""making die"") in the name of preserving the health of the whole population (""making live""). This isn't merely interpersonal prejudice—it's a *technology of power* embedded in state apparatuses.

# Contemporary Relevance

Foucault's framework has become indispensable for analyzing:

* Pandemic governance (lockdowns, vaccine mandates as population-level interventions)
* Algorithmic governance and big data surveillance of populations
* Climate policy and ""planetary boundaries"" as biopolitical regulation
* Migration controls and border regimes managing flows of bodies
* Reproductive policies and debates over bodily autonomy

# Important Nuance

Foucault did **not** claim disciplinary power disappeared. Rather, biopower *layered onto* it, creating a ""double entanglement"": we are simultaneously disciplined as individuals *and* regulated as populations. The modern subject is thus caught between the school/prison's gaze and the actuarial table's probabilities.

Biopower remains one of Foucault's most influential contributions—a lens for understanding how ""life itself"" became the object of political strategy in the modern era.

integrate  ethanol, sugar, caffeine, nicotine  into the framework

Thinking completed

Integrating ethanol, sugar, caffeine, and nicotine into Foucault's biopower framework reveals how these substances function not merely as consumables but as **nodal points where power operates simultaneously on individual bodies and entire populations**—shaping discipline, productivity, health, and social order. Each substance illuminates a distinct facet of the biopolitical apparatus.

# 1. Caffeine: The Productivity Drug of Industrial Biopower

* **Anatomo-politics**: Caffeine became instrumental in the *temporal discipline* of industrial capitalism. By suppressing fatigue and extending wakefulness, it enabled bodies to conform to factory timetables, shift work, and the rationalized time of wage labor. The coffee break itself is a biopolitical technology: a regulated pause that *renews* productivity rather than interrupting it.
* **Biopolitics**: States and corporations actively promoted caffeine consumption (e.g., tea in Britain, coffee in America) as a ""sober"" alternative to alcohol—aligning worker behavior with industrial efficiency. Today, caffeine is *de-regulated* precisely because it serves biopower's goal of fostering productive life. Its ubiquity (in beverages, pills, even intravenous formulations for night-shift workers) reflects its integration into the infrastructure of population-level labor optimization.

# 2. Sugar: The Colonial-Caloric Engine of Population Management

* **Anatomo-politics**: Sugar reconfigured the sensory apparatus of the body—creating craving, altering metabolism, and embedding pleasure in repetitive consumption. Its pairing with caffeine (sweetened coffee/tea) and nicotine (sweetened tobacco) formed a *triad of colonial commodities* that trained bodies toward addictive rhythms compatible with wage labor.
* **Biopolitics**: Sugar was foundational to the *demographic management* of empire:
   * **Colonial populations**: Enslaved Africans were fed sugar-based rations to sustain labor on plantations—a brutal optimization of life for extraction.
   * **Metropole populations**: Cheap sugar calories sustained urban working classes during industrialization, preventing unrest while keeping wages low.
   * **Contemporary regime**: Sugar has shifted from *fostering life* to *managing death*. With obesity/diabetes epidemics, states now deploy biopolitical countermeasures: sugar taxes, labeling laws, public health campaigns. Yet the state remains complicit—subsidizing corn (for HFCS) while taxing its health consequences. This duality epitomizes biopower's logic: *profit from the substance, govern its pathologies*.

# 3. Nicotine: The Racialized Biopolitics of Addiction

* **Anatomo-politics**: Nicotine's cognitive effects (focus, stress modulation) made it valuable for labor discipline—chewing tobacco in mines, cigarettes during factory breaks. But its *addictive architecture* also made it a tool of social control: the need for regular dosing structures time, creates dependency, and commodifies craving itself.
* **Biopolitics**: Tobacco regulation exemplifies Foucault's insight that **racism is functional to biopower**:
   * **Historical**: Colonial states monopolized tobacco production and taxed consumption—extracting revenue while managing indigenous and enslaved populations through controlled access.
   * **Modern**: The criminalization of crack cocaine (vs. pharmaceutical cocaine) mirrors earlier patterns: substances associated with racialized or poor populations are *prohibited* (making die), while identical molecules consumed by elites are *medicalized* (making live). Cigarette advertising targeted Black communities after menthol bans elsewhere; vaping regulations differentially impact youth vs. adult smokers.
   * **Paradox**: States simultaneously tax tobacco for revenue *and* wage public health wars against it—revealing biopower's capacity to *profit from death* while rhetorically championing life.

# 4. Ethanol: The Ritualized Boundary of Sovereign vs. Bio-Power

* **Anatomo-politics**: Alcohol disrupts bodily discipline—impairing coordination, judgment, and temporal control. Hence its regulation through *spatial confinement*: licensed hours, designated drinking zones, DUI checkpoints. These are technologies to contain ethanol's threat to productive order while permitting its ritualized release (weekend drinking, holidays).
* **Biopolitics**: Alcohol governance oscillates between:
   * **Sovereign prohibition** (e.g., U.S. Prohibition 1920–33): an attempt to *make live* through moral purity that backfired by creating black markets and violence.
   * **Biopolitical regulation**: Modern states abandoned prohibition for *managed consumption*—licensing, taxation, blood-alcohol limits, public health messaging. This reflects biopower's preference for *regulation over elimination*.
   * **Class/race stratification**: Drunk driving enforcement targets working-class drivers; ""public drunkenness"" laws criminalize homeless populations; yet corporate alcohol consumption (wine tastings, business dinners) remains normalized. Biopower thus *differentially distributes risk*: some bodies are protected from alcohol's harms; others are exposed or punished for them.

# Synthesis: The Biopolitical Quadrant

|Substance|Anatomo-political Function|Biopolitical Regime|Power's Dual Movement|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Caffeine**|Extends wakefulness; aligns body with industrial time|Promoted/de-regulated (serves productivity)|*Foster life* (productive labor)|
|**Sugar**|Creates metabolic craving; pairs with stimulants|Shifted from subsidy → taxation (caloric management)|*Foster then disallow life* (obesity as pathology)|
|**Nicotine**|Structures time through addiction; modulates stress|Racialized prohibition vs. medicalized acceptance|*Make die* (marginalized users) / *Make live* (pharma consumers)|
|**Ethanol**|Disrupts discipline; requires spatial/temporal containment|Managed consumption (licensing, taxation)|*Let live* within regulated boundaries|

# Critical Insight: Addiction as a Biopolitical Category

These substances reveal that **addiction itself is not a natural condition but a biopolitical construct**. What gets labeled ""addiction"" depends on:

* Whether the substance *serves or disrupts* productive labor
* The race/class of its primary consumers
* The state's fiscal interest in its trade

Caffeine addiction is invisible because it serves capital; opioid addiction becomes a ""crisis"" when it disables white working-class bodies; crack addiction becomes a crime when it affects Black urban populations. Biopower thus *produces* categories of pathological consumption while naturalizing others—always in service of optimizing the population's vitality *as capital requires it*.

This framework exposes a haunting truth: the same substances that built empires and sustained industrial labor now drive the very pathologies (diabetes, liver disease, lung cancer) that biopower claims to combat—revealing the circular, self-reproducing logic of power over life itself.",1,1769854168.0,a1th0ughts,0,1.0,False

   Yes laws exist. Yes some people crossed borders without documentation. Yes the government ignored this reality for decades, benefited from it, and now suddenly claims moral high ground by “enforcing the law.”

   But let’s be honest: selective enforcement without compassion is not justice; it’s punishment. And its cruelty.

   I’ve heard the argument: “Responsible adults wouldn’t put themselves or their families in an illegal situation.”
   I understand why people feel that way. I truly do. But reducing real human lives, especially children, to legal talking points strips away any empathy and context.    
   Many families came here out of survival, not recklessness. And many of us benefit daily from their labor while pretending not to see them.
   The idea that “the more people resist, the worse it will get” may be politically true, but it doesn’t make it morally right.

Let’s ask harder questions.

-Did we not steal this land?
-Was much of our infrastructure not built by immigrants—many undocumented?
-Is the “American Dream” really about enforcing suffering on people we disagree with?

   Punishing children for the circumstances of their birth follows the same logic as saying modern Americans should be punished for the crimes of our ancestors. If that sounds wrong, it’s because it is.

   We call ourselves a melting pot. We invited the world here. So why are we now so satisfied with ruined lives, broken families, and death... just to feel righteous?
  
 And when it comes to violence and gun rights, the hypocrisy is glaring.

   We’ve watched armed protesters celebrated under the banner of the Second Amendment. We’ve seen public praise when people openly carried rifles in the name of “freedom.”
Yet when a man with a legal permit, in an open carry state, with camera in his hand and exercising his rights, is killed... suddenly the narrative shifts. Suddenly it’s “he was asking for trouble,” or “you just can’t have guns. -trump.""
Which is it?
  Rights are not real if they only apply when it’s politically convenient.
   To blame victims after the fact, despite clear video evidence, is not accountability; it’s denial and its ignorance. And it should trouble all of us, regardless of political side.

What hurts the most is this:

   So many of the people being demonized are the same ones who feed us, build for us, clean for us, care for us.. often while being bullied, exploited, or dehumanized. And still, many of them love this country and give more to it than it ever gave back.
That should humble us.
   
   I know people are angry. And that anger makes sense. Life is hard. People feel unheard, unsafe, and pushed to the edge. But anger doesn’t have to turn into cruelty.
Instead of being divided, what if we recognized how much we actually want the same things? Safety. Dignity. Opportunity. A future for our families.

   We are being shown the worst versions of each other on purpose. The left sees the most extreme right. The right sees the most extreme left. And we’re told that’s the whole story. It’s not.

   Look around your real, everyday life. Most people want cooperation.. not collapse.
   The people with the most power and money do not benefit from unity. They benefit from division. From fear. From us turning on each other instead of questioning systems that exploit everyone.

 So I’m choosing compassion without naivety.
Empathy without denial.
And humanity over ideology.

   I’m here for you. You’re not alone.
But I will not stand by while suffering is justified, lives are reduced to paperwork, and cruelty is called “order.”
We can do better; because we are better.

My former PI was not part of these chats as it was informal and he is not aware of the suggestions and advice I am providing to their postdoc.

Sometimes. But honestly, the real magic (and the real grind) was in the moments between those picture-perfect scenes. This trip wasn't about finding myself, or living an 'epic' adventure; it was about getting a genuine feel for a place, warts and all, and figuring out how to navigate it as a party of one.

**My Portugal Playbook (A Month, Solo):**

*   **Route:** Flew into Lisbon (10 days), trained to Porto (7 days), bused down to Lagos in the Algarve (6 days), then a final few days back in Lisbon before flying out. Didn't rush it; wanted to soak things in rather than tick off a list.
*   **Accommodation:** A practical mix of Airbnbs (for more space and kitchen access) and well-reviewed hostels (for a social buzz when I wanted it).
    *   *Lisbon Airbnb average:* €50/night (off-season shoulder month, good deals).
    *   *Porto Hostel private room:* €35/night.
    *   *Lagos Hostel dorm:* €20/night.
*   **Transport:**
    *   *Flights:* Booked well in advance, roundtrip from my home city was about €400.
    *   *Trains (CP - Comboios de Portugal):* Lisbon-Porto ~€30 (booked ahead for discount). Reliable and scenic.
    *   *Buses (Rede Expressos):* Porto-Lagos ~€25, Lagos-Lisbon ~€20. Comfortable enough for longer hauls.
    *   *Local:* Lots of walking. Metro/trams in Lisbon (grab a Viva Viagem card and load it up). Bolt/Uber for late nights or specific areas when my feet gave out.
*   **Food & Drink:** This is where I probably spent more than I intended, because the food is just *that* good.
    *   *Daily average:* €35-€50 (a mix of cooking in Airbnbs, cheap lunch 'prato do dia', and occasional nice dinners).
    *   *Coffee:* Essential, €1.50 for a bica.
    *   *Pastel de Nata:* Daily ritual, ~€1.20 each. No regrets.
*   **Activities:** Mostly walking tours (tip-based), museum entries (€5-€15 each), a beginner surf lesson in Lagos (€45), and just soaking up the atmosphere. Didn't splurge on many expensive tours.
*   **Total Estimated Cost (Excluding international flights):** Roughly €1500-€1800 for the month, all in. I generally aimed to stay around €50-€60/day.

**The Real Talk: Unexpected Hugs (and Headaches):**

Now, let's cut through the Instagram filters for a second. Solo travel in Portugal, or anywhere, isn't always sunshine and easy living.

*   **Loneliness? Yeah, sometimes.** There were evenings in a charming restaurant feeling a bit conspicuous with just me and my book. But then there were the random hostel chats that turned into dinner plans, or the older Portuguese couple at a local tasca who just *insisted* I try their special brandy. The key was knowing when to seek company and when to genuinely enjoy my own space.
*   **Language Barrier:** While many people in tourist areas speak English, venturing off the beaten path (even slightly) meant fumbling through ""Obrigado,"" ""Desculpa,"" and lots of pointing. It was humbling, but also led to some genuine laughs and appreciative smiles. A few basic phrases go a long way.
*   **Decision Fatigue is Real:** Every meal, every activity, every route – it's all on you. By week three, even choosing what pastelaria to get my morning coffee from felt like a major executive decision. Building in ""do nothing"" days, or just wandering aimlessly, was crucial.
*   **The Hills, Oh God, The Hills:** Lisbon and Porto are gorgeous, but my calves got a serious workout. Seriously, invest in good walking shoes. My step count was consistently through the roof.
*   **My Favorite Discovery (Non-Instagrammable Edition):** Finding a tiny, nondescript 'frutaria' in Lisbon with the sweetest, cheapest oranges I've ever tasted. Or the quiet, unassuming Fado bar in Alfama where a local just sang their heart out without any pretense, completely unbothered by tourists. These were the moments that felt truly authentic, not just a photo op.

So, yeah, I'm already eyeing flights for next year. Portugal burrowed its way under my skin, not because it was 'perfect' or 'life-changing,' but because it was real, beautiful, challenging, and endlessly interesting. It taught me that genuine travel isn't about ticking off sights; it's about the quiet moments, the unexpected connections, and the sheer grit of figuring things out on your own.

It's like living in a house with forever revolving doors.

I recall breakfast yesterday - just me, my coffee, and a window that framed a scene of steady rain. The smell of damp earth filled my nostrils, but all I could fixate on was the transformation outside. Blooms shriveling on once vibrant trees, sidewalks washed of summer dust. It was mesmerizing and terrifying at the same time. Incidentally, it was also breakfast time and life had to go on. I had to go on.

It got me thinking - is feeling adrift amidst all this flux a universal human experience? 

Title: Silence in Conversations: Contemplating My Feelings 

Body:  I was in the middle of a discussion with my friend yesterday. Words were tumbling out, ideas were bouncing back like an energetic pingpong session. Suddenly there was silence. Not an awkward one, but the kind where both of us were contemplating what had been said and perhaps venturing into our own mental landscapes. 

I found that silence profound, like a soothing balm on our verbose spirits. It made me think about how capable we are of communicating our thoughts without any words, how shared silence could be just as eloquent as a riveting conversation. That brief silence hinted at depths within us rarely explored. 

Does anyone else find meaning in these shared silences?

Title: Sour Lemons: Battling with Negativity

Body:  It's funny how one offhand negative comment can outdo an avalanche of positive ones. This one's been lingering around my mind for days, casting an itchy shadow. It started with a casual conversation with a friend who nonchalantly critiqued a project I've been intensely working on. I smiled, thanked him for his 'honesty', but that lemony sour taste remains.

Dealing with my friend's non-constructive negativity hasn't been easy. It's left me wrestling with my insecurities, mulling over 'what ifs'. It shone a harsh intrusive light on the very idea of taking criticism gracefully.

1qry8h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qry8h0/aitah_for_stepping_back_from_my_boyfriends_friend/,"AITAH for stepping back from my boyfriend’s friend group after months of exclusion, indirect accusations, and a wedding conflict that escalated after I pushed for a face-to-face conversation?","Hi Reddit,

I (f, 24) am in a relationship with my partner (m, 28). He has a large friend group that originally formed through work several years ago. Over time, most partners became part of that group as well.

All names and identifying details have been changed.

The beginning:

When I first met people connected to this group, I tried to be open, friendly, and respectful. Months later, during a serious conversation, I was suddenly accused of having “insulted” the groom at the very first meeting.

What’s important here:

That first meeting was not a group gathering of this friend group. It was a casual meeting with some of my partner’s other friends. The groom happened to be present, but no one else from this work-based friend group was there.

The accusation later shared in the group was that I had insulted him in my partner’s absence. However:

	•	no one could say what exactly I had said,

	•	this was never addressed with me at the time,

	•	and the groom never spoke to my partner about it directly.

Instead, this alleged incident was apparently communicated by the groom to the wider friend group without ever being clarified with my partner or me.

Despite this supposedly serious issue, no one from the group approached my partner in the following months to say they disliked me, felt hurt, or wanted to resolve anything.

Being told to “wait” and trying to integrate:

After that initial phase, I was told that I could become part of the group, but that it “wouldn’t happen immediately” because they “needed time to get to know me.” I took this as something hopeful and genuinely tried to integrate.

Over the next nine months, I made repeated efforts, especially toward the women in the group. I suggested meeting for coffee or spending time together outside of big group settings. These offers were met with vague, non-committal responses or polite deflections, but nothing ever materialized.

The group dynamics were fairly traditional: women mostly stayed together and prepared food, while the men drank beer and socialized. I don’t naturally fit into that role. I drink beer, I’m interested in video games, and I communicated more easily with some of the men.

Because of this, I was often excluded when my partner met up with “the guys,” even though these meetups were never explicitly defined as men-only beforehand. Later, during a conversation, it was said that I was “destroying men’s nights,” which confused me, because I had never knowingly joined anything labeled as such. From my perspective, I was simply trying to get to know my partner’s friends.

Toward the end of this period (around December/January), there were also occasional subtle but public comments made about me in group settings that felt dismissive or excluding. Still, no one addressed any concerns with me or with my partner directly.

Nine months with no direct communication:

What struck us most in hindsight was that throughout these nine months:

	•	no one spoke to me directly about any issue,

	•	no one spoke to my partner directly about not liking me,

	•	no one tried to clarify the alleged first-meeting incident,

	•	and no one suggested a solution or conversation.

This silence and indirectness started to seriously affect our relationship.

The wedding topic (before the conversation):

One couple in the group (f & m late 20’s over 12 years together) was planning their wedding, and my partner was supposed to be the best man.

Before any face-to-face conversation took place, there were already discussions about expectations related to that role. Some of these expectations felt unclear or illogical, especially regarding logistics and my role as his partner. I kept asking myself: What am I supposed to do during that time? How is this planned?

These questions were never really answered. Communication happened only with my partner via chat, even though the situation clearly affected me as well.

Because everything went through him and nothing was clarified, I suggested that we should all sit down together. I pushed for a face-to-face conversation because I felt my perspective and feelings were being completely bypassed.

The face-to-face conversation (initiated by my partner and me):

That conversation eventually happened with all four of us.

During this meeting, much higher and more rigid expectations were voiced for the first time (e.g. overnight stays, full-day availability, prioritizing the couple entirely). My partner expressed that he was uncomfortable with this and that he also needed to respect our relationship.

At the time, the conversation felt difficult but somewhat constructive. I left it feeling hopeful.

What happened after the conversation:

Afterwards, my partner and I talked privately and agreed that it couldn’t simply be “our wedding, our rules, end of discussion.” He needed to speak directly with the groom again.

He did that and said he could not meet all those expectations and that if they were non-negotiable, he would step down as best man.

Only after that conversation, I received a very harsh message from the bride stating that:

	•	the face-to-face conversation had only happened “for my partner’s sake”

	•	nobody in the group had ever liked me

	•	my behavior explained why

	•	the women would never have given me another chance

	•	it was better I was out of the group so there could be “peace again”

	•	I was manipulative and egoistic

	•	the wedding invitation was withdrawn

	•	and that I was largely responsible for damaging my partner’s friendship with the groom

My partner received a separate message from the bride (not from the groom himself), saying she hoped he would find a job that made him happier, that he would “find his own opinion again,” and that she was disappointed in him. Again, we were told we were no longer welcome at the wedding.

After this, several women from the group blocked me on social media. No one from the group contacted my partner at all.

Where we are now:

My partner later spoke with other friends of his who are not part of this work-based friend group. They all said that:

	•	the expectations placed on him were unreasonable,

	•	excluding me the way they did was not okay,

	•	and that setting boundaries was the right decision.

My partner is grieving the potential loss of a long-standing friendship, but also recognizes that continuing as before would be disrespectful to me and to our relationship.

I feel that stepping back from this group is necessary for my own well-being and that continuing without consequences would invalidate months of exclusion, indirect communication, and unaddressed accusations.

⸻

First mistake: I entered from the wrong gate and somehow ended up inside a cosmetics store that smelled like 17 different flowers fighting for dominance. A lady immediately attacked me with, “Sir, would you like to try our new charcoal face mask?”
I said, “No thanks, I already have a face.”

Escaped from there and went to the food court. I ordered a simple burger, but the guy asked:
“Regular bun, multigrain, brioche, gluten-free, keto-friendly, emotionally supportive?”
I panicked and said, “Bhai jo tum khate ho woh de do.”

Then came the real disaster. the escalator. I stepped on it confidently like a hero in slow motion… and my shoelace decided to participate in a suicide mission. I did a mini dance, almost hugged a stranger aunty, and she looked at me like I was part of a mall entertainment program.

Later I went into Zara just to feel rich. A salesperson asked, “Sir, looking for something specific?”
I said, “Yes… discount.”
He laughed. I wasn’t joking.

He can’t get back to sleep and is usually awake for at least 2 hours or more. He is tired during the day. He has had these periods before but now it’s been going on for several months and he is exhausted. 

He doesn’t drink, alcohol basically at all or caffeine past noon, usually coffee only in the morning 2 cups. We have optimized the bedroom, it’s quiet, dark with black out curtains, cool, etc. Our sleep schedule is pretty consistent as well. 

He has no problem falling asleep, he falls asleep in minutes after the lights go out. To me that’s almost not normal. He does sometimes snore but I don’t hear any breaks in his breathing. I don’t think he’s stressed in general but the no sleep thing is stressing to him. He is often very sleepy during the evening, like between 7-8 pm. 

He has tried valerian tea, melatonin, Dormix (which is i guess originally an allergy med with drowsing effect, currently used for sleep), diazepam, pregabalin. He doesn’t like taking drugs. Pregabalin is the only thing that made him sleep thru the night but he doesn’t want to take it all the time. Diazepam knocks him out but he doesn’t want to use it all the time. 

Other health related things; he has medication for high blood pressure, Losatrix/Losartan which he takes in the morning. From my understanding this should not affect sleep. He also develops kidney stones regularly. He has also problems with digestion of food but we are not sure if it’s high or low acid stomach issue. He doesn’t take regular meds for that tho. I also suspect he may have insulin resistance as his blood sugar levels are borderline prediabetic (but not yet officially diagnosed prediabetic). 

I know waking up at 3 am is super common, I’ve read many threads on here about it. Just wanted to post if there is anyone with the sort of same situation that have found something that works. All advice appreciated.

1qrxyc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qrxyc6/the_psychology_of_change_how_microdecisions/,The Psychology of Change: How Micro-Decisions Actually Rewire Your Life (Backed by Science),"Look, you're stuck. Maybe not in a dramatic, life-falling-apart kind of way. But you know
something's off. You're scrolling through the same feeds, having the same conversations, living
the same Tuesday on repeat. And somewhere deep down, you're screaming for something
different. I spent months researching this phenomenon, digging through behavioral psychology,
neuroscience studies, podcasts with top performers, and I found something wild: most advice
about change is backwards. We've been lied to about how transformation actually works.
The truth? Change doesn't come from massive motivation or waiting for the perfect moment. It
comes from weaponizing one thing nobody talks about: micro-decisions. The tiny choices you
make in the next five minutes will determine whether you're still stuck here a year from now or
living a completely different life.
## Step 1: Stop Waiting for Rock Bottom
Here's what the research shows: waiting for a crisis to force change is the slowest, most painful
path. Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg spent decades studying habit formation and found
that motivation is unreliable as hell. You know what works? Designing your environment so the
right choices become automatic.
Right now, look at your phone. What apps are on your home screen? If it's Instagram, TikTok,
and Twitter, congrats, you've designed your life for distraction. Move them. Put a book app, a
meditation app, or literally anything that serves your goals in those prime spots. Ash is solid for
daily mental health check-ins and relationship advice that actually makes sense. Finch is great if
you need something gamified to build habits without feeling like you're forcing it.
This isn't about willpower. It's about making the good choice the easy choice.
## Step 2: Identify Your Keystone Habit
Not all habits are created equal. Some habits create a domino effect that transforms everything
else. Charles Duhigg nailed this in *The Power of Habit*. He found that people who start
exercising suddenly start eating better, being more productive, and even managing money
differently. Exercise becomes the keystone that unlocks other changes.
Your keystone habit might be:
* Waking up 30 minutes earlier
* Reading for 20 minutes daily
* Going to the gym three times a week
* Journaling every morning
Pick ONE. Not five. Not three. ONE habit that you know, deep in your gut, would create ripples
across your entire life. Then build everything around protecting that habit like it's sacred.
## Step 3: Kill Your Escape Hatches
You sabotage yourself with escape hatches. These are the little excuses you pre-install: ""I'll start
Monday,"" ""I need to research more first,"" ""I'm just not ready yet."" Bullshit. You're building
yourself an easy exit before you even begin.
James Clear talks about this in *Atomic Habits*, the bestselling book that's genuinely changed
millions of lives. He's a habit expert who built a massive following by making behavior change
stupidly simple. His core insight? Make bad habits hard and good habits easy. Want to stop
doom scrolling? Delete the apps. Not just log out. Delete them. Make the friction so high that
your lazy brain gives up.
Want to start running? Sleep in your gym clothes. Put your shoes by the door. Remove every
possible excuse between you and the action.
## Step 4: Use the 2-Minute Rule to Trick Your Brain
Your brain is designed to resist change. It wants comfort, predictability, safety. So you've got to
outsmart it. The 2-Minute Rule from James Clear is criminally effective: any new habit should
take less than two minutes to do.
Want to read more? Don't commit to reading a chapter. Commit to reading one page. Want to
meditate? Don't aim for 20 minutes. Aim for taking three deep breaths. Want to write? Just write
one sentence.
This sounds stupid simple, but it works because it removes the psychological barrier. Once you
start, momentum takes over. You'll read more than one page. You'll meditate longer than three
breaths. But the key is lowering the activation energy so starting feels effortless.
## Step 5: Stack Your Habits Like a Pro
Habit stacking is where the magic happens. This is about linking a new behavior to something
you already do automatically. BJ Fogg's research shows that anchoring new habits to existing
routines makes them stick way faster.
Here's how it works:
* After I pour my morning coffee, I'll read for 10 minutes
* After I brush my teeth at night, I'll write three things I'm grateful for
* After I close my laptop for the day, I'll do 10 pushups
You're hijacking your existing neural pathways instead of trying to build new ones from scratch.
Your brain already knows how to pour coffee. Now it'll learn that reading comes next.
For anyone who wants to go deeper into these concepts but doesn't have the time to read
through dozens of books like *Atomic Habits* or *The Power of Habit*, there's an AI learning
app called BeFreed that's been useful. A friend who works at Google recommended it to me.
It pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books on behavior change to create
personalized audio content. You type in something specific like ""build better habits as someone
who's tried and failed before"" and it generates a custom learning plan with podcasts tailored to
your exact situation. You can adjust the depth from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute
deep dive with examples and context, and even pick the voice style. Makes absorbing all this
research way more digestible when you're commuting or at the gym.
## Step 6: Track Everything, Feel Everything
Look, if you're not tracking, you're lying to yourself about your progress. Get a habit tracker. It
can be as simple as a piece of paper with boxes to check off or an app like Streaks. The point is
to create visual proof that you're showing up.
But here's the deeper part: attach emotion to your tracking. Dr. Andrew Huberman, the
neuroscientist behind the insanely popular Huberman Lab podcast, explains that dopamine is
released not just from achievement but from the pursuit itself. When you check off that box,
celebrate it. Literally feel proud. Say ""hell yeah"" out loud.
Your brain needs to associate the action with positive emotion, not just obligation.
## Step 7: Find Your People or Stay Stuck
You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. If those five people are
stuck, complaining, and avoiding growth, guess what? You'll stay stuck too. This isn't judgment,
it's just reality.
Join communities where the behavior you want is the norm. If you want to read more, join a
book club or online reading community. If you want to get fit, find a workout partner or group
class. If you want to build a business, surround yourself with entrepreneurs.
The Huberman Lab podcast is great for understanding the science behind behavior change,
focus, and performance. Andrew Huberman breaks down complex neuroscience into actionable
protocols that actually work. Episodes on dopamine, motivation, and habit formation are
goldmines.
## Step 8: Embrace the Suck, Then Keep Going
Here's what nobody tells you: change feels like shit at first. Your brain will throw tantrums. You'll
want to quit. You'll feel uncomfortable, awkward, and like you're failing. That's normal. That's not
a sign you're doing it wrong. It's a sign you're doing it right.
The research is clear: it takes about 66 days on average for a new behavior to become
automatic, not the mythical 21 days everyone parrots. So give yourself permission to suck for
two months. Show up anyway. The discomfort is temporary. Staying the same is permanent.
## Step 9: Burn the Ships
This is the nuclear option, but it works. When Cortés landed in Mexico, he burned his ships so
his men couldn't retreat. You need to do the same with your excuses.
Tell people your goals publicly. Put money on the line with apps like Beeminder that charge you
real cash if you don't follow through. Quit your escape routes. Make going back more painful
than moving forward.
*Indistractable* by Nir Eyal is incredible for this. Eyal spent years researching why we get
distracted and how to build a life where you control your attention instead of it controlling you.
The book gives you frameworks to design your environment and schedule so that distraction
isn't even an option. Seriously one of the best productivity books out there.
## Step 10: Decide Who You Are
This is the real shift. Stop saying ""I want to be someone who works out."" Start saying ""I am
someone who works out."" Identity drives behavior way more than goals do. When you see
yourself as a reader, you read. When you see yourself as a fit person, you move your body.
When you see yourself as disciplined, you act disciplined.
Every action you take is a vote for the person you're becoming. You don't need to win every
vote. You just need to win the majority. So cast your votes wisely, starting right now.
The fastest way to change your life isn't some grand plan or perfect strategy. It's the decision
you make in the next five minutes. And the five minutes after that. String enough of those
decisions together, and you'll wake up six months from now unrecognizable in the best possible
way.",4,1769851839.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

Two people of one thought, it can be love, trust, or just made for one another, both have secrets they can’t share. One gets married, the other has to leave. This is not a they lived happily ever story, rather a true love story, where fate wins, and love loses.

CHAPTER I Welcome to netherlands

A twelve hour long flight was the last thing I wanted . You know, it's too much time for a trip to the Netherlands, besides,it was for two reasons: my sister, Kavya, who had shifted from India to the Netherlands 2 months ago due to transfer, wanted to meet me. She writes travelogs for newspaper magazines and is a storywriter at the gazette in the dutch.

 Oh i seem to have forgotten my basic manners, pardon me, i am Aarav shetty, 21 or 22, i don't care to be honest, an unprofessional writer still gaining experience on writing excellent pieces of writing, it has been 4.5 years since my journey began, from Delhi to Denmark, my stories have been based in various venues. Coming to why I came to the Netherlands,about 3 weeks ago,
I had sent in my resume alongside my manuscript . Anyways,I reached out to a very famous non fiction writer named Matthew O'Neil. The letter worked. I was just boarding the plane when my phone chimed, ‘ One new letter for Aarav shetty from Matthew o’ Neil. I PINCHED MYSELF TWICE,[ it hurt by the way] the letter read as follows:

Good morning, Mr Aarav shetty, I am Matthew O’Neil, just call me Matt. Now, the reason I took about 3 weeks to reply is because I was too caught up with some work down here, but I made it my duty to go through your papers and manuscript.
Well, it was a pleasant surprise to read the script and I must say, you sir, know how to write and present a storyline.
Hold your horses however, because  some areas, i would say, were raw, like not edited too well to the standards which people prefer. So I offer you a choice. You can join my company and I will help you edit this novel or you could just do it yourself  and submit it to me, the job is still yours, you could pip in by Monday, 24th . I hope we have a good meeting.
Matt

I boarded the plane, scared but steady,pretty aware of what the situation was at home. I would never be able to reject this offer.I took my diary, my mom gifted it on my 18th birthday, when i said my first draft had been picked up by Times of India. The plane took off, I opened the diary and scribbled a short poem like idea:

                A starry night

While looking out of the window, I saw a star form. It was a beautiful sight, the airplanes flew through the starcast, forming a face, a face which would make the moonlight feel shy…

I had no idea who that face should have been, it couldn't be my sister, it had to be romantic, my mom’s taunts came to my mind, she always brought my marriage to different situations, ‘ aarav beta, just get married and then continue your writing. I’m sure any girl would fall for you.’ yeah right, the plane was really chilly and the blankets were not helping.

The sky was dark and beautifully studded with diamond like stars.
I slept like a baby for 12 hours and finally  woke up at 6pm EST [ technically at 9:30 pm].
  I was woken up by the flight attendant,    ‘ welcome to Netherlands ,sir, we have landed safely at the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the international airport at Amsterdam, Netherlands;   
Your bags are at the checkout line, have a nice trip sir!
I walked out of the plane, looked around and saw no one near my checkout. As I was walking down the line with my bags, I saw a welcome to Netherlands signboard nearby with all the places marked. I immediately realised I was here to make all my work worth it, not just visit. I wasn't pretty loud about my work , and will never be, I will only celebrate when it's worth the celebrations.

I walked down the cab lane and drove straight to keizersgracht in the heart of Amsterdam, right above a bakery where she ate every day.

CHAPTER II THE FIRST MEETING

‘ Hi aarav, good evening,"" my sister texted. ""I hope you know where my house is, "" the next message popped up on my phone almost immediately. I found an electronics store nearby and bought a sim for about ten Euros. The first thing I did was save all my important numbers, texted my sister and the rest, you know it. My sister called, ‘ aarav, listen, i might come at 10 in the night, it's a big ceremony and we have to write it for the gazette, you know what, ask gerrard, my neighbor, to drop you at.. Ok bye.’
I hadn't told her about Matt yet, I told no one about it yet. The suspense had to remain intact, as kavya said, I saw Gerrard in the parking lot. I told him to drive me to the writer’s cafe, 45 minutes from home, as I had to join for my night shift. I saw Matt, he was sitting in the glass room, with his macbook, typing out his manuscript and editing it. As I was walking,
I saw a writer struggle to edit her book. I walked up, sat next to her, and saw her writing.

It was a sad story, more like a heartbreaking novel. I bit my hand, trying not to cry on the last lines, “ only time will heal,I read with a breath, we might be far from each other, but never apart.” Well, how is the story?, the girl asked, well aware of what was happening around her. “ Well, what’s fibrosis? ""I asked  her a question in return. "" It's a chronic lung disease caused due to many factors,it's kinda hard to recover from it."" Her tone sounded quite tired, more like she was forced to say that.

‘ Whoa, okay, tell me about yourself, lighten the mood up there.’ I said, wanting to interact on my first day.
Hey, what's your name?I asked, shyly, ‘ Archie, Archie Sharma, what’s yours?, she asked, with her sweetest tone, 
“
it's Aarav Shetty, I am from the south of India. I said it , with a smile on my face, I trusted her almost immediately. ‘ I am from Mumbai, Archie said, my dad came here because of business expansion, he has a brick company down here in Amsterdam, he left the Netherlands 4 months ago,to check his Indian outlet.

My mother works as a nurse in Mumbai hospital. I live alone in Amsterdam.

‘ Where do you live, I asked, not expecting a reply immediately.
I live on the 2nd floor of Keizersgracht bakery homes in  Amsterdam.' she said it with a smile, a very warm smile.

‘Oh, ok, I was so shocked that I could not move.
Then, Matt walked up to us, patted me on my back and said. “Aarav seems to be a lot more comfortable with Archie”.  Yeah, pretty much you can say that. I opened my laptop and began editing the novel I was working on. It took 2 hours to finish ch 3 and 4.

I finished the work and called Archie. ‘I should take the taxi I guess, do you have a vehicle?’ she asked, meekly and innocently. ‘ no, I came to Netherlands today, thought of taking a break but my job comes first.’ I said, as if I was a workaholic, but I hated to work for 8 hours a day, but as they say, a lie which doesn't hurt someone is never a lie, rather a ‘ cover up truth’. ‘

I'll call a taxi, I am fluent in Dutch, just don't try to talk in it.’ She laughed, sarcastically of course, as she tried to talk to me in the Dutch accent.

Kavya was waiting for me near her house, she hugged me right as I walked in, ‘Hi Aaru!, she called, excited to see me after about 2 WHOLE months in the Netherlands. Mostly she would be alone in her room in India, where she would sleep, study and talk to her friends, watch movies etc. but in Netherlands, her work did not allow her to stay introverted as she had to attend so many meetings regarding the work at the gazette, she couldn't sleep until 4 in the morning at times. I felt sad for her, she had to pull 4 All nighters to cope up with the editorial pile up she had forgotten to edit. Her eyes looked bright, just not as bright as they used to be, her hair was tied up in a messy bun, she did not like to keep them free and loved that hairstyle more than anything else.

Skincare was a must for 17 year old kavya but now she hardly gets time to wear makeup. Her voice used to sound like a nightingale, now her voice feels like it has worn out, of despair, of working as a news reporter and journalist in both India and Netherlands.
‘ Aisa lag raha hai ki sabh kuch chhod kar, ghar ajana hai’ she sighed, a deep sigh of sorrow. These were signs of depression. I patted her head and said ‘ Akka, you should take some time off  the gazette, its for the best of you’.

'Leave that, she said, inhaling sharply, where were you all day?'. 'About that, I joined Writer's cafè.' I said it, no more hiding,this secret and no being scared of consequences that were never a big deal.

'Mattew O' Neil is your boss?' Kavya asked, as if, she did not heard it the first time. 'Yes,  THE Matthew O'Neil is my boss.' I clarified it for her. ' And I heard that, You are Archie's Colleague now, how do you think, is she?

I opened my mouth, but said nothing, the silence was my answer and I slept at Kavya's for the night, i slept, unable to dream, for the first time in years.

Chapter III This can't be love 

ONE NEW MESSAGE FOR AARAV.S FROM ARCHIE.S
 
Morning Aarav, Work at 8 am today, please don't get late.

One of the biggest mistakes I have done is to get to work by Public transport (PT). Gerrard would happily give his car, but I don't have a Driver's licence yet. I called Gerrard to drop me but he was already out for work.

I climbed the tram, overcrowded on the worst day, I checked my clock, 7:40, then 7:51 as I get through the tram ' for god's sake, please move, it wouldn't kill you to help someone' I shouted, as I was squeezed in the tram.

I reached at 7:58 AM, late but not too late to be yelled at by archie, but why am I so worried about her? I brushed off that thought as I walked inside the café. 
 
'Aarav, the next time you are coming to the cafe' she said, giggling quietly ' do not trust Public transport, you will be late. She laughed, sliding a  coffee to my desk.

'Dank u! I said, in my broken Dutch, almost as if, I were trying to impress her.


It's Thank you if you have trouble saying it in Dutch, you know, you are getting quite good at this, Archie said, with an obvious hint of impression, she immediately knew that I was trying to impress her, but I had no strong feelings for her, or so I thought...

I hope these upload okay. I have included a number of screenshots to show the redesign that they've carried out on the WarhammertTV website, and to show some of the shows on offer. 

  
I saw a large post about how Games Workshop is anti-kitbashing through its designing of monopose, detailed kits. I'd like to point people in the direction of 'Scrap Demon' - essentially a nerdy Great British Bake Off (or many other old TV shows depending on your vintage!) where competitors have a minute or so to pick up sprues, and then X hours to build a themed model/diorama. It's bloody brilliant. 

  
Da Mekboy'z Workshop is a show that takes you behind the scenes at hobby board creation, and Warhammer World diorama creation. Lots of interviews with the designers and painters etc. Could be longer episodes but reminds me of the LotR behind the scenes - old school hobbying. 

  
Painting Desk is one-on-one interviews with GW employees/Slayer Sword winners, discussing their approaches to painting and hobbying, and showcasing their work. Really fun and useful stuff, and almost good to look at some of the world's best-painted/converted models!

  
There is much more, not to mention the animations which I feel most people think is all that exists on WarhammerTV (those not subscribed). 

  
For the price of a big Costa coffee a month, you get a lot of good content. Subscriber numbers were at 248k in November, up from 207k November 2024, so it's not like people don't know about it, I just feel there are plenty of you missing out and potentially being mislead by online discussion about what you can and can't do, and what GW's attitude is towards having fun in **your** hobby.

I recently tried these beans in the roastery and the flavour was just incredible. Easily the best beans I’ve ever had. The blueberry flavour was so intense and refreshing.

Anyway I bought some for myself and I’ve been trying and failing to dial them in to a similar taste for a couple of weeks now. It’s my first time trying a light Ethiopian roast and it’s certainly challenging everything I thought I knew about dialling in espresso!

The beans were roasted in January 18th and have been stored in my freezer since January 27th, fully defrosted before grinding.

I have a La Marzocco Micra and a Niche Zero grinder. The closest I’ve come to matching the flavour is using 18g in a 21g LM basket with a paper filter in the bottom, grind 18, 96c and 9 second pre-brew. Got 32g out in 32 seconds and tasted great, but the flavour still didn’t pop as much as I know it can.

1qrxpp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusinessuk/comments/1qrxpp8/advice_needed_itching_to_start_a_business_no_idea/,Advice needed - itching to start a business no idea where to start?,"Hi all, I’m hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here because my brain is full of ideas and I don’t quite know where to start…. 

I’m 32, a mum of two, and currently nearing the end of my maternity leave. During this time (usually at 2am feeds…) I’ve been thinking a lot about whether there’s a way to work for myself so I can spend more time with my kids rather than jumping straight back into my old routine.

For some context, I come from a professional background and have only ever worked for other people. I’ve never owned, opened, or even been close to starting a business, and no one in my immediate circle has either — so this whole world feels very abstract to me at the moment.

We recently moved into a brand-new housing development and it’s growing fast. There’s basically nothing here yet: one Co-op, one coffee shop, and a pharmacy. That’s it. New homes are constantly being built, more commercial units are planned over the next few years, and the area is full of young families. Schools are oversubscribed, and anything kid-related would do really well.

The nearest soft play or similar space is about a 15-minute drive away and it’s always packed. That’s what’s got my wheels turning. I keep coming back to ideas like a soft play / play café / birthday party venue / maybe even a flexible childcare or co-working-with-kids type space. Nothing fully formed yet — just a sense that there’s a genuine need here.

Where I’m completely stuck is the “how does this  actually happen?” part. Funding, premises, planning, whether this is even a realistic idea for someone with no business background… it all feels overwhelming. I’m a pretty logical person, so I think what I’m really looking for is a rough idea of the steps people actually take to get something like this off the ground.

If you’ve started a business from scratch, especially coming from a corporate/professional background or as a parent, I’d love to hear:

\- How did you even begin?

\- What did you do before spending any money?

\- And what do you wish you’d known at this early “idea generation” stage?

Thanks for reading — any advice or reality checks very welcome. ",2,1769850954.0,smallbusinessuk,9,0.75,False

I’m organizing a coffee + music sundowner in Nagpur focused on a young, lifestyle-driven crowd (students & working professionals).

Instead of charging for stalls, I want to collaborate with small local brands (coffee, desserts, fashion, skincare, art, accessories, etc.) by offering them:

• A physical spot at the venue
• Direct interaction with potential customers
• Brand visibility in a relaxed, non-salesy environment
• Content opportunities (photos/videos with crowd)
• PR from my side during the event (introductions, brand mentions, and on-ground promotion)

This is not a flea market, it’s a curated experience event, so I’ll be taking limited brands only to avoid overcrowding.

If you’re a:
– Homegrown brand
– Side hustle
– Or testing a new product

and want real customer exposure without high marketing spend, comment or DM and I’ll share details.

Instead of the usual ""let's try mini golf"" suggestion, I spent a night creating a personalized scavenger hunt around our city. Each clue referenced an inside joke or early dating memory:

- Coffee shop where I spilled espresso on her (clue hidden under ""our table"")
- Bookstore where we first said ""I love you"" (clue in the sci-fi section we were browsing)
- Park bench where we had our first real conversation (3 hours, forgot to eat dinner)

Each spot had a small challenge or question like ""Name one thing you love about us that you've never said out loud."" No gifts, no expensive stuff - just intentional time together.

The hunt took 3 hours. We laughed, remembered why we clicked, had real conversations instead of phone scrolling.

She later told her friends it was the most thoughtful thing I'd ever done. Didn't cost much, just time and attention to what made *us* unique.

In high school I had this art teacher, Mr. H. Quiet guy, wore the same brown jacket every day, always smelled like coffee and charcoal pencils. He wasn’t one of those “inspiring speech” teachers. Mostly just walked around saying stuff like “squint at it” or “stop overthinking.”

One Friday our class was being extra dead. Nobody talking, everyone tired, half the class didn’t even bring materials. He just stood there for a minute looking at us and then goes, “Okay, this isn’t working. Put your stuff down.”

We thought we were in trouble.

Instead he told us to grab our sketchbooks and follow him. Didn’t explain anything. We literally just walked out of school with this man like a confused herd. No permission slips, nothing dramatic. Just crossed the street and kept going.

He took us to this small alley behind some shops near the school  not dirty, just… normal. Brick walls, fire escape, a dented trash can, one of those tiny plants growing out of a crack in the concrete.

And he goes, “This is your assignment. Draw this place.”

We all kind of laughed because… it was just an alley. Ugly, boring, nothing special. One girl even said, “There’s nothing here.”

He just shrugged and said, “That’s the point. Sit.”

So we sat on the ground, on steps, wherever. Cars passing, people walking by staring at us like we were part of a field study. At first everyone was rushing it, but after like 10 minutes it got really quiet. You start noticing stuff when you’re forced to look.

The way the paint on the door was peeling in layers. Old gum marks on the wall. The tiny plant actually had little purple flowers. Light hitting the brick in different colors. Someone found an old sticker half torn off that had probably been there for years.

He walked around not saying much, just “look longer” and “draw what you actually see, not what you think is there.”

We were out there for almost the whole period.

On the way back he finally said, “If you can’t find anything interesting in an alley, you’re not really looking at the world yet.”

That was it. No big lesson speech.

I didn’t become an artist or anything, but I swear after that day I started noticing small stuff more. Cracks in sidewalks, reflections in windows, random details. It’s weird how a random boring alley is one of the strongest memories I have from school.

But over time she started treating my belongings like they were hers. She borrowed my laptop and returned it later with a cracked screen. Used my car without asking and brought it back with an empty tank and a dent in the bumper that she swore was already there. Took my winter coat jacket I got off alibaba and forgot at the coffee shop, i had to go get it back myself
Every time I confronted her she'd give me the same """"oh my god you're so dramatic it's not that serious"""" and that she'll pay me back but she never did. I was out like $400 in damages at this point and she owed me for gas money, the laptop repair, everything.
So I decided that two can play at that game. She was super weird about her bedroom being her private space and had this expensive skincare routine she was obsessed with.

Nag-start ako ng home workout, IF + calorie deficit, at walking from office to home simula January 1. Hindi ako nagkaroon ng drastic na pagbabago sa lifestyle ko, paunti-unti lang, kasi alam kong mas sustainable ’yon para sa’kin.  
Hindi rin ako naging super consistent sa walking dahil minsan, pagod na talaga physically sa work.

Unti-unti rin akong nagbawas sa coffee intake ko. Dati, 1 twin pack ng 3-in-1 instant coffee ang iniinom ko araw-araw. Naging black coffee with konting sugar, hanggang sa after ilang days, pure black coffee na lang.

Nag-build din ako ng routine na gradual ang changes. Day 1 pa lang, imbes na pagkagising ay hawak agad ang phone, hindi ko muna ito hinahawakan. Tumitayo muna ako para uminom ng tubig na may konting asin. Hanggang sa unti-unti ko nang na-incorporate ang home workout sa routine ko, 25–30 minutes per day, walang mintis.  
*Side note lang:* malaking tulong sa’kin ang pagbabasa ng Atomic Habits by James Clear pagdating sa pag-build ng routine.

Pinaka-challenging talaga para sa’kin ang calorie deficit, lalo na bilang isang matakaw at hindi metikuloso na tao. Alam kong susuko agad ako kung pipilitin kong timbangin lahat ng kinakain ko. Kaya ang ginawa ko, minaximize ko si ChatGPT para mag-compute ng calorie intake ko. Buti na lang marunong akong magluto, ililista ko lang lahat ng ingredients, si ChatGPT na ang bahala.

Hindi rin naman talaga maiiwasan na may gusto kang kainin na “bawal.” Imbes na mag-suffer psychologically, pinaplano ko na lang. Kumakain pa rin ako ng gusto ko, pero sinisigurado kong pasok pa rin sa daily calorie intake ko.

Hindi ako nag-weigh nung mismong start ko, pero noong January 13, nasa 78 kg ako. Ngayon, end of January, 73 kg na ako.

Next goal ko naman this coming February ay journaling, i-lo-log ko lahat: ginagawa ko, kinakain ko, at kahit maliliit na detalye.",6,1769849693.0,FirstTimeKo,1,1.0,False

It logs footsteps, pacing, and one entry labeled “standing still”...","I use a sleep app because I don’t sleep well.

Nothing dramatic. I just wake up tired no matter how early I go to bed. The app tracks movement and sound using my phone’s sensors. It’s supposed to help identify patterns. Restlessness. Snoring. Sleep talking. Things like that.

I don’t obsess over the data. I check it in the morning, glance at the score, move on.

Until last week.

Last Tuesday, the app flagged my night as “highly disrupted.” That surprised me. I remembered sleeping straight through. No dreams. No waking up to use the bathroom. No grogginess at 3 a.m. staring at the ceiling.

When I opened the timeline, I frowned.

From 2:11 a.m. to 3:04 a.m., the app showed continuous activity.

Not brief spikes. Not rolling over.

Sustained movement.

The breakdown listed categories beneath the graph.

• walking
• footsteps
• pacing

I stared at the screen, trying to map it onto memory. There was nothing there. No hazy recollection. No sense of lost time.

I checked the audio snippets. The app automatically records short clips when it detects sound.

Most nights, it’s nothing. A cough. Fabric rustling. Sometimes my breathing.

This time, the clips were… different.

One was just quiet room noise. Then, halfway through, a soft thump. Another thump. Evenly spaced.

Footsteps.

Not loud. Not rushed. The kind of sound someone makes when they’re barefoot and trying not to wake anyone.

I sat up in bed, suddenly very aware of the room around me.

I live alone.

The next clip was longer.

Slow movement. A faint creak. Something brushing against fabric.

At the bottom of the timeline, one label stood out.

“Standing still”
Duration: 14 minutes.

I laughed under my breath. The app mislabels things sometimes. If the phone detects subtle vibration without enough motion, it guesses.

Still, I checked the timestamp.

2:38 a.m. to 2:52 a.m.

Fourteen minutes.

I don’t stand in my bedroom for fourteen minutes in the middle of the night.

I told myself it had to be sleepwalking. People do that without remembering. I googled it, read a few articles, reassured myself with medical explanations that felt solid enough to lean on.

That explanation lasted exactly one more night.

Because the next morning, the app showed it again.

Different times. Same pattern.

Footsteps. Pacing. Then:

Standing still
Duration: 22 minutes.

This time, I noticed something else.

The “standing still” entry wasn’t labeled as me.

The app usually tags movement as “user activity.”

This one was tagged “external presence.”

I checked the settings.

That category didn’t exist. Not anywhere in the app’s documentation. Not in the help section. Not in the permissions.

I tried deleting the data.

It reappeared when I refreshed.

I slept with the lights on after that.

The activity didn’t stop.

It got more precise.

Last night, the timeline showed pacing that followed a straight line. Back and forth. Back and forth. Same distance. Same rhythm.

Like someone walking between two points.

And then, just before 4 a.m., the longest entry yet.

Standing still
Duration: 41 minutes.

I didn’t wake up.

I know that because the app logs awakenings too. My heart rate never spiked. My breathing stayed slow and steady.

But when I listened to the audio clip from that period, my mouth went dry.

There was no movement.

No breathing near the phone.

Just silence.

And beneath it, very faintly, the sound of fabric tightening.

Like someone standing close enough to the bed that their clothes brushed against it.

This morning, I found my phone on the dresser.

I always leave it on the nightstand.

And when I checked the app again, there was a new note under last night’s data.

Not a label.

Not a metric.

Just a sentence.

“Movement complete. Subject remained asleep.”

Tonight, I’m scared to go to bed.

Not because I think something will wake me.

But because whatever is moving around my room seems to prefer it when I don’t.

I didn’t delete the app.

That’s the part that bothers me now. I told myself I needed the data. That if something was wrong, I should document it instead of pretending it wasn’t happening. The truth was simpler. The app felt like the only thing acknowledging what was happening while I slept.

I went to bed earlier than usual that night.

Lights on. Door locked. Phone placed deliberately on the nightstand, screen facing up. I even angled it slightly, like that might help it see better.

I lay there for a long time, staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to take me before I could change my mind.

I don’t remember falling asleep.

I woke up to daylight.

That alone should have been comforting.

Instead, my first thought was the app.

I reached for my phone and opened it before I even sat up.

The timeline loaded slowly, like it was buffering something heavy.

From 1:57 a.m. to 2:19 a.m., the graph showed pacing again. Same straight-line pattern. Same interval. Back and forth.

Then the label appeared.

Standing still
Duration: 32 minutes.

I scrolled.

There was a new category now.

Not bolded. Not highlighted.

Indented beneath the others, like it hadn’t been there before.

• proximity detected

My chest tightened.

I tapped it.

A sub-note expanded beneath the entry.

Distance: <1 meter
Orientation: facing user

I dropped the phone.

It clattered against the floor and skidded under the bed. The sound echoed too loudly in the quiet room. I sat there, breathing hard, trying to convince myself this was still software. Still lines of code making guesses based on imperfect sensors.

I retrieved the phone and checked the audio clip again.

This time, I noticed something I hadn’t before.

Near the end of the recording, after the silence stretched long enough to feel intentional, there was a sound I’d missed.

A soft exhale.

Not into the phone.

Across the room.

Like someone releasing a breath they’d been holding.

I didn’t go to work that day.

I moved through the apartment slowly, paying attention to things I’d never questioned before. The distance from the bed to the dresser. The space between the foot of the bed and the wall. The faint scuff marks on the floor that I’d always assumed were mine.

They lined up with the pacing path.

That night, I tried something different.

I put the phone on the floor, leaning it against the bedframe, microphone unobstructed. If something was standing there, I wanted proof that wasn’t filtered through summaries and labels.

I slept badly.

Dreamed of being watched without seeing anyone.

In the morning, my body felt heavy, like I’d been tense for hours without moving.

The app logged everything again.

Footsteps.
Pacing.
Standing still.

But the audio file from the longest entry was gone.

Not corrupted. Not silent.

Missing.

In its place was a system note.

Audio suppressed due to proximity.

Below that, a final line.

User remained undisturbed.

My phone was back on the nightstand.

Plugged in.

And the battery was at 100 percent.

Even though I distinctly remembered it dying sometime during the night.

I stood there for a long time, holding it, trying to decide what scared me more.

That something was moving while I slept.

Or that it was careful enough to make sure I didn’t wake up.

I didn’t sleep in my bed that night.

I dragged a blanket into the living room and lay on the couch with the lights on, phone in my hand, volume turned all the way up. I told myself that if something moved again, I’d hear it. If it stood too close, I’d feel it.

I fell asleep anyway.

That’s the part I still don’t understand.

I woke up just before dawn, stiff and disoriented, the blanket half on the floor. My phone was on the coffee table, not in my hand. I don’t remember putting it there.

I opened the app.

There was no pacing this time.

No footsteps.

Just one long entry.

Standing still
Duration: 3 hours, 12 minutes.

The proximity note was there again.

Distance: <0.5 meters
Orientation: facing user

I scrolled further down.

There was a new section beneath the data. Smaller text. Not styled like the rest of the app.

Sleep position adjusted for comfort.
Obstructions removed.
Monitoring successful.

I sat up slowly and looked around the living room.

The coffee table had been moved a few centimeters farther from the couch. The lamp was angled slightly downward, aimed at where my head rested. A pillow I hadn’t brought with me was tucked under my neck, positioned just right.

I don’t own that pillow.

I checked the audio.

There was nothing.

No movement. No breathing. No ambient noise at all.

Just a faint sound at the very beginning of the recording. A soft shuffle. Like fabric settling.

After that, silence.

That morning, I deleted the app.

Not just uninstalled it. I wiped the data. Removed permissions. Reset my phone. I needed something decisive, something that felt like taking control back.

The phone restarted clean.

No apps. No logs.

That should have been the end.

Last night, I woke up around 3 a.m. without knowing why.

The room was dark. The apartment quiet. My heart was calm, like my body hadn’t panicked yet.

I didn’t move.

I didn’t need to.

I could feel it.

The weight of attention.

The sense of someone standing close enough that the air around my face felt different. Warmer. Displaced.

I stared at the ceiling and waited.

Nothing touched me.

Nothing spoke.

Eventually, I fell back asleep.

This morning, my phone was on the nightstand.

Plugged in.

Fully charged.

On the screen was a single notification from an app I no longer have.

No icon. No sender.

Just text.

Rest quality improved.
No intervention required.

I don’t track my sleep anymore.

I don’t need to.

Whatever stands beside my bed has already learned when I’m most comfortable.

1qrx9hk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrx9hk,"The History of Sinigang (Part 2: American to Modern-day, Recipes)","This is Part 2 so if you want to read Part 1, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoHistory/comments/1qrx9dr/the_history_of_sinigang_part_1_introduction/).

Eventually, the Americans won and hence, the start of the American period. Culinarily, it seems nothing significant was added in the creation of sinigang (Image 11). There came refrigerators and freezing though this is mostly in cities. The barrios still retained the old ways for now. With this, people from the provinces would migrate to cities like Manila which made it more popular.^(43) This explains the recipes in the early 20th century to be shown in this article. There is the 1918 cookbook Condimentos Indigenas by Pura Villanueva Kalaw that mentions sinigang not just as the recipe title (to be shared later) but also an instruction in making another dish: Pollo en Pepitoria as follows:

>Para este guiso puede usarse el remanente de pollo frito o del sinigang.^(44)

Of course, Rizal was not the only person to have a connection with Sinigang but also Philippine Commonwealth President Manuel Luis Quezon from Tayabas (now Quezon). There are many anecdotes that mention Mr. Quezon and Sinigang.

One is from the memoirs of Dr. Victor Buencamino as follows

>You'd think Quezon was a little-time *provinciano* \[province man\] just out of Baler \[in the province Tayabas (now Quezon), now in the province of Aurora\] when he was with us on Manga avenue \[in Manila\]. He liked to be completely casual. He moved about the house in *chinelas* \[slippers\], sometimes just in underwear. No gourmet, he liked the old Filipino common dishes: *sinigang*, *adobo*, *sinañgag* \[garlic fried rice\] and *tinapa* in the morning.^(45)

One is from an article by the Philippines Free Press written by Quijano de Manila. It talks about the experiences of Nonong with his father, Manuel Quezon with mentions of food as follows:

>Nonong says his father often called up Letran to ask what the Fathers were having for lunch. If the answer was “cocido”, Don Manuel would say: “Then wait for me. I’m going right over to eat your cocido!” / Cocido Espanol, says Nonong, was his father’s favorite dish. Don Manuel also liked sinigang and inihaw na isda; and when the fare was native he loved eating with his fingers. Being a Tayabeno, he had a taste for deer’s meat, dried and fried, and eaten with champorado. He wanted his hot chocolate in the Spanish style: thick enough to cut \[through\]. But he had been Americanized enough to be a morning-coffee addict, and a \[coffee\] percolator graced the Quezon's breakfast table long before coffee became fashionable among the local gentry.^(46)

Another is from Federico V. Principe as a Tayabanese and friend with interesting food as follows:

>We had a regular cook for Quezon whose number one favorite dish was **sinampalokang pawikan** (deep sea turtle cooked with sampaloc leaves). Other dishes he favored included **inihaw na sebo** with calamansi juice, **calderetang kambing, rellenong manok, adobo** and **pinangat** (dried fish wrapt in gabi leaves steamed in coconut milk).^(47)

Most detailed is the record of Manuel’s health-aide Sergio R. Mistica (Image 12). It was mentioned numerous times as follows:

>The family was fond of native dishes, their favorites being **adobo, sinigang and tinute** (leaves of a plant akin to gabi, broiled in coconut milk, sometimes with some local fresh fish and at times simply leaves alone). Only convention could compel them to change to foreign delicacies. Due to the malady \[tuberculosis\] which afflicted him, however, the President limited his diet to eggs, milk and coffee. In the afternoon, he took tea with cream. His agua tiempo \[room temperature water\] was “Vichy” or “Evian”.^(48)

>The \[University of the Philippines Manila\] program \[at the Malacanan Palace\] ended, the President, after the customary preliminaries, stood up to welcome the guests, thanked them for their kindness in coming, for the interesting and really exciting program just finished, and, with his usual wit and sarcastic flair, concluded: “Aming napagkasunduang magasawa na handaan kayo nang pinakagigiliwan nating kakaning Pilipino, katulad nang linagang manok, lechon, adobo, sinigang at iba pa, subali’t nang tanungin namin ang kusinero ay ang sagot sa amin ay hindi pa daw nakayayari nang kawa, palayok at iba pang kasangkapan sa pagluluto na maaaring lumulan nang lulutuing pagkain na magkakasiya sa mahigit na walong libong kakain. Kaya’t ganito na lamang ang aming inihanda sa inyo. Kayo na ang bahalang magdagdag sa aming kakulangan.”... His short remarks were met with the most enthusiastic ovation, principally for the fun in it and, incidentally, for the certainty that, at least, the precious moment had arrived when the guests would hear the most hoped-for and enlivening announcement of the day, “Lunch is served!” / The much awaited menu consisted of a half chicken fried to suit any delicate taste, sandwiches, cakes and cookies, fruits and sweets, all carefully arranged and fitted in a carton, the size and shape of a shoe box, and enough to fill the average hungry stomach to excess. Ice cream was served in abundance. Appetites satisfied, the thick crowd was ushered by turns across the river to the Palace proper through the lone ferry boat.^(49)

>A group of Filipino friends was invited by President Quezon for lunch on board the “Casiana”. Advance notice was given \[to\] the steward who hastily prepared a good menu. / The table set, the President and \[his\] guests took their places around the dining table. The President, seeing the \[food\] courses before him, instead of beginning to eat, asked for the steward. The guests, with due respect likewise refrained from commencing lunch and with great interest, waited for what was likely to happen, viewed from the President’s behavior \[point-of-view\]. / “What do you think we are, Americans?” the President bawled at the steward as the latter approached. Without waiting for an answer, the President continued, “Now, don’t just stand there; give us “itlog na maalat” (seasoned \[salted\] eggs) with tomatoes, adobo and sinigang. And hurry!”^(50)

>The steward left with haste while the President continued mumbling curses, ordering some other waiters to clear the table. / Apparently, what the stewards served them were American dishes, and evidently, the President did not like to depart from his age-old preference for native delicacies.^(51)

Then, World War 2 came and it became a destitute time for the Filipinos given the subsistence meals.

One such subsistence meal is sinigang na kamatsili at suso, along with others most interestingly binatog (nilagang mais na putok na ang sahog ay niyog at asin) and kastaniog (inihaw na niyog).^(52)

The cities certainly suffered more in terms of food although the farms did suffer. Remember that last name, Alfon. Here is her although I do not know if they are related. Maybe. Anyways, writer Estrella Alfon wrote of her experiences in Compostela, Cebu with the following food story:

>I suppose, to all of us, sometimes there comes a dream. Of being at peace with one’s neighbors and the whole world nature created. Of forgetting what ambition is beyond eating today’s meal whether it is fish sweet with the freshness of the sea, or shrimps caught with bare hands from under the stones in the path of the whispering stream, or one of my precious well-beloved chickens brought to be a boil and flavored with the minty tang of the tanglad grasses growing in abundance on the hills. / That was Compostela. Under the coconut trees yielding fruit of unsurpassed coolness and bland flavor, listening to the wind passing through the walls fashioned of coconut leaves interwoven by deft fingers; in the nights listening to men and birds in varied serenades; partaking of giant lanka \[jackfruit\] with the pulp exuding aroma like perfume, such a feast so typical of the bounties of nature; the sweet tamarind, the thick fleshy pulp of siniguelas; all of that, a dream well-remembered… And I ask myself, where again and in what time will I find a place like Compostela?^(53)

The chicken with tanglad is a Cebuano chicken tinola. The fish and shrimp are what we want for a sinigang. 

Post-World War 2, there would be an industrialization boom which would pollute the riversides and cause deforestation. This would make live fishes not possible for cooking sinigang (Image 13). Refrigeration certainly spread into the provinces allowing for the fish and meat to be frozen which is different from fresh meat and fish. This makes sense due to work opportunities increasing. At the same time, many Filipinos would emigrate to the United States for better opportunities. There too would be the start of the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), some of whom would not be able to return home for a long time. They crave for the delights of the Philippines such as sinigang. Back then, there were limited ingredients that would have made for the sinigang in the Philippines. Hence, ingredients there were used. One example being: 

>At a Fil-American table in Alaska, *sinigang* was made with salmon head and lemon… Soon after, salmon heads were sold to the Philippines because the diaspora *sinigang* became a \[Philippine\] homeland hit.^(54)

Despite this, there is still the urge to have sinigang the way their ancestors did and this brings us to the story of Teresita ""Mama Sita"" C. Reyes, daughter of Engracia ""Aling Asiang"" Reyes, founder of the Aristocrat restaurant as follows:

>""She would travel regularly to the US to visit her relatives that were there. Mahilig siyang magluto, so she would cook for them. Naaawa kasi siya ng puro hotdog at hamburger ang kinakain nila doon, so she would cook Filipino food,"" says Ramon \[Reyes, son of Mama Sita\]. The only problem was that it was difficult to cook certain dishes – like sinigang, for instance, because bayabas and tamarind (sampaloc) did not grow \[where they lived\] in the US. So she had to content herself with using lemon. / But Mama Sita believed that there had to be a better alternative. ""So when she came back to the Philippines, she talked to her son-in-law (Bart Lapus, husband of daughter Clara) about coming up with a powdered sinigang mix so that Filipinos could have their favorite dish even when abroad,"" says Ramon.^(55) 

With that, in 1980, the brand Mama Sita’s was born and its first product: the sinigang mix with tamarind. This success would encourage other companies in the Philippines to do the same like the White King Sinigang Broth in 1983 as shown in Image 14. 

There is even an American celebrity, Priscilla Presley, trying it in January of 1982 in Kamayan Restaurant as shown in Image 15. 

With that, in 1990, there is this story that mentions sinigang wittily regarding fashion designer Gang Gomez as follows:

>When news broke out that Gang Gomez officially entered the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay \[in Bukidnon\], some monks from the founding Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in Manila went on speculating whether the famous designer would be allowed to keep his nickname… To retain “Gang,” he had to take as \[his\] patron saint either Wolfgang… or Chrodegang (an eighth century French Bishop \[also kinsmen of Charles Martel\]). A nationalist suggested something Philippine–how about *Sinigang*? Gang Gomez… was… given the name “Martin” and is now known as Dom Martin de Jesus…^(56)

Interestingly, Doreen noted in her book Tikim (1994):

>Packaged sinigang mixes are not much used in the Philippines; they are for Filipinos abroad who do not have access to the landscape.^(57)

Eventually, due to their convenience, sinigang mixes would become popular in the provinces, and hence the standard for the typical sinigang many would encounter. Why spend 10 to 20 minutes making tamarind broth if you can put the sinigang mix and simply boil it? Indeed, more modern varieties of sinigang would spread like Sinigang na Short Rib and Watermelon and Sinigang na Corned Beef.^(58)

With that, let us look at five recipes for sinigang in old Philippine cookbooks as arranged in chronological order:

1. ‘Linaga o Sinigang de Carne’ of ‘Pura Villanueva Kalaw’ (p. 67) (Image 16) from ‘Condimentos Indigenas’ (1918) by Pura Villanueva Kalaw 
2. ‘Sinigang na baboy’ & ‘Sinigang na baka’ (p. 100) (Image 17) from ‘Aklat ng Pagluluto’ (1919, first edition 1916) by Rosendo Ignacio - if you want to see how it is made, the Lost Filipino Cookbook did it already.^(59) Unfortunately, it is no longer being posted on ad infinitum^(60) and is now in The Histolinarya Collective.^(61)
3. ‘Sinigang Fish’, ‘Sinigang (No. 1)’, ‘Sinigang (No. 2)’ & ‘Sinigang (No. 3)’ of ‘Tomasa Goduco’ & ‘Cornelia Santos’ (p. 29) (Image 18) from ‘Good Cooking and Health in the Tropics’ (1937, second, 1922, first) by Elsie Gaches
4. ‘Sinigang na Tinapa’ (p. 71) (Image 19) from ‘Mga Pagkain sa Ikalulusog ng Katawan’ (1938) 
5. ‘Sinigang na ulo ng isda’ (p. 18) (Image 20) from ‘Mga Lutong Pilipino Aklat ng Pagluluto’ (1949) by Iluminada M. Luna

With that, I have here interesting dishes that may or may not be a different form of sinigang, the ‘unsure-if-sinigang’ dishes:

In a May 26, 1830 letter from the businessman Hugh Hamilton Lindsay, companion of Paul Proust de La Gironière, it talks about a visit to the cave of San-Matteo (now San Mateo, Rizal) in the neighbourhood of Manilla (Manila). An interesting portion is one about a dish he notices as follows:

>I must not forget here to make honourable mention of the delicious fish with which we were regaled, as there is something peculiar both in the mode of catching and dressing them. The water of the river is clear as crystal, and in some places very deep, and when the fish are playing on the surface, an Indian \[indio\] dives to the bottom and, rising directly under them, catches the fish in his hand with surprising dexterity; and the mode of dressing them is one certainly deserving the admiration of the whole race of gourmands. A few joints of the green bamboo, about two feet long, are cut, into which the fish is thrust, with some leaves of an herb much resembling sorrel, a few pimentos \[cherry peppers\], and other spices, and a little water is also put in; the mouth of the \[bamboo\] cane is then stuffed with leaves, and it is put, into the middle of a hot fire; as soon as the bamboo begins to burn, the fish is dressed, and I will defy any restorateur \[*sic*\] of Paris or Amsterdam to produce a better water-souchy \[an English dish consisting of small fish stewed and served in a small amount of water\] than we eat that morning.^(62,63)

Admittedly, this could be an interesting version of escabeche.

I found another potential beef sinigang in ‘America is in the Heart’ by Carlos Bulosan where he described his childhood working in his family’s farm at the barrio of Binalonan, Pangasinan. This is the dish as follows:

>The night came at last and darkness filled the house; except for the tiny needles of light that filtered through the walls from the sky, there was no other illumination. I found the small oil lamp where my father kept it in the bamboo rack under the homemade pillows. I lighted \[*sic*\] it and went to the kitchen. There was no food left. I went to the rice bin and filled the cooking pot. I prepared string beans and mixed them with small slices of beef. When the pot began to bubble on the roaring stove, I heard my father and brother coming noisily through the gate with their implements. They went to the water trough to wash their feet and hands; then they came into the house and asked me if dinner was ready. / We sat on the floor and ate in the twilight with our bare hands. We spread the salted fish on the steaming rice and soaked it with the broth from the vegetable pot.^(64)

Given the mention of beef, string beans, and vegetable pot, it could have also been nilaga but this is uncertain.

I hope this fills you up and, unfortunately, this would be my last post regarding the comprehensive history of Philippine food. I also realize that this is my longest which I admit I am surprised but glad to have done so. Hopefully, this would inspire more to come from others.

After all, in the words of Doreen Fernandez:

I (30F) feel lonely. I’m so ready to make friendships in my new city, but I’m feeling drained from all the effort I’ve put it. It’s got me feeling down and doubting my choices. About a year ago I moved across the country from the East Coast to the West Coast. It wasn’t for any specific reason or obligation other than I chance to shake things up and try something new.

Life in my home state was comfortable. I had my family, a solid group of friends I met in college, and I was building my career. And yet something felt off. I grew up there, went to college there, and spent my first few years as a young adult there. My job was draining me and when I got laid off, it felt like an opportunity to start a new chapter somewhere else. The hardest part was the idea of leaving my friends but even that felt necessary. It’s hard to explain, but my friend group did not have the best boundaries. We hung out a lot (multiple times a week) and I never felt like I had the opportunity to explore my own interests and “find myself” as an adult. My social life kinda felt like an extension of college for that reason. I’m also a creative person and for years felt so uninspired and disconnected from that part of myself. My partner felt the same lack of enthusiasm about where we lived and was equally amped at the idea of a new beginning. All this to say, a move felt like….the move!

As background, my partner and I had visited the West Coast a number of times, visiting several different cities. We both fell in love with it! The cities, the food, the NATURE! It all felt so vibrant and lush! The culture of the West Coast also seemed to align better with who I am as a person than that of my home state (I always felt like the black sheep there). We both yearned to get out here at some point and when my job came to a halt, we both knew it was time.

Leading up to the move, so many serendipitous things kept happening and it truly felt like the universe was working for my good and validating this huge decision I had made! I got a job that agreed to let me work remotely so I wouldn’t have to stress about finding a job once I moved, we found an amazing apartment in our preferred neighborhood that was more spacious and cheaper that our old one, I learned my old professor had moved out here and they offered to help me find a local job when I was ready, my partner was even able to keep their job remotely (which we never thought was possible). Overall I felt great entering this new chapter and I just knew things were going to work out! This was when my life would really begin!

Fast forward to now and I’m a couple weeks away from hitting the first year mark and I just feel….lonely. Things could be so much worse and I need to keep that in perspective, but it’s just been hard to feel like everything is clicking. Finding community has been hard and I have tried putting myself out there in so many ways. I attend social events, joined clubs/workshops, go to neighborhood events, professional networking, even joined a board! But even still, I’m not making as many friendships as I would have hoped. I find myself feeling so awkward and self conscious. Every event I go to I walk away feeling anxious and insecure, overthinking everything I did and said. The few friendships I have feel so surface level, which I know is to be expected, but still makes me sad.

Working remotely does not help. I’m grateful to have a job, but I’m sick of being in my house all day. I can’t exactly work from a coffee shop bc I have the kind of job where I need 3 computer screens. I work in a creative field that I’m actually really passionate about, but it’s so hard to feel connected to the work when I’m not able to be as hands on. I know I need to find a new job in person, but I’m close to getting a promotion and logically it makes sense to wait so I can enter the job market at a higher paid position. I’m also feeling pretty unmotivated to start the job search because I’m feeling so overwhelmed in other aspects of life.

At this point I’m living for the weekends, but even then, I feel like 99% of the time I’m only with my partner and our relationship is taking a toll. We both take our frustrations out on each other and have become super codependent (particularly me). All of this is causing my mental and physical health to decline. When I talk to my friends and family back home, my heart just breaks because I miss them so much. I often wonder if I made a mistake uprooting myself. My partner has settled much more seamlessly (other than the fact that we spend way too much time together). I think part of the reason is because they are more introverted than me and feel satisfied exploring their hobbies at home. I feel jealous that I can’t feel as content when I wanted this so badly.

We visited our home state over Christmas and it felt so good to connect with our people. We visited our old neighborhood and I was so curious to see how I felt. Overall, I was surprised that I didn’t seem to miss the place at all! It made me realize it’s really only the people I miss. In contrast, here I feel so much more connected to the place (I absolutely love our neighborhood/access to nature), but don’t have the people connections I need to thrive.

The worst part is I know what I want the solution to be: use this time to really focus on myself: Lean into my hobbies, reconnect with myself, make art, read more, be bad at something, learn to love myself. The problem is my heart is aching and it’s making it hard to stick to a routine and stay motivated. 

Just feeling lonely and doubting my decision. I’m hoping I just need more time. I’m willing to let the seeds I’ve planted grow, but just need some encouragement while I wait. Let me know if you have had a similar experience and if you felt the wait was worth it.",2,1769849211.0,lonely,1,1.0,False
1qrx7x0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrx7x0,"Past couple of weeks; Tasmania, Australia","I'm feeling exhausted as always, but I'm feeling a bit more present. I was going to stop all this treatment, throw in the towel, but I guess even if everything is unsuccessful at the end, I'll still have the same outcome as if I left now. At least in here it's a guaranteed roof over my head, and I don't think leaving AMA is recommended by most doctors, no matter how futile this feels.

1. Cottage pie, veggies, and apple crumble
2. Random meat, veg, custard (I was asleep when the menus arrived and also when they were collected a few hours later, so idk what any of that and the next picture was)
3. Chicken stew, veggies, custard and something pastry? And honeycomb milk
4.egg sandwich, pumpkin soup, and custard.
5. Mixed sandwiches, and pineapple crepe
6. Fancy granola
7. Weetbix
8. TWO??? Honeycomb milks (no idea why there was two. The kitchen must just love me I guess)
9. Mixed canned fruit in juice
10. Vegetable pasta, honeycomb milk, and a pathetic thank you note.
11. The coffee I was choking down
12. Berry yoghurt, sandwiches, I drew a sandcastle and a king crab.
13. More mixed canned fruit 
14. Mixed sandwiches and honeycomb milk
15. Leek soup, egg sandwiches, and orange slices 
16. More fancy granola
17. Toast with butter and jam
18. Sandwiches, fruit salad, choco milk
19. Egg sandwich, strawberry milk.

If I don't fill out the menu they just send full standard meals up anyways, so I realised that if I just order a sandwich then that'll be less dishes for them to do and less food waste than the standard hot meals. 

Highlight is the hoard of seagulls I drew on slide 15 feinding over some hot chips. 


I haven't been able to tolerate the ng feed rate, so they had to lower it from 80ml to 60ml pH, they have changed the formula to a more concentrated one, so I'm still getting similar amount of nutrients, just slower. Helps with the nausea a little. Swallowing is starting to get difficult for some reason. i tried to have a coffee (worth it. Momentary coffee is worth feeling sick for and I will die on this hill) and it was like my throat just didn't want to and every so often I'd choke on it a bit, so that's not promising.

No end in sight, unless I give up and throw in the towel. The doctors have told me when we met at the end of the week that they would prefer I stay, but understand if I can't do this anymore and would like to go. I've been frequently in hospitals for the past 6 years and it does get exhausting. Nobody visits anymore, and I am so very exhausted. I think I might try and post regularly on here again, it is something to do. The most effort I put into any day is the little notes.

Hey guys, so I'm kind of at a loss what to do. I need serious help.

I don’t think my friends are human anymore.

Is this possession? Are they sick???? What the fuck do I even say????

It began around a month ago. 

I started losing time. Long stretches of time, whether it was night or day. 

I’d go to class or to the library to study, and suddenly wake up at home. I didn’t remember walking back or what I’d been doing in that missing stretch of time.

I thought it was stress-related or maybe health-related, so I went to see the campus doctor. But he just prescribed me sleeping pills and asked me questions about my diet and lifestyle, as if that had anything to do with the fact that I was blacking out for hours at a time with no recollection of what I had been doing.

It was the same every time. 

I woke up in bed with a gnawing hunger in my gut, like I hadn’t eaten in weeks, and no memory of how I got there.

For reasons which baffled me, the three of them were suddenly sensitive to the moon.

And I don’t mean that it caused them headaches or nausea. I mean it affected them in ways which didn’t make sense.

Have you ever heard of the Transylvania Effect?

According to Discovery Magazine:

“In the dark sky, the clouds shift, revealing the full moon’s eerie silver gleam, and the people on Earth below go mad.”

I wouldn’t have called it going mad, but something was wrong with them.

Different.

And it’s always the full moon that triggers it. Which made me wonder if it was, in fact, the Transylvania Effect.

I first noticed it at Abigail Matheson’s house party. The party was nothing special, really. 

I didn’t drink that much that night. 

The point is, I can’t blame what I saw on being drunk.

I know perception can be misinterpreted and messed up when you’ve had one too many canned Strawberry Daiquiris, but I was completely sober.

And I was planning on staying that way until we left.

I remember the night in clarity. I’m not a fan of crowds, so I lingered in Abigail’s kitchen playing around on my phone.

I only knew Abigail Matheson from Rowan and Immie. They were in the same classes.

I needed to find something to occupy my mind or I was going to die of boredom.

Most of the party was in the living room playing Mario Kart, and I was refilling my glass when I glimpsed Immie’s familiar blonde ponytail bouncing through straggling students grinding against each other.

The party wasn’t costume-themed, but Immie insisted on wearing a baby blue ribbon in her hair, which reminded me of a grown Disney character.

Imogen Prairie was the human embodiment of a golden retriever.

She is as adorable as she is naïve and is always smiling no matter the situation.

I lifted my drink in greeting, about to shout her name, but then I saw the expression on her face.

She looked… wary.

No, that’s not the word. 

I can’t describe her expression because I couldn’t understand it myself. 

For once, Imogen wasn’t smiling. Her eyes were wide, lips twitching into a scowl.

Her movements were erratic as she headed into the kitchen, grabbing a glass of punch and downing it before striding towards the back window and pulling the blinds shut.

Rowan, roommate number two, was right behind her.

They were talking in hushed whispers, their heads pressed together before Rowan noticed me.

Rowan was what you would call pretentious cute.

Usually dressed in trench coats, his party outfit was oddly normal.

Shirt and jeans, a loose pair of glasses sitting on top of unruly brown curls.

Rowan Beck resembled what *he* called a ‘normie’.

He fixed me with what I can only describe as a patient smile. “Nin! Have you seen Kaz?”

The copious amounts of lemonade I’d been drinking all night started to crawl back up my throat.

His tone was different. Darker. Nothing like I knew.

That was the first night I noticed something was wrong with him.

“Huh?” I said stupidly. “Kaz?”

Rowan raised a brow. “Yep. Kazzzz.” He dragged out the Z. “The guy you *live* with. Have you seen him anywhere?”

“I don't think so.” I caught his sharp glance at the blinds. “Rowan, are you… okay?”

The man's gaze snapped to me. 

“I'm peachy.”

Rowan leaned against the table, his expression darkening. I sensed the desperation emitting from him, but it didn’t make sense. Was Kaz in trouble? 

And why were they keeping it between them? What were we, little kids? 

His expression was sour, like he couldn't bear talking to me. “Did Kaz by any chance… I don't know,” he tapped out a tune on the countertop. “Mayyyybeee go outside?”

Our third roomie had been MIA since the four of us walked in earlier. 

He made a comment about going to talk to a guy he was crushing on before disappearing into the crowd. 

I hadn’t seen him since. Which was very unlike Kaz. 

When it comes to games, or anything playable, he’s a competitive bastard. 

I expected him to be in the living room with the others, slamming buttons like his life depended on it. Instead, he was nowhere to be seen. 

I opened my mouth to speak, when Immie stuck her head through the gap in the door. 

“He’s fine!” Immie said, a streak of panic in her tone. She shooed me back when I started forwards. “We’ve got this. Kaz is just, uh, well, he's doing Kaz stuff.”

“Kaz *stuff*?”

“Yeah!” Imogen’s smile was a little too big. “Like I said, we’ve got this.”

“Have we?” Rowan snapped. He raked his fingernails down his face. “How do you lose a 23 year old guy?”

Immie scowled, throwing a cup in his face. 

“He told me he was going to the bathroom.” She said, “It’s not like I could follow him.”

Rowan tossed a cup right back at her. “In these circumstances, yes, you should have followed him!” Lowering his voice, Rowan pulled her closer. But I still heard him. “He could *drown!* What did I tell you about keeping the idiot away from the pool?” 

Imogen scoffed. “I'm sorry, how is that fair? Why don't *you* babysit?”

“You offered.”

“Yeah, not for the whole night!”

Their argument was barely registering. 

*Drown?*

“Nin. You stay here.” Immie grabbed a reluctant Rowan’s arm.  “We’ll go get him.”

I nodded with a smile, but that didn’t stop me following them. 

I made it to the front door, almost tripping over myself. 

The party continued behind me, laughter, and giddy screaming from the living room. 

In front of me, however, was something entirely different from the party. 

The front door was wide open, and the night sky bled inside the house. 

My three roommates  stood on the threshold, their heads tipped back, eyes on the night sky, and the full moon bathing the dark in unearthly light. 

I’ve looked this phenomenon up, and it can be called “Moon drunk” but this had never happened before. I had lived with them for two years and this was the first time they were entranced by the fucking moon of all things. 

Kaz was in front of the others, and I glimpsed a can of beer at his feet spilling its contents onto rough concrete.

At first, I thought they were marvelling the sight. I mean, it was beautiful enough to stare at and smile, maybe comment on it or take a photo. 

""Hey."" I clapped my hands in Rowan's face. ""What's going on?"" 

He didn't even blink. 

Moving to Immie and Kaz, I shook them. 

Still nothing. 

They did move… eventually. 

“See.” Rowan’s voice was almost a breath, his gaze still on the sky. “We’ve found him.”

When the music stopped, they came back to life, ignoring me, and bound back into the party with no explanation to what the hell had just happened.

“Moon drunk” was starting to make the most sense.  

I got my answer when I went back inside, and Kaz was raiding the refrigerator. 

I didn’t think much of it until I saw pieces of raw bacon squelching between his fingers and stringy white sticking from his mouth. 

Now, there’s getting the munchies, and there’s willingly stuffing yourself with raw bacon. 

“Kaz?”

The boy twisted around so fast, almost inhuman. 

Kaz slowly inclined his head, bacon fat caught between his teeth. 

There was a feral look in his eyes, which told me if I even attempted to stop him from feasting on raw pork, I’d lose a finger.  

His gaze tracked me like a predator, before turning back to his meal. 

I left him to whatever *that* was. 

Immie, who hadn’t paid attention to a guy since freshman year when she was assaulted at a party, was sitting in a random guy’s lap, her lips latched to his ear. 

It was Immie who looked to be the one in control, but even being moon drunk, I didn’t want her anywhere near a guy. 

Not when she was still in therapy. 

Before I could intervene, my housemate was yanking the guy to his feet in one pull and dragging him upstairs.

To my shock, though, it was the guy who pulled away from her. “What the fuck?” He hissed, “Get off me!”

Immie didn’t seem fazed. She just offered him a smile and walked away, this time plonking herself in a girls lap.

It was strange behavior, considering Kaz was a vegetarian, and Imogen was terrified of intimacy.

Rowan was acting, objectively, the least weird. I found him in the kitchen staring into his drink.

When I tried talking to him, he responded with one-word answers, his gaze glued to whatever was so fucking fascinating about his glass of diet coke. Was it a dead fly? 

“Rowan.”

I followed him around, trying to snap him out of it. 

“Hm?” His voice was almost sing-song. 

“Rowan!”

He twisted around, doing a little dance, half lidded eyes struggling to take me in. 

“Whaaaaaat?!”

I tried to keep my patience. “Did you know your best friend is currently gnawing on raw pig?”

I regretted my words ten seconds after saying them. 

This guy was going to be *zero* help. 

“Uhmmm, soooo?” Rowan settled me with a childish grin. “You know what you are, Nin?”

I didn't answer, already expecting a stupid answer. 

Rowan threw a plastic cup at me. *”Cuphead.”*

Comedic genius. 

“What the fuck is going on?” I hissed, only for him to lean forward, and blow in my face. 

“Do you like chicken *tenders*?” He asked, before bursting into childlike giggles. 

Rowan spent the rest of the evening aimlessly walking around with a stupid smile on his face. 

He called me *Cuphead* for three hours straight. 

All three of them had that same mystified grin and I couldn't snap them out of it. 

After the party, I noticed the following full-moon they seemed to go 0-100 in terms of personality changes. 

Kaz would spontaneously decide to go visit his parents in another state for no reason. 

Rowan was obsessed with blocking every window to avoid moonlight spilling in, and insisted the whole house had to be protected with duct tape covering every window and reflective surface. 

As for me, I was locked inside my room with the curtains drawn—forced to wear headphones with music playing. 

There was only one rule I had to follow, and when I questioned it, I just got the same answer from all three. “Trust us.” 

They wanted me to trust them when Kaz was gnawing on raw meat like an animal during a full moon, Immie was throwing herself at random guys and girls, and Rowan went into a trance-like state when he caught sight of anything reflective.

I understood the moon was affecting them in ways I couldn’t understand. 

But locking me in my room until the morning was over-kill. 

I was the only one who wasn’t affected by the moon’s light, and yet they treated me like I was in trouble too.

Despite being overly reluctant, I agreed to their rules. I stayed in my room and listened to music as loud as it would go. 

According to them, I couldn’t at any point remove my headphones. 

After playing half of my Spotify playlist, I drifted off, and before I knew what was happening, I was waking up with sunlight poking through the blinds,  feeling like shit, a gnawing hunger in my gut which splintered into nausea. 

There were differences that jumped out at me when I pried my eyes open, blinking through intense sunlight.

I was wearing different clothes. 

I remembered I’d changed into a shirt and shorts for bed, but I was dressed for the day. I didn’t remember drinking anything before falling asleep, but an empty glass was on my bedside.

Except mouth was parched, my lips dry.

I didn’t question it. I wanted to, but anything was possible.

Maybe I was the delusional one. I was blacking out, so maybe I dressed myself without knowing, and then slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink of water in the early morning.

After that night, things seemed to go back to normal. 

I decided that it really was a case of being moon-drunk. 

The others didn’t talk about it again, and life went on, I guess.

I thought about talking about it with them, but when I tried, they would stiffen up or change the subject. 

Rowan would completely shut me down, and Kaz acted like I had a contagious disease. 

I asked Immie if anything happened, and she screwed up her face and jumped up with an excuse that she needed to go somewhere. 

Kaz dismissed everything I said and told me they were fine, and that the moon just “gave them headache”.

I can be an idiot sometimes, but I was pretty sure eating raw bacon like an animal couldn’t be justified with that excuse. 

When I tried to argue, he grabbed the controller from a sleeping Rowan, and dared me to fuck up Immie’s island. 

I did, swiftly ending up covered in Rowan’s breakfast the next morning.

So, basically, my roommates  were hiding something big from me, and I wasn’t planning on telling them about the blackouts.

Because part of me wondered if they were involved. 

I was convinced the two phenomenons were linked.

So, yeah, a pretty toxic mindset to have on both sides.

Anyway, this leads me to what happened last night.

It was the usual– the usual I had gotten used to, anyway. 

After class, I hurried home to help with prepping the house for the full moon. 

Rowan was standing on a chair, taping up the windows, and Immie was closing all the curtains and blinds. 

He was being an asshole as usual, so I busied myself with hiding everything reflective I could find, before retiring to the living room and joining Kaz who was working on his laptop. 

Immie and Rowan were hard to talk to about what was going on, but with Kaz being the resident stoner, his walls came down a little. I slumped down on our Craigslist couch and grabbed a controller, resuming a game of COD from earlier. 

“So.” I focused on the game, navigating my first-person character through a pile of bodies.

Kaz offered me a smile over his laptop. He reeked of weed. 

“Soo..?”

“Are you ever planning on telling me what’s going on?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The moon.” I said. “It’s moon night, and as usual everyone’s freaking out.”

“Freaking out?” Kaz’s gaze strayed on his laptop screen. “I’m the epitome of calm right now.”

I threw a cushion at him. “You’re stoned. And I’m still waiting for you to explain your spontaneous Peppa Pig binge.”

He tossed me a sheepish smile. “I was hungry.”

“You’re a vegetarian!” I said, immediately remembering Rowan’s moon-drunk state. 

“Rowan was… *giggling*.” I whispered. “It was… oh god, I'm still having nightmares.”

He laughed. “Okay, he was definitely replaced.”

“Or you *both* were.” 

Kaz shrugged. “We’ve already told you. It’s just sensitivity. The moon can do shit like that. Look it up.”

“Sensitivity.” I repeated in a scoff, glaring at war-torn Europe on the TV screen. “That’s what you’re calling it?”

Kaz lifted his head, his gaze snapping to me. “What else do you want to call it?”

I took a deep breath. I had some guesses.  

“Werewolf?”

He curled his lip, but I noticed his eyes darken significantly. “Very… original. Ten points for creativity.”

“Werewolves freak out every full moon.” I said. 

He nodded, humoring me as he typed. Kaz was like an older brother. “Uh-huh. They're also not real.”

“It’s not that far-fetched!""

Kaz stopped typing, raising a brow. “I’m pretty sure humans can’t turn into dogs under the full moon. You've been watching too many movies.” He shot me a look. “Weren't you like, *really* into Teen Wolf?” 

I put the controller down. “You lock me in my room until morning.” I twisted to face him. “How is that normal?”

“It’s just a precaution. You’ve told us how weird we act, so it’s better to stay away from us.”

“I’d feel better if I was with you.” I swallowed. “So, I know what’s really going on.”

Kaz’s expression seemed to change, relaxing slightly. He looked like he might reply, before Rowan came crashing in. Quite literally. 

That guy can’t walk two feet without falling or slamming into something. 

In this case, he tripped over the rug Immie had been vacuuming. I blamed the moon’s influence on him being more hyperactive than normal. Rowan oozed ADHD. 

Stumbling into the back of the couch, he grasped onto the back to stable himself. “What are you guys talking about?”

Kaz went back to typing with an exaggerated sigh. “Nin thinks we’re werewolves.”

Rowan straightened up with a very nervous laugh. “What?”

“Werewolves.” Kaz shut his laptop. “You know, people who can turn into dogs? Honestly, I’m offended. I thought Nin was more creative than that. There’s a whole Wikipedia page on moon afflicted creatures, and she goes with the obvious.”

“Oh, um, wowwwww.” Rowan chuckled. “Teen Wolf style?”

Kaz grinned. “TV show or 1980’s movie?”

“Doesn’t matter.” Rowan started clearing up the TV table, flipping through comic books.  “They both suck.”

“What sucks?” Immie yelled from the kitchen.

“Teen Wolf!” Rowan yelled back.

The girl made a sound of horror, and it was hard to hide my smile. 

“Take that back!”

“It’s bad.” Rowan said, loud enough for her to hear. “You forced me to watch an episode, and I fell asleep.”

“That was after season 3!” Immie appeared in the doorway, wielding a spoon like she was going to attack him.

Gesturing wildly with the spoon, Immie was desperate to defend her lockdown guilty pleasure.

“After season three it declined in quality. But it was still good! You liked the episode with the chess game!”

Rowan shrugged. “That doesn’t change my overall rating.”

“Who are you, IGN?” Immie turned and marched back into the kitchen and slammed the door.

It took maybe an hour for the two of them to get back on her good side.

See, I think about these moments, and I wonder why I’m writing this post.

I think I’m still in denial. I want to tell you thousands of reasons why they’re not bad people.

But then I remember what happened after that. I remember why I can’t talk to anyone else but an anonymous subreddit.

At around 10PM I found myself once again in my room going through the same routine.

This time, though, they wanted to be extra careful. Which meant a new addition to make sure I stayed there until dawn.

Rowan knelt in front of me. I couldn’t see the look in his eyes through his raybans, but I could tell he was wary.

“You okay?” He fixed the headphones over my ears, jiggling them a little to make sure they were fitted properly.

I tugged at the handcuffs securing my left hand to the bed frame. “Kinky.” 

“It’s just until morning, Nin.""

“Handcuffs, though?” I said. “Are they really necessary?”

He didn’t answer. “Remember what you have to do?”

""Music on and blasting until I fall asleep.”

""And?""

""And I'm not coming out until morning.""

Rowan hummed. “Lastly?”

“Don’t remove the headphones.”

He jumped up. “All right! Are you all set?”

“Sure.” I tried to smile. “I’ve got enough 80’s pop and sad indie to last me a while.”

“Awesome.”

I tugged at the cuffs. “Rowan, if something is going on, you can tell me.”

He didn't turn around. ""Really? Because, no offence, but I don’t think a pep talk will help.”

“Well, I can try.” I said. “I don’t want to be locked up here every full moon because you’re scared of moonlight.”

I was startled when he sputtered out a laugh before getting close—too close—his icy breath grazing my cheeks.

“Well.” Rowan murmured, “Maybe if you weren’t a coward that day, things might be different. But here we are, Nin,"" He flicked me on the nose. ""Drunk on the fucking moon."" He exhaled in my face, and something warm crept up my throat. “Quite literally.”

“Are you a werewolf, Rowan?” I blurted. 

His entire demeanour changed suddenly. I felt him stiffen. 

I was used to his bad moods before the moon, but this was something different. 

This was hatred and resentment in its purest form shown in the twitch of his lips. 

I didn’t have to see his eyes. 

His smile through gritted teeth told me everything.

Slowly, Rowan tipped his head to the side, like he was feigning innocence. “What gave you *that* idea?”

Before I could reply, he climbed off the bed and offered me a two fingered salute, his lips twisting into a grin I knew was fake.

It made me wonder if I was wrong.

If the moon didn’t change them, instead bringing out their true feelings and selves. 

But that only brought more questions. 

He mentioned “that day” which was part of the endless blur of darkness, memories torn from me in my blackouts. 

Did something happen during one of those instances which had triggered them to act like this? 

With that question in my mind, I attempted to lunge from the restraints, but he was already at the door. 

“Night.""

I didn’t reply. 

I knew not to entertain him when he was starting to feel the moon’s effects.

When the door slammed shut and I heard the twist of the key in the lock, I lay back and closed my eyes.

I considered tearing off the headphones and ignoring the rules, but that seemed petty.

Plus, I was tired.

I drifted off to music slamming in my ears. I still don’t know how I slept through it. 

I don’t know how long I was out for, but it couldn’t have been long. 

A few hours. 

I woke up feeling ravenously hungry, and yet hollow at the same time.

When I sat up, I noticed something felt… wrong. 

I frowned at my toes for way longer than necessary until I realized one was missing. 

*I was supposed to have five toes on each foot*, my foggy mind murmured. 

I counted them twice, but there were only four. My pinkie toe was gone. 

After staring at it for a while, I blinked, and I could have sworn it appeared in flashes, like the flesh was knitting itself back together. I was seeing things. 

That’s what I told myself. Sleep paralysis was a thing, so I waited until I was fully with it, and when I was, my mind began to drink in my surroundings. The room was still dark, only lit up by my bedside lamp. 

I was in different clothes once more, and an empty glass of water stood on my bed stand. 

Something was different though. 

It was still dark outside, and I could just about glimpse a sliver of moonlight poking through the blinds.

Another thing which was different: My hand was no longer cuffed to my bed frame.

Sitting up, I stretched, and headed to the door. It wouldn’t hurt to peek, I thought.

I reached out and grabbed the handle and twisted it, only for the door to swing open.

Weird. Wasn’t it locked?

They probably had some weird ritual to keep the moon out which Kaz found on Yahoo Answers.

Far too embarrassing for me to see.

Slowly, I made my way across the hall and passed the others rooms which were all silent. Which meant they were downstairs.

If I was honest with myself, I really didn’t want to deal with them if they were under the moon’s effects, but the rest of me was desperate to know what they had been hiding. 

Why was I sentenced to my room until dawn? 

The clock on rustic paintwork told me it was 1am as I slipped down the stairs, careful not to make noise. That meant I’d been asleep for around four hours. 

I heard voices when I reached the kitchen door. Immie was laughing, and Rowan made a hissing noise.

“That’s not fair. You always get the blue ones first and never give anyone a chance. I call bullshit.”

“Yeah, because you’re losing!” Immie shot back.

“Rowan’s right, though.” Kaz joined in. “You do act territorial over Park Place and Boardwalk.”

“I do not!”

“At least give someone else a chance to get the blue ones, Immie.”

“Why? I got them fair and square! You’re just calling me out because you’ve got—”

“Hey!” Rowan yelled. “Hey, she can’t just do that!”

“Two hundred dollars left.” Immie sang. “And you’re stuck in jail. I rest my case.”

Huh. They were playing Monopoly without me. So, they locked me in my room and played games till dawn?

That stung a little.

I could have walked away. I mean, they were having fun. I should have left them to tear themselves apart over a board game.

But I was grabbing the handle and twisting it, pulling open the door.

When I stepped into our kitchen, the first thing I saw was the impressive amount of property cards Immie had lain out in front of her, as well as the pile of cash sitting next to the board. I started to speak. 

I think I was going to congratulate Immie on her clear win, but the words choked up when my gaze continued across the table, this time settling on a small plastic container filled with red mush, which Kaz was sticking his fingers in and scooping into his mouth. The kitchen looked so familiar and yet different as my brain struggled to react with what I was seeing. 

Immie’s face was split into a manic grin because of her win, but there was something splattered on her lips and dripping from her chin. It wasn’t Immie I was looking at. It was what was in front of her, spread out like a main course, what she was tearing at like an animal.  

What was hanging out of Kaz’s mouth in slithering strands dyed scarlet and piled on Rowan’s plate. 

I recognised that dirty blonde ponytail. Unbelievably, I was staring at myself. 

I was ahead of my brain at that moment. 

I was already seeing everything for what it was in a hazy red cloud, and my brain could do nothing.

It was me they were eating.

Immie was the first to notice me. 

Her smile dampened, and she dropped what looked like stringy pieces of intestine clenched between her fists. 

My roommate's eyes widened, and for a moment she looked like she was on the edge of hysteria. “Nin!” she squeaked, the mushy mess of guts slipping from her hands. “Hey! Uh, this…. this—”

The girl was struggling, her eyes snapping to my body which had been hollowed out and cut into pieces on the floor.

Then, to Rowan’s plate filled with a red mush of blended whatever.

And whatever the fuck Kaz was sticking his fingers in. 

“This isn’t what it looks like.” Kaz finished for her. He stood up,  seeming calmer than the others.

Rowan was staring at me. 

His raybans pinned back dark curls, and his eyes didn’t seem angry or even fazed that I was seeing this. They only regarded me with amusement. 

Like he *wanted* me to find this. He looked torn whether to continue chewing on my flesh or try to explain.

“Nin.” Immie jumped up. “We can explain.” She whispered. “Or… or we can’t explain right now, but if you just let us—”

“Let us what?” Rowan scoffed. “Explain? Yeah, we’re way past that point. ""Do you want to try explaining café de Nin?”

He pointed to his chin. “You’ve got a little of her small intestine there.”

“What?” Immie shot me a look, swiping at her chin with her sleeve. “Nin, ignore him!”

I don’t remember my legs moving, but I was at the front door before I could release a breath.

They followed me, their thundering footsteps pounding behind me.

Now they were scared.

When I was so close to the door, so close to letting in that unearthly light, their expression’s turned fearful.

“Nin.” Kaz swiped blood from his mouth and chin.  “Don’t open that fucking door.”

Immie wrapped her arms around herself. “Is she here?”

“No.” Rowan grumbled, shading his eyes. “And she won’t come, as long as that door stays shut.”

I found my voice. “Who are you talking about?”

“Nobody.” Kaz said. “Just go back upstairs. We’ll explain. I promise you. But you have to trust us.”

His tone was a warning.

“Trust you?!” I managed to get out. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

It was funny.

How they wanted me to trust them when I saw what they had done to me.

I couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe. 

I didn’t want an explanation or a scuffed excuse. I wanted out of there.

The rest is a sort of blur. I remember opening the door. Or at least I started to open it, and then I shut it again, panicking.

Their cries were enough to make me regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I watched their eyes fill up with that same unearthly light which bathed the sky. It was beautiful and terrifying the way their resolve crumbled in their eyes and lips. 

Scowls turned to whimsical smiles, and blood stained hands fell to their sides. 

The three of them headed back into the kitchen, and a sudden rhythmic knock on the front door startled me. 

I remember Rowan at the corner of my eye, rummaging around in a draw for a knife.

Immie and Kaz stood behind him.

Before they dropped to the ground, like puppets severed from strings.

I checked their pulses.

Dead.

I risked going to the window and peeking out, but all I saw was the moon. 

The moon was right there, three inches from my face like it had encased the sky and oblivion beyond. For a moment I was taken aback at how beautiful she was. 

I had to get the cops. 

I was halfway upstairs when a blinding flash filled the hallway, followed by the sound. It sounded like a camera, like someone was taking a photo. 

When I grabbed my phone from my room, the moon lingered on the screen, growing larger until I swore she wasn’t just in reflective surfaces. She was at the corner of my eye, a half crescent quickly reaching totality the more I caught her shadow looming.

It was like a game she was playing. The more I caught her light, she only grew bigger.

After a hysterical freak-out with the cops, they came 5 minutes later.

Two officers followed me inside the house, one of them asking how many people were dead.

“Three.” I kept saying. “My roommates .” I was speaking in barely decipherable sobs. “My roommates are dead!""

When I led them into the kitchen, however, bracing myself for the gory aftermath of what I saw, I was greeted by the three of them sitting on the floor, resuming their game of Monopoly. 

My body, as well as every piece of me was fucking gone.

The blood pooling on the floor, as well as staining their skin and faces—was gone.

“Officers.” Rowan saluted the cops with his drink. I noticed a glitter of light in his eyes, in Kaz’s when he stood and folded his arms, his lips pulling into a smile. 

“What’s going on?” He shot a look at me. “Nin, come on. We’re in the middle of a game.”

The officer standing behind me frowned. “We were informed of a triple homicide.” He cleared his throat. “Everything seems to be relatively normal.”  Stepping in front of me, he was scowling. “Miss Caine, are you aware that wasting police time is a criminal offence?”

“They were dead.” I said in a hiss. “I saw them. They were dead!""

“Uh-huh.” The second officer sighed, turning to Kaz.

“Is your friend under the influence of drugs?”

“Or too many scary movies?” The other scoffed.

Rowan jumped up. “Uh, nope! No, we’re all good, officer!” 

When he came over and grabbed my arm, his grasp was strangely gentle. When I was leaning into it, however, I glimpsed something on his neck. At first I thought it was a tattoo, but it was engraved into his flesh. 

The number 2. 

“She’s not feeling great.” He said. “We, uh, we apologize for any crap caused.”

The cops didn’t say a word when they left, only muttering to each other about “stupid kids”.

I couldn’t face my roommates  after that. I went upstairs and splashed water on my face.

I was seeing things, I told myself.

I was going fucking crazy.

But then my fingers found the back of my neck, and I was twisting around, something acidic creeping up my throat.

Rowan’s neck displayed the number 2.

While mine had the number 27.

I went to bed after that. I was all ready to grab my things and leave while they slept, but when I risked standing on the top of the stairs, Kaz was in front of the door. 

It didn’t look like he was blocking it intentionally, but I wasn’t going to try.

This morning was awkward. That’s the only word I can think of to describe it.

My roommates  acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing happened. When I asked if the police had come back, Immie frowned at me over her oatmeal she hadn’t touched. “Police?” Her eyes grew wide. “Wait, did something happen last night?”

I was waiting for her to eat it, but she was just staring at it like it was sentient. 

I thought back to last night, watching her chewing through a mouthful of me, and I felt sick to my stomach.

“Doubt it.” Rowan had his back to me, making coffee. “All I remember is passing out after Monopoly.”

“After you lost.” Immie coughed. 

“Last night doesn’t count.” 

Kaz grabbed a seat next to me. “As far as we know, moon sensitivityTM didn’t get us, and Rowan let Imogen win Monopoly. Nin stayed in her room, and we survived another full moon.” 

He smiled. “Cheers to that.”

“Hey, Nin.” Rowan pushed past me when he took his plate to the dishwasher. “If anyone knocks today, don’t fucking answer it.”

I noticed Immie stiffen up.

Kaz’s smile faded.

“Understand?” Rowan said. “Shut off all the lights.”

With no explanation, the others left for class after breakfast, and I planned my escape.

I wanted to pack up all my stuff, but instead I found myself scouring their rooms for anything which would confirm last night was real,  and I hadn’t fucking hallucinated it. But their rooms were exactly how I knew them. 

Immie’s was a total mess, covered in exotic plants she forgot to water, textbooks, a whole bookshelf dedicated to the horror genre, and every plushie you could think of. 

I looked under her bed, though there were just old snacks she’d forgotten to throw away and letters to her parents she had never sent.

I tried Rowan’s next, but it was more or less the same. I knew his room from movie nights I spent with him, though it still felt wrong going in there. Rowan’s room was perfect. Everything was in its place and was strangely symmetrical. 

His books were color coded and there was one singular Yoda plushie peeking from his bed covers. 

Under his bed were the usual things you’d find in a man’s room: Used tissues and odd socks. 

But there was nothing I’d consider weird.

Nothing that told me he was a cold blooded murderer.

I was losing motivation when I reached Kaz’s room at the end of the hallway. 

I expected the usual when I stepped inside, movie posters on the walls, and Japanese snacks littering the floor. 

There was that, of course. I knew Kaz well. 

But when I peeked under his bed, there was something wrapped in plastic. 

When I crawled further under, I saw through the plastic. I saw the same flesh from last night, pieces of torso and limbs ripped through and torn into. 

But there wasn’t just one of me. There were multiple mutilated bodies which all had my face squished against the plastic and pooling red. My cannibalised body stuffed into trash bags, my own dead eyes staring at me. 

My mind flashed back to the blinding light filling the hallway, and the sound of a photograph being taken.  

The moon following me, creeping behind me as I made my getaway upstairs to grab my phone to call the cops. 

My pinkie toe growing back right in front of my eyes. 

I know this sounds fucking crazy, but I think my roommates  are copying me.

That’s what the 27 means. I’ve been copied 27 times.

Copied. Cloned. Whatever.

So they can do that!!!!! 

I am yet to go back home as I’m writing this. I’m planning to go back and get my stuff, but right now I can’t.

I want to blame all of this on them, but I keep thinking back to Rowan’s words.

“That night” I was a coward and left them, and somehow, these are the consequences.

What did I do to turn them into this? Rowan said this is my fault. It’s driving me crazy that I can’t remember it.

How can I get those memories back?

But do I want them back? 

Do I want to know what turned my roommates into this?????",4,1769848916.0,HFY,2,0.84,False
1qrx4kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1qrx4kv/wondering_what_happened_to_me/,Wondering what happened to me,"4 years ago, I dated this girl. Prior to that we had a situationship, and she wasn’t really sure about me. That period of “situation” seeded a lot of self doubt in me. When we started dating, she didn’t wanna tell her parents about us, secluded me away from her friends and any time we had a disagreement or argument she’d ghost me. Let’s just say none of that was good for my mental health and then she broke up with me which left me absolutely devastated. I saw her 2 years after that and she asked if I wanted to get a cup of coffee to which I said no. But sometimes I wonder if me saying yes would’ve led to closure as I’m not fully over it yet. I have a lot of doubt about myself. I’ve tried dating again, it just doesn’t feel the same. Now when people ask me why I’m not dating, my response is I’m not happy with myself yet so I’m not ready. I’m honestly just not the same guy I used to be before that relationship. I don’t have the same confidence. I don’t have the same motivation or drive. I don’t have that discipline I used to have. I feel like a shell of my former self. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Anyone have advice on how to get out of this mindset?",1,1769848800.0,Life,2,1.0,False

PART 2

Troy started the day with routine practices for today’s game. While many of his teammates were anxious and confident about the sure victory ahead, Ilya and Shane seemed a bit out of place.

“I think we have everything going for us,” Wyatt said.

“Definitely. And with Shane on the team, I feel like we have the best lineup of the season,” Zane replied.

Everyone cheered in agreement, and although this lifted Ilya’s mood a little, Shane still looked worried.

“Alright, that’s enough. Everyone go get changed and remember to play the way you’ve been playing. This is a game we have to win,” said Coach Brandon, who, after his winning streak, had been gaining more confidence in himself—something that, naturally, had not gone unnoticed by Ilya.

“Ohhh, so now our coach feels like winning?” Ilya said, showing his playful, cocky side.

“I’ve always wanted to win, but denying that the last few games have changed my perspective a bit would be a lie,” he replied with a smile.

While all of this was happening, Harris continued in the meeting room, fine-tuning details with several LGBTQ+ agencies in Ottawa for the game against Montreal.

Little by little, the door opened, and Troy appeared with a coffee in each hand. Harris simply looked at him, and his expression immediately brightened.

“Thank you,” Harris said as he quickly put the call on mute to whisper to Troy. “You can stay, I’m just wrapping things up.”

Troy nodded and sat down next to his boyfriend in the empty chair, listening to the end of the call.

“All set, Geneve. Thank you so much for your support. All the photos we post on the website will include a mention of your agency… Of course, of course. All set… sure. Bye.”

Harris hung up the call and let out a sigh.

“How are you feeling?” Troy asked.

“Honestly? A bit stressed. We just got an email that, supposedly based on internal NHL security reports, says there could be security issues before and during the game, and that as a result you’re expected to leave through an exit that will be enabled later, without clearly explaining it beyond ‘player safety reasons’”—Harris made air quotes with his fingers. “But I’m almost certain the superintendent will pass this information to #TakeBackHockey first, just to stir things up.”

“This worries me more and more,” Troy said, resting his face on Harris’s shoulder while Harris gently stroked him.

“I know. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t worry me too.”

Silence filled the room.

“But we can’t let him win. What he wants is to create chaos and then blame Ilya and Shane for it, putting the team in trouble,” Harris said. He knew Troy was part of that equation too, which was why he couldn’t stop fighting. “That’s why I’ve been calling every LGBTQ+ nonprofit organization so they can come and support us. I’ve also coordinated with local security to make sure communication is quick and effective.”

Harris spoke with confidence, but Troy couldn’t help wondering why Harris was doing all of this when his role was social media manager.

“Love, don’t take this the wrong way, but…” Troy hesitated.

“I know, I know. I already know what you’re going to say—and you’re right,” Harris replied.

“What was I going to say?”

“That I’m taking on more responsibilities than I should.”

“Well, not just that,” Troy added as they held hands, as if recharging emotionally. “I’m also worried that if something this complicated goes wrong, it’ll fall on you. Why not leave it to security or someone from team management?”

Although this was indeed beyond Harris’s role, and under normal circumstances management would have strongly disagreed with him handling it, this time—because it involved privileged information Harris had obtained through his connections in the field—management granted him special permission to prevent leaks that could cause legal trouble. Naturally, Harris couldn’t explain all of this to Troy, so he had always kept the topic superficial.

“I think they gave me this authority so I can do my job properly with the photos,” Harris said, sounding a bit forced. Troy noticed, but didn’t want to make him feel bad. “Besides, I think management is fully aware of the historical importance of today, and that’s why they put me in charge as someone from the community.”

This time, Harris sounded more confident.

“Hmm… that makes some sense,” Troy said, “but I still think they could’ve put someone else in charge.”

Harris glanced at him sideways.

“Are you saying I can’t handle this?”

“No, no! That’s not what I meant!” Troy replied quickly, worried.

The tension broke when Harris burst out laughing.

“Hahaha! I’m sorry, love. I promise I won’t tease you again for the rest of the day.”

And so it was.

Most of them decided to do what they always did before a home game—what many call “meditating,” but for them was simply going to a teammate’s place to relax by playing video games, or staying home with family before heading back to the arena.

Troy decided to stay with Harris that day, while Ilya and Shane made the same choice. They had also brought Anya to give the team some extra energy, and Harris simply couldn’t let the chance to greet her pass him by. The arena also had facilities for the players to relax and hang out, and that was exactly what they did.",1,1769848766.0,HeatedRivalryTVShow,0,1.0,False

PART 2

Troy started the day with routine practices for today’s game. While many of his teammates were anxious and confident about the sure victory ahead, Ilya and Shane seemed a bit out of place.

“I think we have everything going for us,” Wyatt said.

“Definitely. And with Shane on the team, I feel like we have the best lineup of the season,” Zane replied.

Everyone cheered in agreement, and although this lifted Ilya’s mood a little, Shane still looked worried.

“Alright, that’s enough. Everyone go get changed and remember to play the way you’ve been playing. This is a game we have to win,” said Coach Brandon, who, after his winning streak, had been gaining more confidence in himself—something that, naturally, had not gone unnoticed by Ilya.

“Ohhh, so now our coach feels like winning?” Ilya said, showing his playful, cocky side.

“I’ve always wanted to win, but denying that the last few games have changed my perspective a bit would be a lie,” he replied with a smile.

While all of this was happening, Harris continued in the meeting room, fine-tuning details with several LGBTQ+ agencies in Ottawa for the game against Montreal.

Little by little, the door opened, and Troy appeared with a coffee in each hand. Harris simply looked at him, and his expression immediately brightened.

“Thank you,” Harris said as he quickly put the call on mute to whisper to Troy. “You can stay, I’m just wrapping things up.”

Troy nodded and sat down next to his boyfriend in the empty chair, listening to the end of the call.

“All set, Geneve. Thank you so much for your support. All the photos we post on the website will include a mention of your agency… Of course, of course. All set… sure. Bye.”

Harris hung up the call and let out a sigh.

“How are you feeling?” Troy asked.

“Honestly? A bit stressed. We just got an email that, supposedly based on internal NHL security reports, says there could be security issues before and during the game, and that as a result you’re expected to leave through an exit that will be enabled later, without clearly explaining it beyond ‘player safety reasons’”—Harris made air quotes with his fingers. “But I’m almost certain the superintendent will pass this information to #TakeBackHockey first, just to stir things up.”

“This worries me more and more,” Troy said, resting his face on Harris’s shoulder while Harris gently stroked him.

“I know. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t worry me too.”

Silence filled the room.

“But we can’t let him win. What he wants is to create chaos and then blame Ilya and Shane for it, putting the team in trouble,” Harris said. He knew Troy was part of that equation too, which was why he couldn’t stop fighting. “That’s why I’ve been calling every LGBTQ+ nonprofit organization so they can come and support us. I’ve also coordinated with local security to make sure communication is quick and effective.”

Harris spoke with confidence, but Troy couldn’t help wondering why Harris was doing all of this when his role was social media manager.

“Love, don’t take this the wrong way, but…” Troy hesitated.

“I know, I know. I already know what you’re going to say—and you’re right,” Harris replied.

“What was I going to say?”

“That I’m taking on more responsibilities than I should.”

“Well, not just that,” Troy added as they held hands, as if recharging emotionally. “I’m also worried that if something this complicated goes wrong, it’ll fall on you. Why not leave it to security or someone from team management?”

Although this was indeed beyond Harris’s role, and under normal circumstances management would have strongly disagreed with him handling it, this time—because it involved privileged information Harris had obtained through his connections in the field—management granted him special permission to prevent leaks that could cause legal trouble. Naturally, Harris couldn’t explain all of this to Troy, so he had always kept the topic superficial.

“I think they gave me this authority so I can do my job properly with the photos,” Harris said, sounding a bit forced. Troy noticed, but didn’t want to make him feel bad. “Besides, I think management is fully aware of the historical importance of today, and that’s why they put me in charge as someone from the community.”

This time, Harris sounded more confident.

“Hmm… that makes some sense,” Troy said, “but I still think they could’ve put someone else in charge.”

Harris glanced at him sideways.

“Are you saying I can’t handle this?”

“No, no! That’s not what I meant!” Troy replied quickly, worried.

The tension broke when Harris burst out laughing.

“Hahaha! I’m sorry, love. I promise I won’t tease you again for the rest of the day.”

And so it was.

Most of them decided to do what they always did before a home game—what many call “meditating,” but for them was simply going to a teammate’s place to relax by playing video games, or staying home with family before heading back to the arena.

Troy decided to stay with Harris that day, while Ilya and Shane made the same choice. They had also brought Anya to give the team some extra energy, and Harris simply couldn’t let the chance to greet her pass him by. The arena also had facilities for the players to relax and hang out, and that was exactly what they did.",1,1769848550.0,heatedrivalryfanfics,0,1.0,False

Sources: Itaú Unibanco Corporate Profile, Wikipedia Overview

In the sprawling metropolis of São Paulo,  
Where the skyline glows with the heat of commerce and the pulse of 215 million lives,  
And where Avenida Paulista hums like a continental artery,  
The Golden Inu arrived at the gates of Itaú Unibanco—  
Not as a retail client, nor a corporate titan,  
But as a sovereign flamekeeper bearing the Scroll of the Orange Obelisk.

The Chairman, Pedro Moreira Salles, stood beneath a dome of amber light and digital constellations,  
Surrounded by ledgers that stretched across Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Paraguay, the U.S., Uruguay,  
And into the financial capitals of London, Lisbon, Zurich, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Dubai.  
The bank’s presence—55 million customers, 4,335 branches, and 33,000+ service points—  
Formed a continental web of influence unmatched in Latin America.

“Why do you come, sovereign emissary, to the vault of the Southern Hemisphere’s largest bank?”  
The Inu’s voice was calm, his presence ceremonial:  
“To inscribe the Scroll of Transformative Custody,” he said,  
“For a bank forged through a century of mergers, migrations, and metamorphosis.”

He entered the Chamber of Dual Genesis,  
Where two ancestral rivers converged:

- Banco Itaú, born from São Paulo’s industrial ascent and the Tupi word Itá — “stone” or “rock,”  
  symbolizing solidity and endurance.  
- Unibanco, born from the Moreira Salles family’s 1924 banking house in Poços de Caldas,  
  a sanctuary for coffee growers and regional merchants.

These two rivers met in 2008, forming Itaú Unibanco,  
A financial titan with US$491.6 billion in assets and US$27.2 billion in annual revenue—  
The largest bank in Brazil, the largest in Latin America,  
And one of the top 100 largest banks in the world.

There, the Inu placed a scroll of orange‑fiber parchment and sovereign ink,  
Its glyphs braided from:

- the 1966 launch of Brazil’s first investment bank,  
- the 2006 acquisition of BankBoston’s Latin American operations,  
- the 2021–2024 expansions into Paraguay, Chile, and tech‑fin partnerships,  
- and the bank’s commitment to Net‑Zero by 2050.

It read:

“Let transformation be tradition.  
Let the vault not only innovate, but illuminate.  
Let the bank not only expand, but empower—  
Not just markets, but movements.” - Nagato's Scrolls 

The scroll pulsed.  
Not with reais, but with reinvention.

A new protocol emerged: The Orange Obelisk Accord,  
A sovereign overlay where every retail loan,  
Every corporate mandate,  
Every investment‑banking operation,  
Every insurance policy,  
Every asset‑management decision  
Was braided with sustainability, technological fluency, and continental stewardship.

Each division—Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, Asset Management, Insurance, Private Banking, TechFin—  
Now bore a ceremonial watermark:  
A glyph of remembered metamorphosis, not just modern efficiency.

From that day, Itaú Unibanco became more than a financial institution.  
It became the Orange Obelisk of the Southern Hemisphere,  
A monument to resilience, reinvention, and regional sovereignty—  
And the Golden Inu, seated beside the amber flame,  
Became the silent steward of Latin America’s financial destiny.",1,1769848284.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1qrwygp,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qrwygp/does_my_opening_hook_get_your_attention/,Does my opening hook get your attention?,"Eighteen miles off the cape, we spot a schooner bearing west, flying the green skull pennant of Commodore Savings & Loan.

We fire a cannon in the other direction, and run up our own colors, showing friendly.

“Invite her captain to breakfast,” I say, walking into my cabin.

“The whole coast has surrendered,” says the captain, ramming down his meal. Pan-fried anchovies and beer.

“Surrendered to who?”

“One of the tribal lords. T’Kuhmsa, I think.” His eyes are hollow and bloodshot.

I shoot a secret glare to my steward, Mrs. Fielding. She nods to the brewing kettle and shrugs with barely-concealed insolence.

But my guest is distracted, remote. He finishes two more glasses of wine and slumps back into his chair. I get the feeling he doesn’t care whether the gold his schooner carries is captured or sunk, so long as he’s allowed to sleep.

“Where’s your escort?” I ask.

“Burned to the water before we ever left the Sound. It wasn’t pirates. Someone dropped a candle in her powder-room.”

Through the bulkhead come the working sounds of our sloop, muffled hammering, chisels clanking. At first he winces, like his head can’t take the noise. But then his eyes open, curious at the sound and struggling to wake some part of his brain that might recognize it.

“You’re a scientific vessel,” he says in a tone that can’t be distinguished as either a statement or question.

Our conversation is cut short by the lookout’s hail: “Land ho!”

I frown. We’re not sailing at the moment; if the cape has come into view that means the inshore tide is pulling with uncommon strength.

“You’d best sail in line with us, sir,” I tell him.

Back on deck, my nostrils start burning, the rising sun veiled by a black haze in the east.

I check my pocket watch, impatient while the schooner’s captain stumbles to the rail and his waiting rowboat. As he turns to climb down the ladder, he sees our crew chipping cannonballs, smoothing imperfections and wiping them clean with studiously-plied rags.

Once again he seems curious, perturbed. But then our sloop gives sharp roll and he slips, falling back into the bottom of his boat. As he’s rowed back to the schooner, he leans over the side and vomits.

Mrs. Fielding brings my coffee and cigar case from the cabin. “Pass the word for Mr. Blythe,” I say.

My first mate appears, breathing hard, covered in sweat, tar, and rope burns. But he’s smiling.

“I’ll answer for that new topmast, anywhere this side of the Horn,” he says. He nods to the schooner, rising and falling alongside us.  “Shall I pass them a line, sir?”

South we run, both vessels fighting the tide as it threatens to pull us closer against hostile shores. More sails begin dotting the sea around us, merchants, trawlers, transports, all manner of craft fleeing T’Kuhmsa’s raid in one direction or another.

One of them, a large whaler, hails us and backs her sails. The sailing master asks why we’re standing in for the cape, particularly with a banking vessel in tow, while the coastline falls to pieces.

“You may as well hand that gold to the pirates,” he says. Independent corsairs paid by T’Kuhmsa are plying up and down the channel, ready to snatch up any ships of value. There’s been no sign of the heavy frigates sent by General Campbell to protect us.

With a resounding thump, my crew runs out the full line of cannons along our starboard side. A dozen eighteen-pounders ready to fire point-blank in the whaler’s hull. The friendly flag at our masthead comes racing down, replaced by the dreaded crossed-hatchet banner.

I give the master an apologetic glance. He’s quicker than the schooner’s captain, and grim understanding washes over his features.

He says, “You are the pirates.”

——

But I can’t dine with him. There’s no time. I leave him in the cabin under Mrs. Fielding’s supervision, and run on deck to have a word with my first mate.

We don’t have enough sailors to crew three ships, and dirty weather is sweeping in from the north. Battening down our captures for the night, in this infernal tide, means every hand working long into the evening watch.

But the crew is in fine spirits; two valuable prizes for T’Khumsa, which we all profit from, makes even the most strenuous tasks pleasant, and laughter and conversation pervade the various working parties.

But nobody looks happy when I lay out our new course.

“We’re not putting in at the Saw, sir?” Says Blythe.

He’s in my cabin with young Mr. Jacobs, the third mate. The second is absent again, drunk no doubt.

“If those frigates are still delayed,” I say, dipping my fingers in a wine glass and tracing lines on the tablecloth as if it’s a map. “We can lie off Desolation Island, here. One of those fat merchant brigs is bound to put in for water.”

I watch them mull it over. In one day I’d made them rich beyond anything they’d dreamed possible. Their inner voices would be telling them to quit while they’re ahead. Especially with this gale blowing louder every minute.

But a merchant brig packed with cargo would raise their wealth to princely levels, and I see greed slowly winning the argument in their heads.

“One more prize,” I tell them, “One more prize and we sail home.”

“What about manpower? We’re stretched thin as it is.”

Dusk is falling, and through the stern windows the orange glow of fires on the coast.

“Enlist the captured sailors from the whaler,” I say. “And there’s likely a few prime hands on that schooner, by the look of her trim.“

A faint scream echoes across the dark water. On deck, it grows louder. I recognize the type: true, all-encompassing agony and terror. Other screams join in, and we all stare gravely to the east.

Blythe passes me his telescope. “They’re crucifying the prisoners,” he says with a stony expression.

“Lord T’Kuhmsa mourns the loss of his wife and son,” I say, in voice just loud enough to be overheard.

When Blythe starts taking down names to add to our crew, everyone lines up to enlist. Everyone except the schooner’s captain, who won’t leave his cabin. Part of him seems to believe that he can make it through with both his life and the gold.

Or maybe he thinks whatever T’Kuhmsa does to him will be less painful than telling the Commodore he lost one and a half tons of the bank’s gold.

——

The gale rages all night, wind shrieking through the rigging, water pouring over the bows. I breathe a sigh of relief each time we burst free on the upward heave.

Even with our reinforced crew, it’s late morning by the time our battered vessels limp within sight of Desolation Island. Black reefs, a patch of calm water and a beach with mossy cliffs rising beyond it.

My heart leaps with excitement as our sloops swings wide around the cliffs and a massive white sail appears on the other side.

Is our luck really this good?

A gig loaded with water barrels, rowing between the island and the new ship tells me it is.

The men in the gig have spotted us; we can tell by how fast they’ve started to row. Through my telescope, sailors are scrambling aloft on the merchant brig, for merchant brig she is, and more sails quickly flash out.

“They’re not waiting for their friends in the boat,” I say to Blythe.

“Pragmatical cunts,” he says.

“Two points starboard,” I call to the man at our wheel. To Blythe: “Pick them up. I’m going over to the whaling ship. It’s more than fast enough.”

The merchant brig gives us a chase of it, but the wind favors us, and in two hours we’re close enough to fire a warning shot along her side. She surrenders, taking in sail and rocking meekly, waiting for us to come alongside. It’s a slow approach, the wind turning against us now.

My stomach is growling, and with real regret I think of dinner in my sloop’s cabin. Beefsteak and halibut, toasted cheese, marmalade, port. The cook on the whaler is useless; drunk as my own second mate.

“She might’ve surrendered when we were on the same fucking tack,” I mutter, checking my watch.

Some nearby sailors grumble in quiet agreement. Wealth has made us all petulant, irritable.

At last we climb aboard the brig, trailing our cutlasses, and call for her captain.

“He was in the gig,” says the first mate, a big fellow with tattoos and gold earrings.

“You abandoned your own captain?”

“I told you not to do it, Zeke!” shouts one the merchant crew.

“Shut your mouth!” says the first mate.

“Enough,” I say. My head is aching from hunger and lack of sleep. “Just bring us around back to Desolation, if you please sir.”

The deck is oddly quiet for a ship of this size. What few sailors I can see watch quietly from the tops, and another small group mills around Zeke. Where is everybody?

We make good time to the island, and members of my original crew and even some of the new hands cheer us from the sloop as we sail into the anchorage of Desolation Island.

I’m still aboard the brig, making a bundle of her registration papers and logbook, bills of lading, when I hear the gig being hoisted in.

Raised voices, an argument. Is the captain back on board? Damn, I’ve done nothing to separate him from Zeke.

I burst out onto the deck, cutlass in hand, and a gunshot splits the air. Zeke falls to the deck, blood soaking his shirt, and the merchant captain steps over him to look me face-to-face.

“Left us to starve, the dog,” he says.

He reverses the smoking pistol and holds it out to me. I can smell it.

An hour later, I’m surprised to find myself prolonging dinner again to hike the backside of one of the cliffs. I can’t help myself.

From the summit, I view the anchorage far out and below. The merchant brig and the whaling ship with their great masts, my sloop, and the schooner. Four sound, fast, seaworthy vessels side-by-side.

Smaller boats are rowing back and forth between them and the beach, and through my telescope I see Blythe on the deck of the whaler, shouting orders to sailors high in the rigging.

Swinging my glass to the sloop, I catch the thin trail of smoke rising from the galley stove. A splendid sight.",2,1769848178.0,writers,2,1.0,False

She said she didn’t want a relationship but we were sleeping together. She was still not over her ex. While i was catching feelings and wanted to go into a relationship. She ended up saying she needed space. I was looking for an apartment then so i asked her if the building she was in, had any places (because it was a cheap and nice hotel that rents for students, and i was finding a hard time looking and our city is small so not many options) she said that was creepy and she doesn’t want me to rent there. We had a fight about it (i was mad that she thought i was following her smh). Anyway, fast forward i still think about her every now and then. I texted her once and we caught up, told her lets go over some drinks she said she was out. A year later and i interact with her on social media, she interacts back positively and likes my posts.

She said she didn’t want a relationship but we were sleeping together. She was still not over her ex. While i was catching feelings and wanted to go into a relationship. She ended up saying she needed space. I was looking for an apartment then so i asked her if the building she was in, had any places (because it was a cheap and nice hotel that rents for students, and i was finding a hard time looking and our city is small so not many options) she said that was creepy and she doesn’t want me to rent there. We had a fight about it (i was mad that she thought i was following her smh). 

Anyway, fast forward i still think about her every now and then. I texted her once and we caught up, told her lets go over some drinks she said she was out. A year later and i interact with her on social media, she interacts back positively and likes my posts. I always had the urge to see her because i kind of miss being with her.

1qrwrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1qrwrql/how_to_get_a_job_at_a_startup_as_a_hungry_english/,how to get a job at a startup as a (hungry) english major,"i only know startups. but here's how to get a job at a startup. if you like startups or highly dynamic, chaotic workplaces though, this will work. every startup i've ever met is actively hiring or actively dying, never met any in between. 

I'm helping someone write JD's now and thus this is on my mind and thought i'd share. 

STEP ZERO: LOOK AT ROLE OPTIONS

Customer support, customer success. Generally the 'post-sales' world.

Alternately, sales. Makes a ton of money, I love it, obviously only like 2% of people find it compatible with their personality. 

Marketing--especially content marketing if you're a great writer. 

""producer"", pm, coordination type roles. 

Operations-- a nebulous term, means lots of different things in different places, but generally just a doer of things, often you're doing something very basic/boring (like data entry, calling everyone on a list and checking what's going on with them, some internal process of matching A to B) but the real job is to continuously automate that task and move onto the next one. 

STEP ONE: SOURCE STARTUPS

easy. go to ""built in"" --> there's a bunch for various cities, like built in la, built in denver, etc. it's a startup-focused listing site so fewer listings, very real. this way you can actually find job listings so you'll know for sure the company has something relevant to you.

alternately, look for funding announcements-- in particular series A and series B, later is fine, nothing sooner. look for big-ass numbers.

if your priority is comp, stay away from cool startups (meaning consumer-facing ones selling something you would love to buy yourself, like wine or astrology or dating). think: the driest b2b thing you could imagine. if you can't stomach learning the intricacies of data warehousing, i suppose, ok, hit up cool startups. (please note, you do not need any technical bg to work at a highly technical startup. i studied english. just read stuff, google stuff, im sorry but yes you can ask claude to teach you things very effectively).

start to get a sense for what TYPES of startups are hiring for what TYPES of roles. start to notice patterns in what types of companies there are a lot of. startup job posts are often kind of casual/eccentric and do reveal a lot about the culture/personality so you can also start to get a sense of what types of companies you like vs dislike. 

Decide on 2-3 really specific things you are into, but again, I strongly advise you be practical and stay away with obvious application of passions, be more open to what you find intriguing to think about. By specific things you're into, I mean things like very specific sub-industries, product types. Like neobanks, creative visualization software for designers, two-sided marketplaces with sustainable/reuse approach for big consumer items. Obviously if you pick something currently trending you'll have more companies to aim at.

STEP TWO: GET SMART

0 = i like clothes, this is an ecomm company

100 = i could be a guest on a podcast about the ecomm industry and carry my own for an hour

Try to get to 60-75% in your chosen 2-3 things. If you find this impenetrable advice to follow tbh I fear a startup may not be your place to live your best work life (no offense!! It's not like they're for everyone, many people hate them!!!) but look for hyper niche substacks, linkedin posts, sometimes a personal blog. in the tech world a lot of people loooove to make personal websites/blogs with extraordinarily detailed and generous write-ups of their professional skills. 

ability to self-lead through ambiguous research and quickly structure lots of info in your mind is definitely in top 3 non-engineer tech skills. 

STEP THREE: COLD EMAIL

If the company is <30 people and your email is genuinely good (don't be weird and be 75% smart on the topic), in my experience you have a 50% chance of getting a response back from the CEO. This isn't a begging for a job email, you're an expert now on the industry, so you're really almost striking a peer-to-peer tone here, you're intelligently explaining why you think what the company is doing is cool. 

In a very weird way....it's almost better to cold email when there isn't a job posting you're responding to. Kind of makes it less salesy. 

If the company is >50 people, try a decision maker who is not the CEO. 

STEP THREE BACKUP: COLD LINKEDIN

Ok, let's say step 3 somehow didn't work for you, my apologies! Find someone \*SENIOR\* to your desired role who isn't your competition, maybe someone who would be your manager or your manager's manager. ideally someone who has something vaguely in common with you on linkedin (or is a 2nd degree connection, intro or not). message, say what you admire about their career path, \*\*show you're smart on what their role likely entails\*\* and ask to get coffee to learn about that \*TYPE\* of role. again, actually more successful if they haven't posted a job role relevant to you.
