Lux and Halthekar stared at the ominous loaf of bread.

“Is it burnt?” Halthekar asked.

“I… I don’t know why it turned black. I don’t think it’s burnt though. It smells right. Ish…”

“This is it. First bread baked on Isifriss. I am going to cut a slice,” Lux announced.

Hal nodded solemnly, watching as if the two were about to handle nuclear materials.

Lux delicately placed their fingers against the bread, slid the knife through, and sawed back and forth as if it were a small log of particularly soft wood. After a moment, it was split. “Pretty good so far…”

The texture inside was disconcertingly sponge-like. Omnivores, Hal had learned, ate a lot of strange things.

Lux took a bite and their whole face contorted. Hal had seen a multitude of expressions on their face before, he had even worried sometimes that some of them were bound up in disgust. He needn’t have, as he now knew exactly what Lux’s face looked when faced with something vile. They chewed it slowly, instead of spitting it, and then swallowed as if to complete the formal procedure.

“Is it good?”

“...This might be the worst bread I’ve ever tasted,” They said. Lux had once had tea in a specialty shop on a martian space station that tasted like drinking the world’s most expensive grass, and smelled of a forest after rain. This bread was an equal and opposite experience. It was like eating dirt. Not just dirt, but particularly dirty, poorly-sourced dirt, somehow.

Halthekar couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m sorry!” he said, through the grunting of trying to suppress more laughs. Lux had put so much effort into painstakingly washing and grinding the grain with their coffee-grinder, carefully measuring and mixing, researching and looking for yeast substitutes… *The kneading process alone!*

Far too much time and effort for the galaxy’s worst home-made bread.

“That is unfortunate,” he said, the chuckles slipping out with his words.

They shuddered and dragged their tongue under their top teeth to rid it of the aftertaste. It didn’t work. A laugh burbled out of their throat too. 

“Back to the ‘drawing board’?” Hal quoted his friend.

Lux nodded and leaned back against the couch with a groan. “Yup!”

They’d have to look for something that had already been processed into flour. Corn, perhaps? Could definitely make bread out of that, and Lux had heard the arxur produced a lot of corn these days, so if they could find a place to acquire that, that could work. Not as exciting or interesting as alien grains, though. Or perhaps—the idea struck them like a baseball aimed just a little too low and thrown a little too fast.

“Cricket flour!”

Halthekar tilted his head. Neither of those two words translated cleanly.

“Yes. Yes, this is perfect. If I made something like keto cricket bread, you’d be able to eat it too!” Lux said. “Only problem is… It probably doesn’t exist in arxur space. I don’t suppose you have independently developed a tradition of drying and grinding up bugs?”

Hal huffed to clear the grain scent and took out his pad. “Would vrishnit powder work?” he asked, typing it in.

Lux gave him a blank look and traced a circle in the air with their index finger, which he had learned meant ‘keep talking’.

“It’s an independently developed tradition of drying and grinding up bugs.” He threw the results of his search onto the larger screen. “It’s not nutritious enough to support an arxur on its own, but we used it to stretch out and preserve meat rations longer. It’s… gone out of style somewhat, given… everything. But there are some feast halls that try to use it in more creative ways. Start culinary traditions of our own, yes?”

Lux watched as the screen scrolled through previews of a few of the places. Lyrken’s Fine Prepared Meats, The Piercing Claw, Essel’s Feastery and Hall, The Tender Cut… they all looked quite high-end. They nodded along as he talked. “...Yes. Yes, perfect. I have chicken eggs, I have a whisk. I… can make this work. How much is it and where can I get some?”

He was quiet for a moment, busied with the pad. “The feast halls must get it wholesale. Only place I can find here that sells it is down in the snowpack hubs.”

The lowest parts of the valley, and the absolute poorest parts of Skruerika. Lux didn’t have to guess why this vrishnit powder was still being sold there.

“Alright. Sounds good. I’m pretty free right now, I’ll just head out.”

Hal looked at them carefully. “You will be fine alone?”

They scoffed and rolled their eyes. “What–Of course I will! This is–Hal, I am an *adult*. I have been an adult for eighteen years. I have a bus pass. I have money. I can go out on a quick errand.”

“Of course.”

Somehow, Lux found the acquiescence more troubling than if Hal had argued further. “Plus hey, it can’t be too bad, can it? Just a hop and a scoot. I’ll be fine.”

**LOCATION: Isifriss, Skruerika city, Snowpack Hubs**

Date: HST - 2150.01.24	Arxur Dating System - 1733.883  
Location: Arxur Colony World - Isifriss. Closest Arxur-Controlled planet to Earth.  
(13 human years since the end of the Human-Federation War).

One train ride, one bus and two hours later, Lux found themself in a much less pleasant area of Isifriss than they’d ever set foot on before. The streets here were cramped, and dark, and cold. There was hardly any natural lighting from above. There were walkways upon walkways and tubes and cables at odd angles holding up bridges between different buildings. Odd metallic clanks and groans that did not provide a lot of faith in the quality of the surrounding infrastructure echoed through once in a while. And there were *so many people.* 

It was terrifying.

Lux wandered around in a warm coat, oddly glad to be one of many people wearing clothes. Not that they weren't still conspicuous, upright and tailless as they were. 

But it was curious. The arxur here seemed so much more out-and-about. The street was crowded, in a way that Lux found somehow different than when he’d been out shopping in the nicer areas. They couldn’t place what it was exactly. At first they thought, well, the streets are just smaller. But that wasn’t quite it. Maybe it had something to do with the density? The dwelling units were *far* more densely packed here, and the shops too.

A small group huddled around one of the heating poles had turned to leer at Lux as they walked by. None of them said anything, but their bodies had all turned to watch. Lux tucked further into their cloak and sped up unconsciously.

The streets were colder, but there were more people, and so there were bubbles of warmth dispersing in the air, brief shocks of hot and cold depending on heating tubes or vents. They followed their map as it curved, avoiding the groups and huddles as best--

That was it! That was what was weird! They were *grouping up!* On purpose! Huddled in spots of warmth, or in groups in front of storefronts, a few were even bunching up as they walked. It was almost exactly the opposite of what they’d seen in their last shopping endeavor, where everyone had taken care to maintain polite social distance. Down in the valley floor, the arxur seemed much more comfortable with the possibility of bumping into each other. 

*Huh. Humans spread out when they have more resources too. That’s a part of what led to the loneliness epidemic of the early twenty-first century.*

*Interesting.*

Eventually, they made it to the store. A few arxur were standing at the door, talking in quiet voices and eating out of little disposable cartons. A few were using short metal skewers—Lux could see them glinting under the dim light of the store’s sign—while others simply used a claw. They looked like… little meatballs. With sauce.

The group caught sight of them pretty quick. “Lux Swift,” one of them said, stabbing another meatball. “Touring the low-elevation hubs. Unexpected.”

“Caught your appearance on Cold Truths,” another said, voice a little garbled as he spoke around the claw his tongue was cleaning.

“...Ah. Um. Hi.” Once again, Lux briefly regretted calling in to that ridiculous talk show. Or maybe they were being positive about it? Lux was finding it surprisingly difficult to tell, for some reason. “I hope you enjoyed it..?”

The first one laughed. “Who would have thought a human would be the one to get them to stop talking about humans for five minutes?”

“Their best show in a while,” another agreed. “Want a \[meatball\]?”

Lux’s eyebrows went up. “Um… Sure. I might have to cook it back home before I can eat it, but that would be nice,” they said. The arxur’s eyes flashed a bit at that. Again, Lux couldn’t tell exactly what it was. Amusement, maybe? Whatever it was was a lot more subtle than most arxur they’d met so far. “I actually came by to purchase some vrishnit powder,” they continued quickly.

The woman who’d offered the snack huffed. “This one’s for free, then.” She quickly snapped up a few more before handing the carton to lux, a single one left inside for them. It was much bigger up close. 

“Thank you. Um. So, vrishnit powder—”

“I’d have guessed they fed you a little better, no? Given all the work you do for them.”

Lux briefly wondered who ‘they’were. *The University? The Innovation Party?.. The talk show?* “Oh, well I um, I do have access to–this is–I want to make earth food, but the ingredients don’t exist, so I um… Am trying to figure out alternatives,” Lux said, a little sheepish. 

She tilted her head, looking genuinely curious.

“...Well, the plan is to try to make bread,” Lux confessed. “Um. I first purchased some prey-feed from a repurposed farm, but it turns out that the kind of grains used in prey feed don’t lend themselves to making very good bread. And they’re also not as clean as I would have liked. Anyway, my next experiment is going to be to whisk egg whites and add vrishnit powder. After that, I will cook it in my personal oven, and it should come out kind of like a cake. It won’t taste anything like cake, but… I’ll be able to cut it into slices and put cooked meat in the middle, and…” they trailed off awkwardly. 

The arxur laughed again. “What is this, The Piercing Claw?”

Lux laughed too. “Right? I’ve never had to put this much effort into having bread before. But the all-meat diet *is* driving me a little insane.”

“Oh, I can only imagine. But I wish you luck!” she said, with a graceful bow of her neck. “Don’t use the computer, ask for Irska. She’ll give you a good deal, she’s got a soft spot for humans…”

Lux gave a little bow in return. “Thank you!”

After a quick dip in the store, they got out with a bag of vrishnit powder— at a discount, courtesy of Irska. It was a lot lighter than they had expected, for what was meant as a filler. *It must absorb water like hell,* they thought. The bag barely added any noticeable weight to their pack.

The way home was once again fraught with measuring looks from the people they’d passed. Lux was already not a fan of being a celebrity, but they couldn’t help but feel these glances were more than the curious interest they’d got closer to home. Part of it was probably the lack of children. Further up the walls of the valley, there were more children wandering the streets, going on errands, spending time with their families. Here, it felt like Lux was the smallest creature that could talk in… an unpleasantly large radius.

Hal had mentioned how ‘new’ and ‘ahistorical’ the notion of the modern arxur family was, but it felt much more visceral as a truth when walking through a poorer area of the city. Looking around, there were no children to be seen. *How full are those education wards? And nurseries?* *How many of these people have children, but don't raise them? Some of them have to, right? If only because it’s fashionable with the upper classes?*

They hurried along, until eventually coming across a street blocked almost entirely by arxur. Lux paused, keeping their distance. Something was going on. Arxur were eyeing each other and crouching in low, ready positions. It *looked* like there was about to be a brawl, but it was too organized for that. Then they spotted the concentric circles drawn on the street with chalk. 

*Holy shit, is this snatchdash?*

The two groups of arxur erupted into action, and it suddenly became clear; yes, it was snatchdash. There were two opposing teams, each testing the other side’s boundaries for a place to break through. Leaner, faster-looking arxur prowled around behind the main line, seeming to wait for—

One of the larger players in the center made a play. She feinted, then pivoted in the blink of an eye, and pushed a defender back a step or two. The “dasher,” Lux was pretty sure they were called, took advantage of the newly created space and slipped past the line, entering the defender’s territory.

Now in the middle ring, the dasher sprinted along the edge of the outermost one, guarded by the “sweeps.” He juked, and made for one of the heavy-looking balls they used to score points. They had a proper name, but Lux didn’t know it. Kortin, or Ktorin, or something like that.

Whatever they were called, the dasher didn’t make it. The sweep read his juke and slammed into him, knocking him out of bounds. The unfortunate arxur yelped and went tumbling in a blur of limbs, and the others all called out the end of the play.

The entire field seemed to relax as soon as the play ended. The heated contest evaporated, and the big sweep went to go help the dasher up off the ground. He seemed okay, hopping up and chatting animatedly with her as he made his way back to the center zone to start a new play.

Lux figured this was going to be as good an opportunity as they could get, and hustled across the field. “Um… excuse me, how would I..? Uh…”

A few stopped to stare, straightening upright and following the human with their eyes. But mostly they all just reset their positions, maneuvering across the field.

Lux redoubled their speed, sprinting awkwardly while holding their pack against their side. Getting caught in the middle of a play would almost certainly result in something getting dislocated, and the field was a lot bigger than it seemed at first!

But they made it out, just in time too as the next play started—they could hear the smash of bodies colliding somewhere behind them before they even turned to see it. They took a breath, sagging against a nearby wall.

*I need to do more cardio*…

There was still a good bit more walking to get to the shuttle line back home. Why it wasn’t the same as the one they arrived at, they had no idea, but that was what their map had said. Maybe it was a timing thing, different shuttle availability and all.

The whole trip had been distinctly unsettling, down here in the bottom of the valley. There were all sorts of unpleasant noises; machinery, hot air pumping unevenly around. The occasional creak or hiss would startle them as they moved through the streets. And aside from less natural lighting, the plant life was sorely missed as well. If there was any green here, most of it was in dingy algae tanks backlit with grow-lights.

But the most unsettling thus far had been the large arxur woman—Lux was mostly sure it was a woman—who had been stalking them since making it past the snatchdash game. She might even have been a player, Lux wasn’t sure. A couple of detours had done nothing, and everything was so dark that anything more elaborate than that was sure to get them lost. 

After a couple more blocks of this stalking, Lux had arrived at their destination: the shuttle stop. They leaned against a pole—there were no comfortable seats, like there were at the shuttle stops near Hal’s house–and waited. 

She pounced. Barely enough time to backpedal and she was already nearly pressed against them. Their heart began to pound. 

“Um…” *what do you say,* they wondered, *when a giant lizard pounces in front of you, eyes boring into yours?*

“You are human, yes?” she asked. 

Lux almost said no, just to see what she would do. “Uh… yeah?”

“You are apes, climbers, yes? Small and light.” 

“...Can I help you?”

“One of my nursery wards loves the leaf-lickers. She is good with her hands, very clever,” she continued. *So there are at least some children.* “There is a boy. Cruel little creature.” 

Lux couldn't tell if it was a compliment or an insult.

“He has shot it up into the pipes. It is too far, and I am too heavy but… perhaps you could…” 

Lux chuckled. “Ah. Um. Can you show me the way?” 

Her eyes lit up. “Yes yes! It is very close, come,” she said, and grabbed them by the arm, nearly dragging them around like a ragdoll for two more city blocks. 

Once they stopped, she pointed up, and there it was. A handmade little doll of a *venlil*, of all species. Perhaps even Tarva herself, judging by the tail. It was buried way up high in the mess of exposed cables and pipes. They huffed, shaking their head. It really *was* in the worst possible spot. But… all those pipes were framed behind heavy-looking I-beams and concrete supports. Enough to support a human’s weight. Lux traced a route from the doll to the wall of a nearby two-story dwelling unit, down the decorative facade all the way to the floor. They  took off their coat and gloves, placing them down along with their backpack. 

“Can you give me a little lift?” They asked, and she nodded, offering her hands for Lux to put one foot on. After a little hop, they were on the building’s ledge, walking along it with a dexterity that drew onlookers’ eyes. Up a window sill, another ledge, and soon enough they’d reached the ceiling.

It was, to Lux’s horror, all *just a little wet.* The condensation up here was heavy, it was a wonder they didn’t feel it all dripping down like artificial rain on the streets below. *Alright, fine, it isn’t that bad.* But it did add a whole extra layer to the already-dangerous task.

Lux looked down for a moment. Regret briefly flashed over them, before they wrested it back under control. They’d been dragged out climbing by friends back on Earth, so at least there was *some* experience. But this was still going to be pretty dangerous. Hand-over-hand-ing along a slippery wet metal beam, two stories above bare pavement? Not the same game as climbing on dry rock with ropes and safety gear and a belayer. *How attached are arxur children to dolls?* But there was a little crowd forming now, and it wasn’t up to them to negotiate the doll’s value. So this was happening. 

Lux blinked, wiping their hands dry and mentally plotted their route a final time. 

Then they set off. Their brain quickly shut out all the distractions, the queasy heights, the watching crowd… it was just one hand, and then the next. Their feet came up to take some weight off their hands, and they shuffled upside-down along the beam like that until finally reaching the doll. Lux stretched up, plucked it from where it was stuck, and stuffed it into their pocket. Then they swung their feet gracefully around to the other side, and headed back.

Doing it all backwards actually proved harder than it had been to climb, and they almost fell down two stories—taller stories than human ones, at that! —but they managed to pull off their life’s most-watched awkward climb, eventually making it back to the same ledge they’d climbed up. They sat on it, the exhaustion finally catching up to them, and hopped down without much strain on their knees. 

“Here she is,” Lux said, offering the little toy Tarva back to the woman, who hadn't even bothered to introduce herself. She took it and slipped it gently into her bag. 

“Thank you,” she said, with a big slow blink. “The girl will be happy. Go now. Shuttle is soon.”

They nodded and jogged over to the bus stop, barely managing to catch it. It was pretty empty. Not a lot of arxur from the Snowpack hubs heading over towards Fine Sands, it seemed. 

It made the bus quiet and comfortable enough to set a little timer and have a nap in the corner.

From: Henry Leigh

To: Irnzel 

Irnzel, 

I have reviewed your “trial” proposal. It is a gross overreach, and vastly overcomplicating a simple issue. Lux Swift is a criminal and the galaxy expects your cooperation in handing them over so they may face appropriate justice.

Remember, everyone will be watching you. This is your chance to show the UN and the rest of the SC that you are willing to cooperate with galactic law and order. In my experience, cooperation always opens doors. This is a path to expanded outreach, embassies, and maybe even loosening some of the restrictions of the Bubble.

I have spoken to a few colleagues who are interested in sanctioning a few key information allowances — eg, one-way read-only internet access from participating worlds. You could expect Earth, Leirn, and Skalga at the least. Perhaps more to follow, like Colmia or Mileau.

Additionally, I do have diplomatic ties to the Wrissian embassy. I see no reason why Isifriss could not have its own UN embassy to support further friendly cooperation between us.

Of course, should you not cooperate, we may be forced to be more attentive in our monitoring of the bubble in order to ensure current law is properly enforced. If we cannot trust that you will return a fleeing criminal, thousands may follow in Lux’s footsteps, and we would find ourselves with no way to enforce our laws and bring them to justice. Preventing such an outcome would require an increase in surveillance and a more careful hold on the kinds of information access that have been slipping through the cracks over the past few years.

If you proceed with this, I am giving you my friendly notice now that I will be forced to go over your head and work with the Capitol Grand Office to ensure that our respective governments can continue to work as friendly, neutral parties.

Regards,

Agent Henry Leigh, ILEC

Grala and Irnzel sat in front of the message, plotting out their response. Grala had hunched forward towards the monitor, as if physically looking closer might reveal some weakness in the email, while Irnzel had stretched out behind her, looking oddly proud instead of worried.

“I was really hoping we would have more time,” Grala muttered.

“Ah, just tell him…” Irnzel grinned. “Tell him how we are glad to be cooperating with the UN and are looking forward to turning over this criminal… *after* a fair trial, which, of course, they aren’t at all scared of losing.”

Grala turned to look at him behind her chair. “You aren’t worried about this?”

He shook his head and continued narrating his potential response. “We have a responsibility to guarantee a fair and balanced trial regardless of species or political will, and blah blah blah, we trust that you are not implying that the arxur are incapable of doing such. And then say that we look forward to concluding this matter in the trial. Easy.”

“What about him going to the central government and pulling it all out of our hands?”

Irnzel drummed his claws on the back of Grala’s seat. “Hrmmm,” he grumbled. “One, I think he is bluffing. As far as my net is aware, he *has* no such contacts. Frankly, I do not believe that Henry Leigh respects the arxur enough to have any.”

“Hm.”

“And second, even if he did have that kind of pull, it would still be a matter of time. The Capitol moves slowly and has many checks and balances for exactly this sort of overreach, thanks to Isif. As long as our schedule doesn't change too much, we will be fine.”

Grala stared back at the monitor. 

“The whole thing is a bluff. He has nothing and he knows it, he is just trying to,” he waved a hand vaguely in the direction of the email as he recalled the words. “*Carrot and stick* us, as the humans say. Just tell him we will see him when he chooses to visit and be done with it.”

“Aren’t you doing it?”

“No, I have to go to CWA. I am already late.”

Grala nodded. Irnzel was very attached to his Collaborative Welfare Association meetings. She guessed he felt among his fellows, with all the “modern” arxur that went to those meetings. The group had been pushing itself as a political demographic for years, so the Skruerika chapter must have been quite pleased to have Irnzel as a member.

She wouldn’t fault him or shame him for it, even if she had no interest in attending herself. “But I have to prepare for dinner with the human,” she protested instead.

Irnzel shrugged, already halfway through the door. “Then do it after!”

The door shut, and Grala grumbled at the empty space in the room before turning back to the monitor.

She Doesn't Know That I Know - UPDATE 5 - Emily's Email,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1iv8qpn/i_discovered_my_wife_28f_of_7_years_is_cheating/)

TL;DR:  Emily wrote me an email.  Apparently she's a victim, too. 

A lot of you were wondering about Bev's husband.  Bev's husband texted me back ""shit""  and then ""thanks, man"".  I don't know how exactly to interpret that, but I'm too tired to be invested in Bev's husband's marriage.  I told him about his wife being a POS. What he does with that is on him. Good luck, buddy.

""Oh this is all FAAAAAKEEE!!!"" Fine just block me and ignore me. Go play ""Reddit Batman"" someplace else.

Emily's mom texted me using Emily's phone.  She wants me to unblock her. I ignored it.

Several hours later she asked me again and promised not to bring up Emily if I would unblock her.  

I unblocked MIL's number.  I texted her and told her I was still alive, had no plans to change that status, and that I will unblock her later on so we could talk.  I told her in no uncertain terms that I only want to chat about me or her, but not Emily.  I told her I need a break from all of this and I'll unblock her later and to be patient.  I'll contact her again. 

Emily tried a perfunctory ""I'm sorry you're hurt"" text which wasn't very comforting. 

Hints from her texts and the fact that her mom is using her phone to text me indicate to me that she's at her parents' house now.

There was a long silence of a several hours. and finally Emily texted me to check my email.

Went to my spam folder and there it is.

As before, I obfuscated the text and writing because I don't want her to do a text search on the internet and find my posts.  So yeah the email she wrote didn't have these misspellings. she has autocorrect and spell check like everyone else. Sorry for the annoying spelling. You grammar nazis are now the victims of my paranoia.

Also, I am making comments in the email too like before because I'm no contact and this is therapy for me.

Here we go:

(My Name),

I keep thinking about how this can’t be real. It can’t just be over. How u can just shut me out like I was nothing 2 u. It’s killing me. 

(Yeah, that's the idea, Emily. It sucks when you get abandoned by the one you love, huh?)

I don’t even know how 2 start this because my mind is racing, and nthing makes sense. I know I don’t deserve a response, but please, just rd this. Please don’t delete it. I just need u 2 hear me.

I talked with my dad and SIL's husband. I told them how I messed up.  They said I was stupid and they're right. I told them about how I never loved John and I always loved you and they laught and told me that dsn't matter at all. I felt so stupid. 

I know ur done with me. I know I don’t get 2 ask anything from u, but don’t I at least deserve 2 explain? 2 look u in the eyes and tell u how sorry I am? 2 tell u I never stopped loving u? U think you know everything, but u don’t. Yes, I fucked up. I betrayed u in a way that I can't take back. But it wasn’t because I didn’t love u. 

I need u to know that it was never what u think it was. It wasn’t about love. It wasn’t even about sex. I was pressured and felt obligated. 

(""Oh yeah, let me just shave my privates, wear some $700 underwear and traipse on down to the expensive boutique hotel for a nice raping.  Help! Police!)

John didn’t just walk in 2 my life and sweep me off my feet. He inserted himself. He did so much for me, and for my business. You know how much I was struggling, how close I was 2 loosing everything. He was the 1 who helped me. He connected me with the right people. He helped me with my lease, with contracts, with vendors. He got me meetings I culd have never gotten on my own. And I let myself believe that he was jus being a mentor, that he jus wanted 2 help me.

I told myself it was jus 1 time. That if I jus gave in 1nce, it would be enough. That he’d stop pressing. But it wasn’t enough. And I didn’t know how 2 get out of it. I kept telling him no, but he alwys had a way of making me feel like I was being ungrateful. Like after everything he did for me, I was selfish for not giving him what he wanted.

I hate myself for not shutting it down from the start. For being so fucking stupid. For letting it go on. I tried 2 stop it, but every time I pulled away, he’d remind me of how much he helped me. How I wouldn’t be where I am without him. How I’d ruin everything if I cut him off. So I kept making excuses. I told myself I had it under control. I thought I could handle it.

(What do we call someone who trades sex with someone they don't love for goods and services? Tip of my tongue....)

And then Christmas happened. New Year’s Eve happened. And that’s when I knew he wouldn’t stop. That’s when I knew I had 2 end it, for good.

I DID END IT. But by then, it was all fucked up. Everything was fucked up.

I knew I had 2 tell u. I wanted 2 tell u. I knew that the second I told u, that u'd never look at me the same way again. That it would be ruined. And I couldn’t handle it.

I know u at least suspected ever since u accused me at NYE. I just put my head down and wanted it 2 all go away.

So I kept putting it off and telling myself I’d find the right time. But there was never a right time. And now I’ve lost you anyway.

I can’t stop thinking about Charleston. Do u remember? That stupid little bed and breakfast where u hated the coffee, and we spent half an hour at a gas station just so u could get a normal cup of coffee? And we sat outside that little seafood shack by the water, eating fried shrimp and laughing at the seagulls trying to steal our food and u were acting like a knight with ur funny british voice protecting my food and making me laugh?

(Yeah I loved that weekend.  Remember when you didn't FUCK OTHER GUYS? That was a swell time too.)

I don’t expect anything. I don’t expect u 2 take me back. But I also can’t believe that u would just walk away without even talking 2 me. After everything, don’t we deserve that much??

I’ll sign whatever u want. I’ll give u whatever u want. But please, don’t just disappear. Don’t pretend like I never mattered. Because I know I did.

(She'll sign? This smells like a trap)

I love u so much! I always have. And I’m terrified that I’ll never get the chance to tell u that in person again.

(I loved you too. But I need you to get out of my life for both our sakes.)

Please.

Emily""

I reread my comments and I sound like a heartless bastard.  I'm just tired, I guess.  

No mention of John's credit card. No mention of how the affair ""wasn't fun"" for her any more. No mention of how she was supposed to be ""handling me"".

Is this what they call ""trickle truth""?  Because a lot of this sounds like the Emily I know, TBH. Maybe there's some truth to it but she's downplaying her role it it all.  It's like this was all happening to her and she wasn't an active participant.

I mean, I feel sorry that she lost control or whatever but it's not like she didn't have a CHOICE.  She CHOSE to sleep with the guy because she felt obligated and he did her favors.  

Doesn't that mean she's a prostitute?  Sounds like I was prescient in naming her AP ""John"".  Here, I thought it was just 4 letters that are easy to type on a keyboard and it turns out to be a ROLE.

Should I petition the mods to change my username to ""oblivious-pimp6969""?

I do want to know what you all think about it but I'm telling you right now it doesn't make a difference ultimately.  She's trying to change the narrative to the point where we're BOTH victims instead of just me and I think that's just shitty.  

The really fucked up thing is that part of me wants to believe her, that she was just a victim of John. But the problem is, that doesn't change the fact that she slept with him for almost a year. If I forgive that, then what am I?

Just sign the papers, Emily, and let's move on from this. Can't you do that for me?  Please??  You're young, you're beautiful, you don't have any kids, you are a successful business owner, and you have a whole wardrobe of fancy designer clothes courtesy of your sugar daddy.  You're killing it at life.  Go live it somewhere the fuck away from me.

1iwut2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electrical_Froyo7638/comments/1iwut2h/fear_digestion_part_2/,Fear Digestion part 2,"On Chris Williamson’s podcast, Alain de Botton mentioned how (im paraphrasing) “the dread you have for scary events in the future aren’t in your future, they’re in your past. The thing that you’re scared of happening has already happened, you’ve just forgotten about it and have placed it in the future”

Oof. 

Saturday afternoon I was triggered dramatically by this random, dumb ass YouTube ad. The ad presented itself as a highly urgent warning to people in the Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri area; saying that there are things coming for this region of the country that will be devastating. 

It was so peculiar watching this trigger unfold because on one hand, I knew I was watching some hyper conspiratorial, schizo click bait and on the other, every word this ad uttered reflected profound fears I carry around. This neurotic ad lit up my neurotic fears and sent me on an internal journey. 

Going back to de Bottons quote “the thing you’re scared of happening has already happened, you’ve just forgot about it and placed it in the future”. 

The tragedy I’ve known often gets forgotten about. The busy nature of modern life carves out no room for the processing of grief and its demand for your continual participation. 
Sitting with pain, grief and fear is never convenient, but it’s as necessary as brushing your teeth and eating meals. It’s never convenient to cook a healthy meal, but you don’t have a choice. Well, you do…but that choice leads to cancer; and I imagine neglecting grief and fear can lead to the same place. 

If the heart break of the past isn’t dealt with it will place itself in front of you, deceiving you with future worry. You can’t grieve or feel pain for any of the inevitable heart break and tragedy of the future because it hasn’t happened and you have no idea what it will look like. However the pain and anguish from the past is incredibly real and fills the somatic body demanding and screaming for attention. 

I came to that conclusion this evening. 
Realized there needed to be another visit to that 11 year old boy spending the night in the hospital watching his older brother grieve a tattered and broken body. 

It’s funny how we can deceive ourselves about our level of pain and our continued healing. 
It’s so simple to push pain back down with “I don’t have time for that” or “I’ve done so much healing work, I don’t need to think about that right now”. Just because I brushed my teeth yesterday doesn’t mean I don’t have to brush my teeth after a day of drinking coffee. When triggers hit, that’s the cue to address emotional and spiritual hygiene. 

The future is anonymous. The past is known. 
The heartbreak of the past will manipulate our relationship to the future.

The website is [purveyors.io](http://purveyors.io)

Coming from winemaking, I've felt like the green coffee space makes it hard to collect information and make educated buying decisions - especially as a home roaster. There's a lot the coffee industry could do to expand the understanding of green coffee from a consumer perspective and make it easier to learn about the product. The roasted coffee industry has the same predicament and often it's all about marketing and branding rather than connecting with the product. This is one of the main reasons I got into green coffee - to really learn about the product and the people who produce it!

All the suppliers have different methodologies for marketing their coffees. I've found it hard to select coffees from all these supplier sites in a holistic way. I just want a big marketplace with reputable suppliers and a comprehensive offering. Until now I've been using sweet marias and trying to order the highest scored/ newest arrival date coffees, which is hard to do because they don't allow you to sort for those data points. I want to see what else is out there, so I'm taking this project on to make it easier.

This project is just a hobby but hopefully it's useful for people like me. I'm going to keep working on it but it's at a point where it's not too embarrassing to share.

What the site can do:

* Current sources - Sweet Maria's, Captain Coffee, Bodhi Leaf- planning to grow this list.
* All in-stock coffees from the suppliers are displayed together, in an aggregated marketplace.
* The links take you directly to the coffee on the supplier's site.
* [purveyors.io](http://purveyors.io) is updated daily
* You can query the LLM (currently Gemini 2.0 flash exp) I integrated with the data to chat about all the coffees and collect custom suggestions.
   * It's really bad at math and dates, like asking for new coffees, but that's what the filter/sort tools are for.
   * I've found it's pretty good at providing tasting note suggestions and will even think outside the box by recommending certain regions or processes based on the flavors you want. Like if you ask for earthy coffees it sometimes recommends wet-hulled coffees, even if ""earthy"" isn't specifically called in the cupping notes.
* You can sort & filter

Functionality currently hidden:

* A roasting ERP system (basically like artisan plus but I designed it specifically for the Fresh Roast roasters. It's pretty nice tracking purchased coffee, roasts, and sales on my phone or from the web. If you are interested in using this functionality DM me and I may release a beta for some people to try it.",0,1740375256.0,roasting,3,0.5,False

How do I bring this up, without being an arse towards her?","Hey reddit! I hope you can help me, I'm in need of good advice!

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a while now, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue that’s starting to strain our relationship. Every time I make plans to hang out with friends—whether it’s a group gathering or just grabbing coffee with a buddy—her behavior escalates. She either becomes very insecure, breaks down crying, or insists that something is wrong if I’m already out with someone.  

And it’s not just minor distress—it’s intense. She completely breaks down, struggling to catch her breath between sobs.  

Even when I reassure her that it’s just a casual meetup, she’ll sometimes call me during the hangout, sounding upset and asking for more reassurance. I’ve introduced her to all of my friends to help ease her concerns, but it hasn’t made much of a difference. It’s gotten to the point where I feel guilty about spending time with anyone else.  

I understand she’s likely dealing with insecurities, and I want to approach this in a way that’s kind and supportive while also being firm about my need for personal space and social time. How can I bring this up without making her feel attacked or invalidating her feelings?  

Lately, I’ve started declining invitations from friends because of this issue. I feel like my social circle is shrinking, and I’m barely seeing my friends anymore. A pattern has emerged: whenever I make plans to do anything with friends, she gets very anxious, starts an argument, or has an emotional breakdown.  

I know I need to address this because I’m beginning to feel resentful about always having to decline invitations or leave gatherings early. I’ve tried talking to her about it before, but those conversations often end with her becoming emotional or angry.  

It’s taking a toll on me. What makes it harder is that this isn’t a two-way street—I fully support her spending time with her friends, going on trips, and doing her own thing. But the resentment is slowly building, and I know that’s a recipe for disaster in any relationship.  

I want to bring this up in the best way possible because I care deeply for her and want to be respectful while addressing the issue calmly. However, it seems like things are only getting worse despite my efforts to reassure her.  

I want her to feel safe in our relationship, but I don’t think it’s healthy when that comes at the cost of my friendships and personal freedom. For context: we haven’t had any major crises like infidelity (aside from her kissing someone at a party we both attended), so there doesn’t seem to be an obvious reason for this behavior.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  

TL;DR: My girlfriend becomes very emotional or insecure whenever I make plans to see friends. Looking for advice on how to address this issue without triggering negative emotions.

But he’s really disappointed me in recent years- he battles with alcoholism, his mom and brother pay his rent to live in LA (where he lives), he doesn’t have a job and hardly applies but blames his unemployment on the market. He visited me and he has no house manners- spills food we make like a baby in a high chair, put his dirty socks and undies on my bed while he showered, doesn’t offer to help clean or do his own dishes, and he generously paid for my coffee and meal out to thank me for hosting… but then he pouted when I wouldn’t pay for his brunch.

So my journey started when I encountered Sammy Ingram. I was successful for small things but failed at larger things. Also the way it happened was super duper stressful. I had heard people say ""oh her teachings are a scam, robotic affirmations don't work, you need deeper work, get into the state, etc""

Then I came across other teachers who are Neville heavy and believe his teachings are the only way. Like ""you can't affirm, you must use your imagination, and feel it real, etc"" Like how do I even invoke feelings I've never felt?

I've been consuming so much content to the point I am super duper confused now. I just don't know what manifesting is anymore and what I can do now. I've tried pretty much everything and I either ""fail"" or get ""half ass results."" I'll be super honest I'm extremely frustrated and sometimes I think this isn't real.

Also on Reddit, I've been told everything is possible but being able to do physical changes (ex. lose 100 lbs in a week) is impossible and unhealthy. Or that even doing things on a time crunch isn't the way to go cuz ""you are focusing on time, etc."" I've even been told manifesting a sp is impossible and they have their own brain.

Also I see a lot of people fail with the law which also makes me doubt a million times more. I just see small successes like manifesting a coffee. Like for example, I have a friend who is trying to manifest her sp for years by pure affirming and he hasn't conformed one bit. She's been trying to robotic affirm for so long even through tears, and such and it's kinda scary to see how she has become. 

Things get worse when I come across people who explain ""manifesting isn't real"" with a logical standpoint and it makes sense but there are also success stories. I just wanted to rant a bit and hope I can get some insights. I just think it all sounds woo-woo but I also have some hope cuz I've manifested small things. I think I spend more time on how to manifest vs actually getting what I want. I'm just not sure how I can be successful considering I also ""fail"" to manifest what I want.

1iwuld7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iwuld7/girlfriends_30f_behaviour_excalates_whenever_i/,"Girlfriend's (30f) behaviour excalates whenever I have(29m) plans to see my friends. How do I bring this up, without being an arse towards her?","Hey reddit! I hope you can help me, I'm in need of good advice!

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for a while now, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue that’s starting to strain our relationship. Every time I make plans to hang out with friends—whether it’s a group gathering or just grabbing coffee with a buddy—her behavior escalates. She either becomes very insecure, breaks down crying, or insists that something is wrong if I’m already out with someone.  

And it’s not just minor distress—it’s intense. She completely breaks down, struggling to catch her breath between sobs.  

Even when I reassure her that it’s just a casual meetup, she’ll sometimes call me during the hangout, sounding upset and asking for more reassurance. I’ve introduced her to all of my friends to help ease her concerns, but it hasn’t made much of a difference. It’s gotten to the point where I feel guilty about spending time with anyone else.  

I understand she’s likely dealing with insecurities, and I want to approach this in a way that’s kind and supportive while also being firm about my need for personal space and social time. How can I bring this up without making her feel attacked or invalidating her feelings?  

Lately, I’ve started declining invitations from friends because of this issue. I feel like my social circle is shrinking, and I’m barely seeing my friends anymore. A pattern has emerged: whenever I make plans to do anything with friends, she gets very anxious, starts an argument, or has an emotional breakdown.  

I know I need to address this because I’m beginning to feel resentful about always having to decline invitations or leave gatherings early. I’ve tried talking to her about it before, but those conversations often end with her becoming emotional or angry.  

It’s taking a toll on me. What makes it harder is that this isn’t a two-way street—I fully support her spending time with her friends, going on trips, and doing her own thing. But the resentment is slowly building, and I know that’s a recipe for disaster in any relationship.  

I want to bring this up in the best way possible because I care deeply for her and want to be respectful while addressing the issue calmly. However, it seems like things are only getting worse despite my efforts to reassure her.  

I want her to feel safe in our relationship, but I don’t think it’s healthy when that comes at the cost of my friendships and personal freedom. For context: we haven’t had any major crises like infidelity (aside from her kissing someone at a party we both attended), so there doesn’t seem to be an obvious reason for this behavior.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you handle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  

TL;DR: My girlfriend becomes very emotional or insecure whenever I make plans to see friends. Looking for advice on how to address this issue without triggering negative emotions.

1iwuj9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseMedicine/comments/1iwuj9s/can_someone_explain_my_diagnosis_frozen_heart/,Can someone explain my “diagnosis”? Frozen heart leading to heart attack,"I’m part Chinese but don’t speak or understand Mandarin so there is a language barrier for me. My aunt brought me to a TCM practitioner in a very busy, but sketchy office. It was crowded but there was absolutely no privacy amongst other patients (it was a small, crowded room where everyone could hear everything) and my “appointment” was less than 5 mins. I’m looking for help in trying to decipher what my diagnosis means. 

The TCM practitioner took my pulse only yelled “frozen heart!” to me. He said my heart was very cold and that I was a high risk to have a heart attack. I was shocked and confused. Aside from anxiety (I used to take meds over 10 years ago but nothing recent), I don’t have any heart issues, problems or symptoms I know about. All he would tell me was to stop eating salads, cold food, cold drinks, absolutely no fruits, little meat - and when I asked him to clarify, he basically mocked me and embarrassed me in front of the room, everyone laughed who could understand. It was such a humiliating experience. My aunt later gave me this list of typical TCM diet related restrictions while taking the herbal medicine, such as warm foods only, avoiding spicy foods, no coffee/tea, eating simple meals: green leafy vegetables, congee, rice, whole grains. 

Is anyone familiar with what a cold heart means and how that can lead to a heart attack? I am so confused because this is not what I expected (he didn’t ask me for any background information or why I was even coming) and this came out of no where. I’d love to do some research of my own but my google searches aren’t leading me to anywhere that matches what my current dietary restrictions now are. How do fruits come into play? What kind of search terms should I be using? 

I thought my diet was relatively healthy as I usually just eat a protein (chicken breast, turkey, eggs, rarely beef, etc) on top of a bed of greens (salad or roasted vegetables, sweet potatoes). I love my smoothies and protein shakes, hummus with raw veggies, avocado toast, keep to a dairy-free except for Greek yogurt, and mostly gluten-free diet, and rarely eat rice except for sushi. I have only drank alcohol once in over a year, and only have non-caffeinated teas and decaf coffee. 

My background: 34F, underwent major surgery in the summer to remove a rapidly growing tumour on my ovary (also lost the ovary). I’ve been going through IVF treatments before and after this surgery with no success in banking eggs for fertility reasons. Though I feel much better than when I first had surgery, I still feel pain especially when expecting a bowel movement or if I’m about to urinate. I feel intense pressure, kind of like cramps. My doctors did tell me that it could be up to a year for the scar tissue to repair itself which could contribute to the pain. Again, it’s not as bad as it once was. My period has been normal and nothing out of the ordinary throughout so I don’t have any concerns. I am unable to exercise like I used to (HIIT and Peloton) and get very easily winded when running. I am also always constantly exhausted or get exhausted easily. I’ve done fertility acupuncture with a clinic for 6 months prior to my surgery who spoke English, but it didn’t make any difference in my IVF results. So goes to say, fertility and my slow recovery from surgery was my main reason to seek TCM.

I met a girl at a family friend's wedding and she and her parents liked me so they sent an AM proposal to my parents, I liked the girl too but will have to spend a lot of time with her to be sure about marrying her and knowing her. 
The girl seems to an introvert and is a little reserved (or shy) it's been a week of texting back and forth.
I need advise on the following. 

1. Should I ask her out for a coffee/ meet her or is it too soon? 

2. I occasionally drink, she doesn't. I occasionally eat chicken, she doesn't. Do these things have the potential to be problems in the long run? 

3. I used to smoke (it's been 6 months since I've quit) should I tell her this? ( I still smoke sometimes when I'm with my friends)

It's a little tough to talk to her as the conversation on texts keeps running dry and our work schedules don't match so it's been next to impossible to call her and speak with her. 

I don't want to get married this year as I've just switched jobs and just want to settle down at my new job but I can definitely spend time with her to know her better. On top of all this my mother keeps asking me every single day about her and what are we talking about.
Any suggestions to manage that would be helpful too.

With my daily meditation habit the caffeine was starting to make me feel wayyyy too jittery. I've been able to associate negative feelings with caffeine and that has helped me quit. Some benefits I've experienced: 

Finally I've figured out what was causing all this binge eating. I was so impulsive with food, i eat when I'm not hungry and i really couldn't help it. I've been able to keep a healthier diet and make better food choices. I remember one day i was too busy to make dinner so I thought i would eat a muffin at 4pm and eat dinner later when I was free..... I actually wasn't hungry enough to eat it later. Unbelievable. 

My mind has calmed down a lot and I'm more present. I don't have as much ruminating or this feeling of impending doom. It's still there cuz i suffer from C-PTSD but it's lot easier to manage. 

I think it's easier to study and get my work done? I still need more time to experiment with that. 

In regards to sleep, i still need melatonin to sleep but i realize i can sleep for much longer. Usually i wake up after 6-7 hrs... Now i can sleep for 8 if i wanted. More sleep is always a good thing. 

I was actually trying to go cold Turkey but i had a lot of exams coming up and i was falling asleep at 5pm which cannot happen. I'm tapering with green tea and diet coke right now.

So, I (29M) stopped by a busy coffee shop on my way to work yesterday. There was a long line, and I was already kind of in a bad mood because I was running late.

Right in front of me was this guy—let’s call him Ethan—who looked like he had never ordered coffee before in his life. He kept asking the barista dumb questions like, ""What’s the difference between a latte and a cappuccino?"" and ""Is oat milk healthier than almond milk?""

I was standing there, watching the minutes tick by, and I finally just snapped. I loudly said, ""Dude, it’s coffee, not a life-or-death decision. Just pick something so the rest of us can get to work.""

Ethan turned red and mumbled something, but he rushed his order and stepped aside. The barista gave me a dirty look, but I just shrugged and placed my order in under 10 seconds—because I’m a functioning adult who knows what I want.

As I waited for my drink, I heard Ethan quietly telling his friend that he has severe anxiety and that ordering in public is really stressful for him. His friend glanced at me and said, ""Yeah, well, people should learn some patience too.""

Now I feel kind of bad, but also… it’s a coffee shop, not a therapy session. People have places to be.

19f friends are also 19f 

i have two coworkers who i have known for over a year that i started hanging out with social  in maybe august or july, we went to a club, i invited them into my friend group, to hang out with my partner and our mutual friends

after awhile i suspected they had feelings for each other and thought it was a bit silly but i would never go out of my way to make fun harshly of them i did ask one of them about it anytime i went into their store (i transferred a few months ago) but i guess maybe now i am second guessing everything ive ever said to them. they have never once brought it up to me that i was stepping any lines of going over any boundaries 

there were a few times when they would branch off and not really engage within the group i brought them too and it made me a little upset, ive been trying to reach out to hang out here and there since september, (friendsgiving invites, birthday texts, bringing one of them gifts at work for birthday, visiting them at work, etc) and they’ve been friendly the entire time even saying how much getting them christmas presents meant to them

important to note i did not just go to visit specifically them at work, i also went in to talk to my other coworkers too and ive never gotten any sign that i was unwelcome, my old coworkers were always happy to see me 

sometimes id go into the coffee shop we all worked at and talk with one of them for hours on end, important to note that i did check in occasionally to see if i was being a bother and she never said such. during this time i would try and give my advice on her crush on the other friend, she herself had a lot of insecurities about it and i honestly didn’t know if it would work out but i would never tell someone that their relationship would be doomed, i even drove her home from work once or twice after these talks and she would tell me we should hang out soon. 

today, i texted one of them asking to maybe catch up, watch a movie, etc and i got a long message saying the way ive been acting for months is unacceptable, that im making them feel trapped to talk to me by coming to their job, that i cant take the hint and that they were obviously uncomfortable and using body language for months to tell me that they were uncomfortable and didn’t want to be my friend, that they didn’t consider me a close friend at all, that i am self centered and treat them like sims and only talk at them not with them, that i do not know them at all, and that they’ve been trying to cut me off since november. she said that they were purposefully ignoring me as the ‘mature’ thing to do and let me live my life but clearly i need to be told bluntly since i wasnt getting the hint. 

i was devastated and completely confused because i know i can be self centered but whenever i talk to anyone i try and check in that im not being too focused on myself because of my autism

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

1iwu8yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecoast/comments/1iwu8yi/mar_14_apr_7_killington_or_sugarbush/,Mar 14 - Apr 7 @ Killington or Sugarbush?,"Howdy all,

I work at a restaurant on the Maine coast that slows down a lot in the winter, and as such I have March and the first week of April off. I also happen to be moving into my van in a few days time so I have the ability to stay for an extended period at either mountain. I’ve skied a handful of times at Killington and had a good time, but just day trips so I didn’t do anything but ski and hit the ol’ car bar with a couple friends. Never been to Sugarbush but have heard that maybe it has a bit more character/VT feel to it? I did used to live outside of Burlington for about a year and dated someone in the southeastern part of the state for a short while after my stint in the Burlington area, so I’m semi-familiar with the VT ~vibe~ in general and am a fan. 

I’m 33, a very solid skier, and love hopping into the woods. I’d say I’m lightly granola and would also love to socialize at least a bit in the three weeks I’ll be in VT. Definitely past the partying phase of life, but would love to at least be around and/or share a beer with some like-minded people and get into some quality conversation here and there. I grew up skiing and ski every season but have mainly been focused on surfing the last decade or so, but feeling the call of the woods and some mountain therapy is what I need. That being said, I’m looking for an area that is friendly for me to park the van overnight at (or at least very near to the mountain), and since I know I’m not going to ski for 21 days straight, where I can also hit some cool trails, hang at a cozy coffee shop or brewery, and a space to shower up and hit a hot tub or sauna while I’m at it. 

Essentially, I would like to live the friggin good life for a few weeks and get some fun spring skiing laps in on the regular before I go back to work. Killington has an affordable spring pass option, and Sugarbush has a semi-affordable afternoon only pass option that I could use even earlier than the 14th, which could be sweet to make it 4 instead of 3 weeks total. Being that I won’t be working, I would be totally cool with not being able to ski until the afternoon. Another consideration is getting the 25/26 ikon pass when it goes on sale (assuming soon?)—in past seasons, pass holders have been able to spring ski at Sugarbush and Stratton starting on March 14th. Less interested in Stratton. 

Given the above info, where do the east coast skiers of Reddit think I should point the ol’ Chevy towards? Help a bröther out. Thanks, homies. Thoughts/comments/advice, all are welcome 🙏 

PS the van does have two heat sources and is very cozy/livable inside so I’m not super concerned that March is still pretty darn cold. Another piece of info though is that it’s a unit and a pretty unique rig, so it is absolutely not a stealth camping van. It does pretttyy much fit in a normal parking space though.

1iwu8qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iwu8qg/retrospective_jealousy_31f_34m/,"Retrospective jealousy 31F, 34M","I 31 F have been with my boyfriend 34 M for 2 years. We have known each other for 16 years due to him being a close friend to my family. Since I’ve known him, he has dated maybe around 5 girls, 1 of them, a friend of mine for around 2 years but we’re not that close. During the time he was single, he would message me and ask me to go out but I have always declined, (even though I’m attracted to him) due to that friend. I know a lot of people wouldn’t even care, considering we’re not even close but for me, it’s a huge hurdle because I know what I’m like. 

I grew up in a very toxic environment with a lot of domestic abuse so I guess that made me scared of being in a relationship, so I’ve been single for the first 29 years of my life…. For me, being in a relationship seemed stressful and I guess I was kind of avoiding it too, I mean the only person that could hurt me is me really, plus I’ve been fine all these years. I just had to deal with all the “why don’t you have a boyfriend”, “are you a lesbian?” “I have someone that’s perfect for you!” Don’t get me wrong, there were a few guys that I did find attractive but I guess my standards were too high so I didn’t even bother (I realised that list of standards was absurd and was there to protect myself in a way). 

So I went out one night and something happened, he ended up helping me and got me home. From then on, the people around me kept telling me to give him a chance and after a few months of pestering, I gave in and asked him out for some coffee. The date went really well and we got to know each other properly, and I told him the reason why I never went there with him in the first place was because of his ex and how I didn’t want to deal with it but I guess I’ll let it go. So we started dating and I was genuinely happy. After a bit, I found out that he has hooked up with 2 of my friends (both from different friendship groups) and so I confronted him about it and he apologised, saying it meant nothing, during that time he thought he’ll never get a chance with me and he also gave up on the idea of settling down so that’s why he did what he did and he didn’t want to tell me at the start because he knew I wouldn’t want to be with him at all. Which is correct, if I knew all that then, I would not have asked him out for coffee. 


Fast forward to 2 years later, we’re still together but I’m still so insecure. I get it, it’s in the past but it still affects me. I found out the correct term for it is retrospective jealousy. I’ve tried listening to podcasts about it to try and better myself but it’s not really helping. He has always been a nice guy and treated everyone, girls especially really well, but that just makes me not feel special at all. He follows a lot of girls on insta and I told him I had an issue with it, especially since he’s flirted and taken them out for dinner prior to us dating and so he deleted all those girls. He also deleted all the chats and likes which made me extremely mad cause it seems like he’s hiding things but he said there’s no need to keep past chats if they mean nothing to him. Which I get too but I can’t help feel what I feel. Don’t get me wrong he treats me really well but we do have our small fights which we work through together and he also gets moody sometimes and doesn’t tell my why he’s upset because he doesn’t want to fight, so I just let him be, even though it does make me sad too. 

He use to be very active online doing twitch, discord etc, which is something I’m not familiar with and so knows and has A LOT of friends. So when I’m on social media, I’ll randomly see old posts of some of the girls he’s ’liked’(bikini photos etc), the things they say about him and, the nicknames they gave him and I’ll get triggered. I’ll question him about the girl and he’ll say they’re just friends and I do believe him but calling him “my precious (bfs name)”….It’s a bit much right? oh and he also goes out of his way to follow their pets accounts as well as their business accounts/side accounts… its just not something I would do, I have boundaries when it comes to my guy friends and I definitely would not do anything to ‘lead’ them on. 

I have really bad anxiety/social anxiety and a lot of health issues as well, so I like to keep my life simple, friendship circle small and only go out when it’s necessary. He’s helped me a lot during these past few months with all my issues but every few weeks/months, I’ll see these triggers and it’ll upset me, which is unfair for him because it’s his past. I don’t want to be like his exes and make our relationship toxic and we do love each other very much. I mean he is my first for everything but it’s just upsetting that I’m just one of many for him and I guess that’s why I’m so insecure. So now I’m at a point where I just don’t know what to do. It’s also not fair to break up with him for something that’s happened in the past, he’s been working hard trying to build a future for us but I also don’t want to burden him with insecurities.

(E.g., in NOVA this is “Northern Virginia Career Works”)

On Wednesday, March 5, Virginia Career Works will host a virtual job fair state-wide, where prospective employers will meet with job seekers. 

A new website will be launched on Monday February 24 at 10am, called “Virginia Has Jobs”. This site will specifically target “Virginians seeking their next career transition”. 

[Note: NOVA Career Works *already* has a website, and there is a new drop down menu *specifically for Federal workers* displaced by the Administration’s slash and burn approach to workforce reduction.]

Traditionally, workforce development programs have focused on skilled labor, artisan, and healthcare fields, but at least in Virginia this has been expanded in recent years to include support for job seekers looking for IT re-skilling, veterans newly separated looking for transition support, over 55 displaced workers in all fields, and now specifically help for Federal Contractors and Feds looking for re-skilling, certifications, job placement support, and career counseling.

There’s also a robust set of resources through Virginia’s library system, free to library card holders in the Commonwealth. Libraries also offer a lot of free programming, movies, author talks, free classes from knitting to genealogy to business topics. Don’t overlook them as a resource, and also as a place you can meet up and network with others, and most have shared spaces if you need an office type environment away from your home to prepare for an interview or just to get some quiet time to focus that a coffee shop can’t offer.

I’m not a career counselor, I’ve just been a volunteer in workforce development for over a decade. If you have a question you think I can help with, feel free to reach out. Take care 🤍

We put the wood paneling behind the TV today. We will be adding more diverse lighting and replacing the coffee table eventually. I think the room needs a bright accent color to bring up the mood a bit.

We're replacing the green curtains, we were thinking yellow and white with a very simple pattern (we will be raising the curtain rod further up the wall as well). My wife wants a darker yellow, but as I said I think the space needs to be brightened up a bit. I wanted a yellow that roughly matches the shade in the painting, she wants something much darker.

This is a common sore spot when it comes to our home decor, we agree on a general idea but she always wants darker, moodier, etc. while I think it makes the room imbalanced (I wanted the wood slats on the wall to be lighter and cooler toned, but she and the family said they preferred the warm medium tone wood because it matched the room better).

A high-performing PPC campaign driving immediate traffic while your well-optimized SEO ensures lasting visibility.

 Together, they’re a powerhouse duo that can elevate your product rankings, attract more customers, and maximize ROI.

Whether you’re an established Amazon FBA seller or a newcomer, understanding the right PPC-to-SEO ratio is your secret weapon to dominating search results and converting clicks into sales. In this guide, we’ll explore how syncing these two essential strategies can boost your Amazon success like never before.

*Explore More:* [*3 Ways to Measure the Performance of your Amazon PPC Ads*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/3-ways-to-measure-the-performance-of-your-amazon-ppc-ads/)

# Immediate Visibility Through PPC Campaigns

PPC campaigns are especially helpful when a new product is introduced to Amazon since it can target the desired population instantly as opposed to waiting for it to be found in the sea of constrained traffic that may not purchase anyway due to its limited feedback and reviews. 

New products for instance face a lot of challenges, initially have low ranking value when it comes to search, and hence lots of competition from well-established brands. The PPC ad places the product strategically where targeted customers are in the search results and gets to them on time.

* For instance, an **Amazon FBA** seller who is selling a fitness tracker will post specific keywords such as ‘cheap fitness tracker’ under PPC ads. This makes the product to be among the first to be seen once the search is done hence attracts the buyers. 

# The idea of Long Term Sustainability with SEO

SEO provides an effective tool for staying relevant on the site for a long time after PPC campaigns have finally exhausted their potential. 

Learning from the defunct free-for-all ad war, most Amazon FBA sellers have adopted the use of keywords such as in product title, bullets, descriptions, and relevant back-end searches to enhance organic ranking. 

* For instance, an Amazon FBA seller with a product “Multi-functional vegetable slicer”. So, if it is associated with such text as ‘time-saving kitchen tools’ or ‘the best vegetable slicer for salads’, it will be continuously presented at the top of articles with those words. 

In the long run this constant exposure means constant flow of traffic and sales without having to spend more on adverts.

The need for SEO increases even more by 2025, considering the increasing ad expenses around that time. Because of the impact of inflation in PPC budgets, those **Amazon FBA** sellers who do not utilize SEO subject themselves to essentially unmanageable advertising costs. 

Additionally, the targeted search results provided by AWS in the form of the A9 algorithm filters promote well-optimized listings more and more and thereby make SEO an essential part of an Amazon FBA seller’s success plan.

# Towards Better ACoS with Synergy Amazon FBA

ACoS is the most important yardstick regarding the effectiveness of [PPC campaigns](https://medium.com/@begom37641/ppc-campaigns-can-be-highly-effective-but-they-also-suffer-from-a-variety-of-problems-that-can-21922ffa2b5e). For those who intend to combine PPC with SEO, the ACoS of their products will be cut down in the course of the business, which will help in increasing the overall revenue return on investment.

 Enhanced product that helps speed up the pay per click advertisements so that the clicks through rates as well as the conversion rates are higher yet the number of unproductive or unnecessary advertisements is lower.

* For instance, suppose the **Amazon FBA** seller is interested in bidding on the PPC ad section to appear in searches next to the term ‘organic baby shampoo’. If the keyword is used both to create a category listing and to optimize that listing, it is a smooth transition for the customers. 

The next shoppers clicking on the ad will see a listing that contains ideal keywords and branding descriptions, or benefits including ‘gentle on sensitive skin’ or ‘no harsh chemicals’. This alignment enhances the probability of conversions; this makes each of the ads clicked to be more valuable.

By 2025, competition shall also increase, and the costs of ads shall be even higher, meaning that controlling ACoS will be twice as important. 

# Brand Credibility Through Review

Reviews are the basis for amazon’s success and PPC supports the creation of these reviews especially during the start of a product.

 Sites having healthy reviews not only improve visibility but also tend to draw more organic traffic as well as conversions. Always, using PPC with SEO means that the reviews can support both, paid and organic results.

* For example, the **Amazon FBA** seller who released noise-canceling headphones will leverage PPC to obtain 50 first sets of headphones. Some of these sales can be used to gather reviews which make the listing more trustworthy and more conspicuous. 

It means that Additional keywords such as ” the best noise-canceling headphones” can then be part of the SEO strategy to keep the product competitive in organic search results.

And as the trend of consumers turning to reviews to guide them in their purchase decisions intensify in 2025, Amazon FBA Amazon FBA sellers need to accrue a good review profile. Consumers even sort the product list results with a specific attribute of the product such as high rating and number of reviews.

 Sales through PPC give the much needed early push to meet such criteria while search engine optimization keeps the product in front of the buyer.

# Identifying High-Performing Keywords

Through PPC campaigns, brands get useful insights on timely customer perceptions as well as popularity of certain [Amazon keywords](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-to-master-amazon-keywords/). Thanks to such analytics, the Amazon FBA sellers themselves can see which keywords have the best CTR and, therefore, the greatest conversion rates. 

Such insights generate a loop by which Amazon FBA Amazon FBA Amazon FBA sellers are able to enhance existing SEO techniques with improved keywords that are incorporated within their product offers.

* For example, an Amazon FBA seller targeting vegeans using PPC and selling “vegan protein powder” may have stumbled upon a fact that the keyword like “plant-based protein for sportsmen” brings great conversion.

 It can be used in the product title, bullet points, and in the description where the title was included to rank organically. This makes the listing to be perceived by more potential buyers who are in the search for the same products.

Data viewership as a critical success factor to Amazon’s Amazon FBA sellers in 2025. The ability to receive the keyword performance data of PPC campaigns also helps the Amazon FBA sellers make a smart choice for the TOP placement of the listings. 

Those Amazon FBA sellers who take advantage of this information will have a better stand as compared to the **Amazon FBA** sellers who will try to guess.

#  Constructing Seasonal and Trend-Based Sales

In my conception, it is important to maximize revenues during consumption high seasons or when trends dictate so through both [Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-ppc-all-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-ppc/) and Amazon SEO. 

Since PPC brings campaigns to the target audience’s view immediately, they are especially effective at higher traffic periods during trend increases, whereas SEO guarantees constant traffic periods.

* For instance, an **Amazon FBA** seller of holiday gift boxes can use PPC advertising and post the ad each in the search engine under keywords such as Christmas gifts during the months of November and December separately.

 These ads generate traffic and sales in the shortest time possible so that the Amazon FBA seller can make the best out of the holiday season. At the same time, the Amazon FBA seller can fine tune the keywords and phrases which can be something more neutral like “gift boxes” for customers who may need them at any time of the year.

By 2025, growth in demand and relevance of seasonal purchases and purchase driven by trends, requires **Amazon FBA** sellers to adjust to its corresponding fluctuating demands. 

PPC enables the Amazon FBA sellers to respond to new trends or high seasons as compared to SEO that focuses on the foundation of long-term visibility. These two tactical strategies help Amazon FBA sellers to create constant sales regardless of the nature of the market.

# Competing in Saturated Niches

Saturated niches on Amazon means that when a niche is very competitive Amazon FBA sellers end up incurring high ad costs and it becomes hard to make a difference. 

This makes the complete reliance on PPC unsustainable in such environments though competent SEO strategy minimizes on paid ads to achieve sustainable competitiveness.

* Let us take, for example, an Amazon **FBA** seller in the beauty niche selling an ‘Anti-aging serum for sensitive skin’. First, the Amazon FBA seller might apply PPC campaigns to gain traffic and attract clients to its Internet site. 

However, in order to cut down the headline advertisement cost in future, the Amazon FBA seller concentrates on Search Engine Optimization. This explains how the product gains organic traffic and conversions by being optimised with poetic language, keyword descriptions and **listing images.**

When it comes to the year 2025, self-Amazon FBA sellers operating within competitive markets cannot afford to incur much costs on selling their products. 

Moreover it makes other campaigns such as PPC more effective because it guarantees that optimized listings will convert better.

 If a customer submits his/her query and gets a PPC ad and a listing presenting a well-coordinated offer, a buy is most likely. It also serves to drive up the sales while, at the same time increasing the effectiveness of [PPC ads.](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/3-ways-to-measure-the-performance-of-your-amazon-ppc-ads/)

#  Customer Retention and Loyalty the Strategies

It is essential to retain customers and be loyal to amazon and the best method of achieving this is by using both PPC and SEO techniques. 

While PPC targets those potential consumers who directly enter into the market through searching for particular products, SEO guarantees that the product stays relevant and easily found when consumers return for more.

* For example, a subscription **Amazon FBA** seller who provides coffee delivery services will possibly employ PPC to keywords such as “ best coffee subscription.” These ads create a market for new users, first-time users to the product, and create brand awareness. 

At the same time, the Amazon FBA seller reallocates resources and targets keywords such as “monthly coffee delivery ‘and detailed descriptions that will appeal to the recipient. This helps the customers to easily locate the product and make their orders again When customers plan to buy the same product again.

The probability by which customer acquisition costs will exceed the costs of retaining the existing ones will increase in 2025. Consumers are inclined to continue purchasing from brands that help make the process frictionless, and that’s where optimized listings stand out. 

By opening access to the listings and guaranteeing that any information a buyer might need is available, there is a level of trust established and thus repeated business is created.

# How to Allocate Budget Between PPC and SEO Efforts

# Product Lifecycle Stage

Budget allocation is influenced by the stage at which your product is currently at its life-cycle. All the stages require specific action plans to strike the best timing between short-term exposure and sustainable development.

# New Product Launch

When developing a new product, a common goal is to maximize the amount of attention a product receives as soon as it hits the market and as time goes by. PVC to PPC campaigns should consume 70–80% of your total advertising budget. 

This provides a brand’s product with a high ranking of relevant keywords to increase the rate of its sales, initially helping to rapidly gain reviews from clients – an important factor in SEO optimizing.

 As previously explained the higher PPC investment guarantees quicker traffic more often benefiting from a tested and active listing against the well set organic listings.

* Let’s imagine that you have a fitness tracker that you are going to launch. Blowing a lot of money on PPC for terms such as ‘cheap fitness tracker’ guarantees traffic and impression as your product gathers reviews and sales records in the market.

# Established Product

 SEO should be given maximum priority once your product is established; in that case, shift your budgets towards it. Spend 50-60% of your time for the purpose of enhancing product tile, description, as well as backend keywords to enhance the rate of organic search. 

Effective SEO strategy minimizes the utilization of PPC which increases profitability and the sustainability of an online business.

* Imagine a multi-functional vegetable slicer already ranking well for ‘kitchen gadgets’. The current listing helps more. This means that SEO investment guarantees consistent penetration of the market without regular ad spend.

To sum up, the novelty of the product implies high saturation with PPC to start its active sale, advanced products should transform their budget to SEO for more organic growth. This means that dynamic allocation approach lets you use the strength of the two methods at the right time.

# Competitors as well as Niche oversaturation

The competition level within your specialized area defines how your financial resources should be divided between PPC and SEO.

# High Competition

 As in many competitive segments, the question of visibility determines success in highly specialized fields. PPC principles also should take 60–70% of your budget because your product has many competitors. 

Engage PPC alongside SEO since they can be run in parallel to create traffic and sales on the short end while developing SEO on the long run. This kind of PPC should be steadily phased out with time due to change in ranking, especially when organic rankings have taken root.

* An **Amazon FBA** seller in the skincare niche that decides to introduce an anti-aging serum will realise that the market belongs to more prominent players. PPC campaigns targeting such keywords as ‘anti-aging serum for sensitive skin’ puts the product in front of the potential buyer despite competition.

*Low Competition*

 If your niche is not too competitive you can set aside a higher percentage of the total budget to go to SEO right from the start. There are lesser competitors and organic ranking is attained easily; although, PPC can be planned purposefully to support the SEO work.

 Here, investing $50000 or more to SEO offers the brand’s sustainable growth because it requires less ad spending.

* For example, an ‘eco friendly yoga mats,’ which occupies a relatively small market segment, will not need extensive PPC advertising; significantly more advertising funds need be allocated to optimization for search engine result pages.

To sum up, the higher the competition the greater the share of PPC you will have to use in the beginning. In other words, the opposite is true when there is little competition: a balanced or SEO approach would be more successful.

# Ad Cost Trends and ACoS Goals

It is one of the most important KPIs and, in combination with ad cost, will help set your budget. The relative use of PPC and SEO depending on these parameters provides for its profitability and effectiveness.

# Rising Ad Costs

While costs of ads are continuously rising, if ACoS is either constant or improving, it might be worth preserving a higher PPC budget (50-60%). This approach makes certain that you maximize your returns from the ads hence harness its constant upward trend on costs.

* That is why, even if the ACoS is 20% and PPC campaigns are remarkable in bringing conversion, it is justified to maintain high PPP when the costs are rising.

# Declining Profitability

If ACoS goes beyond your established profitability points, it is high time for SEO to be funded more. SEO investment affects organic places; it has little reliance on paid advertisements resulting in less cost.

* Whenever a keyword such as ‘organic baby shampoo’ sells a lot but in the process incurs a very high ACoS, then moving the budget to improve the position of the same keyword is a way of achieving more permanent standing, without having to cut on the ad spend all the time.

If the above metrics are tracked, one can be able to make decisions that are informed by data. Since SEO is less costly as compared to PPC when the latter becomes unprofitable, it is used for sustaining visibility and sales. 

This should be done continuously in order to identify current trends that should be followed to ensure the allocations result in the most profit possible.

# Seasonal and Nonseasonal Goods

Whether or not the product is eventually going to sell in the particular year determines where the most of the available finances is going to be spent between the PPC and the SEO.

# Seasonal Products

 Back in the peak of demand, particularly during festive seasons or events, it is advisable to invest 70-80% of your budget on PPC. Seasonal [PPC advertising](https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/ensure-your-ppc-campaign-is-successful-with-these-tips.html) takes advantage of the increased interest, which should be done anyway so that your product is visible to interested consumers.

 During the winter, you should move to SEO and dedicate 60-70% of your efforts for the long-term ranking of the business listings.

* An **Amazon FBA** seller of gift boxes particularly those for Christmas could use PPC in the months leading to December targeting phrases such as gift ideas during the holidays. After the holiday season, they need to ensure that they continue to optimize for general terms such as ‘gift boxes’.

# Year-Round Products

 For products, which are in a steady demand, a balanced approach is effective. Distribute your expenditure in PPC and SEO in a 50/50 ratio meaning that you spend 50% of your budget in PPC and 50% in SEO. 

PPC generates traffic to the website instantly, while SEO focuses on consistently causing a constant increase in traffic to that website in the long run.

* This may be done by a reusable water bottle **Amazon FBA** seller so as to continually capture new customers and at the same create natural rankings for terms such as ‘recyclable water bottles.’

# Keyword Performance Data

Keyword performance indicates how to properly set up PPC and SEO accounts, and how money should be allocated between these two strategies. 

Employing PPC information can help make a determination of the keywords to use that would help in conversion and the ones that should not be used. It can help you tweak your PPC and SEO so that they offer the best returns for your business.

# Well-Performing Keywords

It may be useful for instance to assign part of your SEO spend to ensure that your PPC refined key phrases are optimised on your product pages. If there are customers interested in high-performing PPC keywords, it is likely that if you optimize your listing in a relevant manner, it will rank higher organically.

 This would be more efficient for the growth of any business since it is not fully dependent on paid advertisement in future.

* Seeing that ‘plant-based protein for athletes’ has high conversion rates in a PPC campaign on a vegan protein powder, the search query should be incorporated into SEO. In this way, when your listing starts to rank for that keyword organically, it can rest assured knowing that without spending much on ads, it will remain prominent for that keyword.

# Poor-Performing Keywords

 On the other hand, target keywords that yield low results with PPC campaigns should not be used any longer. It’s recommended to refocus ads from those keywords to better performing ones in order to decrease your ACoS and increase your ROI.

 Redirecting the SEO activities to focus on those keywords that have proved to be more useful in PPC helps avoid directing our resources in the wrong direction.

* If you are struggling with the ‘vegan protein powder for weight loss’ PPC campaign then it might be best to look for an alternative keyword that works well in that platform such as ‘plant-based protein for muscle gain’ then to apply SEO techniques in an attempt to make the term work when in fact it might never does well in that platform.

By using PPC campaigns, you can keep reviewing the keyword’s success, and by doing so, you can use them on your SEO strategy and have your listings appear without using an ad.

#  Scaling and Retention Goals

It is crucial to decipher if you require extended customer acquisition resulting from PPC or focus on retaining those customers with SEO services hence understand the budget allocation that is needed. 

These goals will affect your strategy, and the acquisition will address PPC way more than the retention who looks into more SERP investment in the long term.

# Customer Acquisition Focus

If your main objective is to gain as many new customers as possible within the shortest time possible, you should allocate 60-70% of the budget to PPC.

 PPC is useful in terms of providing instantaneous exposure, meaning products are moved up to the top result where customers can easily access them, leading to more buys on your listings and, in effect, creating more customers. 

This is mostly applied when launching new products, or diving into new industries, where getting initial attention is critical.

* A new subscription box service may experiment with PPC campaigns seeking the keywords ‘best subscription boxes for \[targeted group\]’ in order to gain an immediate positive response and lead traffic to their listings.

Retention and Loyalty Focus: If the key objectives of your brand are centered on retention and subsequent, customer loyalty then it will be most suitable to allocate between 60 to 70% of your budget to SEO. 

Robust SEO guarantees that your product sticks in the eyes of the consumers, encouraging re-buying, and referrals. By providing focus on SEO you are able to lower the amount of money spent on advertising and have returning customers flooded with organic exposure.

* For instance, an **Amazon FBA** seller of quality skincare products would apply SEO in a way that their target product listings would appear frequently when clients seek products such as “the best anti aging serum” and “skincare for sensitive skin” instead of paying for PPC adverts.

Keeping a proper ratio of spend on PPC and SEO guarantees that you are establishing new customers whenever needed and increasing the client database overall while keeping it stable at the same time.

# Budget Examples: Use Case for Different Budgets

Whether you need to constantly attract traffic to a site or draw customer attention to a specific product, there should be a direct PPC to SEO budget ratio. 

Here are examples of how you would apportion your budget depending on a given business condition; when introducing a new product or when wanting to boost sales of a particular product during a particular season.

# Scenario 1: New Product in a Competitive Niche

* Monthly Budget: $5,000
* PPC: $3,500 (70%)
* SEO: $1,500 (30%)

Here, a new product in a highly sensitive market requires significant PPC to generate traffic and visibility and kick start the market. Nevertheless, SEO stays important yet is more of a supportive aspect that should aim primarily at creating a solid basis for the listing and for the formation of organic positions.

# Scenario 2: Defending a Moderate Competition Niche Market

* Monthly Budget: $3,000
* PPC: $1,200 (40%)
* SEO: $1,800 (60%)

For a regular product with average competition it is necessary to go for SEO. There is a good presence on the organic side and you can definitely cut down your PPC cost and put more money to work in other areas like refining product listings. This helps maintain organic traffic with some sale traffic as the icing on the cake.

# Scenario 3: Usage During Peak Demand Applies To For A Seasonal Product.

* Monthly Budget: $10,000
* PPC: $8,000 (80%)
* SEO: $2,000 (20%)

Seasonal products need a lot of money spent in PPC during the high demand season. This is particularly helpful since PPC enables you to bid for ad spaces during an occasion where search traffic is high season. 

The following examples show why your budget allocation needs to change depending on the stage of the product, its competitors, and its demand: Knowledge of such factors makes the allocation scheme efficient and flexible.

# It Is Actually Imperative To Flow 

PPC budgets and SEO are not constant percentages of a brand’s marketing budget. It thus requires constant assessment and optimization, which is based on both past and current performance figures. Monthly PPC and SEO audit reviews of how both types of marketing campaigns are faring will ensure the best results.

# PPC Metrics

 Many parameters: dynamics of CTR, conversion rates, ACoS, etc. It also allows you to decide whether your PPC campaigns are bringing the expected returns on the investment. If ACoS is higher than expected you should consider optimising your budget and cut PPC spend and shift more of your attention on SEO.

# SEO Metrics

 Track organic rankings, traffic and sales that are attributed to organic SEO efforts. Therefore, for websites generating a good amount of traffic through SEO and converting this traffic, the PPC can be cut back on, freeing up the resources to improve the listing positions and build overall organic rankings.

# ROI and Profitability

 It is also important to keep measuring the returns on investment for both PPC and SEO. If, for instance, PPC strategy is giving better short-run results in terms of conversion, then it might be more rational to spend more of the amount on ad placements.

 However, if SEO is effective in constantly feeding a brand with organic sales, then the increased spending will greatly offset the total marketing cost, and positively impact the brand’s long-term profitability.

# When to Scale Back PPC and Focus More on SEO

The next question is when is it so appropriate to start scaling back on PPC, and start focusing more on search engine optimization?

It means that if your business is gradually growing on Amazon, the approach to the ratios between PPC and SEO should also change. Although PPC can produce instant traffic and quick sales, SEO affords long-term stability and therefore a cheaper method of retaining organic rankings. 

The ability to identify when you should reduce your utilization of PPC and switch to SEO majorly affects your profits and productivity. Here are some of the signs that point to that crucial time when change of strategy is necessary.

# Unaware Your Product Went Viral

As soon as your product goes to the organic search results for its primary keywords, more PPC campaigning is not as necessary. Those that remain consistently within the first page or two of the search results for their defined keywords do not need expensive adverts to sustain them.

 If what you see is a gradual increase in your organic rankings you should be able to know that it is time to increase the budget on SEO more. 

By optimising product titles, descriptions, and any hidden keywords put behind the [product title](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/writing-balanced-product-title-features/) you create a solid organic footprint, which inevitably helps to lessen the need for ongoing paid advertising.

* When you are doing PPC for “wireless earbuds” for several months, your product starts capturing the first three positions for this word. This is something indicating that your product is gaining acceptance naturally and you can now cut down on PPC and focus on SEO to strengthen those positions.

# When Advertising Cost of Sale is Becoming Unaffordable

ACoS is a very important metric that helps you know how much you are spending on ads to ensure a particular level of sales. It serves as a heads up that reaching that ACoS level is costly not to mention if the returns are not proportional to the spend, then getting sales this way is not as efficient as it used to be when using PPC. 

Muting the PPC campaign and focusing more on SEO will eventually cut on costs and yet keep the productVisible. The other benefits of optimizing for say long-tail keywords or increasing your product conversion rate can help increase organic traffic at a fraction of the cost.

* Let’s assume you are using $5 per sale on its PPC campaigns and while making $10 in gross profit out of them, there is almost little room for expansion. Instead, you can cut down on PPC spend and instead opt for SEO to rank your product more organically, to sell more and spend less on advertising.

# Gain Benefits From The Reviews 

Customer opinions or reputation seem to have a strong bearing on both forms of paid ads and organic rankings. PPC campaigns can work for achieving initial couple of sales and more that are followed by the reviews, but with the given number of reviews are likely to be ranked naturally.

 As you advance to this step your priority should move to improving the appearance of your listing to showcase the reviews much as you aim at topping the organic search results and therefore reducing on the use of the paid advertising.

* A food selling kitchen appliance has garnered more than 100 positive reviews. If the review profile is strong, it ranks organically, and this means less push for GPaaS to aggressively sell PPC campaigns. 

This is the right time to go back to the listing and use proper researched keywords and make proper changes in the product descriptions especially targeting for the SEO for long term results.

# When Your Product’s Niche Becomes the Problem

If your product markets within a sphere which is not as keenly contested or indeed if your product has adequately distinct itself from other similar products, SEO can then become a long term, efficient marketing tool. 

If you just develop enough brand equity and credibility, you can get sustained visibility through organic without having to purchase click throughs. In such instances, the SEO strategy will ensure that product visibility is maintained, while less money is spent on advertising.

* There is an identification of brand loyalty and customer recognition by a firm selling environmentally friendly cleaning products in a specific segment. Once their product listings are made they automatically rank for Buy Terms such as ‘natural cleaning supplies’. 

Since there is not much competition in this particular niche, the **Amazon FBA** seller can reduce spend on PPC ads and concentrate on SEO to stay relevant as well as to keep on growing gradually.

# Performance of PPC

Long-run, running PPC campaigns will prove to be very useful in generating insights as to which keywords, and product listing are likely to generate the most traffic. In case you have accumulated a lot of data from the PPC campaigns you can then shift more energy towards SEO for those keywords that proved to be more effective. 

This means you get to make your listings keyword rich for the keywords that have high click through rate on ads hence improving your organic search results and avoiding over reliance on ads.

* One day after having been running PPC for several months, you tend to realize that ergonomic office chair term is a huge convert.

 If you can rank for that keyword in the first place, it also means you can now invest more into the SEO of your product listing by including that keyword in the title, description and backend keywords of the product.

 That means that when other variables are held constant, as the organic traffic increases you can reduce the PPC for that keyword.

# When Your Product is Seasonal

For products with high periodicity, then the PPC campaigns are usually most appropriate during those periods. As the season comes to a close, there is no urgency for increased PPC usage and tuning in for more SEO for sustained all-year presence. 

To address the latter issue, you should position your products for less popular, but more universal, keywords This way, your product will always remain in demand, even after the ‘season’ of highly popular search queries is over.

* As an example, a particular **Amazon FBA** seller of holiday decorations has many PPC ads running every time in the holiday season. During the [holiday season](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/top-10-ecommerce-strategies-for-holiday-season-that-your-brand-cant-afford-to-ignore/), they can spend a lot of money on PPC but after that, they can cut it down and just work on the lifespan of listings under broader keywords such as ‘unique home decorations’.

# When You Have to think Long-term

SEO is a good long-term plan that will help your products to stay relevant in the market without having to keep on with constant advertising costs. Although PPC is helpful for advertising in the present time, it is also essential to develop a good SEO for the future of the business. 

This way, transitioning to SEO enables you to shift some focus away from the paid ads while still maintaining overall organic performance, meaning that your brand will always remain relevant without escalating your ad budget.

* One sustainable fashion merchant has relied on PPC as a means of creating brand familiarity and the first sale. When the business expands, they start concentrating on SEO through using broader and more general keywords. 

This makes it easy for the Amazon FBA seller to create a good organic profile, and pump most of the investments into creating a long-term business rather than being compelled to constantly increase PPC expenses.

# How SEO Lowers Ad Spend by Increasing Amazon’s Organic Sales

Future and current businesses aspiring to cut down their ad spend and at the same time boost their organic sales on the likes of Amazon need to embrace search engine optimization, also called SEO. Through general unaided product listings, firms can reduce the explicit use of paid ads which may be expensive in the long run. 

# Enhanced search result rankings

The basis of SEO in Amazon is based on optimization of products for searches that are conducted on the platform. In other words, the more frequently a product is exposed, the more likely it will attract the clicks finally culminating in sales.

 Title, description, and keywords that are associated with a product must be optimized for higher rankings in Amazon search.

* For example, if we have a product such as Bluetooth headphones. Hence the challenge if the title is displayed as “Wireless Headphones,” it will be more complex for the product to feature on the search results when a customer is looking for headphones of a Bluetooth type suitable for gym use or the noise-cancellation headphones for running. 

This way, by keying in the words like ‘gym use,’ sports’ or ‘noise-canceling’ the product then has higher chances of being featured in the search results. When the product being sold is higher in the SEO rankings, there is no necessity to frequently make ad spendings to attract the customer’s attention.

Increased visibility through link SEO enables the products to go to the right market after dismissing the costs incurred on paid ads thus leading to a long-term cost saving through optimizing the organic sales. 

Also, more people are able to see the product and that shall reduce the dependence on the sponsored campaigns to bring traffic.

# Improved Click Through Rate (CTR).

A well placed product listing with appropriate title, [listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-amazon-penalizing-your-listings-for-low-quality-listing-images/) and a description ensures the product is well exposed and customers are inclined to try the product. For instance, when a user searches for particular goods, then, he or she tends to click on the listings appearing to be orderly, seriously, and credibly offered.

* For instance, a basic listing with a bold, clear title, and brief, persuading bullet points about the product and what it can offer is likely to generate more clicks than a general one. When a product has outstanding pictures and brief comprehensive descriptions, it is only frantic that its CTR is likely to improve.

This is due to the fact that the higher CTR it has the more chances users will be clicking on the product link and purchasing the product. This, of course, reduces paid advertisement as organic traffic becomes more effective. 

When a product is well placed and enjoys a higher click through rate, little is needed to promote the listing using paid ads hence lesser amount spent on ads and hence better utilization of the ads money.

# Higher Conversion Rates

Therefore, SEO is critical not only to the visibility and CTR but also to [conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-amazon-product-photography-affect-conversion-rates/); the number of visitors that make purchases. When SEO is well implemented, the products being marketed appear to be more appropriate and appealing to the customers hence buying them becomes natural.

The product title, image/s, and the keywords that are targeted aid the shopper in their browsing pattern to get exactly what they want. 

* For example, position statement development in the form of feature-benefit bullet points like ‘Built to last for your intense training,’ ‘Sweat, rain and splashed-proof,’ and ‘Powerful sound’ are communicating directly to the consumer. This is because the reviews and appearances of products they advertise build confidence and make the customer make the purchase without getting influenced by the ads.

Whenever there is an increase in rank, time spent by consumers on a website, the kind of products people want, etc, it is good to know that such an improvement is not only in terms of clicks but also in terms of conversion. 

This is half the norm of relying on paid campaigns, as businesses are able to make sales organically without necessarily hawking the product. In due course, this results in an increase in marketing productivity as the need for recurring paid advertisements decreases.

I think I may have hyperparathyroid. I have PCOS so I do have issues with that, but I work really hard at keeping that regulated. Every doctor I see though immediately runs to test my thyroid, which is always normal. I only drink water most of the time besides maybe a single cup of coffee on occasion, maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. No soda, nothing with sugar, no tea. I am very conscious of my diet and work very hard at losing weight. But my PCOS is a hindrance. I have lost about 20lbs in the last 2 months though. 

I’ve struggled with kidney stones for many years. They produce rapidly and I’ve had several surgeries to have them broken. I’ve been hospitalized for hydronephrosis and sepsis. No matter what I do, they don’t seem to go away. Diet modification, no matter how much water I drink. Lately I’ve also begun having tiny stones or stone sediment in my urine almost every time I go to the bathroom. My urologist is stumped by it. They’ve checked uric acid and it’s normal. My calcium is high end but still normal. I’ve always had lower vitamin D but whenever they’ve put me on supplements, my stones have gotten SO much worse and I cannot tolerate it. I have a surgery scheduled for March 7th to have 3 massive stones broken and they’re going to explore my bladder and kidney as well because they literally have no idea where all of these tiny stones are coming from but honestly my urologist doesn’t seem to be too concerned about anything I have going on.

I’ve also been suffering from monstrous headaches, extreme fatigue, body aches, muscle weakness, brain fog. But because I have PCOS and I’m overweight, every doctor just writes me off and says it’s all just because of my weight and that if I focus on my diet and exercise, the pain will go away. My kidney pain is so unbearable some days that I can’t get out of bed and the headaches are debilitating. But for some reason I cannot get a doctor to take me seriously and do any testing. I had to be seen in urgent care / ER five times before they took my kidney pain seriously enough to do imaging and not write it off as a UTI. Even given my prior history of hydronephrosis and sepsis. They wouldn’t listen to me. I even had a doctor tell me “this shouldn’t be causing you any pain, so it’s not.” while I sobbed in a ball. 

I have an appointment with my primary next week and she is the only one who usually listens to me and I’d like to talk to her about this. But I at least want to know that I’m not crazy for thinking this is a possibility before I go asking about it. ",2,1740371848.0,Parathyroid_Awareness,1,1.0,False

1iwtsla,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iwtsla/disappointment/,Disappointment. 🥲,"“Support local roasters,” they said. “They care about coffee, so you’ll get someone who’ll tell you all about how to properly brew their roasts,” they said.

Warning: Not all local roasters provide the magical experience everyone claims they will. 😅

I live in a beautiful, sleepy little town, and there’s ONE local roaster nearby that runs a pretty swanky coffee shop. Swanky enough that they opened another location in a town nearby.

Prompted from spending way too much time reading posts on this sub, r/espresso, and r/coffee, I paid a visit to this small-town roaster and asked what beans they had in their coffee for the day. They had no idea. 🥲 I was pretty bummed. They had several bags of their own roasted beans for sale, so I figured if I liked whatever was on “tap”, I could buy a bag. Unfortunately, they weren’t very helpful. And when I DID try a sample, it was overly sour and under extracted. 😅 I ended up ordering a latte to be polite (hard to get that wrong).

I visited again thinking, well, they have some Ethiopia beans freshly roasted. Maybe I can just ask about the beans directly, and they’ll offer some info?

“How long should I let this rest?” Me.

“Errr, uhm… I… I don’t know, uh… How are you brewing it?”

“Just a V60 Pourover.”

“Oh, uh… I just use a french press. I’m sure whatever you’re doing, it’ll be great.”

“Oh. Thank you. I’m excited to try it.”

$17 for 12oz.

Isn’t French Press the most “forgiving” brew method? Hm. Not looking down on French presses at all (I just invested in the Espro 2 and am really excited about it!), but the conversation made it clear the barista would be of no help.

Anyway… I think I was just excited to geek out with someone SOMEWHERE about finer coffee details, and excited in general to learn more about the beans they had for sale, the different roasts, and all that exciting stuff coffee nerds geek out over. But both times I visited, the different baristas helping me lacked any knowledge about anything being offered. 🥲

My beans say they were roasted on February 5. I hope they’re good! I’m throwing them in the freezer for now (still getting through a stale old bag of Stumptown Roasters that still tastes great TBH lol). If the beans suck, I’ll probably just end up buying something delicious online one of you recommends. And hey! If they’re amazing, HOORAY FOR ME! Found a local roaster to support!

Could just be a case of employing locals who don’t really care about coffee but just need a job. Which is fine! Just left feeling a little disappointed, and now know I should lower my expectations when it comes to local roasters.",8,1740371772.0,pourover,32,0.67,False

So far, it's going great and quite successfully. I feel like I'm finally living a life more true to myself and my values of simple living. I've always been a bit of a minimalist but haven't been able to always practice it. I think that's because of the capitalist culture we live in, with ads being thrown at us literally on every platform.

1iwtpbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iwtpbo/aio_gave_my_gf_ultimatum/,AIO? Gave my gf ultimatum,"We've been together about 9 years and have a 7 year old son together. She got fired from a decent job last year for being late all the time. She'd been there about 7 years. They instituted a points policy because of her and then used it to get rid of her. She can't wake up in the morning and is the type to snooze the alarm 10 times and then end up late everywhere. My son has been late to school 38 times so far this year. 

After she got fired, I let her take a break from work and told her I'd take care of her portion of the bills out of my savings for a month. One month turned into 4 before she got a new job. She didn't fill out a single application and got a job with her friend working with high school kids at a coffee shop that is in a suburb 25 minutes out of town. It doesn't pay well at all, terrible actually. It was supposed to be temporary but she's been there almost a year now and still hasn't put any effort into finding something different. 

Her portion of shared expenses is just the utilities and food. Utilities are about $300/month and food should be the same but she doesn't buy that much.  I pay the $1,500 mortgage which is in my name only because of her terrible credit score she couldn't be on the loan. I spent $1000 to pay her credit cards down to get her credit score up and she proceeded to abandon the cards completely. I pay the internet and buy food and household items more often than I should be. Altogether I pay about $2,000 a month in shared expenses not counting my personal expenses like gas, phone, car insurance, lunch food for work, etc., and she is supposed to pay $600 for utilities and food. 

I got a text from her last week while I was at work that the water had been shut off. She knew I would be mad and I understandably was. When I got home I was curious about the standing with the electric bill and found that it was $1,200 delinquent and the only reason it was still on is because it's illegal to turn off service in freezing temperatures so the account is protected until March 6th. 

So that was it. I snapped. I've been on her about it long enough and she just won't do anything. I gave her an ultimatum. She bought a car she couldn't afford even with her last job. We were supposed to buy a used car with cash from her tax return but she teamed up with her equally irresponsible mom who cosigned for her and they went and bought a $15,000 car she couldn't afford, on payments. 

I told her she can sell her car and use the cash left over to buy a cheap car with cash since she finally owes less than it's worth, or she can put some effort into finding a job that pays more than $10/hour, or she can leave. 

She became hysterical and left. She tried to take the kid, called the police, police said the kid is fine at his home and if she wants to take him with her she needs to get a custody order. She went to stay with her mom. Her mom is an abusive alcoholic with the record to prove it, that abandoned her as a child with other family who molested her. Her first son went to live with grandma after I caught him molesting my son two years ago. That is the environment she wants to bring my son to. 

So that's where we stand. She won't come back and I think I'm about to have an ugly custody battle. I paid the water bill current and I'm stuck with $1,200 worth of debt, no savings because I just had to buy a different car because of frame rust, default custody of my son, responsible for taking him to school and picking him up, using 3 tanks of gas a week, my fuel expenses just went from $200/month to $600/month. I explained the entire situation to my boss and asked for a giant raise and actually got it. My tax return will be here sooner than I thought and I will be able to catch up the electric bill without missing the house payment, and with my raise I'll be able to support myself and my son completely alone.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iwtofx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1iwtofx/tonight_i_found_out_my_wife_is_cheating_on_me/,Tonight I found out my wife is cheating on me,"Hi all. 

I'm 34M married to my wife 33F for 2 years, together for 6. 

Apologies for a long and erratic text, but need to give you enough context and it all happened a few hours ago so I'm all shaking.

TLDR: found out from wife's whatsapps wife is cheating on me, not sure how bad as couldn't read all of it as it made me sick. Not sure what to do next.

Full story:

Last 6 months we've been having more arguments than usual, although nothing too dramatic, mostly around silly stuff. Generally we never used to argue. Wife was really stressed at work during autumn, and we had a few arguments which didn't help. She suggested seeing a therapist, which I thought was odd as it wasn't that serious, so I declined, saying she should do it herself because most of her problems were work-related (maybe selfish of me, I know). We've been also trying for a baby unsuccessfully for more than a year, which added more stress and pressure for us.

Last 12-16 months she also mentioned this male coworker time to time, who she said was also a Prince fan like her, and they 'bonded over music.' I didn't give it much attention until some point last year when she mentioned she invited her to go check out some records during lunch, and then another time he invited her to museum. I said no - it's odd to hang out with male colleagues on Friday nights, to which she disagreed saying he's just friendly, and has a kid and a family, etc.

Fast forward to this year and we've been having a few arguments as well. I noticed that from around January she's been texting a lot more than usual, I did ask a few times who it was and she said it's her friend Laura (important for later). I noticed a slight change in her behaviour in January, like she was super stressed, didn't want to talk and listened to a lot of quirky music. Kept talking about all these new bands she's discovering. One odd thing that happened in January is that she left friend's baby shower earlier than me, blaming that she's tired, which is very uncharacteristic of her. Basically it felt like she didn't want to do anything together anymore.

Finally she asks me if she can go out with that male colleague, because he invited her to a cinema on a Saturday night to watch some band they both liked. I couldn't really say no, as I caught up with a female friend from school when I was home in January (just for coffee, she knew that). But the thought of her meeting the guy was really irking me all this time, a few times I mentioned it to-- her weird it is to ask married women out on Saturday night, and it's not first time he's done it. She just shrugged it off saying it's totally fine, everyone is friendly at their company and it's just a cinema. She even said she'll try to invite a few colleagues so it's not just them two. On the day of the cinema she tells me it's just them two, as the other two ""can't make it"".

The next day it was my friends birthday and again she didn't come. In fact I already felt something suspicious, I couldn't tell what, but all her behaviour was so distant and weird. I mentioned the whole male colleague situation again which made her super angry, gaslighting me like I'm some jealous dictator. She was adamant than he hasn't made any moves, it was totally fine, and I'm overreacting like some freak. She also suggested again we see a therapist as ""we can't communicate well"". Anyway we ended arguing and shouting and then I left. I did agree to see a therapist though asap.

Anyway I come back from my friend's birthday tonight, and she's already asleep. I went to bed as well, but just couldn't fall asleep staring at the ceiling. Now what happens next I'm not proud of, I know it's not cool, but I just thought I'd check her phone...I take blame for that.

One WhatsApp is with her friend, they're clearly talking about me and she's saying she's afraid of me (I did shout at her louder than usual), and how she needs a safe space and even gave her emergency phone number? Like wtf, that was shocking to read considering I've never raised my hand on my wife. I'm not sure what sort of shit she told about me.

But then I click on the ""Laura"" texts, keep scrolling through, and it's all music. But then I see all the messages how ""Laura"" is commenting on her ass in the office... something like ""wow your ass really looks hot today in those trousers"" and she responded something in return....I saw some other messages like that but by that time my heart was pulsing, hand shaking and I wanted to vomit. I was so shocked it made me ill and I really can't remember anything at all in terms of other messages, I was just sick. I just started shouting ""what have you done...."" and that woke her up. I left the phone with her.

She pretty much admitted the fact immediately, it was a lot of tears and she said she just liked that attention. She was adamant it was nothing more than flirting, and yes it was stupid of her etc and she probably wouldn't be able to forgive me if she was in my shoes. We talked for about 2 hours, mainly me trying to fish more information from her - when did it start? Did you have sex, etc? 

Now the problem is, my wife goes to other cities for work every other week, and now I started realising the worst. But she swore there was no sex, she was just talking to the guy for the last 2 weeks etc. And they didn't even kiss, nothing, not even in the cinema yesterday. 

I pushed her to show me the texts to prove it, but she declined. Eventually after multiple questions she did say that the guy was planning to come to the same city in two weeks and suggested ""they could have a dinner together"". But she said nothing would've happened etc etc which I find hard to believe.

She did apologise and said sorry multiple times, but honestly I don't know if I find her tears convincing. She was clearly lying to me before, and she could be lying again, just the fact she didn't want to show the texts is very odd. Is there more there that I haven't seen?

After all the lies I'm not sure I can trust her ever again. I just believe nothing has happened, like how do you comment on colleagues ass without having some previous ""encounters"". I probably haven't seen the worst of those texts.

At this point I'm not even sure what I'm trying to achieve by typing this to reddit.

You will laugh, but my two previous relationships resulted in my GFs cheating on me, so I broke up. And now after six years this again...

A man with a big heart could forgive and move on. But at the same time, I know I will live in constant discomfort and fear - how do I know they're not talking at work? What is she doing at her work trips? When she goes out to see a friend, is it really that friend? 

We have a house together which we'd have to sell in case of a divorce, have loads of travel tickets for the upcoming year ( flights, weddings, concerts, etc)...

I really don't know what to do, so any advice would be useful. Who do I talk to about it? None of my friends had this experience (thank God)....

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Wireless Handheld Projector

Now that we've explored the various ⁤audience ‌segments and their⁣ specific needs, let's delve into the key features you should ⁣consider when choosing a **wireless handheld ⁤projector**:

*   **Brightness (Lumens):** ⁢Brightness is ⁣measured in lumens. The higher the ‍lumen⁣ count, the brighter the image.⁢ For dark rooms, ​100-300‌ lumens‍ may be sufficient. However,‍ for well-lit rooms or outdoor use,​ 300-500+ lumens is recommended. Some **high lumen portable projector** variants exist for those‌ seeking maximum visibility.
*‌   **Resolution:** Resolution‍ refers to the number of pixels that make up the image. Higher resolution results in a sharper ‌and more detailed picture. Common resolutions for handheld projectors ⁤include 480p, 720p (HD), and 1080p (Full HD).
*   **Contrast ‌Ratio:** Contrast ratio measures the difference between the darkest and ⁢brightest parts of the image. A higher contrast ratio results in a more vibrant and realistic‌ picture.*   **Connectivity:**‌ Ensure that the projector has the necessary ports and ​wireless connectivity options to connect to your devices. Common ports include HDMI, USB, and audio ‌output. Wireless options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
*   **Battery Life:** Battery life is a crucial factor for portable ⁣projectors. Choose a model with sufficient⁢ battery ‍life to meet your needs. Aim for at least ‌2 hours of ‌battery life for presentations or movie nights.
*   **Keystone Correction:**‍ Keystone correction automatically‌ adjusts the image⁣ to correct for distortion when the projector is not placed perpendicular ⁣to the screen. This feature is essential for ensuring a rectangular and properly aligned image.
*   **Throw Ratio:**‍ Throw ratio‍ determines the ​distance required to project a⁢ specific image size. A ​shorter throw ‍ratio allows you to project a larger image from a shorter distance, making it ideal for small rooms.
*   **Built-in Speakers:** Some projectors have built-in speakers, while others require external speakers. Consider the⁣ audio quality and volume ​of the built-in speakers if you plan to use them​ for presentations or movies.
*   **Portability:** While all handheld projectors are portable, some are more compact and lightweight⁢ than others.​ Consider the ⁣size and weight of the projector if you plan to ⁣travel with it frequently

We recently made the entire codebase [source-available on GitHub](https://github.com/justdoinc/justdo) (your ⭐️ means a lot to us!), and as CoffeeScript enthusiasts ourselves, we thought this community might appreciate a look into how CoffeeScript has scaled in a large production app over the years.

**Why It Might Interest You:**

* **Real-World Lessons:** You’ll see how we implemented a JustDo in purely CoffeeScript. This might be interesting if you enjoy seeing how CoffeeScript patterns hold up in large, modern projects.
* **Meteor-Driven:** We leverage Meteor for reactive data and rapid prototyping, which played nicely with CoffeeScript back in the day. We’d love feedback on how we tackled advanced features, especially with Meteor + CoffeeScript.
* **Source-Available License:** While not MIT or GPL, it offers full visibility, self-hosting, and customization—geared toward distributors and enterprises. But anyone is welcome to explore and fork! No single PM tool fits everyone, so source-availability is central to our mission of enabling specialized niches.

**We’ve poured a decade into this** (and I personally love CoffeeScript’s syntax). I’m excited to share this living example of CoffeeScript in the wild:

I’m looking for some practical solutions to this dilemma. My parents and whole side of the family does not agree with alcohol or dancing at the wedding. His side of the family wouldn’t know what to do at a wedding that doesn’t have alcohol and dancing. I have already decided that I will have some alcohol at my wedding, but I am trying to figure out how to make it subtle and less “in your face.” I was thinking to have a coffee truck and then also an alcohol cart that serves a couple of alcoholic cocktails, as well as some mocktails. Does anyone have any other ideas of subtle ways to include alcohol?

And what about the dancing? How can I include some dancing but not make my family uncomfortable? ",10,1740370706.0,wedding,51,0.82,False

Other girls and people my age, like my best friend who is also 18 like to drink and go to the club. Lots of people live on their own or at a college dorm, making friends their age and being mature. But I still live with my parents and I spend my weekends writing in my journal and organizing my sticker collection. I have lots of plushies and Hello Kitty stuff, almost everything I own is cutesie and pink themed. I find myself to be very easily entertained by taking a walk and looking at squirrels and birds and it makes me very happy. I also dress in clothes that are cutesie and probably immature. My friends (which I do not have very many of) wear heels and skirts and do lots of makeup and stuff and I also want to do these things but I feel like I am wearing a costume if I do it. I feel like a martian. I go to university where my mom is a professor, so in between classes I go in my mom's office with her and eat lunch instead of making effort to talk to other people my age. My therapist has suggested that I might have autism but I don't know how to get that checked out really. I have a job at the University Lab Preschool which doesn't give me much opportunity to make friends with coworkers. My mom suggested to me to change jobs to a coffee shop or restaurant so I can make friends with other girls. I cry a lot because I feel very ""simple"" and different but I fall back into what I think is comfortable. (Being at home with family and having alone time.) My brothers also poke fun at me for not being ""a real adult"" or acting ""like a toddler"" because I watch children's shows or color and use stickers. But my behavior doesn't affect other people negatively I feel, because I have a job and go to university.  ",3,1740370584.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False
