1np4sh8,https://i.redd.it/gruy40e922rf1.jpeg,You Mee Ramen review,"Location: You Mee, Phoenix Marketcity, Viman Nagar

Ordered: Miso Pork Ramen (‚ÄúRich‚Äù broth)
This is a new dish as they have an updated menu.
Swiggy, Zomato and Google reviews, all still show the old menu.

TLDR: 
10/10 on taste, 
9.5/10 on service (nitpicking), 
4/10 on beverages

I am Ramen hunting in Pune. Tried Shisuzan and You Mee as of now. Ukiyo, Ginkgo and Soy Komo Soy, next in my list. Will keep posting reviews. I am not a food expert and will learn more about intricacies of ramen.

If you choose Miso Pork Ramen and out of 3, choose the ‚Äúrich‚Äù option for broth, you should get a deliciously umami bowl of ramen.

Not the most authentic ramen in my opinion, but one of the best ramen I have had in India.

The highlight was the pork meat for me. It was nice and chewy with a lot of flavour. Little sweetness to it but not overpowering.

The dashi broth was delicious. Even after finishing up the veggies, meat and the noodles, solely broth had enough flavour to keep me hooked. It did have little after taste of black pepper and the heat which you will feel on the edges of your lips after a few bites. But still I will not call this broth as spicy.

Nitpickings:
They use the disposable generic chopsticks, which have splinter problems sometimes, and are short in length, compared to the depth of the bowl. So it‚Äôs a little difficult to use them at the end of your meal. I like to use chopsticks only at asian places, so just my review. They could use the metal chopsticks which would be long, sturdy and reusable.
I wish they had the option to order extra noodles or broth.

Bad:
For the price, they have very average beverage. This time I ordered a cold coffee (‚Çπ350). It tasted like the coffee that I used to have in college in my canteen for ‚Çπ40. It didn‚Äôt taste bad per se but for its price and the type of place, you have a lot better expectations.",1,1758694695.0,pune,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been comparing the more premium veneer options which are well within my budget, vs some of the affordable solid wood options which are just within my budget. Everything I‚Äôve been looking at is from reputable companies with sound reviews. Self assembly vs delivered assembled isn‚Äôt a deciding factor for me.

I‚Äôm debating a few options:

a) Buy everything in premium veneer, save cash, spend it elsewhere (garden for example). 

b) Buy only higher wear items (such as dining table & coffee table) in solid wood for durability, but buy lower wear items (such as tv unit) in premium veneer.

c) Stretch the budget, buy everything in solid wood for piece of mind, but have much less to spend elsewhere (garden etc).

I‚Äôm 28M, she‚Äôs 22F (4th year nursing student). We met on a dating app back in July, talked for like two days, then moved to WhatsApp, then Messenger. The app was kind of anonymous, so that‚Äôs where we exchanged real names.

On the 5th day, I decided to take an 8-hour bus ride from Rizal to see her. I brought flowers, we went for coffee and dinner ‚Äî it honestly felt like a proper date. After that, we went to my Airbnb and yeah‚Ä¶ things happened on the first meet.

For context: she came out of a 3-year relationship about 3‚Äì4 months before we met. Her ex cheated on her, and she told me several times she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship yet. I told her I was willing to take the risk because I‚Äôd already fallen for her.

When I went back home, we kept talking every day and night. Two weeks later, I traveled back to see her again (another 8-hour ride). This time it was a surprise ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know I was coming. She was super happy and even admitted she thought I wasn‚Äôt serious about her (probably because we slept together the first time). We spent the night together again, went out, had coffee, dinner, the usual couple stuff. Leaving her again made her sad.

Fast forward a week later, I went back for the 3rd time. She caught me on Messenger with my backpack, so my ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù was ruined. üòÇ This time I stayed for 3 days and we spent a lot of time together. Everything felt right, we were happy.

Eventually, I decided to just move to her city (yep, another 8 hours from my hometown). I rented a place, found a job as a BPO manager with decent pay, and we basically see each other every day now. We eat together, sleep together, she introduced me to her family as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (still courting stage), and I‚Äôve even stayed in her room multiple times.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî she‚Äôs tried to break things off a couple of times, but I begged her to stay. Until now, we still don‚Äôt have a label.

I really love her, but I also want to protect my mental health. I know pain is part of love, but I don‚Äôt want to lose myself in the process.

What do you guys think? Should I stay and keep trying, or step back a bit? Maybe take a rest it's been almost 4 months.

Whether you‚Äôre a videographer, photographer, designer, or just someone trying to make your visuals look more professional without breaking the bank, we think you'll get where we're coming from.

üëâ¬†**What we‚Äôre offering:**  
We‚Äôve started the¬†**Aiarty Support Program**, where we‚Äôre giving out¬†[free license codes for our products](https://www.aiarty.com/download.htm?ttref=w1bl-xxx-r2509241)¬†(the same versions we sell, not stripped-down trials):

* **30-day license**¬†\- available for anyone who wants to use it for a quick personal project, a one-off experiment, or single-shot use.
* **180-day license**¬†\- reserved for freelancers, small businesses, and creators who plan to use it for client work, ongoing projects, or can briefly explain how it fits into their workflow. A limited number of these 180-day licenses are available as part of the program.

The tools can help with things like:

* Enhancing video/image quality (great for older footage or low-light shots).
* Fast, clean image matting (no more hours with the lasso tool).
* A cost-efficient alternative to some of the pricey subscriptions out there.

üëâ¬†**The background / why we‚Äôre doing this:**  
Over the past year, we‚Äôve heard a lot from people stuck with low quality videos from older cameras, or who spent hours cutting out backgrounds manually for client projects. The biggest struggles usually came down to¬†*time*¬†and¬†*cost*. As the team behind Aiarty, we realized that while we do sell these tools, we also wanted to¬†**create something supportive**¬†\- especially for those just starting out, freelancing, or building a side hustle.

üëâ¬†**If you feel like sharing:**  
The license is yours either way, but if you do try it and want to share your honest thoughts, we‚Äôd be grateful. Good, bad, or in-between - all feedback helps us improve, and it might also help others here decide if it‚Äôs useful for them too.

If you already share your work or reviews on other platforms that support ‚ÄúBuy Me a Coffee‚Äù (or similar), we‚Äôd be glad to treat you to one as a small thank-you. This isn‚Äôt payment for positive feedback - just a gesture of appreciation for the time you take to share your genuine experience.

üëâ¬†**Why this matters:**  
For us, this isn‚Äôt just about handing out codes - it‚Äôs about lowering the barrier for creators to produce higher-quality content and saving time so you can focus on what actually matters: your work.

If this sounds useful, contact¬†[media@aiarty.com](mailto:media@aiarty.com)¬†and be sure to mention¬†**‚ÄúAiarty Support Program‚Äù**¬†so we know your request is part of this campaign. Also, let us know which product you‚Äôd like.

1np4kf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTMississauga/comments/1np4kf5/do_you_guys_actually_believe_in_campus_networks/,Do you guys actually believe in campus networks or student connections?,"To be honest, one of the most important reasons I came to this school was that my college counselor told me that the alumni network here could provide extremely important help for my future career and personal development. After all, you know, U of T is the most prestigious and elite university in Canada. But after I arrived, I was greatly disappointed. First of all, I feel that this university doesn‚Äôt uphold the classical humanistic values, and there are so many people.Every lecture I attend has at least 100 students (though I know our St. George campus even has classes with 200 or 300 people). This makes me feel like everyone is extremely atomized and has become very utilitarian.



Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed that the culture here doesn‚Äôt seem to aim at cultivating a group of people who can make outstanding contributions to society or possess a maverick spirit, like Steve Jobs. The university administration and campus culture seem to prefer that we obediently grind for a high GPA, enhance our resumes, and if possible, publish a paper, all with the aim of securing a stable job offer after graduation.





This vision of becoming a white-collar middle-class worker, sitting in a fancy office building, enjoying air conditioning, sipping coffee and snacks, and using a computer to complete tasks assigned by the team leader, seems to have become the life goal of every U of T student. However, what puzzles me is whether this approach is still effective in an era where AI is becoming increasingly important, offering highly cost-effective and extremely cheap labor.

  
I recently read an article on Stack Overflow: [AI vs Gen Z: How AI has changed the career pathway for junior developers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/.In).  
  
In simple terms, the article points out that entry-level positions for Gen Z (those born after 1995, though I believe most people browsing this subreddit were likely born after 2000) are becoming increasingly scarce. AI is making junior software developers less and less needed. The future will be an era of human-AI collaboration, where we need to evaluate the answers provided by AI and its tempo in specific contexts, and, more importantly, individuals need to proactively adapt to the skills truly required in the AI era. However, I find that this university is extremely lacking in this regard.



That being said, even if most people follow the standard white-collar career path of university internships, job entry, and promotions, personally I don't find myself particularly interested in or in need of such conventional routes. I don't want to hide anything - I do come from a relatively wealthy family in China, and my parents have provided me with a solid financial foundation. Even if I don't work, the amount of money I can spend or access in a year might exceed what some of my classmates would earn a decade after graduation. This has left me with little motivation to understand their struggles. For instance, when a friend told me about focusing on GPA to get into grad school and then land a good job, I found it utterly boring - it felt like their life was already scripted by some predetermined plan. Furthermore, the recently published paper ""Genius on Demand: The Value of Transformative Artificial Intelligence"" presents an extremely pessimistic view, arguing that as AI grows increasingly powerful, it will replace most jobs, leaving only a handful of geniuses capable of creating real value. This makes me seriously question whether their efforts are truly meaningful.



I just had to get this off my chest, and I feel much better saying it. To be honest, I'm kind of disillusioned with this place. I feel like my counsellor tricked me into coming here. It's not as good as she made it out to be. But maybe I'm just not the right fit for this place...",1,1758693879.0,UTMississauga,0,1.0,False

- At ryokan or bigger spas, you may also get a yukata (cotton robe) or pajama-style loungewear.

‚∏ª

Step 3: Changing Room
- Undress completely. Swimsuits are not allowed.
- Leave everything in your locker except the small towel.
- Amenities vary: shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are standard; some places also provide skincare and hairdryers.

‚∏ª

Step 4: Wash Thoroughly
- Enter the shower area naked with your small towel.
- Sit on the stool, use the shower or bucket, and wash every surface of your body ‚Äî think ‚Äúremove all forensic evidence of a crime.‚Äù
- Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are usually provided. You can also bring your own toiletries.
- Rinse completely before heading to the bath.

‚∏ª

Step 5: Enter the Bath
- Once clean, soak. The bath is for relaxing, not washing.
- Keep towels and hair out of the water. Tie hair up or rest the towel on your head.
- If a strand falls in, pick it out immediately.
- Talk only in a low murmur. Etiquette says quiet, but in practice rules are often looser for men, and some baths (especially with kids) can be cheerful and noisy.

‚∏ª

Step 6: Between Baths & Sauna
- Rinse off quickly before moving between pools.
- Always wash or rinse after the sauna before re-entering the bath.
- Make sure rinse water doesn‚Äôt flow back into the bath.

‚∏ª

Types of Onsen

Day-use public baths ‚Äì Most common. Many open late, and some run 24 hours. Larger facilities may have nap rooms or restaurants attached 

Ryokan (inn) baths ‚Äì Same rules, but guests usually bathe before dinner and breakfast. Wear the yukata provided to and from the bath. Many ryokan also open their baths for day visitors (often 11am‚Äì2pm).

Private baths (Ë≤∏ÂàáÈ¢®ÂëÇ / kazokuburo) ‚Äì Reserved for couples or families. More relaxed, but still wash first.

Wild onsen ‚Äì Natural outdoor springs. Customs vary (sometimes swimsuits). Never use soap in rivers. Rinse before entering, and leave no trace.

Rotenburo (Èú≤Â§©È¢®ÂëÇ) ‚Äì Outdoor baths, often with mountain or river views. Magical in snow or rain.

‚∏ª

Extras & Good-to-Know
- Children ‚Äì Welcome if toilet-trained. Nappies/diapers are not allowed in the baths. Kids under ~6‚Äì7 can enter with either gender parent.

- Tattoos ‚Äì Some onsen restrict them. You can often cover with a tattoo seal („Çø„Éà„Ç•„Éº„Ç∑„Éº„É´).

- Snow gear ‚Äì In winter, people sometimes wear wool hats or conical hats (sugegasa) to keep snow or rain off while soaking.

- After bathing ‚Äì Dry off lightly before entering the changing room. Drink water, or try the classic coffee milk or fruit milk.

- Sauna flow ‚Äì Standard is sauna ‚Üí cold plunge ‚Üí hot bath ‚Üí rest ‚Üí repeat.",1,1758693335.0,u_CloudsandRoads,0,1.0,False

My wife and I had our second child 4 weeks ago and I took a week off work while she's been on parental leave. 

I began working from home as she had a c section and needed more help which I totally understand. My frustrations come in now that she is mostly recovered, off work and I feel like I'm still doing a lot of the night time stuff basically 50/50.


She decided to pump, complains about it all the time, doesn't pump enough.

She only pumps maybe 4 times a day which means our baby is probably drinking 60-70% formula anyways. Despite this she still pumps although it's very infrequently where there isn't a steady milk supply. 

I will say it I think this is pointless, he's swapping back and forth between full formula and mostly formula there isn't enough milk to make sure he's fed anyways. She feels as though he needs her milk but does not want to breast feed.


Night time is split into two sections, 10-2 and 2-6.

I have him from 10-2 every night and he does not sleep, he's up 80% of the time and loses his mind if he does not eat every 1-2 hours at random. She does the 2- whenever she wakes me up to take him in the morning which can be 5, 6 or whenever and then she sleeps until 8. I start work at 8 meaning I'm basically sleeping from 2-5 or 6 if I'm able. She has the ability to sleep during the day, he sleeps more during the day but refuses to take naps. Why I'm not sure but that means I'm running on 3-4 hours of sleep a night.

I feel like since she can sleep during the day she should take the majority of his night time routine, not sleep 4 hours until 2 then be awake for maybe 2 hours then sleep for 2-3 hours. I have fallen asleep with him on me and she chastised me for it.


Frequently while I'm working she asks me to take him, so she can have a shower or go out to grab a coffee or something like that.

I get that she needs to shower, id prefer her to do it once our 3 year old goes to bed or even during the day when the baby falls asleep but it's always random and a lot of the time lines up with his wake window. She also calls me all the time when I'm out at clients homes doing quotes asking when I'm coming home, in my mind, my work hours should be when I work and only during emergencies should I look after the baby.

1. Big city‚Äôs and small towns are your worst enemy try to live or at least sleep in medium sized towns/cities I live in the Midwest so my examples are from that area, St.George, Springville, cedar city, anything in the 25,000-125,000 range is the sweet spot. Too big and the crime rate means dangerous encounters are more likely, too small and people pay too much attention (good or bad) and tend to get weird about it.

2. Either get a gym membership or get really familiar with what gas stations have showers and make sure you stay up on your hygiene (brush your teeth, shower, wipe your body down in bathrooms if you can‚Äôt find a shower) it‚Äôs not just important for your physical health it is critical for your mental health as well. (Pools and rec centers are also good places to go for showers as they are usually cheap and clean and can also be a good place to hang out) 

3. Have a bathroom plan for everyplace you sleep, getting a ticket at 4  am for peeing on a tree because you parked 5 miles from the nearest public (and open) bathroom Is not a fun time. Construction sites usually have porta  pottys and if your in a population sweet spot they usually don‚Äôt have cameras or fenced off areas.

4. Boredom will be your biggest problem, library‚Äôs, local game shops, Barnes and nobles, and coffee shops are your best friend when you just need to not sit in your car but don‚Äôt have a place to be (malls, outlet stores can be good too but I personally get real bored real fast there)

The heat gets turned up slowly. Changes so subtle most don‚Äôt jump out. Time goes and the flavor of the church is nothing like it used to be.

Some things stand out for me:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†For decades, no crucifixion art, no cross. Now, chapels hang art of Christ on the cross - a step toward embracing mainstream Christian symbols. And language shifts to Christian mainstream.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Music shifts: drums, guitars, and praise-style hymns with a ‚Äúnew age‚Äù or Southern Baptist vibe. The hymnbook alone no longer defines worship. Band camp is coming.

Members rarely question it. Leaders present these changes as inspiration or ‚Äúrevelation,‚Äù and the rank and file nod along the thinking is already done.

This slow simmer is so obviously deliberate. An attempt to shed ‚Äúpeculiarity‚Äù and counter declining membership by rebranding the church as more palatable, more mainstream Christian.  Predictions I think we may even see:
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†LGBTQ+ inclusion softening once the current hard-liners like Oakes croaks. Doctrine often shifts with the death of the gatekeepers. Priesthood lite for women but not the full version. 
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Relaxed Word of Wisdom enforcement, maybe tea, coffee, or even social alcohol tolerated.
¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†More overt Christian branding (crosses, crucifixion art, evangelical-style worship).

From inside the crock pot, the frogs feel all nice a warm with the new rollout brand-wank revelations from the cronies. From outside, it looks like a badly made mash-up crock of shit, cringy-as-hell rebrand for mainstream TBM consumption.

So my question is: are the members frogs in the crock pot, slowly simmering into mainstream Christianity- or the whole about to croak completely in its own bullshit? Either way I don‚Äôt give a shit. It‚Äôs just interesting watching the pot boil. ",3,1758692606.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

1np44oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1np44oq/that_one_substitute_class/,That one substitute class,"Back in elementary when I was in 6th grade, honestly I don‚Äôt even know why we had a substitute teacher that day, sometimes we‚Äôd have substitutes when it was either personal matters with our teacher, or school board meetings. But I don‚Äôt remember why we had a substitute that day, all I remember was that it was bad. The teacher wasn‚Äôt bad, she was honestly doing her best that day, the problem was my classmates, not all of them but most of them. I‚Äôm not trying to be a party pooper, but why is it whenever we have a substitute teacher, the classroom suddenly becomes a war zone, the damn hunger games, classmates start acting like we‚Äôre kindergartners. But this specific day all hell broke loose, the first hour started as usual for substitute days, the teacher would take attendance, mess up some names, that one kid that always makes up crap about his nickname and stuff, and always that one kid that yells ‚Äúnot here‚Äù when their name gets called out. Honestly that day I was pretty tired, wasn‚Äôt in the mood for anything and just wanted to go home and nap, I was running off the sad breakfast of school milk and those coffee breads they gave out. Then of course was the teacher‚Äôs note the substitute would read out for us, just our usual teacher telling us to behave and that he was out going personal matters. And then the substitute would give us the worksheet for the first subject of the day. I honestly forgot the substitute‚Äôs name so ima just call her Miss M, I do remember my regular teacher‚Äôs name however, Mr. Merchant, yea that was his name. So the first 2 hours go fine, I‚Äôm just trying to do my worksheet when the girls start to all ask to go to the bathroom all the sudden. One by one after another just to go to the bathroom, the substitute let them hit them got suspicious, and when one of the girls was taking too long the teacher left for literally 5 minutes because the bathrooms were not that far from the classroom, and that one group of boys, like three of them I remembered by Kevin, Issac and Marco start throwing crumbled paper at eachother, and from there I already knew this day was fucked. Some other students start taking their phones out, those two girls that were responsible actually do their worksheet, and me, I‚Äôm just trying to keep it together, I wasn‚Äôt exactly innocent either because I just laid my head down, my head was hurting as it was and I just wanted to go home. That‚Äôs when Miss M walks back in and the boys stop and she starts lecturing the class about respect and responsibility and that we needed to lesson to her, honestly she deserved a reward for her patience because I feel like I would have crashed out by then. Anyway the day started to become worse by the hours as Miss M kept giving us worksheets Mr. Merchant left us for the day, and slowly but surely the others started doing their own thing, then was the first recess of the day, I just laid down by the grass where the trees made a nice shade and stuff and tried to get my headache to go away. After recess however some students took their sweet time getting back in, some stayed in the bathroom longer, and some started to do their own thing in there desks, by the time we went to lunch we had finished the 5th worksheet, coming back from lunch I guess everyone just said, ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and that‚Äôs when everything went down. You‚Äôre probably thinking I‚Äôm lying but I mean it, one of my classmates made a mini fortress with one of the big tables and chairs and used others backpacks, the boys were plying fricken Uno in the corner, some girls were using their phones to take Snapchat pics, and honestly I don‚Äôt know how but Chris from the other class was in my class playing Uno with the other guys, at that point I can see Miss M just writing in her little clipboard like she had just given up completely. I was honestly too tired to care anymore and just finished the worksheets and took a nap on my desk until leaving time. By the next day I knew that entering that classroom, Mr. Merchant was going to be pissed. It‚Äôs always that way with a substitute teacher. As soon as everyone sat down Mr. Merchant stood up and started to scold us with the, ‚ÄúNever in my 10000 years of teaching.‚Äù And the ,‚ÄùI‚Äôm not mad I‚Äôm just disappointed.‚Äù And how he was ashamed that we acted that way. One of the girls that didn‚Äôt do anything actually told him that not everyone was acting up. To his respond being,‚ÄùI know, but it could have made a difference if we‚Äôd try to help maintain order and try and help our classmates not act up. Yeah like that would work, but I could tell he was just as stressed since he was actually planning his wedding at the time so he would often call days off for a substitute whenever he needed to do something important for his upcoming wedding. But yeah we lost out on our pizza party and movie night, even our gaming day because every 2 weeks Mr. Merchant would bring in his Nintendo and we would all take turns playing Mario Cart and this cooking battle game I forgot the name to.

Only major medical history is TB (lungs) about 5 years ago.  
I don‚Äôt drink (only 3 times in my life) or smoke (never).

**Lifestyle details:**

* Sedentary/low activity (stopped going to the gym about a year ago), often lethargic
* **Diet:**¬†Mostly regular home food (my country‚Äôs diet tends to be very carb-heavy). I usually have two cups of coffee daily, with sugar intake increasing significantly over the past 10 months. I don‚Äôt eat much oily food.
* Sleep: irregular, late nights (going on for about 2 years)
* Mental health: struggling with anxiety, negativity & stress (for +2 years)

**Blood work:**  
All results normal (CBC, KFT, Lipid Profile, HbA1C, Thyroid Profile, BSF), except for a minor increase in bilirubin (both direct and indirect) in LFT.

**Blood Pressure readings:**

* Not a large sample yet, but typically around 138‚Äì140/88‚Äì90 mmHg (in the morning after waking up, before food)
* One random spike to 148/98 mmHg (was really anxious at that time)

**Doctor‚Äôs prescription:**

* BP medicine (to be taken daily for a few weeks)
* Multivitamins + B12 tablets
* Lifestyle and diet modifications

**My questions:**

1. Is it normal to be started on BP medication this early, or should I try lifestyle changes first?
2. Should I be worried about long-term heart/kidney damage at this stage?
3. How long are patients usually kept on BP meds if they are young and otherwise healthy?
4. Can this be managed with sleep, diet, and exercise instead of long-term medication?

""Come on, you promised you'd sit with me while Tae finished our project,"" Ozias whined as he tried to drag me to the computer lab.

""I know, but Evander just asked me if I could meet him in the library really quickly,"" I said, trying not to laugh at the pout on Ozias' face. ""I'll only be a minute.""

""Oh, please, Evander is going to keep you the whole time,"" Ozias sulked.

""I won't let him,"" I replied, but he wasn't convinced.

""What if I just go with you?"" he suggested, shrugging his shoulders.

""That would leave Tae all alone, and you know I hate that,"" I said.

""You only hate it because he hacks into your socials every time you give us more attention than him,"" Ozias teased.

""Yeah, and last time, he posted a ton of embarrassing pictures of me,"" I replied with a laugh. ""The double chins... I was so hideous.""

Ozias laughed as he reached up to cup the side of my face, brushing his thumb across my chin. My laughter died down as he stared at me. Electricity was crackling between us, and I held my breath, unsure of what to do. I don't want to pull away, but I'm also a little bit scared.

""Double chins... Hideous,"" Ozias scoffed softly. ""Would it make you feel better to know that I jerked off to those pictures?""

My face flamed as embarrassment coiled in my belly.

""W-what?"" I stuttered.

Ozias, as usual, wasn't phased in the slightest.

""It was real, it was raw, it was unfiltered you,"" he replied. ""And nothing gets me going more than you, Sweets. At any angle.""

He's joking, right? He has to be. We've been friends our whole lives pretty much. Ever since the first day of fourth grade.

Ozias had stood up for me when some boys were pushing me around on the playground. I had been at school for a few days and couldn't seem to make any friends. We moved in the middle of the school year and everyone pretty much had their friend groups already. I never seemed to fit in.

That day was the first day anyone was nice to me. Ozias and his friends had been on an extended weekend vacation, so it was the first day I had met any of them. Even as kids, they were all very protective of me. That day, Ozias had threatened the boys who were pushing me, and then took me inside to meet his friends.

The six of us have been practically inseparable ever since.

That being said, this charming attitude that Ozias has isn't new. Ever since we were old enough to know what se.x is, he's made comments similar to this. However, this is the boldest thing he's ever said to me.

I blame the fact that they were all raised in a motorcycle club. The Inferno's Demon Riders MC. The demons are great, don't get me wrong. I've spent so much time in the clubhouse that it's like a second home to me. I know that they party and party hard. I also know that they make sure I don't see everything that happens there either.

""Did I break you?"" Ozais teased me when I just stood there with my mouth open like a mor.on.

""Break her? That's my job, isn't it?""

I groaned at the sound of that voice. I didn't even get the chance to turn around, or plan an escape before Chayton slung his long arm around my shoulders. Ozias smiled at our friend before they fist bumped.

""You'd never break Bly and you know it,"" Ozais told him, shooting me a wink.

""You have no idea how much I want to,"" Chayton muttered.

I looked up at him with a frown. Chayton is just a big bully. He's rude, but he has a big heart under it all. He's just a big ol' sassy pants. But he's so dang tall and buff, you'd never guess he was kind. You just have to dig for it.

""Anyway,"" Chayton continued without looking at me. ""What are you guys doing?""

""Well, Peaches here thinks she's going to meet Evander all alone in the library,"" Ozias told him. ""I told her that I should come with.""

""Oh, definitely,"" Chayton said, spinning us around in the direction of the library. ""Let's all go have a little bit of fun.""

Ozias was on my other side within seconds. He was so close that his fingers brushed against my hand. I looked at him and he winked at me. My face flushed with heat and I quickly looked away.

""So,"" Ozias said. ""Want to come to the clubhouse-""

\~ Present, age 25 \~

Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

My alarm clock going off pulled me from my dream. Or my memory, I should say. I groaned as I reached out to slap it, making it stop. I rolled over in my bed and stared at the ceiling, thinking about that dream.

It's been years since I've even seen them. Almost ten whole years. Why do I keep dreaming about them?

Probably because my time with those five were the only times in my life that I was happy, that I felt safe.

Still, I wish it would stop. I hate having to be reminded of everything I lost every time I try to sleep. The good memories hurt just as much as the bad ones now. Although I would rather dream about them then-

I shook my head, clearing the thoughts from my mind.

I'm not going down that road first thing in the morning. Or ever, if I can help it.

Slowly, I dragged myself out of bed and headed for the bathroom. My apartment is tiny, but it's just me. Well, me and Butter, my black cat that I saved about a year ago. Found him outside the diner I work at, licking a stick of butter that didn't quite make it into the dumpster. Hence, the name Butter. He was wounded, scared, and only a kitten when I found him. We've been together ever since, and he is my dearest and only friend.

I talk to the girls at the diner, and we're friendly, except Abby, but... After everything I went through with my first set of friends, and everything after... I can't bring myself to trust anyone. Understandably so, but it's lonely.

Lonely or not, at least I'm free now.

I sighed as I looked at myself in the mirror. I look like I barely slept. I was crying in my sleep again, so my eyes are a bit puffy. I can't believe I was crying over a stupid memory like that.

I guess it wasn't that stupid. Not for the 13-year-old Blythe. The one that thought those five hung the stars in the sky.

That day was the day that we all found out Ozias was moving. The party he was trying to invite me to at the clubhouse was his family's going-away party. Ozias didn't even know himself until that night.

Honestly, Ozias is the only one of them that I don't actually harbor any hard feelings for. Other than his lack of communication when he moved, he never did anything to me. Ozias never bullied me, he was never mean to me, and he always knew how to make me smile.

I wonder if the reason he never wrote me a letter, or texted, or even added me on any of my socials was because of the others. Or maybe he just outgrew me and forgot about me. I don't blame him. We were kids and he didn't know. Or maybe he did know and just didn't care.

Ozias' family was deep in the MC. His father was part of the club and owned a gym in town. The whole reason they moved was because The Inferno's Demon Riders opened a new chapter. It was right in the heart of whatever state was the biggest MMA scene. Ozias' dad jumped at the opportunity.

I remember how the six of us spent that party. We were all sad, devastated really. We tucked ourselves in Kylian's room for the entire night. We reminisced. We promised to never lose contact. We cried and laughed and...

And it all turned out to be a lie anyway. It doesn't matter anymore. We were just kids, and I was stupid for thinking that we would remain the way we were forever.

My mom picked me up from the clubhouse the next day. It was something she had been doing for the last few years. I never questioned it because I was just happy that she would let me stay the night.

After she announced her engagement though, I realized that I had been overlooking a lot. Like the small, lingering glances they made. The way that Tusk would always make sure he was near us in some way. The way that he would already be talking to my mom when I came down the hall. How comfortable she seemed to be there.

Tusk was a great guy. He was the club's enforcer, and he was always kind to me. That didn't change when he married my mom either. No, it was other people that changed. Like his son and his son's friends.

I thought that living with one of my best friends was going to be the coolest. It was anything but. My whole life changed after that. That's what happens when people around you start scheming.

I rolled my eyes at my reflection before jumping into the shower, the water as hot as it could go. I need to stop thinking about them. All of them. The MC, my mom, the guys. They're all in my past. I'm moving forward now. Moving past it all.

Past the MC. Past my fake friends. Past my delusional mother. Past my semen donor of a father. And most importantly...

Past my abusive husband and the scars he left me.



Blythe's P.O.V.

""Hey, you're here a bit early for your shift,"" Mary said as I walked around the counter to clock in.

""Jason asked me to before I left last night,"" I told her.

""But... you worked a double yesterday... and closed..."" Mary said, putting the pieces together.

And here it comes.

""Bly, you worked until past 1 in the morning, and you're back already?"" The way she said it was accusing, like I was the one that asked for this shift.

Great, so she knows that it took me forever to close last night because I had to do everything alone. Jason was supposed to help, but spent the whole night shooting the [sh.it](http://sh.it) with the cook who was also supposed to be helping. I'm not even sure how long they ended up staying. Of course, Mary knows all of this already.

""I was asked to come in early today. I said yes, Mary,"" I replied. ""It's no big deal.""

""No big deal?"" She asked incredulously. ""Bly, it's only seven in the morning right now. You have to close again tonight-""

""Mary, please,"" I cut her off as I turned to face her. ""I know you're worried, but I'm fine, okay? I got bills to pay. That's all.""

Which was a total lie. I need this job. Not because it pays well, or because the diner is just doing so well that I make incredible tips. Because those would both be lies. It's because Jason pays me under the table and doesn't ask questions. Plus, I need a job that I can make cash at every day.

Just in case I need to run again.

""You're going to burn out though, and then what?"" Mary muttered under her breath.

I let it go, mostly because we had tables to look after. I know that even if Mary knew that she'd be short-staffed today, she would have told me to stay home and sleep. I doubt that Mary could handle waiting tables, bussing tables, and taking food and drinks out all by herself though. It's hard enough with just the two of us.

Thankfully, the morning kept me busy enough that I remained wide awake. I was used to not sleeping much anyway. It also made time fly by and, before we knew it, we were in our less busy time of day. I was busy preparing silverware and marrying the ketchups when Mary stood next to me, leaning on the counter.

""I cannot believe that it's already almost eight o'clock,"" she said.

I whipped my head at the clock hanging on the way and then looked at Mary.

""You were out at four,"" I said, frowning. ""Where is Abby? She was supposed to take over for you.""

Mary shrugged as she started helping me.

""Guess she called in to say she was going to be late or something,"" she replied. ""Jason asked me to stay until she got here. He said he had to run to go get her because of car trouble.""

I rolled my eyes.

Right. Car trouble. Couldn't possibly have anything to do with the fact that she and Jason are fu.cking on the side. You see, Jason is actually a married man. Not happily, which is understandable because his wife is a mega-cu.nt, but still.

Jason's wife, Lora, will come in here at least once a week. She always has something rude to say, she degrades the place and all of us workers, and then she and Jason spend at least two hours fighting in his office. I try to stay out of it, but I often wonder why they're even together still.

Regardless of their reasons or anything else, Jason cheats a lot. Abby is not the only one, but she is the only one who works here. And not for lack of trying either. I guess Mary and I just have standards. All the kitchen cooks are men, and I guess Jason doesn't swing that way.

However, this means that Abby gets everything she wants and Mary and I have to suffer for it. We're already short-staffed because Jason keeps scaring off the waitresses. Apparently, Mary and I were just built to handle a lot. Still, I have no idea how the man hasn't been sued for se.xual harassment.

If only I wasn't so afraid to be found.

""Do you think that Abby's boyfriend knows that she screws her boss?"" Mary asked me, genuinely curious.

I snorted.

I love Mary. If I were a more trusting person, I think we could be really good friends. She's funny and bubbly and tends to be a lot of fun when we work together. She's tried to get me to hang out several times, but...

I just can't.

""I didn't know Abby had a boyfriend,"" I replied. ""I thought she had multiple, and they all knew about each other.""

Mary let out a burst of laughter. Luckily, we only had one customer at the moment, who happened to be Silent Jay. He's an elderly, grumpy man who glares at us while he takes two hours to drink his cup of coffee and eats his dinner, and then he leaves. And with barely a tip, I might add.

""Gosh, you're too much,"" Mary teased me, gently pushing my arm as she snorted.

I only smiled and kept doing my job. I'm glad I made Mary laugh, but I was actually being serious. I've seen a few different guys come in and claim to be her boyfriend. Maybe because I work more shifts with Abby than Mary does.

""Anyway, her boyfriend that I know about is a guy from the motorcycle gang in the next town over,"" Mary continued.

I froze.

There's a motorcycle club near here? I've never seen any club members around before. Though, I just work and go to the grocery store, so maybe I just never saw them?

The fact that I'm so close to some random MC scares me a little. Just a little though. Despite how shi.tty my supposed friends ended up being, the club was always a safe place for me. Until it wasn't, but that was my sh.itty friends and my even shi.ttier stepsister, Everly.

I never blamed the club though. The older guys were like father figures to me. After Tusk became my stepdad, they were like uncles. They were never mean or rude to me and always treated me like family.

That was probably just because of my mom though. Nobody actually wanted me around. I figured that out the hard way.

Anyway, being close to an MC shouldn't be a big deal. They obviously never come in here, and why would they? As long as they aren't affiliated with The Inferno's Demon Riders, then all should be fine. Even if they were, the only worry I'd really have is word getting back to my father and husband about my whereabouts.

Just like last time.

Whatever, I doubt that anyone would even recognize me. Right? I mean, I haven't seen the majority of them in nine years. The last time I was there, I only saw Evander. That was still eight years ago.

""The guy came in here the other night, and he was fine as sin girl,"" Mary continued.

I tried to keep up with all her gushing about how such a hot guy could be with an STD-riddled ska.nk like Abby. It was difficult though. My mind kept wandering towards the past, reminding me of the good ol' days.

Or were they good?

I thought so at the time. Those memories used to be the safe place I'd escape to when things got bad at Silent Divine. Then I came to learn the truth though. The cold, hard, ugly truth.

None of them wanted me. Not my mom, not Kylian, not Tae, not Evander, definitely not Chayton. I wonder if Ozias ever even truly liked me.

The more I think about it, the more I wonder if they were all told to befriend me and be nice to me. At least at some point they were told that. Probably when my mom started seeing Tusk behind our backs. Tusk wouldn't want to upset his ol' lady.

Maybe I was always just a nuisance to everyone.

""I told you to stay away from me for a while.""

""God, you're always in the way, Shorty.""

""What are you doing here, Spark? We told you to stay out of the clubhouse.""

""Maybe you should take the hint, Dimples. No one wants you here.""

""Bly, are you listening to me?"" Mary asked, pulling me from my spiraling thoughts.

I blinked away the wetness filling my eyes and plastered a smile on my face.

""Sorry, zoned out a bit,"" I mumbled.

""Understandable,"" she replied. ""You're probably dog-tired.""

Of life, yes.

""Anyway, I was saying that we should go out tomorrow night after work,"" Mary said. ""We close together again. Let's go get a drink after.""

""I don't know, Mary,"" I mumbled.

""Oh, come on! Please?"" She asked, pouting at me. ""Just a couple of drinks?""

""I'll think about it,"" I replied.

Mary squealed like I had told her yes instead of maybe. Perhaps she took it as a yes, since I always say no, no matter what. I could probably go out for one night. I can handle that. Everything will be fine. No one knows me here.

What's the worst that could happen?



Blythe's P.O.V.

""It's Friday night, are they seriously going to stay locked in the office all night instead of helping?"" Mary asked angrily.

Steven, the only cook on for tonight, and I shared a look through the small widow we set food down to stay heated.

""You know he love gettin' his [di.ck](http://di.ck) wet, girl, let a playa play,"" he told Mary.

I shook my head at him because I knew what was coming next.

""Let a playa play?"" Mary asked in a cold tone with her eyes narrowed, plates stacked in her arms. ""That playa can play when his business isn't crumbling because he has no workers!""

With that, Mary stormed off, flipping her hair as she did so.

""Why'd you have to rile her up?"" I asked as I started grabbing plates for one of my tables. ""She's already angry as it is.""

Steven laughed.

""Come on, that girl is too fun to not rile up,"" he said before going back to fulfilling the orders.

Tonight is one of the busiest Fridays we've had in a while. The diner always gets busy in spurts. Busy enough to keep us employed and the place open, but tonight is different. The place is packed.

I wonder if there's some kind of event happening in town tonight that drew in a crowd, but I don't know what that could possibly be. I mean, this is Gering, Nebraska. Nothing ever happens here. That was why I settled in this place.

I spent the first two and a half years of my freedom bouncing around from town to town. I was too afraid to stay in one place for more than three months. The longer I did that though, the harder it got. Eventually, three months turned into four, then five, then six.

When I came across this little town, I found myself liking it more and more. So, I decided to stay. They'll never find me here. Besides, I'm ready to run at a moment's notice.

I have everything covered.

The night was passing by in a blur. The diner stayed packed the entire time. Abby was in and out of Jason's office. I'm starting to wonder if the man has a se.x addiction. It would explain a lot.

However, I'm growing more and more frustrated. I've had to stop Mary from interrupting them several times. If she does, she might get fired, and I don't know if this job is worth it without her. Still, it's getting old.

Does Jason not care about his business at least?

I was behind the counter wrapping up utensils and muttering under my breath about how much [bullsh.it](http://bullsh.it) this was. The diner had cleared out some, but not enough for us to have a break. It's well after 7 o'clock now too. The diner closes at 11 p.m. Only four more hours to go.

""Excuse me.""

I looked up at the polite, deep voice that was trying to get my connection. The first thing I noticed was his megawatt smile and then his bright blue eyes. The guy looked to be around my age and was leaning on the counter. His golden blonde hair was hanging down to his shoulders in a se.xy rugged kind of way. He was extremely attractive, and for a moment, I forgot how my mouth worked.

""Uh..."" I mumbled lamely.

The guy smirked at me.

""Sorry to bother you while you're so busy,"" he said politely. ""Came in here and sat in my girl's section, but I ain't seen her. She's here, right? I didn't get her schedule wrong? Her name is Abby.""

My eyebrows shot up at that.

No wonder why Mary was so shocked. Abby isn't an ugly girl by any means, but this man is a god. What the heck is he doing with someone like Abby?

As if my brain was working in slow motion, another thought dawned on me. Mary also said he was part of an MC. For the first time, I noticed the cut he was wearing. The Devils MC with their logo on it. Right next to that is a patch that says: Treasurer.

""I'm not here to cause trouble,"" he said quickly, noticing me staring at his cut.

I shrugged and looked back down at what I was doing.

""Didn't think you were,"" I replied.

""Hmm,"" he hummed thoughtfully.

I was too afraid to look at his face in fear that he might see something in me. Like that, I was familiar with his world. I don't remember anyone ever saying anything about The Devils, but I don't want to get involved with bikers. Or anyone for that matter.

""So... my girl?"" he asked after a silent moment.

Before I could reply, Mary came stomping up next to me.

""Are you trying to pay? Most customers let us do the walking,"" she joked.

""Ah, no, haven't ordered yet actually,"" he replied.

""Right, because you're sitting in Abby's section,"" she grumbled under her breath, but it was apparently loud enough for him to hear.

""So she is here!"" he exclaimed, throwing his hands out before resting them on the counter. ""Where is she? She on break or something?""

Mary stared at him like he was some kind of puzzle she was trying to solve. I know that she recognizes him as Abby's boyfriend. I tried to mind my own business, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't love what was happening. Mary is about to blow a gasket, and as much as I hate to see her so worked up, I love it at the same time.

""Oh, you want me to take you to her?"" Mary asked sweetly.

Wait, what?

""Mary,"" I scolded her quietly.

Mary met my eyes, but hers were full of defiance. She wasn't going to listen to me. Bad idea or not, when Mary was fed up with something, she was fed up. And tonight, I kind of agreed with her.

""He deserves to know anyway,"" she whispered to me.

I looked back at the guy who was still watching us. He clearly heard everything, but that smile was still on his face. He seems so upbeat and... nice.

""Why are you even with her?"" I blurted before I could stop myself.

His eyebrows shot up to his hairline and his eyes hardened.

""What's that supposed to mean? 'Cause she's a waitress, and I'm a biker? You think she works too hard for me, or that I'll bring her down or something?"" he spat. ""Don't be jealous, sweetheart. It's not a good look.""

Now it was my turn to be surprised.

""Jealous!?"" Mary practically screamed, more offended than I was.

Before he could reply, I busted out in laughter. It started as a sputtering of noises until I was bent over holding my belly. I couldn't help it, and it had been so long since I laughed like that.

""It wasn't that funny,"" the guy muttered.

""Actually, it was,"" Mary replied. ""Because jealous is the last thing we are of Abby.""

Just then, the door to Jason's office opened. We heard Abby giggling, followed by hushed tones. Speak of the devil and she shall appear.

From this spot, the biker guy has a clear view of whatever is happening. My back is to them, but based off of past experiences, they're probably all over each other still. The way the biker just tensed tells me that's most likely what's happening. His jaw is ticking, and he looks moments away from storming back there.

""I can give you his home address if you want,"" Mary said excitedly. ""He has a wife.""

""Nah, screw that sh.it. That bimbo ain't worth it,"" he grumbled.

""Okay, but can you make a scene or something?"" Mary whined. ""This is the highlight of our night.""

The guy looked at Mary like she was insane as she gave him her best puppy-dog-eyes. He looked between the two of us like we were crazy, but didn't comment if that's what he thought.

""Sorry that I made assumptions,"" he said. ""Shouldn't have done that.""

""It's fine, I get it,"" I replied, waving him off.

""So, anyway,"" Mary said, drawing the attention back to herself. ""For starters, I feel obligated to let you know that you are one fine specimen of a man, and you can do way better than a ska.nk like Abby.""

The biker ran his hand threw his hair, looking past us.

""I liked that she was going to school and working her [a.ss](http://a.ss) off,"" he mumbled. ""Thought she was real, ya know? I mean, how many chicks do you know that are fun to be around and smart? She's going to school to be a children's therapist. She takes care of her grandmother, who raised her. I thought she was sweet and kind.""

Mary and I blinked at him. He furrowed his brow, clearly confused by our reaction, or lack there of. Well, it was lacking until Mary spun around with more fury in her eyes than I'd ever seen before.

""You psychotic bit.ch!"" Mary screamed, causing the entire place to go silent.

I tried my best not to laugh as I watched Mary storm up to Abby, who finally noticed that her se.xy biker boyfriend was watching.

""You're going around pretending to be to snatch up hot biker guys!"" Mary continued to scream. ""You've crossed the line! I don't care what lies you make up to your freaking harem of men, but leave me out of it! And how is that even fair!? You literally stole my life and landed the hottest guy I have ever seen, and I can't even get a text back! I can't take it anymore!""

""Her life?"" The biker asked me, leaning on the counter as his eyes roamed over Mary.

I smiled because I knew what that look meant.

""Yeah,"" I replied. ""Mary is the one going to school and working and taking care of her grandmother. I don't know Abby's situation, but I can tell you that she doesn't work very hard or very often.""

""But Mary...?"" He asked, quirking an eyebrow.

""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""Why don't you ask her yourself?""

""You think she really thinks I'm the hottest guy she's ever seen?"" he asked.

I busted out a laugh.

""Better schedule that STD screening,"" I told him.

""I'll get one tomorrow.""

I‚Äôm a 24 M, height 5'10"", weight 81 kg (gained \~4 kg in the last 6 months; I would describe myself as skinny fat, with more fat around the abdomen and sides).  
Only major medical history is TB (lungs) about 5 years ago.  
I don‚Äôt drink (only 3 times in my life) or smoke (never).

**Lifestyle details:**

* Sedentary/low activity (stopped going to the gym about a year ago), often lethargic
* **Diet:** Mostly regular home food (my country‚Äôs diet tends to be very carb-heavy). I usually have two cups of coffee daily, with sugar intake increasing significantly over the past 10 months. I don‚Äôt eat much oily food.
* Sleep: irregular, late nights (going on for about 2 years)
* Mental health: struggling with anxiety, negativity & stress (for +2 years)

**Blood work:**  
All results normal (CBC, KFT, Lipid Profile, HbA1C, Thyroid Profile, BSF), except for a minor increase in bilirubin (both direct and indirect) in LFT.

**Blood Pressure readings:**

* Not a large sample yet, but typically around 138‚Äì140/88‚Äì90 mmHg (in the morning after waking up, before food)
* One random spike to 148/98 mmHg (was really anxious at that time)

**Doctor‚Äôs prescription:**

* BP medicine (to be taken daily for a few weeks)
* Multivitamins + B12 tablets
* Lifestyle and diet modifications

**My questions:**

1. Is it normal to be started on BP medication this early, or should I try lifestyle changes first?
2. Should I be worried about long-term heart/kidney damage at this stage?
3. How long are patients usually kept on BP meds if they are young and otherwise healthy?
4. Can this be managed with sleep, diet, and exercise instead of long-term medication?

Everybody around me is freaking out, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm stressing my family more than needed.

**I**

Baudelaire envisaged readers to whom the reading of lyric poetry would present difficulties. The introductory poem of the *Fleurs du mal* is addressed to these readers. Will power and the ability to concentrate are not their strong points; what they prefer is sensual pleasures; they are familiar with the ‚Äòspleen‚Äô which kills interest and receptiveness. It is strange to come across a lyric poet who addresses himself to this, the least rewarding type of audience. There is of course a ready explanation for it. Baudelaire was anxious to be understood; he dedicates his book to kindred spirits. The poem addressed to the reader ends with the salutation: *‚ÄòHypocrite lecteur, ‚Äì mon semblable, ‚Äì mon fr√®re!‚Äô* It might be more fruitful to put it another way and say: Baudelaire wrote a book which from the very beginning had little prospect of becoming an immediate popular success. The kind of reader he envisaged is described in the introductory poem, and this turned out to have been a far-sighted judgment. He was eventually to find the reader at whom his work was aimed. This situation, the fact, in other words, that the climate for lyric poetry has become increasingly inhospitable, is attested to, among other things, by three factors. In the first place, the lyric poet has ceased to represent the poet *per se.* He no longer is a ‚Äòminstrel,‚Äô as Lamartine still was; he has become a representative of a genre. (Verlaine is a concrete example of this specialization; Rimbaud must already be regarded as an esoteric figure, a poet who maintained an *ex officio* distance between his public and his work.) Secondly, there has been no success on a mass scale in lyric poetry since Baudelaire. (The lyric poetry of Victor Hugo was still able to set off powerful reverberations when it first appeared. In Germany, Heine‚Äôs *Buch der Lieder* marks a watershed.) As a result, a third factor was the greater coolness of the public even toward the lyric poetry that had been handed down as part of its own cultural heritage. The period in question dates back roughly to the middle of the last century. Throughout it the fame of the *Fleurs du mal* has constantly spread. This book, which was expected to be read by the least indulgent of readers and which was at first read by few indulgent ones, has, over the decades, acquired the stature of a classic and become one of the most widely printed ones as well.

If conditions for a positive reception of lyric poetry have become less favourable, it is reasonable to assume that only in rare instances is lyric poetry in rapport with the experience of its readers. This may be due to a change in the structure of their experience. Even though one may approve of this development, one may be all the more hard put to it to say precisely in what respect there may have been a change. Thus one turns to philosophy for an answer, which brings one up against a strange situation. Since the end of the last century, philosophy has made a series of attempts to lay hold of the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô experience as opposed to the kind that manifests itself in the standardized, denatured life of the civilized masses. It is customary to classify these efforts under the heading of a philosophy of life. Their point of departure, understandably enough, was not man‚Äôs life in society. What they invoked was poetry, preferably nature, and, most recently, the age of myths. Dilthey‚Äôs book *Das Erlebnis und die Dichtung* represents one of the earliest of these efforts which end with Klages and Jung; both made common cause with Fascism. Towering above this literature is Bergson‚Äôs early monumental work, *Mati√®re et m√©moire.* More than the others, it preserves links with empirical research. It is oriented toward biology. The title suggests that it regards the structure of memory as decisive for the philosophical pattern of experience. Experience is indeed a matter of tradition, in collective existence as well as private life. It is less the product of facts firmly anchored in memory than of a convergence in memory of accumulated and frequently unconscious data. It is, however, not at all Bergson‚Äôs intention to attach any specific historical label to memory. He thus manages above all to stay clear of that experience from which his own philosophy evolved or, rather, in reaction to which it arose. It was the inhospitable, blinding age of big-scale industrialism. In shutting out this experience the eye perceives an experience of a complementary nature in the form of its spontaneous afterimage, as it were. Bergson‚Äôs philosophy represents an attempt to give the details of this afterimage and to fix it as a permanent record. His philosophy thus indirectly furnishes a clue to the experience which presented itself to Baudelaire‚Äôs eyes in its undistorted version in the figure of his reader.

**II**

*Mati√®re et m√©moire* defines the nature of experience in the *dur√©e* in such a way that the reader is bound to conclude that only a poet can be the adequate subject of such an experience. And it was indeed a poet who put Bergson‚Äôs theory of experience to the test. Proust‚Äôs work *√Ä la Recherche du temps perdu* may be regarded as an attempt to produce experience synthetically, as Bergson imagines it, under today‚Äôs conditions, for there is less and less hope that it will come into being naturally. Proust, incidentally, does not evade the question in his work. He even introduces a new factor, one that involves an immanent critique of Bergson. Bergson emphasized the antagonism between the *vita activa* and the specific *vita contemplativa* which arises from memory. But he leads us to believe that turning to the contemplative actualization of the stream of life is a matter of free choice. From the start Proust indicates his divergent view terminologically. To him, the *m√©moire pure* of Bergson‚Äôs theory becomes a *m√©moire involontaire.* Proust immediately confronts this involuntary memory with a voluntary memory, one that is in the service of the intellect. The first pages of his great work are charged with making this relationship clear. In the reflection which introduces the term Proust tells us how poorly, for many years, he remembered the town of Combray in which, after all, he spent part of his childhood. One afternoon the taste of a kind of pastry called *madeleine* (which he later mentions often) transported him back to the past, whereas before then he had been limited to the promptings of a memory which obeyed the call of attentiveness. This he calls the *m√©moire volontaire*, and it is its characteristic that the information which it gives about the past retains no trace of it. ‚ÄòIt is the same with our own past. In vain we try to conjure it up again; the efforts of our intellect are futile.‚Äô Therefore Proust, summing up, says that the past is ‚Äòsomewhere beyond the reach of the intellect, and unmistakably present in some material object (or in the sensation which such an object arouses in us), though we have no idea which one it is. As for that object, it depends entirely on chance whether we come upon it before we die or whether we never encounter it.‚Äô

**According to Proust, it is a matter of chance whether an individual forms an image of himself, whether he can take hold of his experience. It is by no means inevitable to be dependent on chance in this matter. Man‚Äôs inner concerns do not have their issueless private character by nature. They do so only when he is increasingly unable to assimilate the data of the world around him by way of experience. Newspapers constitute one of many evidences of such an inability.** If it were the intention of the press to have the reader assimilate the information it supplies as part of his own experience, it would not achieve its purpose. But its intention is just the opposite, and it is achieved: to isolate what happens from the realm in which it could affect the experience of the reader. **The principles of journalistic information (freshness of the news, brevity, comprehensibility, and, above all, lack of connection between the individual news items) contribute as much to this as does the make-up of the pages and the paper‚Äôs style. (Karl Kraus never tired of demonstrating the great extent to which the linguistic usage of newspapers paralyzed the imagination of their readers.) Another reason for the isolation of information from experience is that the former does not enter ‚Äòtradition.‚Äô** Newspapers appear in large editions. Few readers can boast of any information which another reader may require of him.

**Historically, the various modes of communication have competed with one another. The replacement of the older narration by information, of information by sensation, reflects the increasing atrophy of experience. In turn, there is a contrast between all these forms and the story, which is one of the oldest forms of communication. It is not the object of the story to convey a happening** *per se*, **which is the purpose of information; rather, it embeds it in the life of the storyteller in order to pass it on as experience to those listening. It thus bears the marks of the storyteller much as the earthen vessel bears the marks of the potter‚Äôs hand.**

Proust‚Äôs eight-volume work conveys an idea of the efforts it took to restore the figure of the storyteller to the present generation. Proust undertook this assignment with magnificent consistency. From the outset this involved him in the primary task of resurrecting his own childhood. In saying that it was a matter of chance whether the problem could be solved at all, he gave the full measure of its difficulty. In connection with these reflections he coined the phrase *m√©moire involontaire.* This concept bears the marks of the situation which gave rise to it; it is part of the inventory of the individual who is isolated in many ways. Where there is experience in the strict sense of the word, certain contents of the individual past combine with material of the collective past. The rituals with their ceremonies, their festivals (quite probably nowhere recalled in Proust‚Äôs work) kept producing the amalgamation of these two elements of memory over and over again. They triggered recollection at certain times and remained handles of memory for a lifetime. In this way, voluntary and involuntary recollection lose their mutual exclusiveness.

**III**

In seeking a more substantial definition of what appears in Proust‚Äôs *m√©moire de l‚Äôintelligence* as a by-product of Bergson‚Äôs theory, it is well to go back to Freud. In 1921 Freud published his essay *Beyond the Pleasure Principle*, which presents a correlation between memory (in the sense of the *m√©moire involontaire*) and consciousness in the form of a hypothesis. The following remarks based on it are not intended to confirm it; we shall have to content ourselves with investigating the fruitfulness of this hypothesis in situations far removed from those which Freud had in mind when he wrote. Freud‚Äôs pupils are more likely to have encountered such situations. Some of Reik‚Äôs writings on his own theory of memory are in line with Proust‚Äôs distinction between involuntary and voluntary recollection. ‚ÄòThe function of remembrance \[*Ged√§chtnis*\],‚Äô Reik writes, ‚Äòis the protection of impressions; memory \[*Erinnerung*\] aims at their disintegration. Remembrance is essentially conservative, memory is destructive.‚Äô Freud‚Äôs fundamental thought, on which these remarks are based, is formulated by the assumption that ‚Äòconsciousness comes into being at the site of a memory trace.‚Äô (For our purposes, there is no substantial difference between the concepts *Erinnerung* and *Gedachtnis*, as used in Freud‚Äôs essay.) **Therefore, ‚Äòit would be the special characteristic of consciousness that, unlike what happens in all other psychical systems, the excitatory process does not leave behind a permanent change in its elements, but expires, as it were, in the phenomenon of becoming conscious.‚Äô The basic formula of this hypothesis is that ‚Äòbecoming conscious and leaving behind a memory trace are processes incompatible with each other within one and the same system.‚Äô Rather, memory fragments are ‚Äòoften most powerful and most enduring when the incident which left them behind was one that never entered consciousness.‚Äô Put in Proustian terms, this means that only what has not been experienced explicitly and consciously, what has not happened to the subject as an experience, can become a component of the** *m√©moire involontaire.* **According to Freud, the attribution of ‚Äòpermanent traces as the basis of memory‚Äô to processes of stimulation is reserved for ‚Äòother systems,‚Äô which must be thought of as different from consciousness. In Freud‚Äôs view, consciousness as such receives no memory traces whatever, but has another important function: protection against stimuli.** ‚ÄòFor a living organism, protection against stimuli is an almost more important function than the reception of stimuli; the protective shield is equipped with its own store of energy and must above all strive to preserve the special forms of conversion of energy operating in it against the effects of the excessive energies at work in the external world, effects which tend toward an equalization of potential and hence toward destruction.‚Äô **The threat from these energies is one of shocks. The more readily consciousness registers these shocks, the less likely are they to have a traumatic effect. Psychoanalytic theory strives to understand the nature of these traumatic shocks ‚Äòon the basis of their breaking through the protective shield against stimuli.‚Äô According to this theory, fright has ‚Äòsignificance‚Äô in the ‚Äòabsence of any preparedness for anxiety.‚Äô**

**Freud‚Äôs investigation was occasioned by a dream characteristic of accident neuroses which reproduce the catastrophe in which the patient was involved. Dreams of this kind, according to Freud, ‚Äòendeavour to master the stimulus retroactively, by developing the anxiety whose omission was the cause of the traumatic neurosis.‚Äô** Val√©ry seems to have had something similar in mind. The coincidence is worth noting, for Val√©ry was among those interested in the special functioning of psychic mechanisms under present-day conditions. (Moreover, Val√©ry was able to reconcile this interest with his poetic production, which remained exclusively lyric. He thus emerges as the only author who goes back directly to Baudelaire.) ‚ÄòThe impressions and sense perceptions of man,‚Äô Val√©ry writes, ‚Äòactually belong in the category of surprises; they are evidence of an insufficiency in man‚Ä¶. Recollection is ‚Ä¶ an elemental phenomenon which aims at giving us the time for organizing the reception of stimuli which we initially lacked.‚Äô The acceptance of shocks is facilitated by training in coping with stimuli, and, if need be, dreams as well as recollection may be enlisted. As a rule, however ‚Äì so Freud assumes ‚Äì this training devolves upon the wakeful consciousness, located in a part of the cortex which is ‚Äòso blown out by the effect of the stimulus‚Äô that it offers the most favourable situation for the reception of stimuli. That the shock is thus cushioned, parried by consciousness, would lend the incident that occasions it the character of having been lived in the strict sense. If it were incorporated directly in the registry of conscious memory, it would sterilize this incident for poetic experience.

The question suggests itself how lyric poetry can have as its basis an experience for which the shock experience has become the norm. One would expect such poetry to have a large measure of consciousness; it would suggest that a plan was at work in its composition. This is indeed true of Baudelaire‚Äôs poetry; it establishes a connection between him and Poe, among his predecessors, and with Val√©ry, among his successors. Proust‚Äôs and Val√©ry‚Äôs reflections concerning Baudelaire complement each other providentially. Proust wrote an essay about Baudelaire the significance of which is even exceeded by certain reflections in his novels. In his ‚ÄòSituation de Baudelaire‚Äô Val√©ry supplies the classical introduction to the *Fleurs du mal*. There he says: ‚ÄòThe problem for Baudelaire was bound to be this: to become a great poet, yet neither Lamartine nor Hugo nor Musset. I do not claim that this ambition was a conscious one in Baudelaire; but it was bound to be present in him, it was his reason of state.‚Äô There is something odd about speaking of a reason of state in the case of a poet; there is something remarkable about it: the emancipation from experiences. Baudelaire‚Äôs poetic output is assigned a mission. He envisioned blank spaces which he filled in with his poems. His work cannot merely be categorized as historical, like anyone else‚Äôs, but it intended to be so and understood itself as such.

**IV**

The greater the share of the shock factor in particular impressions, the more constantly consciousness has to be alert as a screen against stimuli; the more efficiently it does so, the less do these impressions enter experience (*Erfahrung*), tending to remain in the sphere of a certain hour in one‚Äôs life (*Erlebnis*). **Perhaps the special achievement of shock defence may be seen in its function of assigning to an incident a precise point in time in consciousness at the cost of the integrity of its contents. This would be a peak achievement of the intellect; it would turn the incident into a moment that has been lived** (*Erlebnis*). **Without reflection there would be nothing but the sudden start, usually the sensation of fright which, according to Freud, confirms the failure of the shock defence. Baudelaire has portrayed this condition in a harsh image. He speaks of a duel in which the artist, just before being beaten, screams in fright. This duel is the creative process itself. Thus Baudelaire placed the shock experience at the very centre of his artistic work. This self-portrait, which is corroborated by evidence from several contemporaries, is of great significance. Since he is himself exposed to fright, it is not unusual for Baudelaire to occasion fright.** Vall√®s tells us about his eccentric grimaces; on the basis of a portrait by Nargeot, Pontmartin establishes Baudelaire‚Äôs alarming appearance; Claudel stresses the cutting quality he could give to his speech; Gautier speaks of the italicizing Baudelaire indulged in when reciting poetry; Nadar describes his jerky gait.

Psychiatry knows traumatophile types. Baudelaire made it his business to parry the shocks, no matter where they might come from, with his spiritual and his physical self. This shock defence is depicted graphically in an attitude of combat. Baudelaire describes his friend Constantin Guys, whom he visits when Paris is asleep: ‚Äò‚Ä¶ how he stands there, bent over his table, scrutinizing the sheet of paper just as intently as he does the objects around him by day; how he *stabs away* with his pencil, his pen, his brush; how he spurts water from his glass to the ceiling and tries his pen on his shirt; how he pursues his work swiftly and intensely, as though he were afraid that his images might escape him; thus he is combative, even when alone, and parries his own blows.‚Äô In the opening stanza of his poem ‚ÄòLe Soleil‚Äô Baudelaire has pictured himself engaged in such a fantastic combat; this is probably the only place in *Les Fleurs du mal* that shows the poet at work.

Le long du vieux faubourg, o√π pendent aux masures

Les persiennes, abri des secr√®tes luxures,

Quand le soleil cruel frappe √† traits redoubl√©s

Sur la ville et les champs, sure les toits et les bl√©s,

Je vais m‚Äôexercer seul √† ma fantasque escrime,

Flairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime,

Tr√©buchant sur les mots comme sur les pav√©s,

Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps r√™v√©s.

Shock is among those experiences that have assumed decisive importance for Baudelaire‚Äôs personality. Gide has dealt with the interstices between image and idea, word and thing, which are the real site of Baudelaire‚Äôs poetic excitation. Rivi√®re has pointed to the subterranean shocks by which Baudelaire‚Äôs poetry is shaken; it is as though they caused words to collapse. Rivi√®re has indicated such collapsing words.

Et qui sait si les fleurs nouvelles que je r√™ve

Trouveront dans ce sol lav√© comme une gr√®ve

Le mystique aliment qui *ferait* leur vigueur.

Or:

Cyb√®le, qui les aime, *augmente ses verdures.*

Another example is this famous first line:

La servante au grand coeur dont vous √©tiez *jalouse.*

To give these covert laws their due outside his verses as well was Baudelaire‚Äôs intention in his *Spleen de Paris*, his prose poems. In the dedication of his collection to the editor-in-chief of *La Presse*, Ars√®ne Houssaye, Baudelaire wrote: ‚ÄòWho among us has not dreamt, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose? It would have to be musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and resistant enough to adapt itself to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the wave motions of dreaming, the shocks of consciousness. This ideal, which can turn into an *id√©e fixe*, will grip especially those who are at home in the giant cities and the web of their numberless interconnecting relationships.‚Äô

This passage suggests two insights. For one thing, it tells us about the close connection in Baudelaire between the figure of shock and contact with the metropolitan masses. For another, it tells us what is really meant by these masses. They do not stand for classes or any sort of collective; rather, they are nothing but the amorphous crowd of passers-by, the people in the street. This crowd, of whose existence Baudelaire is always aware, has not served as the model for any of his works, but it is imprinted on his creativity as a hidden figure, just as it constitutes the figure concealed in the fragment quoted before. We may discern the image of the fencer in it; the blows he deals are designed to open a path through the crowd for him. To be sure, the *faubourgs* through which the poet of ‚ÄòLe Soleil‚Äô makes his way are deserted. But the meaning of the hidden configuration (which reveals the beauty of that stanza to its very depth) probably is this: it is the phantom crowd of the words, the fragments, the beginnings of lines from which the poet, in the deserted streets, wrests the poetic booty.

**V**

**The crowd ‚Äì no subject was more entitled to the attention of nineteenth-century writers. It was getting ready to take shape as a public in broad strata who had acquired facility in reading. It became a customer; it wished to find itself portrayed in the contemporary novel, as the patrons did in the paintings of the Middle Ages. The most successful author of the century met this demand out of inner necessity. To him, crowd meant ‚Äì almost in the ancient sense ‚Äì the crowd of the clients, the public.** Victor Hugo was the first to address the crowd in his titles: *Les Mis√©rables, Les Travailleurs de la mer*. In France, Hugo was the only writer able to compete with the serial novel. As is generally known, Eug√®ne Sue was the master of this genre, which began to be the source of revelation for the man in the street. In 1850 an overwhelming majority elected him to Parliament as representative of the city of Paris. It is no accident that the young Marx chose Sue‚Äôs *Les Myst√®res de Paris* for an attack. He early recognized it as his task to forge the amorphous mass, which was then being wooed by an aesthetic socialism, into the iron of the proletariat. Engels‚Äô description of these masses in his early writings may be regarded as a prelude, however modest, to one of Marx‚Äôs themes. **In his book** *The Condition of the Working Class in England*, **Engels writes: ‚ÄòA city like London, where one can roam about for hours without reaching the beginning of an end, without seeing the slightest indication that open country is nearby, is really something very special. This colossal centralization, this agglomeration of three and a half million people on a single spot has multiplied the strength of these three and a half million inhabitants a hundredfold ‚Ä¶ But the price that has been paid is not discovered until later. Only when one has tramped the pavements of the main streets for a few days does one notice that these Londoners have had to sacrifice what is best in human nature in order to create all the wonders of civilization with which their city teems, that a hundred creative faculties that lay dormant in them remained inactive and were suppressed ‚Ä¶ There is something distasteful about the very bustle of the streets, something that is abhorrent to human nature itself. Hundreds of thousands of people of all classes and ranks of society jostle past one another; are they not all human beings with the same characteristics and potentialities, equally interested in the pursuit of happiness? ‚Ä¶ And yet they rush past one another as if they had nothing in common or were in no way associated with one another. Their only agreement is a tacit one: that everyone should keep to the right of the pavement, so as not to impede the stream of people moving in the opposite direction. No one even bothers to spare a glance for the others. The greater the number of people that are packed into a tiny space, the more repulsive and offensive becomes the brutal indifference, the unfeeling concentration of each person on his private affairs.‚Äô**

This description differs markedly from those to be found in minor French masters, such as Gozlan, Delvau, or Lurine. It lacks the skill and ease with which the *flaneur* moves among the crowd and which the journalist eagerly learns from him. **Engels is dismayed by the crowd; he responds with a moral reaction, and an aesthetic one as well; the speed with which people rush past one another unsettles him. The charm of his description lies in the intersecting of unshakeable critical integrity with an old-fashioned attitude.** The writer came from a Germany that was still provincial; he may never have faced the temptation to lose himself in a stream of people. **When Hegel went to Paris for the first time not long before his death, he wrote to his wife: ‚ÄòWhen I walk through the streets, people look just as they do in Berlin; they wear the same clothes and the faces are about the same ‚Äì the same aspect, but in a large crowd.‚Äô To move in this crowd was natural for a Parisian. No matter how great the distance which an individual cared to keep from it, he still was coloured by it and, unlike Engels, was not able to view it from without.** As regards Baudelaire, the masses were anything but external to him; indeed, it is easy to trace in his works his defensive reaction to their attraction and allure.

The masses had become so much a part of Baudelaire that it is rare to find a description of them in his works. His most important subjects are hardly ever encountered in descriptive form. As Dujardin so aptly put it, he was ‚Äòmore concerned with implanting the image in the memory than with adorning and elaborating it.‚Äô It is futile to search in *Les Fleurs du mal* or in *Spleen de Paris* for any counterpart to the portrayals of the city which Victor Hugo did with such mastery. Baudelaire describes neither the Parisians nor their city. Forgoing such descriptions enables him to invoke the ones in the form of the other. His crowd is always the crowd of a big city, his Paris is invariably overpopulated. It is this that makes him so superior to Barbier, whose descriptive method caused a rift between the masses and the city. In *Tableaux parisiens* the secret presence of a crowd is demonstrable almost everywhere. **When Baudelaire takes the dawn as his theme, the deserted streets emanate something of that ‚Äòsilence of a throng‚Äô which Hugo senses in nocturnal Paris. As Baudelaire looks at the plates in the anatomical works for sale on the dusty banks of the Seine, the mass of the departed takes the place of the singular skeletons on these pages.** In the figures of the *danse macabre*, he sees a compact mass on the move. **The heroism of the wizened old women whom the cycle ‚ÄòLes petites vieilles‚Äô follows on their rounds, consists in their standing apart from the crowd, unable to keep its pace, no longer participating with their thoughts in the present. The mass was the agitated veil; through it Baudelaire saw Paris.** The presence of the mass determines one of the most famous components of *Les Fleurs du mal.*

In the sonnet ‚Äò√Ä une passante‚Äô the crowd is nowhere named in either word or phrase. And yet the whole happening hinges on it, just as the progress of a sailboat depends on the wind.

La rue assourdissante autour de moi hurlait.

Longue, mince, en grand deuil, douleur majestueuse,

Une femme passa, d‚Äôune main fastueuse

Soulevant, balancant le feston et l‚Äôourlet;

Agile et noble, avec sa jambe de statue.

Moi, je buvais, crisp√© comme un extravagant,

Dans son oeil, ciel livide o√π germe l‚Äôoutragan,

La douceur qui fascine et le plaisir qui tue.

Un √©clair ‚Ä¶ puis la nuit! ‚Äì Fugitive beaut√©

Dont le regard m‚Äôa fait soudainement rena√Ætre,

Ne te verrai-je plus que dans l‚Äô√©ternit√©?

Ailleurs, bien loin d‚Äôici! Trop tard! *Jamais* peut-√™tre!

Car j‚Äôignore o√π tu fuis, tu ne sais o√π je vais,

O toi que j‚Äôeusse aim√©e, √¥ toi qui le savais!

In a widow‚Äôs veil, mysteriously and mutely borne along by the crowd, an unknown woman comes into the poet‚Äôs field of vision. What this sonnet communicates is simply this: **Far from experiencing the crowd as an opposed, antagonistic element, this very crowd brings to the city dweller the figure that fascinates. The delight of the urban poet is love ‚Äì not at first sight, but at last sight. It is a farewell forever which coincides in the poem with the moment of enchantment. Thus the sonnet supplies the figure of shock, indeed of catastrophe. But the nature of the poet‚Äôs emotions has been affected as well. What makes his body contract in a tremor** ‚Äì *crisp√© comme un extravagant*, **Baudelaire says ‚Äì is not the rapture of a man whose every fibre is suffused with** *eros*; **it is, rather, like the kind of sexual shock that can beset a lonely man.** The fact that ‚Äòthese verses could only have been written in a big city,‚Äô as Thibaudet put it, is not very meaningful. **They reveal the stigmata which life in a metropolis inflicts upon love. Proust read the sonnet in this light, and that is why he gave his later echo of the woman in mourning, which appeared to him one day in the form of Albertine, the evocative caption ‚ÄòLa Parisienne.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhen Albertine came into my room again, she wore a black satin dress. It made her pale, and she resembled the type of the fiery and yet pale Parisian woman, the woman who is not used to fresh air and has been affected by living among the masses and possibly in an atmosphere of vice, the kind that can be recognized by a certain glance which seems unsteady if there is no rouge on her cheeks.‚Äô This is the look ‚Äì even as late as Proust ‚Äì of the object of a love which only a city dweller experiences, which Baudelaire captured for poetry, and of which one might not infrequently say that it was spared, rather than denied, fulfilment.**

**VI**

A story by Poe which Baudelaire translated may be regarded as the classic example among the older versions of the motif of the crowd. It is marked by certain peculiarities which, upon closer inspection, reveal aspects of social forces of such power and hidden depth that we may count them among those which alone are capable of exerting both a subtle and a profound effect upon artistic production. The story is entitled ‚ÄòThe Man of the Crowd.‚Äô Set in London, its narrator is a man who, after a long illness, ventures out again for the first time into the hustle and bustle of the city. In the late afternoon hours of an autumn day he installs himself behind a window in a big London coffee-house. He looks over the other guests, pores over advertisements in the paper, but his main focus of interest is the throng of people surging past his window in the street. ‚ÄòThe latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without.‚Äô Important as it is, let us disregard the narrative to which this is the prelude and examine the setting.

The appearance of the London crowd as Poe describes it is as gloomy and fitful as the light of the gas lamps overhead. This applies not only to the riffraff that is ‚Äòbrought forth from its den‚Äô as night falls. The employees of higher rank, ‚Äòthe upper clerks of staunch firms,‚Äô Poe describes as follows: ‚ÄòThey had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern.‚Äô Even more striking is his description of the crowd‚Äôs movements. ‚ÄòBy far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business-like demeanour, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but redoubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.‚Äô One might think he was speaking of half-drunken wretches. Actually, they were ‚Äònoblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers.‚Äô

Poe‚Äôs manner of presentation cannot be called realism. It shows a purposely distorting imagination at work, one that removes the text far from what is commonly advocated as the model of social realism. Barbier, perhaps one of the best examples of this type of realism that come to mind, describes things in a less eccentric way. Moreover, he chose a more transparent subject: the oppressed masses. Poe is not concerned with these; he deals with ‚Äòpeople,‚Äô pure and simple. For him, as for Engels, there was something menacing in the spectacle they presented. It is precisely this image of big-city crowds that became decisive for Baudelaire. If he succumbed to the force by which he was drawn to them and, as a *flaneur*, was made one of them, he was nevertheless unable to rid himself of a sense of their essentially inhuman make-up. He becomes their accomplice even as he dissociates himself from them. He becomes deeply involved with them, only to relegate them to oblivion with a single glance of contempt. There is something compelling about this ambivalence where he cautiously admits to it. Perhaps the charm of his ‚ÄòCr√©puscule du soir,‚Äô so difficult to account for, is bound up with this.

Men‚Äôs underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch

Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too.

Emma Ockerman
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read


From Labubus **(1)** and men‚Äôs underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere.

Whether they‚Äôre accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter.

Here‚Äôs how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a ‚Äúsignificant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.‚Äù

That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year ‚Äî an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)**

Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the ‚ÄúSahm rule,‚Äù **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low.

Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating ‚Äî and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise ‚Äî here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch.

Cardboard boxes

Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here‚Äôs the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, **(8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down.


‚ÄúI love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,‚Äù Wooten said.

Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)**

‚ÄúThe cardboard box industry is incredibly large ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking close to $100 billion in revenue,‚Äù Wooten said. ‚ÄúWhat I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it‚Äôs four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don‚Äôt have that about the cardboard box industry. It‚Äôs so much more important.‚Äù

Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments.

Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession.

All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning.

‚ÄúThis is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,‚Äù Wooten said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.‚Äù


If looks could indicate

Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It‚Äôs been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men‚Äôs underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn.

It‚Äôs also been said, however, that many of those ‚Äúindicators‚Äù are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** ‚Äî midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst.


And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men‚Äôs underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy.

But is it?

‚ÄúI cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,‚Äù said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar.

‚ÄúGreenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?‚Äù Swartz added.

During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more ‚Äúchoiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt spend, it just means that they aren‚Äôt necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,‚Äù Swartz said.

The 'little treat' economy

A few months after the 9/11 attacks ‚Äî at which point the US was already in a recession ‚Äî Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Est√©e Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,‚Äù according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)**

""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,‚Äù Lauder said.

This sentiment started being referred to as the ‚ÄúLipstick Index,‚Äù and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle treat economy,‚Äù or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,‚Äù Swartz said. ‚ÄúMy opinion would be that when there‚Äôs a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.‚Äù

More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)**


‚ÄúYou can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,‚Äù Swartz said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We‚Äôve also seen weakness in the luxury space.‚Äù

Giant skeletons

Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead.

He has his own ‚ÄúSkelly‚Äù and noted that ‚Äúthere are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.‚Äù Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August‚Äôs decoration drop would generate a lot of interest.

‚ÄúThough I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,‚Äù he wrote. **(17)** ‚ÄúIn 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,‚Äù he added.

A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúshare any sales specifics around any products,‚Äù though ‚Äúwe continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.‚Äù

As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot‚Äôs Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations.

Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy.

‚ÄúIf people aren‚Äôt buying those ‚Äî and it‚Äôs been a hot-ticket item in past years ‚Äî then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,‚Äù Bagniewski said.

1. Sleep
Are you sleeping better and feeling a little more refreshed each morning?  Or are you falling asleep faster at night time? Focus on getting good sleep and setting yourself a sleep routine.  Sleep is critical for hormone balancing, fat burning, metabolism function, moods, energy, hunger regulation and blood circulation.  This should be your #1 priority.
I WONDER - WHAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF GOOD SLEEP FOR YOU?

2. Hydration
This is important - look at your skin. If it's looking better than it was, you're on the right track. Your hands, your face, your legs - these are good areas to look at for hydration levels.  Hydration is a sign of good health. Keep drinking water (not coffee, not tea, not cordial).

3. Energy
Have you been feeling a little LESS fatigued lately? Are you bouncing out of a bed a bit more each day? Are you getting further through the day before you crash? Are you getting more done?  These are signs that whatever you're doing is working for good health.

4. Strength
Are you feeling stronger?  Maybe in the gym - but more importantly, throughout the day?  Are you more able to get up off the floor? Or not pull a muscle by reaching up high? Are you able to lift things you weren't able to before?  These are BRILLIANT signs you're on the right track

5. Clothes
Do your clothes fit a little nicer? Is the zip going up easier? Is your chest not poking out of your blouse buttons so much? Is there less 'top on your 'muffin' in your yoga pants?  

All of these things are signs that you are getting healthier, despite whatever the scales might say.  If you're looking for longevity with your health",0,1758691572.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.5,False

1np3wal,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1np3wal/blended_americano/,Blended americano?,"To start, I work at a target starbucks. A lady came in today and asked for a venti iced americano blended, with a splash of milk and whatnot. I noticed I couldn't add a blending modification to an iced americano. I ended up charging her for an iced coffee blended plus 2 shots. Is there some rule in place for americanos not to be blended? If yes, how should I go about charging for it?

And now, the lady had a problem with how I made it:
I made a standard venti iced americano with the exception that I used less water(water/espresso to the bottom line like a frappe) and I threw that in the blender with her other flavor modifications. She had also asked for whip at the bottom and top of cup, which is so fine. However, the problem arises that it doesnt all fit in the orginal venti cup. There was about a tall size left over. She sees this and gets angry and states that Im stealing her espresso shots. She kept explaining that's why I shouldn't add water and I explained to her she ordered an americano (espresso with water, no?). She insists that I give her the extra frappe, which again is fine, I was going to dump it anyway. And now she's angry that she has to deal with 2 cups in her cart (the target shopping cart with 2 cup holders). 
At this point I should've offered a remake/ an alternative way to order this drink but honestly it was 5min until my shift was over and I was overwhelmed by her behavior, I just wanted her to be on her way. And she rambled more about the ridiculousness of 2 cups and walked away.
Was the way I made her blended americano right or should I have made it differently?

* I love the twist that Alice Wake wasn't being menaced by Mr. Scratch but that Alan was just running around their apartment terrified and angry. Very much a Tales of the Black Freighter sort of twist. I like the idea that Mr. Scratch was killed in American Nightmare and never came back. I do NOT like the idea Mr. Scratch was just Alan all along and even less that Alan was the source of the Dark Presence completely.
* I appreciate the heavy implications from the Final Draft that Darling and Tom the Filmmaker did create Alan Wake as a way to get out of the Dark Place. It's kind of funny that there's an Occam's Razor thing about all the theorizing of Tom that he used an alias from his movie's writer. Also, probably that he was locally known as a poet but internationally known as a filmmaker. No need for mind bending there.
* Alan Wake not being able to make people into existence is something I'm iffier on but I understand why Remedy would joss some of my favorite theories to avoid Alan being a God. I also note that he could have created Jesse, Casey, and the entire magical world via drawing real people from alternate realities but I should probably just accept that's not the case.
* I like the implications, real or imagined, that part of the reason that Casey hates Alan Wake's work is its so excessively grimdark and he's such a jerk when in full Max Payne mode while Casey is far more mellow in RL.Maybe even because he hates the excessive Punisher-style origin story that Wake gave him.
* Rose's fanfic was awesome and I hope she ends up with some sort of magical version of Alan and his bad boy brother. Easily my favorite of the DLCs. I'd ship her and Sheriff Breaker but I'm already shipping him and Jesse. Her having two jobs to make ends meet (nurse and coffee waitress) was also the saddest bit of realism.
* I'm with the people who think that Pat Maine just was suffering Alheimzers and someone should have taken away his podcast. It's so much worse than him remembering different realities wrong.
* So was Rose getting messages from Mr. Scratch, Alan, no one at all, or Mr. Door? Because it got Cynthia Weaver killed but Alan is Scratch and....argh.
* I'm worried about Jesse in the Oldest House since she's apparently not been able to get the Hiss under control after four years.",5,1758691453.0,AlanWake,3,0.86,False

¬†

Michael had taken two weeks' worth of our rations with him, in case he got stuck in the storm. That was a month ago. Halfway through the second week, we had begun rationing even more, hoping for a supply drop from the Belgians. Nothing ever came through, though. After a month, our food had almost all but run out. We only had supplies for a few days, and we were getting desperate. We ate only every other day. The power had gone out two weeks ago, and we were using the backup generators for minimal output: life support systems and the preservation tank where the bacteria were stored. If we lost that, then we would lose everything.

Most of our days were spent in the dark around a tiny heater and sleeping off hunger. No one really said much; there was nothing more to say. We were all trying to survive until the next day, but with every passing day, we knew something had to change. ¬†Time was running out, and we all knew that something must have happened. Adam was the first to talk.

‚ÄúWhat now, boss?‚Äù He asked Dr. Culhane as he shivered under many layers of jackets.

Dr. Culhane sat there silently for a moment before his cracked blue lips opened a slit.

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶we need to get to the Belgians ourselves.‚Äù He finally said. His eyes finally lifted off the faint orange glow of the heater to look at us.

Dr. Cillian stared at him for a moment. ‚ÄúYou want us to go out there?‚Äù She protested.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only thing we can do,‚Äù he replied, the gravity of our situation in his voice, ‚Äúotherwise we stay here and starve.‚Äù

We took in his words for a minute until Adam stood up.

‚ÄúLet's get what we can gathered up and head out then.‚Äù He said defiantly.

We gathered what we could as we mustered just before the hatch. Doctor Culhane switched off the life support systems to preserve the power generators for the bacteria's eco chamber. With the minimal load output, the generators would be able to run for another few weeks without us. Dr. Culhane opened the hatch, and bright light blinded us as we stepped outside. The skies were overcast, but having been in the dark for the last few weeks, the foreign light was glaring. The storm had recently subsided, luckily, so our journey wouldn‚Äôt be as perilous.

¬†

Hours of walking with an empty stomach were pure anguish. Everything in my body told me to stop, but I trudged on, ignoring my body screaming at me. We kept close together on the journey in case someone fell behind, which happened a lot. No words were spoken between any of us until Dr. Culhane motioned for us to stop. The supply cart we dragged with us slid to a stop behind us.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been going for about ten hours now.‚Äù he let out heavy, ragged breaths. ‚ÄúLet's stop for the night.‚Äù

We pulled out the tent supplies and sleeping bags. Inside the cramped two-man tent, we packed in on top of each other for some much-needed rest. It was cramped, but warm. Down here, it was always daytime during this time of the year. Even with the tarp over the tent, the sunlight peeked through the tent, casting tiny beams down on us. I could hear the sounds of everyone quickly drifting off to sleep as I thought about what could have happened to Michael out here during the storm. The thoughts followed me into my dreams.

¬†

I stood at the top of the radio tower, where the antenna was placed, and stared down at Michael's withered, frozen corpse. His body, preserved by the icy wind, but his gaunt face and sunken cheeks had told me that he had lost his supply to the storm days ago. His ungloved hands were immobile over the wires and circuitry of an open panel, which was now filled with snow and ice. I knelt to try to move him, but it was no use. His body had frozen to the cold metal, and he was not a fixture among the rats' nest of wires and steel holding this ruin together.

I heard a cracking sound as his head turned to me. His flesh ripped from the metal, taking half his face with it. The tissue and bone underneath now faced me as I gawked in terror at what I was looking at.

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶my‚Ä¶‚Äù A withered voice escaped him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶hun‚Ä¶gry.‚Äù He said before he lunged at me, teeth bared and his mouth wide.

¬†

I let out a scream as I bolted up, sweating, and the sleeping bag fell away. I felt an immediate chill and pulled back into the bag. It wasn‚Äôt as cramped anymore, and I turned over to see that there was no longer anyone inside the tent with me. I pulled on my jacket and went outside. I was greeted by the sight of the rest of the group clustered around a fire. Dr. Cillian seemed like she was in pain; she let out a muffled scream as she bit down on a rag.

I walked over to where Dr. Culhane and Adam were comforting her and had her hand in a pot of steaming water. It wasn‚Äôt boiling; I knew exactly what was happening. I saw that the tips of her fingers in the water were a very dark blue; an hour or two more in these conditions, and she would have lost them. Frostbite was already starting to threaten us. After about half an hour, the color had not returned to her hand, though she said that the numbness had gone away. We resigned to keep moving.

Another day of trudging step after step with nothing more than black coffee made with melted snow to fill our stomachs. Nothing like hiking on a caffeine rush to make you feel nauseous. All of us had vomited at some point; most of it was bile. Exhaustion was setting in, and we knew we had to eat some of our limited rations. Dr. Culhane stopped us two hours into the march to eat. It was a simple meal of dry, stale crackers and preserved cheese that was past its expiration. Still, we tore at it like savage, starved animals. Afterwards, I felt a new surge of energy, but it was only temporary.

A few more hours in, and my stomach begged me for more food. We had no idea how long it would take to walk all the way to the station, so we had to ration our supply sparingly. We were constantly battling hypothermia and frostbite, even with the heavy clothing and protective gear. We fought for the next few steps every grueling hour that passed; exhaustion threatened to take over at any point. Occasionally, someone would pass out, and we would stop to rest while those who collapsed came back to.¬† Dr. Culhane kept track of the time and would stop us every few hours to set up another bivouac. We would settle in for a few hours of sleep before continuing the journey to the station.

Move, sleep, move, sleep. It was an endless, relentless cycle of monotonous, exhaustive exertion that was enough to make anyone crazy.

Every time we stopped, we checked Dr. Cillian‚Äôs hands. The shade of blue had not changed color, but it did slowly creep up her fingers, almost as if it was spreading. Though she maintained the ability to move her hands, she didn‚Äôt have numbness or any blistering or redness. If it wasn‚Äôt frostbite, then what was it? The answer seemed to elude both of our doctors, and at the time, it was the last of our concerns, as well.

¬†

We woke up once again after a week of walking to begin yet another day. I climbed out of my sleeping bag and pulled on my jacket. I looked around and saw that Adam and Dr. Cillian were pulling on their warming layers before their fight with the cold. Dr. Culhane, however, was not awake. He was usually up before any of us. He usually got the snow melted and boiled for the coffee, but today he was still in his bag.

‚ÄúDr. Culhane?‚Äù I shook him, and he didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get up; we have to keep moving.‚Äù

No response.

Dr. Cillian reached over with a bare hand and placed it on his forehead. Then she reached her hand into the sleeping bag and felt his neck. She came back up and said nothing, a somber look on her face as she finally made eye contact with me. She just shook her head as tears welled in her eyes. He was still warm, which meant he had only recently passed away.

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù Adam shouted.

The rest of the morning was a somber occasion as we took stock of our supplies and strapped the doctor to the cart. We ate the last of our rations as we consulted our map of the area, scanning for the terrain features that had guided us so far. We had to be close to the Belgian station by now. We had been following Dr. Culhane‚Äôs navigation with nothing but a compass and a map for over a week, and he was sure just the night before that we would make it the next day.

‚ÄúJust over the ridge, five more miles.‚Äù He told us. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve earned a break, though. We‚Äôll head out after a few hours‚Äô sleep.‚Äù

With everything that was happening, we had all not even noticed that he hadn‚Äôt been taking his insulin. He must have thought he could last just a few more hours without it and get some from the Belgians' med bay. None of us had any idea that he wouldn‚Äôt make it.

We continued in the direction the doctor had pointed us only a few hours prior. Only a few short hours later, the wreckage came into view. The storm hit here as well, only it was much, much worse than when it hit us. The bay door was left on hinges, and the power was off. As we stepped inside, it looked like it was abandoned, and we would be right to assume they had taken the high road and left the shelter if not for the body of someone lying in the middle of the room as we entered.

‚ÄúSupplies.‚Äù I weakly relayed to the other two. ‚ÄúMaybe we can find some supplies.‚Äù

They nodded in agreement, and we left the cart in the bay and spread out. It wasn‚Äôt long before we found out that there was nothing left. Most of the facility had been torn away and buried, who knows where, under a blanket of ice. We gathered what we could find and started a fire in the bay. Adam managed to block the door, and we sat around the fire. There was no communication tower, no supplies left, and no rescue on the way.

¬†

Hunger is a primal thing. A feeling that does not go away for anything, eat or die are the only options for every living thing on this planet. We sat around the fire, and I fought back the thoughts that danced in my head. There was no way we could resort to that kind of depravity. I felt eyes on me and looked up. Adam stared at me with a defeated look on his face. Then he looked to Dr. Cillian, who met his eyes, then looked at me. It was an unspoken agreement that we knew what we had to do. Survival was our mission now. Others had done the same in these circumstances. We had to do it.

I stood over Dr. Culhane‚Äôs corpse, my hands shaking as I clutched the knife close to my chest. Once it began, there was no going back from this. We would forever be known as people who had committed an act so vile that it brought conspiracy and mentions of curse with it, all for the means of survival.

DMZ- The most popular trip is the DMZ near Paju (imjingang) about 50km NW of Seoul. Here you have the 3rd Tunnel, gondolas to Camp Greaves and the Dorasan Observatory. It‚Äôs great for a day trip and more of a theme park as they have fairground rides and attractions to see. You can see North Korea from the Observatory but in my opinion it‚Äôs not the best view and the rooftop is closed so you can‚Äôt access the telescopes and you‚Äôre not allowed to take photos towards NK. Take binoculars if you want to see NK clearly. The monorail to the tunnel is currently closed and no cameras or electronic items in the tunnel allowed¬†

JSA- The best place to see North Korea up close and personal is The JSA (Joint Security Area - Panmunjom) where the blue buildings are that span both sides of the border. Mr Trump met Mr Kim here is 2019 but unfortunately the JSA is currently closed due to rising tensions. I visited a few years ago before it closed and was a great experience to go into the blue buildings and cross over the line into North Korean side. I hope it will open again soon as I want to visit again. Last time they had a duty free shop but that‚Äôs now closed apparently.

Observatories- there are several observatories with views over North Korea. Aegibong, Odusan & Gangwha. These Observatories are all fairly close to Seoul and good for a day trip. My Favourite was Aegibong as the views of NK where the most impressive- I could see people working in the fields, school & apartments. This is a popular place for Insta photos as there is a Starbucks coffee shop in the Observatory that overlooks NK. There are good telescopes here and you can take photos towards NK. Other observatories have views over NK but not as much to see or as clear - IMO.

2nd Tunnel - the 2nd Tunnel is in Cheorwon - 100km NE Seoul and is part of a bird sanctuary so it is not as accessible as the 3rd Tunnel and you really need a private tour or private car to do this trip. The 2nd tunnel is much longer than the 3rd Tunnel and a bit more space inside if you‚Äôre claustrophobic. Apart from the tunnel and bird park there is not much else to see so the 3rd might be better if you‚Äôre looking for a package deal.¬†

CCZ - stands for civilian control zone so anytime you get close to the DMZ you will probably pass through a military checkpoint and they will check your passport/South Korean ID. So always carry them.¬†

A lot of these trips I did with Mrs Kim a Seoul tour guide as she specializes on DMZ history. (Seouljollytour.com) - thank you¬†¬†and I hope you enjoy these as much as I did. I plan to do East coast of SK soon as there are a few locations that side of the Country.",1,1758691190.0,koreatravel,0,0.67,False

¬†

Michael had taken two weeks' worth of our rations with him, in case he got stuck in the storm. That was a month ago. Halfway through the second week, we had begun rationing even more, hoping for a supply drop from the Belgians. Nothing ever came through, though. After a month, our food had almost all but run out. We only had supplies for a few days, and we were getting desperate. We ate only every other day. The power had gone out two weeks ago, and we were using the backup generators for minimal output: life support systems and the preservation tank where the bacteria were stored. If we lost that, then we would lose everything.

Most of our days were spent in the dark around a tiny heater and sleeping off hunger. No one really said much; there was nothing more to say. We were all trying to survive until the next day, but with every passing day, we knew something had to change. ¬†Time was running out, and we all knew that something must have happened. Adam was the first to talk.

‚ÄúWhat now, boss?‚Äù He asked Dr. Culhane as he shivered under many layers of jackets.

Dr. Culhane sat there silently for a moment before his cracked blue lips opened a slit.

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶we need to get to the Belgians ourselves.‚Äù He finally said. His eyes finally lifted off the faint orange glow of the heater to look at us.

Dr. Cillian stared at him for a moment. ‚ÄúYou want us to go out there?‚Äù She protested.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only thing we can do,‚Äù he replied, the gravity of our situation in his voice, ‚Äúotherwise we stay here and starve.‚Äù

We took in his words for a minute until Adam stood up.

‚ÄúLet's get what we can gathered up and head out then.‚Äù He said defiantly.

We gathered what we could as we mustered just before the hatch. Doctor Culhane switched off the life support systems to preserve the power generators for the bacteria's eco chamber. With the minimal load output, the generators would be able to run for another few weeks without us. Dr. Culhane opened the hatch, and bright light blinded us as we stepped outside. The skies were overcast, but having been in the dark for the last few weeks, the foreign light was glaring. The storm had recently subsided, luckily, so our journey wouldn‚Äôt be as perilous.

¬†

Hours of walking with an empty stomach were pure anguish. Everything in my body told me to stop, but I trudged on, ignoring my body screaming at me. We kept close together on the journey in case someone fell behind, which happened a lot. No words were spoken between any of us until Dr. Culhane motioned for us to stop. The supply cart we dragged with us slid to a stop behind us.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been going for about ten hours now.‚Äù he let out heavy, ragged breaths. ‚ÄúLet's stop for the night.‚Äù

We pulled out the tent supplies and sleeping bags. Inside the cramped two-man tent, we packed in on top of each other for some much-needed rest. It was cramped, but warm. Down here, it was always daytime during this time of the year. Even with the tarp over the tent, the sunlight peeked through the tent, casting tiny beams down on us. I could hear the sounds of everyone quickly drifting off to sleep as I thought about what could have happened to Michael out here during the storm. The thoughts followed me into my dreams.

¬†

I stood at the top of the radio tower, where the antenna was placed, and stared down at Michael's withered, frozen corpse. His body, preserved by the icy wind, but his gaunt face and sunken cheeks had told me that he had lost his supply to the storm days ago. His ungloved hands were immobile over the wires and circuitry of an open panel, which was now filled with snow and ice. I knelt to try to move him, but it was no use. His body had frozen to the cold metal, and he was not a fixture among the rats' nest of wires and steel holding this ruin together.

I heard a cracking sound as his head turned to me. His flesh ripped from the metal, taking half his face with it. The tissue and bone underneath now faced me as I gawked in terror at what I was looking at.

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶my‚Ä¶‚Äù A withered voice escaped him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶hun‚Ä¶gry.‚Äù He said before he lunged at me, teeth bared and his mouth wide.

¬†

I let out a scream as I bolted up, sweating, and the sleeping bag fell away. I felt an immediate chill and pulled back into the bag. It wasn‚Äôt as cramped anymore, and I turned over to see that there was no longer anyone inside the tent with me. I pulled on my jacket and went outside. I was greeted by the sight of the rest of the group clustered around a fire. Dr. Cillian seemed like she was in pain; she let out a muffled scream as she bit down on a rag.

I walked over to where Dr. Culhane and Adam were comforting her and had her hand in a pot of steaming water. It wasn‚Äôt boiling; I knew exactly what was happening. I saw that the tips of her fingers in the water were a very dark blue; an hour or two more in these conditions, and she would have lost them. Frostbite was already starting to threaten us. After about half an hour, the color had not returned to her hand, though she said that the numbness had gone away. We resigned to keep moving.

Another day of trudging step after step with nothing more than black coffee made with melted snow to fill our stomachs. Nothing like hiking on a caffeine rush to make you feel nauseous. All of us had vomited at some point; most of it was bile. Exhaustion was setting in, and we knew we had to eat some of our limited rations. Dr. Culhane stopped us two hours into the march to eat. It was a simple meal of dry, stale crackers and preserved cheese that was past its expiration. Still, we tore at it like savage, starved animals. Afterwards, I felt a new surge of energy, but it was only temporary.

A few more hours in, and my stomach begged me for more food. We had no idea how long it would take to walk all the way to the station, so we had to ration our supply sparingly. We were constantly battling hypothermia and frostbite, even with the heavy clothing and protective gear. We fought for the next few steps every grueling hour that passed; exhaustion threatened to take over at any point. Occasionally, someone would pass out, and we would stop to rest while those who collapsed came back to.¬† Dr. Culhane kept track of the time and would stop us every few hours to set up another bivouac. We would settle in for a few hours of sleep before continuing the journey to the station.

Move, sleep, move, sleep. It was an endless, relentless cycle of monotonous, exhaustive exertion that was enough to make anyone crazy.

Every time we stopped, we checked Dr. Cillian‚Äôs hands. The shade of blue had not changed color, but it did slowly creep up her fingers, almost as if it was spreading. Though she maintained the ability to move her hands, she didn‚Äôt have numbness or any blistering or redness. If it wasn‚Äôt frostbite, then what was it? The answer seemed to elude both of our doctors, and at the time, it was the last of our concerns, as well.

¬†

We woke up once again after a week of walking to begin yet another day. I climbed out of my sleeping bag and pulled on my jacket. I looked around and saw that Adam and Dr. Cillian were pulling on their warming layers before their fight with the cold. Dr. Culhane, however, was not awake. He was usually up before any of us. He usually got the snow melted and boiled for the coffee, but today he was still in his bag.

‚ÄúDr. Culhane?‚Äù I shook him, and he didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get up; we have to keep moving.‚Äù

No response.

Dr. Cillian reached over with a bare hand and placed it on his forehead. Then she reached her hand into the sleeping bag and felt his neck. She came back up and said nothing, a somber look on her face as she finally made eye contact with me. She just shook her head as tears welled in her eyes. He was still warm, which meant he had only recently passed away.

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù Adam shouted.

The rest of the morning was a somber occasion as we took stock of our supplies and strapped the doctor to the cart. We ate the last of our rations as we consulted our map of the area, scanning for the terrain features that had guided us so far. We had to be close to the Belgian station by now. We had been following Dr. Culhane‚Äôs navigation with nothing but a compass and a map for over a week, and he was sure just the night before that we would make it the next day.

‚ÄúJust over the ridge, five more miles.‚Äù He told us. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve earned a break, though. We‚Äôll head out after a few hours‚Äô sleep.‚Äù

With everything that was happening, we had all not even noticed that he hadn‚Äôt been taking his insulin. He must have thought he could last just a few more hours without it and get some from the Belgians' med bay. None of us had any idea that he wouldn‚Äôt make it.

We continued in the direction the doctor had pointed us only a few hours prior. Only a few short hours later, the wreckage came into view. The storm hit here as well, only it was much, much worse than when it hit us. The bay door was left on hinges, and the power was off. As we stepped inside, it looked like it was abandoned, and we would be right to assume they had taken the high road and left the shelter if not for the body of someone lying in the middle of the room as we entered.

‚ÄúSupplies.‚Äù I weakly relayed to the other two. ‚ÄúMaybe we can find some supplies.‚Äù

They nodded in agreement, and we left the cart in the bay and spread out. It wasn‚Äôt long before we found out that there was nothing left. Most of the facility had been torn away and buried, who knows where, under a blanket of ice. We gathered what we could find and started a fire in the bay. Adam managed to block the door, and we sat around the fire. There was no communication tower, no supplies left, and no rescue on the way.

¬†

Hunger is a primal thing. A feeling that does not go away for anything, eat or die are the only options for every living thing on this planet. We sat around the fire, and I fought back the thoughts that danced in my head. There was no way we could resort to that kind of depravity. I felt eyes on me and looked up. Adam stared at me with a defeated look on his face. Then he looked to Dr. Cillian, who met his eyes, then looked at me. It was an unspoken agreement that we knew what we had to do. Survival was our mission now. Others had done the same in these circumstances. We had to do it.

I stood over Dr. Culhane‚Äôs corpse, my hands shaking as I clutched the knife close to my chest. Once it began, there was no going back from this. We would forever be known as people who had committed an act so vile that it brought conspiracy and mentions of curse with it, all for the means of survival.

1np3noh,https://i.redd.it/p49slpyup1rf1.png,Wife Exposes Husband's Affair | The metallic clang of surgical instruments,"Chapter 1

The metallic clang of surgical instruments echoed through the trauma bay as I worked alongside the team on the motorcycle accident victim. Blood pulsed from the patient's femoral artery, and I moved with practiced precision to clamp it. Across the table, my husband, Dr. Michael Chen, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Emma Rodriguez, the newest resident in our emergency department.

""Perfect technique, Dr. Rodriguez,"" Michael's voice carried an unmistakable warmth as he guided Emma's hands. ""Just like that.""

I kept my eyes fixed on my work, but I couldn't help noticing how his fingers lingered on her forearm‚Äîa touch that lasted seconds longer than necessary. The OR lights caught the gleam in Emma's eyes as she looked up at him, her smile intimate and knowing.

A cold weight settled in my stomach. This wasn't merely an attending physician guiding a resident.

""Dr. Mitchell, we need another unit,"" the nurse called, breaking my trance.

""On it,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. Eight years of marriage had taught me to wear a professional mask, even as I cataloged the small betrayals happening before my eyes.

Michael leaned closer to Emma, murmuring something that made her laugh softly. His wedding ring caught the light as his hand brushed against her lower back‚Äîa gesture hidden from the rest of the team by their surgical gowns, but perfectly visible from my angle.

""Excellent work, everyone,"" Michael announced as we stabilized the patient. ""Especially you, Dr. Rodriguez. Your quick thinking saved this patient's leg.""

I had been the one to identify the arterial bleed first, but apparently, that detail had escaped my husband's notice.

Hours later, I stood under the scalding shower in the attendings' locker room, trying to wash away the day's tensions along with the antiseptic smell that clung to my skin. The water couldn't rinse away what I'd seen‚Äîthe lingering touches, the private smiles, the way Michael's eyes followed Emma when she moved.

Wrapping myself in a towel, I stepped back into the locker room. Michael's scrubs lay discarded on the bench, and his phone sat abandoned on the edge of the sink. He must have been called away suddenly.

I stared at the device, my heart hammering against my ribs. We'd always had an open-phone policy‚Äîa relic from our early days of trust and transparency. When had that changed? When had I stopped checking his messages? When had he started guarding his phone?

With trembling fingers, I picked it up. The screen lit up at my touch‚Äîno password required. Perhaps overconfidence was Michael's fatal flaw; he never expected me to look.

I tapped on his messaging app, and there it was‚Äîa conversation thread with Emma at the top of his recent chats. My thumb hovered over it for a moment before I pressed down, unleashing an avalanche of truth.

\*Miss you already. Last night was incredible.\*

\*Can't wait to feel you again.\*

\*Delete these after reading, baby.\*

I scrolled up, each message more explicit than the last. Photos appeared‚ÄîEmma in states of undress, Michael's hands on her body. I recognized our bedroom in the background of one image, the sheets I had picked out framing their betrayal.

My hands didn't shake anymore. A strange calm settled over me as I methodically took screenshots, sending them to my own phone before carefully returning everything to its original state. The evidence of their affair now safely documented, I placed Michael's phone exactly where I'd found it.

That night, I lay beside my husband in bed, listening to his even breathing as he slept peacefully. How many nights had he come home to me after being with her? How long had this been happening while I underwent painful fertility treatments at his mother's insistence?

The next morning, I arrived at the hospital early, a folder of papers tucked under my arm. I'd spent the predawn hours preparing what looked like standard hospital credential renewal forms‚Äîbut were actually divorce papers I'd had prepared months ago during a moment of suspicion I'd talked myself out of.

""Morning,"" Michael said as he breezed into the doctors' lounge, barely glancing at me as he poured his coffee.

""Need your signature on these,"" I said, voice professional, sliding the folder toward him. ""Hospital's pushing for the credential renewals early this year.""

Michael sighed with annoyance. ""Can't the admin staff handle this?""

""They're backed up with the merger paperwork,"" I lied smoothly. ""Just sign where I've flagged, and I'll drop them off.""

Without reading a single line, Michael scrawled his signature across each marked page, his arrogance working in my favor. He trusted that I, his dutiful wife, would never deceive him.

""Thanks,"" I said, tucking the folder away. As I walked out, I caught sight of Emma entering the lounge, her eyes lighting up at the sight of my husband.

Little did either of them know that with those signatures, the first domino in my carefully planned revenge had just fallen.

Chapter 2

Michael and Emma jetted off to Napa Valley, and Emma wasted no time sharing their romantic getaway with the world. Every candlelit dinner, every sunset stroll through the vineyards, every laugh‚Äîit was all meticulously curated and posted on Instagram. Each snapshot was a dagger, twisting deeper into my heart.

I watched them, my stomach churning with every click. The comments from their friends and colleagues piled up‚Äîcongratulations, hearts, and cheers for the ‚Äúnew couple.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt care that he was still married. They didn‚Äôt care that I was being torn apart by their betrayal.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I typed out a comment on one of Emma‚Äôs posts, my fingers trembling with anger. ‚ÄúEnjoy your stolen life,‚Äù I wrote, then hit send before I could change my mind. It was reckless, but I didn‚Äôt care. I couldn‚Äôt keep silent anymore.

The response was immediate. Emma blocked me, but it was too late. Screenshots of my comment spread like wildfire across the hospital‚Äôs grapevine. The whispers started‚Äîcolleagues murmuring in the hallways, judgmental glances following me in the ER. I heard snippets of conversations, hushed voices discussing the scandal. They didn‚Äôt know the full story, but they knew enough to speculate.

I kept my head down, focusing on my work. Outwardly, I appeared calm, professional. But inside, I was seething. I filed away every screenshot, every message, every piece of evidence. I knew it would come in handy soon.

That night, as I changed out of my scrubs, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My eyes were hard, my jaw set. I barely recognized the woman staring back at me. The naive, trusting person I used to be was gone, replaced by someone colder, more calculating. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked this new version of myself, but I knew it was necessary.

The days passed in a blur of work and quiet rage. I threw myself into every task, determined to stay ahead of the game. I couldn‚Äôt let Michael and Emma bring me down. I wouldn‚Äôt give them the satisfaction.

One evening, as I was leaving the hospital, I saw Michael striding toward me, his face dark with anger. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing, Sarah?‚Äù he demanded, grabbing my arm. ‚ÄúWhy are you causing trouble?‚Äù

I yanked my arm free, my voice icy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not causing trouble, Michael. I‚Äôm just telling the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe truth?‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like a jealous ex-wife, making a scene on social media. You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm embarrassing myself?‚Äù I laughed, a bitter sound. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one sleeping with a resident, flaunting it for everyone to see. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs embarrassing us, Michael.‚Äù

He glared at me, his jaw clenched. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making this personal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is about my career, Sarah. Your little stunt is going to reflect badly on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour career?‚Äù I repeated, incredulous. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried about your career? You should be worried about your marriage, Michael. You should be worried about your integrity.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this. I have a surgery tomorrow, and I need to prepare.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúYour precious surgery. I hope it goes well. Maybe Emma can assist you‚Äîif she‚Äôs not too busy planning your wedding.‚Äù

He growled, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get a rise out of me, Sarah. I‚Äôm not going to fight with you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not trying to fight,‚Äù I said, smiling sweetly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just stating the facts. Enjoy your surgery, Michael. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be‚Ä¶ enlightening.‚Äù

He stormed off, leaving me standing there, my heart pounding. I watched him go, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction. I wasn‚Äôt going to let him win. I wasn‚Äôt going to let him destroy me.

The next morning, I arrived at the hospital early, ready to face whatever the day brought. As I scrubbed in for the first surgery, I noticed Emma hovering in the corner, her eyes fixed on Michael. She looked nervous, her usual confidence shaken.

The surgery was a high-pressure case‚Äîa young boy with internal bleeding from a car accident. Michael was in charge, with Emma assisting. I stood by, observing as they worked.

Everything seemed to be going smoothly until Emma faltered. She miscued a staple, and blood began to spill onto the surgical field. Michael‚Äôs head snapped up, his eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, Emma?‚Äù he barked. ‚ÄúGet it together.‚Äù

She flinched, her face pale. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Dr. Chen. It won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù

Michael‚Äôs gaze flicked to me, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of guilt. But then his expression hardened, and he turned back to Emma. ‚ÄúWatch what you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù he said curtly. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford mistakes.‚Äù

I kept my face neutral, but inside, I was seething. He was going to let her take the fall for this. He was going to protect her, no matter what.

Chapter 3

I stood in the medication room, staring at Michael in disbelief. The audacity of his request left me speechless for a moment.

""You want me to take the fall for your girlfriend's mistake?"" I said, my voice dangerously quiet. ""You really don't know me at all, do you?""

Michael's jaw tightened. ""Sarah, be reasonable. This is about what's best for the department.""

""No,"" I replied, the word sharp and final. ""This is about what's best for Emma. And you.""

I brushed past him, my shoulder deliberately bumping his as I left. In the quiet of the locker room, I pulled a folder from my bag‚Äîmy Doctors Without Borders application. I'd been considering it for months, a distant escape plan I never thought I'd need. Now, it felt like a lifeline.

My fingers moved methodically across the pages, filling in personal details, medical qualifications, availability dates. With each box completed, I felt a weight lifting. I tucked the application into my locker alongside the printouts of Michael's texts with Emma‚Äîevidence I'd been gathering like a silent collector.

\* \* \*

The hospital's annual charity gala transformed the usually sterile grand ballroom into a glittering wonderland. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over tables draped in midnight blue linens, while Seattle's medical elite mingled in formal wear that cost more than most patients' monthly salaries.

I adjusted my silver gown‚Äîa dress I'd chosen months ago, before I knew my marriage was a sham. Michael stood across the room, his hand resting possessively on Emma's lower back. She wore red, of course. Subtle.

""You're handling this with remarkable grace,"" Chloe whispered, appearing at my side with two champagne flutes. ""I'd have poisoned his drink by now.""

I accepted the champagne with a smile. ""The night's still young.""

Dinner proceeded with excruciating politeness. I was seated at the Chen family table‚Äîa seating arrangement made months ago that no one had thought to change. Michael sat beside Emma at the far end, while I was positioned between his parents. Eleanor Chen's perfume was suffocating, a cloud of expensive scent that couldn't mask the sourness of her personality.

As dessert was served, Eleanor rose, crystal glass in hand. The room quieted.

""I'd like to propose a toast,"" she announced, her voice carrying that practiced warmth that never reached her eyes. ""To Seattle General, to excellence in medicine, and to our perfect future family.""

Her gaze lingered on Emma, who blushed appropriately on cue. Then Eleanor's eyes slid to me, sharp as scalpels.

""Though some of us may find that family comes more... naturally... than others."" She smiled thinly. ""How is your delicate condition these days, Sarah? Still no progress?""

The room went silent. I could feel every eye on me, waiting for the wronged wife to crumble or lash out. Instead, I lifted my glass, my smile unwavering even as something burned behind my eyes.

""To family,"" I echoed, taking a deliberate sip. ""In all its forms.""

Eleanor's smile faltered at my composure.

After dinner, as guests dispersed to the dance floor and bar, I approached Michael, who stood with his parents and Emma in a tight circle. I carried a familiar manila folder.

""I've been meaning to return these to you,"" I said pleasantly, extending the folder to Michael. ""The credential forms you signed.""

Michael took the folder absently, barely glancing at me. ""Fine, fine.""

""You might want to look at them,"" I suggested, my voice honey-sweet. ""There's been a slight change.""

Frowning, Michael opened the folder. His face drained of color as he recognized the divorce papers, his signature on every page. Eleanor peered over his shoulder, her eyes widening in shock.

""What is this?"" she hissed. ""What have you done?""

""Nothing that wasn't long overdue,"" I replied calmly.

""This is underhanded trickery!"" Eleanor spat, her carefully maintained composure cracking. ""Michael, call our lawyer immediately!""

Emma placed a comforting hand on Michael's arm, her expression a perfect mask of shocked concern. ""I had no idea,"" she murmured, though the gleam in her eyes told a different story.

I turned to leave, but not before catching sight of David Chen's face. For the first time, I saw something like doubt cross his features as he looked at his son.

As I walked away, head high, I heard Eleanor's voice rising behind me: ""You ungrateful, scheming‚Äî""

But her words couldn't touch me now. The first real move in our game had been played, and judging by the expressions I'd just witnessed, none of them had seen it coming.

What they didn't know was that this was just the beginning.

1np3ias,https://www.reddit.com/r/Living_in_Korea/comments/1np3ias/dmz_ccz_jsa_23_tunnels_observatories_which_one_to/,"DMZ, CCZ, JSA, 2&3 Tunnels, Observatories? Which one to visit?","Lots of people want to see North Korea when visiting Seoul so I thought I would write a post about my tour visits to all of these different locations along the border as it is a popular trip while visiting South Korea. I‚Äôm English and have lived in SK for the past year and this is the trips I most wanted to do while living here. Enjoy¬†¬†

DMZ- The most popular trip is the DMZ near Paju (imjingang) about 50km NW of Seoul. Here you have the 3rd Tunnel, gondolas to Camp Greaves and the Dorasan Observatory. It‚Äôs great for a day trip and more of a theme park as they have fairground rides and attractions to see. You can see North Korea from the Observatory but in my opinion it‚Äôs not the best view and the rooftop is closed so you can‚Äôt access the telescopes and you‚Äôre not allowed to take photos towards NK. Take binoculars if you want to see NK clearly. The monorail to the tunnel is currently closed and no cameras or electronic items in the tunnel allowed¬†

JSA- The best place to see North Korea up close and personal is The JSA (Joint Security Area - Panmunjom) where the blue buildings are that span both sides of the border. Mr Trump met Mr Kim here is 2019 but unfortunately the JSA is currently closed due to rising tensions. I visited a few years ago before it closed and was a great experience to go into the blue buildings and cross over the line into North Korean side. I hope it will open again soon as I want to visit again. Last time they had a duty free shop but that‚Äôs now closed apparently.

Observatories- there are several observatories with views over North Korea. Aegibong, Odusan & Gangwha. These Observatories are all fairly close to Seoul and good for a day trip. My Favourite was Aegibong as the views of NK where the most impressive- I could see people working in the fields, school & apartments. This is a popular place for Insta photos as there is a Starbucks coffee shop in the Observatory that overlooks NK. There are good telescopes here and you can take photos towards NK. Other observatories have views over NK but not as much to see or as clear - IMO.

2nd Tunnel - the 2nd Tunnel is in Cheorwon - 100km NE Seoul and is part of a bird sanctuary so it is not as accessible as the 3rd Tunnel and you really need a private tour or private car to do this trip. The 2nd tunnel is much longer than the 3rd Tunnel and a bit more space inside if you‚Äôre claustrophobic. Apart from the tunnel and bird park there is not much else to see so the 3rd might be better if you‚Äôre looking for a package deal.¬†

CCZ - stands for civilian control zone so anytime you get close to the DMZ you will probably pass through a military checkpoint and they will check your passport/South Korean ID. So always carry them.¬†

A lot of these trips I did with Mrs Kim a Seoul tour guide as she specializes on DMZ history. (Seouljollytour) - thank you¬†¬†and I hope you enjoy these as much as I did. I plan to do East coast of SK soon as there are a few locations that side of the Country.

1np3gtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1np3gtv/my_childs_surgery_replaced_my_scalpel_with/,My Child‚Äôs Surgery Replaced My Scalpel with Handcuffs,"Chapter 1

On the day of my son's surgery, because assistant doctor Mariam Shanahan injected the wrong medicine, I, as a senior neurosurgeon, could only watch my son die on the operating table, under my scalpel.

Grief consumed me, and in my fury, I sued Mariam .

But in court, my husband‚Äîthe anesthesiologist for that very surgery‚Äîturned on me. He stood up and testified that it was my instructions that killed our child.

The surgical recording had been deliberately erased. Every doctor and nurse who had been in that operating room chose to be silent. With no evidence to defend myself, I was convicted of murdering my own son and sentenced to five years in prison.

When I finally walked free five years later, I discovered the truth‚Äîmy husband had already built a new family. He was living happily with Mariam, the woman who had killed my child! Together, they had a little boy of their own.

Their son looked at me curiously and asked, ‚ÄúPapa, who is she?‚Äù

My husband hesitated for a moment. Then, with a calm face, he replied, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the new nanny.‚Äù

Rage burned through me, hotter than anything I had ever known. But I did not cry. I did not scream. Quietly, I vowed that I would dig through the buried evidence of five years past and find justice for my son.

I dialed the number I had been yearning to call for five long years.

‚ÄúAtty. Spence, I want to overturn the case‚Äîthe one from five years ago. I‚Äôll make them pay for what they did, even if it costs me everything!‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

Arizona‚Äôs POV

The day I walked out of prison, the sky was heavy with clouds.

Dressed in nothing but a worn prison uniform and clutching a cheap phone, I dialed the number I had been yearning to call for five long years.

‚ÄúAtty. Spence, I want to overturn the case‚Äîthe one from five years ago. I‚Äôll make them pay for what they did, even if it costs me everything!‚Äù

On the other end of the line, silence lingered for several seconds before a low, steady voice finally responded.

‚ÄúGood. You‚Äôve finally made up your mind. I‚Äôve been investigating this case for the past five years. Give me one more week, and I‚Äôll make sure they pay‚Äîblood for blood.‚Äù

I closed my eyes, my fingernails digging deep into my palms.

‚ÄúAll right. In the meantime, I‚Äôll find a way to get hold of the surveillance footage from that surgery.‚Äù

Alan paused before lowering his voice. ‚ÄúWhy are you so certain she still has it?‚Äù

Instantly, the memory of that day five years ago surged before my eyes.

The machines blared with urgent alarms. The heart monitor abruptly flatlined. My son‚Äôs small body convulsed one last time on the operating table‚Ä¶

And in the trembling hand of the assistant surgeon, Mariam Shanahan, gleamed a syringe filled with the wrong medication.

Her stammering confession still rang in my ears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Ä¶ I must have grabbed the wrong drug‚Ä¶‚Äù

Later, I learned it was not a mistake at all. She had done it on purpose!

Before I was sentenced, she leaned close to my ear and whispered, ‚ÄúIf your son hadn‚Äôt died, I‚Äôd never have a chance with Charlton. I kept that surgical footage as a trophy. I watch it whenever I feel like it. It‚Äôs exhilarating!‚Äù

My eyes snapped open at the memory, and my voice cut like ice.

‚ÄúThat shameless woman definitely still has it.‚Äù

Alan‚Äôs tone turned grim. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. If we can secure that footage, our chances will be higher.‚Äù

I hung up, my chest heaving as though my lungs might tear apart.

I was locked up in jail for five long years.

Five years ago, my own husband, Charlton Cohen, both an anesthesiologist and the man I once trusted most, testified falsely against me in court and sent me behind bars.

For those five years, he never visited me once.

And today, the day of my release, he was not there either.

Alone, I hailed a cab and went back to the villa that used to be our home.

I had not even decided what I would say when I saw him again before my eyes fell upon the scene in the courtyard.

Mariam stood there, cradling a three-year-old boy in her arms, laughing and playing with Charlton as though they were a family.

The child noticed me first. Tilting his head with innocent curiosity, he looked up at the man and asked, ‚ÄúDaddy, who‚Äôs that lady? Why does she have a key to our house?‚Äù

Charlton‚Äôs expression faltered for a moment before he quickly recovered.

In an unnervingly calm tone, he replied, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the new nanny we hired.‚Äù

It felt as though thunder exploded inside my skull, and a red haze clouded my vision.

Daddy?

He called me a nanny?

‚ÄòWhy, Charlton?‚Äô I wanted to ask. ‚ÄòIf you wanted a divorce, if you wanted to start a family with another woman, couldn‚Äôt you have just told me? Why did you let that woman kill our child, then send me to prison and destroy my entire life?!‚Äô

The questions burned in my head, but my body wouldn‚Äôt move. I stood frozen at the doorway, my throat quivering as words scraped out.

‚ÄúCharlton, you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out already? Why didn‚Äôt you let me know in advance?‚Äù he interrupted quickly, as if afraid of what I might say in front of the boy. He grabbed my arm and pulled me into the house.

I looked at this man‚Äîso familiar, yet so foreign‚Äîand felt my heart nailed through with pain.

All the questions I had prepared for years lodged in my throat, unable to escape.

I could not accept that the man I had loved deeply for years had become this unfamiliar figure.

I remembered the day we met, both of us strangers in an online support group for victims of medical malpractice.

Both of our parents had died in medical accidents.

We comforted each other, supported each other, and swore to become doctors who would never repeat those tragedies.

We poured every coin into our studies.

In our tiny rented room, he had once held my hand and vowed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll become the best anesthesiologist. I‚Äôll be your most reliable partner in the operating room.‚Äù

Later, we made it happen.

At the hospital, we were the couple everyone envied.

We spent our days in white coats saving lives and our nights eating instant noodles while watching movies.

Life was simple, not wealthy, but brimming with happiness.

The day I completed my first neurosurgery, he proposed to me.

The very next day, I discovered I was pregnant.

When I told him, his eyes reddened.

‚ÄúArizona, we finally have a family. I‚Äôll protect you and our son for the rest of my life.‚Äù

Back then, I believed him.

But now, this same man stood before me, weaving a flimsy lie in a cold voice.

‚ÄúThe child is Mariam‚Äôs relative. His parents passed away, and he‚Äôs staying with us for now. He‚Äôs still young, Arizona. He doesn‚Äôt understand what happened, so don‚Äôt get the wrong idea and say anything that might upset him.‚Äù

As if nothing had happened, he even handed me clean clothes with feigned tenderness.

‚ÄúYou must be tired after coming back alone. Do you want to rest first? Have you eaten?‚Äù

His fake concern made my skin crawl.

I cut him off, my voice sharp.

‚ÄúThen what about Mariam? Why is she here? Don‚Äôt you have a single explanation for what happened five years ago? And why‚Ä¶ all these years‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wanted to ask him, ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt you come see me even once?‚Äô

He looked at me as though I were an unreasonable madwoman, and his voice was cold.

‚ÄúArizona, the past is past. No matter how much you dwell on it, nothing will change. Why keep tormenting yourself? As for children, if you want one, we can always have another.‚Äù

We can always have another?

A crushing tightness seized my chest, and blackness closed in at the edges of my sight.

He and Mariam killed my child. They destroyed my career. They ruined my name!

And now, all of it was brushed aside with ‚ÄúWe can always have another.‚Äù

Did he think our son was some toy, something to discard and replace whenever he pleased?

When he saw me sway on my feet, his eyes flickered with concern. He instinctively reached out to steady me, but a cry from outside cut him short.

‚ÄúCharlton! Luca fell!‚Äù Mariam‚Äôs anxious voice rang through the courtyard.

His face changed instantly, and without hesitation, he rushed out the door.

I stared blankly after him, a bitter laugh escaping my lips.

When our son was alive, a mere tear in his eye would earn nothing but his daddy‚Äôs stern words. ‚ÄúBe strong. Boys shouldn‚Äôt cry.‚Äù

Never once did he show such worry.

But for Mariam‚Äôs child, a simple stumble sent him into a panic.

Halfway through the doorway, he turned back and gripped my shoulders hard.

‚ÄúArizona, I‚Äôm at a critical point in my career. Mariam is the director‚Äôs daughter; whether I get promoted depends entirely on her. I know you hate her, but we can‚Äôt fight her. Listen, don‚Äôt make trouble now, alright?‚Äù

The way he said it told me he had practiced those words many times.

It was as if he were ready for my outrage, ready to suppress me.

But instead of lashing out, I smiled faintly, each word torn from my bleeding heart.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt make trouble.‚Äù

Making trouble meant there was still hope. But I had none left.

All I wanted now was divorce and justice for my son.

He froze and then let out a long sigh of relief, as though shedding a great burden.

Pulling me into his arms, he whispered, coaxing, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better. We‚Äôve survived worse days together, haven‚Äôt we? Go unpack your things. Later, I‚Äôll explain everything to you.‚Äù

His hand rested gently on my head, just as it had countless times in the past.

Then, he turned and ran back outside‚Äîto Mariam and her child.



Chapter 2

Arizona‚Äôs POV

I looked around and saw that every trace of my son and me had been erased from the villa.

The puzzle we once pieced together no longer sat on the coffee table. My son‚Äôs beloved dinosaur figurines were gone as well.

In their place, Mariam‚Äôs expensive trinkets glittered on every surface. A toy car and a few building blocks‚Äîbelonging to another child‚Äîlay scattered by the edge of the carpet.

A metallic taste rose in my throat, and my eyes burned. Forcing down the ache, I made myself walk toward what had once been my bedroom.

The moment I pushed the door open, a low and guttural snarl tore through the air, vibrating in my ears.

A massive black dog lunged at me, its sharp fangs glinting as it stopped barely half an inch from my face.

My entire body went rigid. My breath came in shallow gasps, and every drop of blood in my veins seemed to turn to ice.

The dog slammed me onto the floor. Its weight pressed against my chest until I trembled uncontrollably with no sound escaping my throat.

Just as its jaws were about to close on me, Charlton‚Äôs cold, commanding voice cut through the air.

‚ÄúAlpha! Stop!‚Äù

The black dog hesitated, bared its teeth one last time, and finally stepped aside.

I collapsed on the floor, drenched in cold sweat. When I lifted my head, Mariam was walking toward me, smiling sweetly as she cradled the little boy in her arms.

She bent down and stroked the dog‚Äôs head, her lips curving into a mocking smile.

‚ÄúDr. Crumpler, I‚Äôm terribly sorry. You‚Äôve been gone for five years, and there weren‚Äôt enough rooms in the villa, so I took the liberty of housing Alpha in yours. If you really mind, I can have someone move him to another room right away.‚Äù

Her tone was airy and dismissive, almost generous, as though she were the true lady of this home. Perhaps, in these past five years, she really had been.

My nails dug deep into my palms as I clenched my fists.

Before I could respond, the little boy in her arms piped up in his childish voice.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she just the nanny? How can the nanny stay in Alpha‚Äôs room? Nannies should stay in the tiny room by the stairs downstairs.‚Äù

Charlton quickly pulled the child closer, silencing his innocent honesty. He turned to me, his voice softened.

‚ÄúLet it go, Arizona. Why don‚Äôt you stay in your son‚Äôs old room?‚Äù

My lips parted. He must have thought I was about to explode. Instead, I whispered, ‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

I could tell his chest tightened with unease. After five years apart, I was different‚Äîso different that he must have felt a creeping loss of control.

Then, he shook his head, as if protesting, ‚ÄòNo. Impossible. She was still the same girl from that small town‚Äîkind, devoted, hopelessly in love with me. What real change could five years bring?‚Äô

With a blank expression, I walked toward the children‚Äôs room. But when I pushed open the door, my chest wrenched in agony.

The room that once belonged to my son had been turned into a storage space!

The colorful drawings he once painted on the walls‚Äîour little family smiling together‚Äîhad been scribbled over with markers.

His awards and certificates were ripped into pieces, tossed into the trash bin, trampled and crumpled like worthless scraps.

‚ÄúDr. Crumpler.‚Äù Mariam followed me inside, shutting the door with a careless hand. She leaned lazily against it, her eyes brimming with contempt, her voice lowered to a sneer.

‚ÄúSo what if you‚Äôve come back? This house no longer has a place for you. If you know what‚Äôs good for you, you‚Äôll leave quietly.‚Äù

A rush of blood thundered in my head. Hatred surged, threatening to consume me whole.

‚ÄúMariam‚Äî‚Äù My voice shook, but she cut me off with a derisive laugh.

‚ÄúWhat, did you come back to overturn the case? To take revenge on me? Oh, Arizona, you‚Äôre still so naive. Do you really think the people who sent you to prison five years ago would give you another chance now?‚Äù

She stepped closer, her gaze sharp and malicious.

‚ÄúAs for your dead son‚Ä¶‚Äù Her lips curved into a cruel smile. ‚ÄúI had his grave leveled long ago. I bet his soul will never rest.‚Äù

My mind exploded into white noise.

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù Her smile widened, her contempt obvious. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just as pathetic. Damaging your hand was only the first step. If you don‚Äôt obediently divorce Charlton, I‚Äôll make the rest of your life nothing but endless darkness!‚Äù

That was it. The last of my restraint shattered.

I raised my hand and slapped her so hard that the blow cracked through the room.

But Mariam didn‚Äôt flinch. She didn‚Äôt move or blink.

Instead, her eyes glistened. Tears welled instantly, and her lips trembled.

‚ÄúDr. Crumpler, I only wanted to apologize to you. Why would you suddenly hit me?‚Äù

The door burst open. Charlton rushed in with the little boy.

‚ÄúArizona!‚Äù His furious shout struck my ears like a thunderclap.

He jabbed a finger at me, eyes blazing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone too far!‚Äù

My chest heaved, my throat raw as if slashed by knives. ‚ÄúShe said‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCharlton, don‚Äôt blame Dr. Crumpler.‚Äù Mariam sobbed, tears streaming down her cheeks. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just too upset‚Ä¶‚Äù

Charlton‚Äôs anger wavered, replaced by distress. He pulled her protectively into his arms and glared at me coldly.

‚ÄúFive years, Arizona. It‚Äôs been five years! Mariam has long regretted what happened. Back then, it wasn‚Äôt just even intentional; she only made a mistake because she was nervous. You can‚Äôt put all the blame on her. Why must you keep pressing her like this? You come out of prison, and you‚Äôre still so impulsive, so violent!‚Äù

A ringing filled my ears. My eyes stung with unshed tears.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù the little boy cried, rushing toward me. His face was wet with tears as he shouted, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs bullying Mommy!‚Äù

Before I could react, he rammed into me, slamming me back against the wall. His small fists pounded viciously into my stomach.

Agony tore through me. A metallic sweetness filled my throat, and blood surged upward.

Mariam quickly gathered him into her arms, her voice tender through her tears.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right, sweetheart. It‚Äôs my fault. If Dr. Crumpler has any resentment, let her take it out on me. I deserve it. If not for me, she wouldn‚Äôt have ended up like this today.‚Äù

I trembled all over, staring at the ruined children‚Äôs room, my chest tightening with grief and blood.

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù I rasped, my voice hoarse and breaking. ‚ÄúCharlton‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs divorce.‚Äù

For a moment, the air froze.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù The word burst from his mouth. His face darkened instantly, his mouth pressed into a hard line.

‚ÄúRight now is a crucial time for me,‚Äù Charlton said in a low voice. ‚ÄúIf a divorce scandal breaks out, it will damage my chances of promotion. Wait one week. Once I‚Äôm promoted, we‚Äôll talk about it.‚Äù

As soon as he finished, he scooped the sobbing Mariam into his arms and strode away, as though afraid I might say something else he didn‚Äôt want to hear.

Without anyone else but me around, the room fell silent. I stood frozen, then a bitter laugh escaped my throat, and tears blurred my vision.

So that was it. It wasn‚Äôt that Charlton refused to divorce me. He had only been stalling because he feared for his career.

I had been telling myself to be patient, that one week was nothing. I could wait.

After that, I would divorce him and see both him and Mariam pay for what they had done!



Chapter 3

Arizona‚Äôs POV

I curled slowly onto the small, already-ruined bed where my son had once slept.

My tears soaked the pillow little by little until exhaustion pulled me under.

When I opened my eyes the next morning, a small blanket had been draped over me.

I pushed it aside with a sneer. What game was Charlton playing now?

He already had a child with another woman and planned to divorce me. Why still pretend to be considerate?

I had barely opened the door when Charlton appeared, waiting outside. He thrust a suit into my arms and said in a coaxing tone, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Mariam‚Äôs birthday. You upset her yesterday, so you must apologize personally.‚Äù

Coldness swept across my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going.‚Äù

He stepped closer, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúAlmost everyone from the hospital will be there tonight. They already know you‚Äôre out of prison. If you don‚Äôt show up, the rumors will only grow worse, and more people will be disgraced than just you.‚Äù

My throat tightened. Memories of my old colleagues rose before me‚Äîpeople I had trusted, who had sat in silence at my trial, heads bowed, as if I truly had been the killer of my own child.

‚ÄúArizona,‚Äù Charlton said, taking my hand. ‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt been easy getting to where we are. If we can just get through this one time, we can start over. Once I‚Äôm promoted, I‚Äôll apply for a deputy director position abroad. Then, we can be together, won‚Äôt we?‚Äù

First the threat, then the sweetness. His hand in mine pulled me back to memories of the countless nights we had leaned on each other in our tiny rented room.

My fingers clenched around the suit until my knuckles turned white. My voice was hoarse when I whispered, ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt care about his promises. I only thought that maybe tonight I would find a clue‚Äîsome piece of the truth buried five years ago.

Soon, night fell.

I stepped into the party hall, glittering with crystal lights. Before I even reached the table, whispers began to cut at my ears.

‚ÄúDang. Arizona is so shameless. Her child died under her care, and she‚Äôs still living under Dr. Cohen‚Äôs house.‚Äù

‚ÄúDr. Shanahan is so kind. If it were anyone else, they would have kicked that cursed woman out long ago.‚Äù

My chest tightened, but I forced my steps forward.

At the head table sat Charlton and Mariam, side by side. He listened to the harsh gossip without denying a word.

Mariam's lips curved slightly; she sipped her red wine at leisure, her laugh clear. ‚ÄúDr. Crumpler has nothing after leaving prison. If she were on her own, she‚Äôd probably starve. Fortunately, I‚Äôm softhearted. I took pity and kept her on as a nanny.‚Äù

At once, the crowd around her chorused with flattery.

‚ÄúYou really are so generous, Dr. Shanahan!‚Äù

I searched for a place to sit, but someone sneered nearby. ‚ÄúLook‚Äîthe housekeeper dares to show up. Does she have no shame?‚Äù

Before I could speak, Mariam smiled brightly and answered for me. ‚ÄúDr. Crumpler is here to apologize to me.‚Äù

A man jeered, ‚ÄúThe esteemed Dr. Crumpler apologizing? For falsely accusing Dr. Shanahan five years ago? How will Dr. Crumpler apologize?‚Äù

Mariam tilted her head toward Charlton with a mock-sweet expression.

Charlton lowered his gaze, his voice stripped of warmth. ‚ÄúShe will beg for Mariam‚Äôs forgiveness. Arizona, come and apologize.‚Äù

I stared at him in disbelief. How could he say such a thing? He wanted me to apologize to my enemy?!

Mariam clapped lightly, laughter chiming. ‚ÄúHow could I bear such a gesture? Why not let her show everyone how she lived in prison?‚Äù

The crowd erupted in mocking laughter. My face was drained of color, but before I could refuse, a voice bellowed from the back.

‚Äú0528!‚Äù

My body froze, then straightened by reflex. Without thinking, I shouted, ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù

For a breath, silence blanketed the hall. Then, the laughter swelled into a roar. The sound coiled around me like a venomous snake. One after another, they called out my number.

‚Äú0528, apologize!‚Äù

‚Äú0528, crawl like a dog!‚Äù

My teeth ground together as my whole body trembled. But when I tried to resist, Charlton leaned close and hissed into my ear, ‚ÄúMake Mariam happy. If you don‚Äôt, I will never tell you where your son is buried.‚Äù

My heart was torn open. My son‚Ä¶ My one weakness.

My vision went blank. My body moved on its own. I sank to my knees, my palms slapping against the cold marble.

With that, applause and laughter exploded around me.

Someone pushed further, smirking. ‚Äú0528, strip!‚Äù

Charlton‚Äôs face flickered with unease, but before he could stop me, I had already torn my skirt open with a sharp motion.

The light fell not on glamour, but on the jagged scars etched across my skin‚Äîmarks carved by years of prison beatings.

Finally, the hall froze into silence.

Charlton‚Äôs pupils shrank. He sprang to his feet, stripping off his coat and wrapping it tightly around me before dragging me toward the exit.

In the restroom, he shoved me against the washbasin, his voice hoarse with fury. ‚ÄúHave you no shame, Arizona? People tell you to strip, and you obey? Where the hell is your dignity?‚Äù

I stared at the hollow-eyed stranger in the mirror, then let a cold smile curve my lips. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this what you wanted? Didn‚Äôt you tell me to obey them?‚Äù

He stiffened.

I raised my gaze, my voice hollow. ‚ÄúNow, tell me where my son‚Äôs grave is.‚Äù



Chapter 4

Arizona‚Äôs POV

Charlton‚Äôs expression froze, panic flickering in his eyes.

Five years ago, I had been proud as an eagle, brilliant enough to be called the prodigy of neurosurgery. How had I fallen so low?

Suddenly, he wrapped his arms around me, his voice shaking.

‚ÄúArizona, I-I‚Äôm doing this for our future. As an anesthesiologist, I can‚Äôt get promoted easily. This opportunity‚Äîif I pass it up now, we‚Äôll lose everything. Please, just bear with me a little longer, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúBear with it?‚Äù My throat churned. I shoved him away and lurched toward the sink, heaving violently.

My stomach revolted, and even the metallic tang of blood rose in my mouth. Nausea crawled into my bones.

Charlton‚Äôs face went ashen. He was about to grab me when a piercing scream cut through the corridor.

‚ÄúLuca! Luca, what‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù

I stiffened and looked up.

Mariam was holding the little boy, crying and shaking him. His face was deathly pale, his lips blue. He managed in a thin voice, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I drank the milk the nanny gave me today. My stomach hurts‚Ä¶‚Äù

My thoughts exploded.

Milk?! I had never even touched that child!

At Mariam‚Äôs words, her expression changed instantly. She lunged toward me and slapped me across the face.

‚ÄúArizona! How could you be so heartless? Because of my mistake, you lost your child back then, and now, you want to poison mine on purpose?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not me!‚Äù I screamed, hoarse and frantic.

But no one listened.

Even Charlton‚Äôs eyes flashed red. He shoved me away so hard I slammed into the sharp corner of a table. In an instant, pain shot through my waist, and for a moment, I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Everything blurred. I saw only Charlton scoop Luca into his arms and rush toward the hospital doors. Mariam, frail with weeping, stumbled after them.

People around me looked at me with nothing but disgust and contempt.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the doctor‚Äôs conscience?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a monster‚Ä¶‚Äù

They hurried after Charlton‚Äôs car. In the confusion, someone pressed a scrap of paper into my palm.

I clutched my waist with both hands, trembling from the pain. Before I could catch my breath, one of Mariam‚Äôs bodyguards grabbed me and hauled me toward the exit.

I shoved the paper into my bra.

The corridor outside the operating room went silent as the doors closed, cutting off the world.

Mariam leaned weakly against Charlton‚Äôs chest, sobbing until her tears fell like spring rain. He held her, his brow knitted tight.

There they stood‚Äîlocked in each other‚Äôs arms‚Äîperforming a scene for everyone: a devoted couple, bereft of their child.

I pressed my back against the cold wall and let a bitter, ironic smile tug at my lips.

This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous!

Everyone was calling me a cruel mother, accusing me of killing a child.

Yet Mariam, to frame me, had coaxed her own son into drinking milk laced with something.

The so-called motherly love in her eyes was nothing more than a weapon.

What was even more absurd was how badly Charlton‚Äôs clumsy lies had already unraveled. That child was clearly Mariam‚Äôs blood!

A suffocating ache swelled in my chest. I suddenly remembered a scene from five years ago‚Äîthe day I had accidentally seen Mariam forcibly kiss Charlton.

Around the corner of the corridor, under the cold white lights, Mariam had stood on tiptoe, gripping Charlton‚Äôs sleeve as she kissed him.

He said he rejected her, but his body was rigid and he did not pull away. His gaze flickered, and he even leaned in slightly, as if accepting her intimacy.

At the time, my blood boiled, but I forced myself to swallow my anger.

For the sake of my child, I did not want to tear our marriage apart.

I also knew that Mariam, though merely an assisting doctor, was the hospital director‚Äôs daughter. We could not afford to offend them.

But later, those two‚Äîthose monsters‚Äîhad been together. They were the ones who killed my child and pushed me into the abyss!

My fingertips went cold as I tightened my fist.

I unfolded the scrap of paper hidden against my chest. My heart lurched when I read the shaky handwriting.

\[If you plan to overturn the case, I‚Äôm willing to be a witness. The silence of five years has tormented me. I‚Äôm sorry.\]

Tears pricked at my eyes at the sight of the crooked, slanted characters. After being shrouded in darkness for so long, in that moment, I finally saw a sliver of hope.

With a witness, in five days, our chances of winning would be a little better.

Suddenly, all the humiliation I had endured that night in the party hall‚Äîthe forced kneeling, the degradation made into a spectacle‚Äîseemed trivial.

Soon, the operating-room lights went out.

The doctors emerged with solemn faces. One of them told Mariam, ‚ÄúThe gastric lavage went smoothly. The child‚Äôs life is saved. However, during the procedure, we found abnormalities in his brain. We suspect a glioblastoma. We‚Äôve sent samples for further testing. Even with surgery, the success rate for this kind of lesion is very low‚Äîless than thirty percent.‚Äù

As soon as the words fell, the air suddenly chilled.

Mariam‚Äôs face was drained of color. She shook her head and muttered, ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ Luca is so young. How could this be‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her body went weak, and she nearly collapsed. Charlton immediately held her up.

While no one was paying attention to me, I crushed the scrap of paper into a ball and, with deliberate calm, I swallowed it.

‚ÄòThere are only a handful of surgeons in the country qualified to perform this operation. And I‚Ä¶ am one of them.‚Äô

Chapter 5

Arizona‚Äôs POV

Of course, Charlton would think of me first.

He seized my hand so hard it hurt, desperation burning in his gaze. ‚ÄúArizona! You have to do it! You can save Luca, can‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Mariam‚Äôs soft, sympathetic mask shattered completely. She lunged forward, yanking at my collar, her eyes bloodshot and feral. ‚ÄúArizona! You must save my son‚Äîor I‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù

A bitter, hollow laugh escaped my throat. Slowly, I took off the glove I‚Äôd been wearing.

Under the harsh white light, my right hand was a map of winding scars. The fingers were stiff and twisted, long since robbed of the fine dexterity needed for surgery.

I smiled, and the smile cracked as tears spilled down my face. ‚ÄúMy hand‚Äôs been damaged for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou forgot?‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúFive years ago, you were the ones who damaged it!‚Äù

Mariam‚Äôs face went ashen.

Charlton‚Äôs pupils tightened, his breath coming fast and shallow. He stared at me as though he couldn‚Äôt believe what he was seeing. ‚ÄúYour hand‚Ä¶ Is it damaged? That can‚Äôt be! Why didn‚Äôt anyone tell me?l

He looked frantic, as though he were hearing this for the first time. The pain in his eyes made my skin crawl.

Mariam snapped. She threw herself at me and screamed, ‚ÄúNo! No! You can‚Äôt run away from this! You have to save my child!‚Äù

She signaled to the bodyguards to pin me down. They tightened their grip, forcing me to the spot, while she shrieked like a woman possessed. ‚ÄúTeach us! You must teach the procedure! Whoever can perform it will do. Just save Luca!‚Äù

Grinding my teeth, I answered coldly, ‚ÄúI will teach. But only if you give me the surveillance footage from that operation five years ago.‚Äù

Her expression shifted like a storm. Her fists clenched, her eyes burned with hatred so sharp it seemed almost crimson.

Then, in a sudden, calculated move, she turned to Charlton and wrapped her arms around his neck.

In front of me, she kissed him hard, lips pressing like both accusation and bargain.

Her voice dropped into his ear. ‚ÄúCharlton‚Ä¶ if Luca survives, the whole hospital will be yours. Help me. Please‚Ä¶‚Äù

I watched Charlton change. First came a flicker of uncertainty, then a settling quiet, and finally a cold, absolute hardness.

He reached out and pressed his hand onto my shoulder with ugly decisiveness. ‚ÄúI know what to do,‚Äù he said flatly.

Before I could gather myself, they dragged me‚Ä¶ to my son‚Äôs grave.

The night wind tore through the cemetery. Stones gleamed cold and merciless.

Before I could fall to my knees at the graveside, hands forced me down until they struck the hard earth.

Mariam took out a tablet from her bag with deliberate slowness and held it in front of my face, a smile curving at the corner of her mouth. ‚ÄúYou wanted the footage from five years ago? Then, watch.‚Äù

At the same time, Charlton gave an order. Men hefted tools and began to dig at the tombstone.

His voice was brittle with indifference. ‚ÄúArizona, I‚Äôll give you one more chance. Teach us a doctor who can operate, and I won‚Äôt disturb your son‚Äôs ashes.‚Äù

Blood ran cold through me. My body trembled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane, Charlton! That is your own child‚Äôs remains! How can you do this? How can you deny him peace in death?!‚Äù

His gaze flickered. He spoke again, his tone calm and hard. ‚ÄúTeach, or watch his ashes dug up.‚Äù

Mariam‚Äôs smile was sweet but sharp as a blade. She pressed play.

The nightmare from five years ago unfolded on the screen.

My son‚Äôs breath faltered on the operating table. The monitor recorded every misstep, every manipulated moment of that disaster.

It was the rawest wound of my life.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I screamed, my voice breaking. I tore and thrashed, but the hands holding me were iron; they pinned me so I could not move.

The footage replayed again and again, each loop slicing into my chest like a knife.

In the background, the steady ring of shovels striking earth grew heavier with every blow.

Madness crawled at the edges of my mind. Tears blurred my vision until everything smeared.

‚ÄúStop! I‚Äôll teach! I promise‚ÄîI‚Äôll teach!‚Äù The plea ripped from my throat, ragged with desperation.

Charlton raised his hand, and his men froze.

Mariam, smiling with almost pleasant cruelty, paused the tablet. The image froze on my child‚Äôs final pale face.

She leaned close, towering over me with mock tenderness. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this better?‚Äù she whispered, sugar-smooth and merciless. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd behaved like this sooner, none of this would have happened.‚Äù

My body shook so violently I could barely breathe. Tears fell, each one a cold drop on the hard earth.

They had taken everything from me five years ago.

Now, five years later, they dragged me back into the same burning pit of despair.

But in the hollow of my heart, something snapped alive.

I fixed Mariam with a gaze full of the long-buried hatred I had nursed for years.

My voice was hoarse but steady. ‚ÄúI have one condition.‚Äù

Charlton‚Äôs face hardened instantly. He frowned as if staring at a lunatic. ‚ÄúYou still dare to make demands?‚Äù

Hatred rose in my eyes, years of suppression surfacing in a sharp, exacting edge. ‚ÄúYes. My condition is that I divorce you right now. Sign the papers, and I will teach you how to perform that surgery.‚Äù

Silence crystallized around us. For a moment, the world felt suspended.

Mariam blinked, then a sickly euphoria lit her face. She nodded as if it were the sweetest bargain imaginable. ‚ÄúFine. A deal like buy-one-get-one‚ÄîI can‚Äôt say no to that.‚Äù

Charlton‚Äôs jaw worked, but he said nothing.

Soon, the divorce agreement was presented and placed in front of me.



Chapter 6

Arizona‚Äôs POV

The moment my pen touched the paper, my fingertips trembled slightly, but I did not hesitate.

As the nib cut across the line, I felt the last shackle around me snap with a dry click.

A sudden, intoxicating illusion of freedom washed over me.

I folded the agreement carefully and pressed it to my chest, as if shielding the last thread of my dignity.

Charlton looked at me as if he wanted to say something, but then stopped. His eyes carried an emotion so tangled it felt almost foreign. I no longer cared to untangle it.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù I said, my voice cold.

Mariam escorted me down the corridor and into the ward. The white ward door was locked. Her tone was ice as she said, ‚ÄúYou will not step out of here until you train someone who can perform that operation.‚Äù

I did not struggle.

They did not know that I had never intended to teach that surgery to them in the first place. Five years ago, when my son was still alive, I had already wanted to take on an apprentice. I wanted to save more patients, but there simply had not been time.

For five years, I fell asleep only after running the operation step by step in my head, terrified that I might forget. What was happening now was only me fulfilling the mission I had set for myself sooner than planned. By the time I was released again, my spirit would already be frayed.

Luca‚Äôs surgery was scheduled for three days from now.

That night, Charlton and Mariam returned home, something that rarely happened.

‚ÄúDr. Crumpler, go cook,‚Äù Mariam ordered as she flung her bag onto the sofa without room for argument. ‚ÄúA nanny should act like a nanny.‚Äù

I answered calmly, ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù and turned toward the kitchen.

Charlton suddenly spoke in a low voice as I stepped away. ‚ÄúArizona, you and Mariam should get along from now on. As long as you obey, this home will always be yours.‚Äù

My steps halted, and my fingers stiffened.

We had both been orphaned. Every coin we had scraped together had bought that house, and in his mouth it became a place I could only temporarily occupy so long as I obeyed.

It was ridiculous.

It was absurd.

It was disgusting.

I said nothing and kept walking to the stove. Charlton seemed to want to explain. ‚ÄúI have had our son‚Äôs grave moved and rites performed. It will not bother him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI am cooking,‚Äù I cut him off flatly.

Soon, Mariam hooked her arm through Charlton‚Äôs and dragged him into the bedroom with a laughing, possessive air. Their murmurs rose, then fell into the rhythm of the bed, breathy and intimate. Steam from the pot blurred my vision as I stared at the bubbling food, but my expression did not shift. I felt like a block of stone.

When the sounds stopped, Mariam emerged in a bathrobe, satisfied, padding in slippers while casually tossing her hair. She lifted a bowl of soup, took a sip, and spat it back with disgust. ‚ÄúThis is awful,‚Äù she sneered.

Charlton, however, picked up his chopsticks, tasted a bite, and froze for a moment. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶‚Äù he murmured, then bowed his head and ate, one mouthful after another. He polished off the entire table of food. I did not even twitch an eyelid.

Late at night, sleep settled over the house, and the steady rhythm of snores filled the rooms. I opened their bedroom door without a sound. Mariam slept deeply, and a tablet on the bedside glowed quietly. As my hand reached for the tablet, the corner of my eye caught the trash bin.

Several used Durex had been balled up and tossed inside.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest, as if someone had driven a needle into me. I did not linger. My fingers moved quickly, copying the surveillance videos from the tablet one by one.

When I finished, I packed the divorce papers and my son‚Äôs keepsakes carefully into my bag. I did not look back. I did not linger. I slipped out of the villa that had once been ours. The night wind was bone-cold, but my mind had never been clearer.

At the street corner, I pulled out my phone and sent the copied videos to Alan in one hurried burst. My fingers trembled as I hit send.

\[Evidence found. I have witnesses.\]

\[Prepare for court, Atty.\]

At that moment, Charlton and Mariam were sleeping soundly, unaware that earlier at our son‚Äôs tomb, I had replayed the video she had planted over and over until I was certain it proved she had intentionally swapped the infusion. They did not know it had taken me four years to master the glioblastoma surgery. Even if the hospital doctors understood the theory, it would take them a long time before they could perform it in practice.

When Alan replied, I allowed myself my first quiet, easing smile.

‚ÄòMariam and Charlton, go to abyss together!‚Äô

1np3fpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1np3fpo/dmz_ccz_jsa_23_tunnels_observatories_which_one_to/,"DMZ, CCZ, JSA, 2&3 Tunnels, Observatories? Which one to visit?","Lots of people want to see North Korea when visiting Seoul so I thought I would write a post about my tour visits to all of these different locations along the border as it is a popular trip while visiting South Korea. I‚Äôm English and have lived in SK for the past year and this is the trips I most wanted to do while living here. Enjoy¬†¬†

DMZ- The most popular trip is the DMZ near Paju (imjingang) about 50km NW of Seoul. Here you have the 3rd Tunnel, gondolas to Camp Greaves and the Dorasan Observatory. It‚Äôs great for a day trip and more of a theme park as they have fairground rides and attractions to see. You can see North Korea from the Observatory but in my opinion it‚Äôs not the best view and the rooftop is closed so you can‚Äôt access the telescopes and you‚Äôre not allowed to take photos towards NK. Take binoculars if you want to see NK clearly. The monorail to the tunnel is currently closed and no cameras or electronic items in the tunnel allowed¬†

JSA- The best place to see North Korea up close and personal is The JSA (Joint Security Area - Panmunjom) where the blue buildings are that span both sides of the border. Mr Trump met Mr Kim here is 2019 but unfortunately the JSA is currently closed due to rising tensions. I visited a few years ago before it closed and was a great experience to go into the blue buildings and cross over the line into North Korean side. I hope it will open again soon as I want to visit again. Last time they had a duty free shop but that‚Äôs now closed apparently.

Observatories- there are several observatories with views over North Korea. Aegibong, Odusan & Gangwha. These Observatories are all fairly close to Seoul and good for a day trip. My Favourite was Aegibong as the views of NK where the most impressive- I could see people working in the fields, school & apartments. This is a popular place for Insta photos as there is a Starbucks coffee shop in the Observatory that overlooks NK. There are good telescopes here and you can take photos towards NK. Other observatories have views over NK but not as much to see or as clear - IMO.

2nd Tunnel - the 2nd Tunnel is in Cheorwon - 100km NE Seoul and is part of a bird sanctuary so it is not as accessible as the 3rd Tunnel and you really need a private tour or private car to do this trip. The 2nd tunnel is much longer than the 3rd Tunnel and a bit more space inside if you‚Äôre claustrophobic.

CCZ - stands for civilian control zone so anytime you get close to the DMZ you will probably pass through a military checkpoint and they will check your passport/South Korean ID. So always carry them.¬†

A lot of these trips I did with Mrs Kim a Seoul tour guide as she specializes on DMZ history. (Seouljollytour) - thank you¬†¬†and I hope you enjoy these as much as I did. I plan to do East coast of SK soon as there are a few locations that side of the Country.

Out of 847 applications they received for a Python Developer role, only 127 made it past their ATS to human eyes.

720 resumes ‚Äì from real people with real skills ‚Äì never got seen.

Here's the brutal reality of what happens:  
ü§ñ¬†Second 1-3:¬†ATS scans for file readability. Creative PDFs with graphics? Rejected.  
ü§ñ¬†Second 4-10:¬†Keyword matching begins. No ""Python"" in your skills section when the job asks for it? Gone.  
ü§ñ¬†Second 11-15:¬†Format parsing. Tables and columns confuse the system. Your beautiful design just killed your chances.  
ü§ñ¬†Second 16-20:¬†Job title matching. You're a ""Software Craftsman"" but they searched for ""Software Engineer""? Filtered out.

The whole process takes 20 seconds. Your 5 years of experience, your GitHub contributions, your side projects ‚Äì none of it matters if you don't pass this robot test first.

But here's what actually works:  
‚úÖ Simple .docx files with standard fonts  
‚úÖ Clear section headers: ""Technical Skills,"" ""Professional Experience""  
‚úÖ Keywords from the job description sprinkled naturally throughout  
‚úÖ Job titles that match what they're actually searching for I know it feels defeating. You shouldn't have to game a system just to get your foot in the door.

But until companies change their screening process, we have to play by the robot's rules first ‚Äì so we can eventually talk to the humans who matter.

The good news?¬†Once you know how ATS works, you can beat it. Your skills haven't changed ‚Äì you just need to present them in a language robots understand.

Have you ever wondered if your resume got stuck in ATS hell? What's been your biggest frustration with the application process?

I know this is probably the most asked question here. . .I think, but every search I've tried, every video, artical, all of them just leave me confused on where to start.

Like all universes, it started out small and was a alt of game series I and my GF enjoyed (no judging, it was cringe) but now after about 10 years, the ideas and stories and everything of it has blown out into a massive place. It's a blend of a lot of different Punk genres, a bit of space travel and a magic system that's made to clash with technology. 

We've rough ideas for about maybe 5 book series (Well, more of manga inspired web novel) what we what to do, charaters, places, powers, a timeline that stretches back to the very universal foundation! . . and a little ball of miasma that keeps eating all the coffee cups. . . anyway

I want to write this out and plan this all out in detail, but any attempt ends up derailing down several connection rabbit holes and I end up in a self enduced Nacho cheese doritos coma, putting it off again and again until I hate myself for ignoring it

I am looking for the master, the boss, king, smartest bug dude in the universe for an ID, even advice in the ball park would be helpful at this point. I am moving in 10 days and worried that whatever has been bothering us will travel with us, that would an absolute disaster.

You'll see my earlier posts. Have been renting a furnished apartment that has lots of timber - furniture, decor, hardwood floors. Right near beach, I didn't realise when signed the lease, quite damp, moisture, high humidity.

The timber has changed colour, darkened, burl growth. brittle, cracks, the fill in between floorboards, caulking to kitchen joinery and floor and tiles to benches or floor deteriorates rapidly. Random small marks on walls appear. Some kind of tiny tiny ants (earlier post) have been found in bathrooms, kitchen and at skirting to carpet, not sure what species they are, always dead when found, possibly from the many sprays. Outside, concrete cracks, stairs up against exterior walls, seperate with gaps, render peeling.

The 2 pugs and I are bothered by something, worsens afternoon/evening. Super weird as it is almost like something drops from ceiling/near us/or jumps, tiny, invisible sticky web/filament/spiral, often bad smell.

Cannot see any bugs but whatever it is I appear to be allergic (I am to some mosquitos and moths) - if gets on my skin, red hives in a small patch, not a sting or bite, itchy, like an allergic reaction, hives and redness disappear after 10 minutes or so. Dogs are constantly rubbing their fur for relief. Happens everywhere in the house, worse in kitchen, living and even in bedroom. Now in my car, have had it detailed twice, a week later, its back. I often wear a hat.

If aircon on or doors, windows open, possibly  airborne in wind/draft, worsens then too. I feel hostage to this, only wish to know what it may be so can consult with dermatologist and do whatever I can to ensure my clothes, contents aren't affected and so that with moving it doesn't come with us.

Promise I am not delusional, I am no expert, wear glasses, eye sight not great, terrible photographer, but convinced it's a bug - wood and humidity related.

Please help and much thanks to all Obi-Wan of Bugs. I appreciate any advice on ID.

I work a laborious job in HVAC and am into weighted calisthenics, weight lifting and sports like basketball, tennis and rollerblading.

I stay active but try to sleep early every night because I need to be at my job for 7 AM.. So I tend to get to bed around 8:30-9 and be up for 5:30.

Like a lot of other guys maybe, I was curious this summer about giving myself a testosterone boost.. I'm a lifelong natural and thought Tongkat Ali would be the middle ground between doing nothing and full blown steroids, which I'd probably never consider.

I bought some Tongkat Ali and some quality Tribulus. Started taking them first thing in the morning with my black coffee. (Protein + collagen shake with zinc and magnesium at night)

As expected things were pretty awesome for a while.. till around 3 months in of everyday dosing, I started feeling like my sleep was feeling less deep.. And my muscles started to flatten, and I started getting acne on my face and my hair started to thin out and my elbows started to ache and pop, and I started to dread every workout.. Back day was the worst for whatever reason. The dry eyes I got are a very notable side effect..     It's crazy how I noticed all of this but it didn't click that it could've been the test boosters, since in my brain, testosterone increase = optimization. Which probably is the case, just wish I didn't get greedy and cut the supplements before they backfired on me.

Did some anxious Google searching and I'm coming to the conclusion that I may have crashed my estradiol levels.. I know I'd need bloodwork to be sure but yeah I don't think I'll be getting any anytime soon but low estradiol makes the most sense to me..

Anyways I haven't taken any tongkat Ali or tribulus for 3 days now and am slowly starting to feel like myself again.. I shouldn't have underestimated this stuff.. If I ever do decide to mingle with test boosters again, I'll keep in mind cycling. Take this as a lesson!
