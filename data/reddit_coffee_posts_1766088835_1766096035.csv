I work in the hospitality industry, mainly a luxury hotel/resort in Visayas.

I have 2 licenses and titles next to my name.

I want someone who has the same outlook with me in life. Dating Filipinos is so tiring haha!

I want like-minded individuals, I may be extroverted but at the end of the day I like sitting in my camping chair and sipping coffee looking into the sea/beach (since I live near the sea for work purposes.)

I just want someone to connect with and when I say connect — a real genuine connection.

I’m coming from a non target background, and I’ve found that landing coffee chats with consultants in my target office has been tougher than I expected.

I’ve been thoughtful and intentional about who I reach out to, but I’m starting to hit the limits of the usual paths like alumni, friends, or obvious overlaps. At this point, there are only so many people left in that office I can reasonably contact.

For those who’ve been in a similar spot, how did you expand your outreach or get traction beyond the standard routes?

Any advice would really mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",2,1766095865.0,McKinsey_BCG_Bain,0,1.0,False

1pq3tlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristmasGiftIdeas/comments/1pq3tlw/the_most_consistently_recommended_gifts_on_reddit/,The Most Consistently Recommended Gifts on Reddit (Part 2)," A few days ago I posted about analyzing Reddit gift threads to find the most consistently recommended products. That post blew up and I got a few messages asking if I found anything else worth sharing.

  Short answer: yes, a lot.

  **What I did this time**

  - Ran the same Python script on the same communities (BuyItForLife, Gifts, GiftIdeas, and a few others)
  - Focused on alternative brands and complementary products to avoid duplicating Part 1
  - Products mentioned 10-40 times across different threads
  - Cross-checked everything for availability and current reviews

  **The results: 93 more products Reddit stands behind**

  **Tech alternatives people swear by**

  - Bose QuietComfort 45 (alternative to the Sony XM5 from Part 1)
  - Jabra Elite earbuds (AirPods alternative)
  - RAVPower and Belkin chargers (Anker alternatives)
  - JBL Charge 5 speaker

  **Kitchen gear that keeps showing up**

  - Ninja Foodi (air fryer mentions everywhere)
  - Breville Smart Oven
  - Le Creuset Dutch oven (expensive but mentioned constantly)
  - Wüsthof chef's knife
  - Fellow Stagg electric kettle (coffee nerds love this)
  - AeroPress (budget coffee option that punches above its weight)

  **Outdoor & adventure gear**

  - Osprey Atmos backpack (hiking-specific)
  - Hydro Flask and Yeti Rambler (water bottle wars continue)
  - Black Diamond headlamp
  - Arc'teryx and Smartwool (premium alternatives to Patagonia/Darn Tough)

  **Quality tools (beyond Leatherman)**

  - Victorinox Swiss Army knives
  - Klein Tools electrician sets
  - Milwaukee cordless drills
  - Knipex pliers

  **Work-from-home upgrades**

  - Herman Miller Aeron chair (mentioned in almost every ergonomic setup thread)
  - Autonomous standing desk
  - Logitech MX Master mouse
  - BenQ monitor light bar

  **What I learned from Part 2**

  **Reddit has *deep* benches**—for almost every popular product, there are multiple equally-loved alternatives

  **Price stratification is real**—some categories have clear budget/mid/premium tiers and Reddit recommends across all three

  **The ""alternative brand"" phenomenon**—for almost every top product, there's a highly-recommended alternative (Anker → RAVPower, Darn Tough → Smartwool, etc.)

1pq3soz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1pq3soz/i_was_experimented_on_by_the_government_now_im/,"I Was Experimented On By The Government, Now I’m Hunting Them. Pt2 (Remastered)","Lily let me crash in the back room of the diner.

Nothing special. A sagging cot, a metal shelf with a first-aid kit, a rattling space heater. But it was quiet. No black SUVs outside. No Division trackers pinging. No Carter.

For now.

I didn’t sleep much. When I did, the nightmares came.

Not about the things I’d hunted. Claws and teeth are simple. You can point a gun at those.

The worst nightmares were about me.

My skin shifting when I let my guard down.

My bones feeling like they weren’t set right.

The Revenant’s voice echoing in the back of my skull.

That thing inside you? It’s waking up.

I woke up sweating, heart racing, body aching in a way that felt wrong—like pressure, not fatigue. Like something inside me was testing how far it could go.

I stared at my hands in the dim light.

Flexed my fingers.

The skin felt too tight over the tendons. Not ripping. Just… off. Like it didn’t belong completely to me anymore.

You were never meant to be the hero, 18C. You were meant to be a weapon.

I closed my fists and forced my breathing to slow.

If I was going to war with The Division, I needed more than anger.

I needed a plan.

Two days passed. The diner stayed mostly empty—truckers, locals, nobody who looked twice at me if I tipped and kept my hood up. The constant was Lily, leaning on the counter between orders, watching me with that quiet, measuring stare.

“You’re not just some guy on the run, are you?” she said eventually.

I paused halfway through a bite of cold eggs. “Why do you say that?”

She nodded toward my side. Last time she’d seen it, the wound had been bad enough that I’d barely stayed upright.

Now it was gone.

“Those ribs were wrecked,” she said. “You should be hunched over, not sitting like nothing happened.”

I sighed. Put the fork down. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”

She gave a small, tired smile. “Try me.”

There was something in her eyes—more than curiosity. She’d seen things too.

“The government turned me into something that shouldn’t exist,” I said. “Now they want me dead.”

She didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“What kind of something?” she asked.

That was the problem.

“I’m still figuring that out,” I said.

She held my gaze a second longer, then reached under the counter and pulled out a worn leather notebook. She slid it over.

“I’ve been keeping track of things,” she said. “Stuff that doesn’t add up. Disappearances. ‘Gas leaks’ nobody reports. News stories that vanish after a day.”

I opened it.

Pages full of clippings, printed forum posts, blurry photos, coordinates, arrows, circled dates. Some of the locations made my stomach turn.

Halfway through, one entry stopped me cold.

Division Outpost 3 — Montana. Abandoned in 2019 after failed containment of subject. No official closure report. All digital records scrubbed.

I knew that place.

It was where I’d killed the Skinned Man.

My first mission.

In Division records, Outpost 3 had been shut down. Clean. Logged.

According to Lily’s notebook, it didn’t shut down.

It went dark.

“Where did you get this?” I asked.

“Public records. Some stuff from dead links. People who talk too much online.” She tapped the line. “Whatever happened there? The area’s a black hole. People go near it, they don’t come back.”

If The Division had really walked away from an outpost and wiped the paper trail, it meant one thing.

They were afraid of it.

“This,” I said, tapping the page, “might be where I start.”

“You sure?” she asked.

No.

But I nodded. “Sure enough.”

Montana was colder than I remembered.

The wind knifed through the trees, carrying the smell of frozen pine and old bark, with something sour underneath it.

Rot.

I tightened my grip on the steering wheel of the stolen truck. The engine rattled as I followed an old service road that barely existed anymore, headlights swallowed by low, creeping fog.

No streetlights. No houses. Just the road, the woods, and that familiar static behind my eyes.

The closer I got, the worse it got. Pressure built in my chest, like my lungs were being squeezed from the inside.

I knew that feeling.

I wasn’t alone.

I pulled into the clearing at 2:13 AM and killed the engine. Silence hit hard.

For a second, I just watched my breath fog the windshield.

Then I stepped out.

The outpost sat ahead of me.

Up close, it looked like a carcass. Concrete walls cracked and caved, rusted beams jutting up like broken ribs. What was left of The Division insignia clung to the entrance, peeled and faded.

The smell hit next.

Old blood. Mold. Chemicals.

And something else. Meat that had been left too long in a warm room.

I checked my gear—handgun, knife, flashlight, extra mags. A rifle wouldn’t help in a place like this.

Up close beats distance.

The main doors weren’t broken; they were peeled outward. Metal twisted like foil.

Something inside had wanted out badly.

I stepped over the threshold.

My flashlight cut through the dark. Dust floated in the beam. Footprints—turned to dark, flaking smears—trailed away from the entrance.

The air shifted around me, the smell changing with it. The walls almost felt like they were holding a breath.

No voices. No beeping machines. Just the quiet heaviness of a place that had seen violence and then been abandoned to rot.

I moved deeper.

Broken glass. Plastic shards. An ID badge face-down on the floor, the photo side ground away.

The feeling in my chest got tighter the deeper I went. Not fear—recognition.

This wasn’t just an abandoned base.

It was a grave.

An overturned desk blocked part of the corridor where the security station had been. I nudged it aside with my boot. Papers, a mug, a half-melted pistol.

Whatever had happened here, nobody left in formation. They ran.

From farther inside came a soft, wet drag. A sound you feel in your teeth more than in your ears.

I swung the flashlight down the hall.

Nothing.

The corridor forked.

Left went toward holding cells. I knew that much from old schematics I wasn’t supposed to have seen.

Right went toward the labs.

The drag had come from the left.

Every instinct told me to follow it.

I went right.

Whatever was in the cells wasn’t why this outpost went dark. The labs were.

The air grew thicker, humid and close. The smell of mold and copper mixing with a chemical sting that clung to the back of my throat. Water dripped from somewhere overhead, splashing into shallow puddles.

The hallway ended at a reinforced door.

Unlike the others, this one hadn’t been torn apart.

It was sealed.

A cracked terminal pulsed weak light beside it.

I pressed my palm to the biometric pad.

For a second, nothing.

Then:

ACCESS GRANTED.

Locks hissed. The door groaned open.

The lab was big.

Rows of tall glass containment tanks lined the walls, most of them shattered. Tubes hung loose. The overhead lights flickered in weak pulses.

The smell was worse here.

Rot. Chemicals.

And bodies.

At least a dozen Division agents slumped against the far wall, fused to it where their uniforms had melted into their flesh. Their faces were warped, frozen in mid-scream. Skin stretched too tight around their torsos, like something had swelled inside before they died.

I crouched next to the nearest one.

The veins in his arms were empty.

Not bled out.

Hollow.

Something had eaten them out from the inside.

I straightened and moved carefully through the lab.

At the far end, a secondary door hung halfway open.

Observation.

I stepped inside.

Monitors lined one wall. Most were dead. One still flickered, looping corrupted security footage.

I moved closer.

The timestamp read four years ago.

The view showed the lab I’d just walked through. Empty.

Then a figure stumbled into frame.

Lab coat. ID badge. His face was twisted with pain. Black veins stood out along his neck. He dropped to his knees, clawing at his chest.

His stomach bulged.

Something moved under his skin. Pushing. Squirming.

His ribs bowed and cracked.

He didn’t explode.

He opened.

His skin stretched and split in strips, peeling back. Bone bent aside. Something pulled itself free of him.

It unfolded on long, shaking limbs, too tall and thin. Its skin was translucent, dark veins moving under the surface.

Where a face should have been was a hollow cavity ringed with writhing tendrils.

The scientist’s empty body collapsed behind it.

The footage glitched.

Then jumped.

Now the lab was chaos. Figures running. Muzzles flashing. Things half-caught by the camera—tall, bending wrong, flesh flickering like it couldn’t decide on a shape.

More of them.

Dozens.

The video cut.

The monitor went black.

I listened to the fading hum of old power and my own pulse in my ears.

The Division hadn’t wrapped this place because they were done.

They lost.

A slow, wet dripping sound rolled in from the lab.

Thicker than water.

I turned.

Something clung to the ceiling near the broken tanks.

Limbs spread wide, fingers and joints hooked into the concrete, its shape folded into the shadows. Translucent flesh shivered slightly in my beam, veins shifting underneath.

It had been here the whole time.

Watching.

Waiting.

My gun was already in my hand.

It didn’t attack.

It uncoiled.

It lowered itself with awful control, limbs stretching, bones rearranging under the skin with soft cracking sounds.

Then it hit me.

Not physically.

In my head.

My own memories flashed—waking up in a metal room, gas in my lungs, my bones screaming as they changed, cold chemicals burning in my veins.

The thing’s hollow face tilted wider.

More memories came that weren’t mine. People splitting open. Tunnels made of meat. A sense of hunger that had never been fed enough.

My skull felt like it was going to split.

It knew me.

It recognized whatever The Division had put inside me.

I stumbled back a step, forcing my grip to stay tight on the knife I’d already drawn without realizing.

The whispers dug deeper, scraping at who I was, trying to pull pieces loose.

It thought I was like it.

Waiting to remember.

Heat flared through my veins.

For a second, something inside me wanted to answer.

I shoved it down.

The moment my stance shifted, it moved.

It dropped like a net made of limbs and bone, arms snapping toward my throat and head.

The world snapped into slow motion.

Everything sharpened. Every limb, every angle, every tendon stood out. I slipped under the first strike, turned away from the second, felt air brush my face where a bone spike should have been.

My knife flashed and bit into its side.

The scream that came out of it wasn’t a sound—it was pressure. A wall of voices, hundreds layered together, crashed into my skull.

My legs buckled. I hit the floor, ears ringing. It felt like my thoughts were getting shoved to the edges.

It pushed into my head.

I pushed back.

Not with anything special.

Just with that stubborn, ugly instinct that refused to let anything else take control again.

The pressure cracked.

The creature spasmed, limbs jerking out of rhythm.

I lunged.

I drove the knife into its torso and left it there as the flesh clenched around the blade. I grabbed one of its arms and ripped.

The limb tore free with a wet pop.

Black, thick veins pulsed and twisted at the stump, trying to regrow.

I grabbed a broken piece of pipe from the floor and drove it through its chest, hard enough to pin it to the wall.

Its scream shifted.

The confidence went out of it.

The body began to lose cohesion, shaking around the pipe. Limbs slackened. Edges blurred, like its shape was sliding off whatever held it together.

The whispers in my head shredded into nothing.

It shuddered once more and collapsed inward, shrinking until there was nothing there but a dark smear that faded into the air.

No body.

No blood.

Just absence.

I stood there, breathing hard, hands slick with whatever passed for its blood.

I looked down at myself.

Still me.

Skin wasn’t crawling. Bones weren’t shifting. My head was my own.

Whatever was inside me had moved—but it hadn’t taken over.

Not yet.

The Division thought this place was a graveyard.

It was a mirror.

Proof they didn’t understand what they’d made.

Proof I wasn’t just one of their experiments anymore.

I gave the lab one last look and left.

By the time I reached the truck again, the sky was just starting to lighten at the edges. I drove without stopping, letting the miles blur past.

Find Carter.

Make him talk.

Find out what I was before something else did.

I should’ve known The Division wouldn’t wait.

I was passing the ruins of a dead mining town when it happened. Boarded-up buildings, rusted equipment, the skeleton of a place everyone had already forgotten.

The world erupted.

A blast ripped through the truck’s front end. The steering wheel tore sideways. The airbag punched the breath out of me. We skidded off the road, metal screaming, into a ditch.

Then silence.

The cabin stank of burnt rubber and propellant.

Floodlights snapped on outside, all at once, blinding.

I reached for my gun.

A shock round hit center mass.

Electricity surged through me. Every muscle locked; my jaw clenched so hard my teeth screamed. I hit the ground outside the truck and couldn’t move.

Boots crunched on gravel.

“You should’ve stayed hidden, 18C,” Carter’s voice said somewhere above me.

Then everything went black.

I woke up strapped to a chair.

Cold metal. Tight restraints. No slack.

Bare room. Metal walls. Single light. No windows.

Carter stood in front of me, hands clasped.

He looked calm. Tired. Like this was paperwork.

I tested the restraints. Reinforced. Bolted down.

“Go to hell,” I said.

He smiled a little. “Eventually.”

He opened a folder on the table and turned it so I could see.

My own face stared back at me from a medical photo. Tubes everywhere.

Scans. Bone structure denser than normal. Brain activity flagged as “non-standard.” Metabolic charts that didn’t look human anymore.

“Project Revenant was never just about soldiers,” Carter said. “You weren’t the first attempt. You’re just the only one still pretending you’re a person.”

I said nothing.

He flicked his wrist.

A screen behind me came to life.

I twisted enough to see.

The diner.

Lily behind the counter, wiping it down.

My pulse spiked.

Carter tapped his wrist again.

The feed changed.

Her apartment. A sniper on a neighboring rooftop, rifle trained. A red dot hovered near where her chest would be if she walked into frame.

“You come back,” Carter said. “You work with us. Or she dies.”

I pulled against the restraints. Nothing gave.

They wanted me alive. If I was just a liability, they’d have finished it at the outpost.

Lily was bait.

I swallowed the anger and forced my voice flat.

“Fine.”

Carter’s eyebrows lifted. “Fine?”

“I’ll work with you,” I said.

He studied my face, then nodded, satisfied.

“Good. Let’s—”

I moved.

I threw my weight forward, snapping two of the chair legs. Momentum carried us both over. We hit the floor. He grabbed for his gun.

I hooked my ankles around his throat and yanked.

We crashed. The restraints bit into my wrists as I twisted, forcing my bones to slide just enough the wrong way for the cuffs to slip.

It hurt.

Didn’t matter.

My hands came free.

I tore his sidearm from its holster and pressed it to his head.

“Call off the sniper,” I said. “Now.”

“You’re—” he started.

I shoved the barrel harder into his skull. “Call. Him. Off.”

Carter exhaled, then hit his wrist comm. “Hold position.”

On the screen, the red dot vanished.

It didn’t make me feel better.

I shot him in the knee anyway.

The sound was loud in the metal room. He yelled, clutching his leg as blood spread across the floor.

I took his wrist unit and pulled up layout, cameras, exits.

We were underground.

Main elevator was a kill funnel.

Hangar bay.

Vent network.

The door flew open.

A guard stepped in, rifle raised.

I put a round in his throat before he finished aiming.

Another came in with a baton crackling. I stepped inside his swing, broke his wrist, slammed his head into the wall.

Alarms wailed. Gas hissed from vents overhead.

I grabbed a dropped mask, strapped it on, and ran.

The corridor was chaos—flashing red lights, sirens, echoing footsteps. I followed the map burned into my head. Left. Right. Up a flight. Vent access.

I kicked a grate open and pulled myself into the shaft. The gas made my arms feel like they were full of sand. Voices echoed through the metal below, too close.

I crawled.

Light seeped through the final grate.

I looked down.

Hangar.

A sleek black aircraft sat ready. Pilot in the cockpit. Two guards nearby with rifles slung.

I dropped down.

First guard’s throat collapsed under my elbow. Second grabbed for his gun; I put two rounds in his chest.

The pilot fumbled with the controls. I dragged him out and bounced his head off the console. He stayed down.

Rifles barked from the far end of the hangar. Bullets sparked off the hull.

I hit everything that looked like it should be hit.

The engines roared to life.

The plane lurched, then screamed forward. The bay doors opened just enough for us to blast through.

Then I was in the air.

Barely.

By the time the facility was a dark patch in the snow behind me, my hands were shaking.

Carter wasn’t dead.

But I was out.

For now.

I poured the last of the fuel into getting back to the diner. By the time I put the aircraft down in a clearing a mile away, the sky was starting to bruise with sunrise.

The woods around the roadside diner were too quiet.

I walked in through the front door.

Empty lobby. Chairs knocked over. Coffee burnt to sludge on the warmer. The air smelled like dust and something sour.

A sharp click sounded behind me.

I turned.

Lily stood in the kitchen doorway, shotgun raised.

She stared a second, then lowered it. “You look like shit.”

“Feels accurate,” I said.

Up close, she didn’t look much better.

She nodded at the mess. “They came looking for you. Said you were dangerous. I told them I’d never seen you before.” She shrugged. “Didn’t believe me. But they left.”

“They didn’t hurt you?” I asked.

“Not yet,” she said.

I moved to the window and scanned the tree line. The air felt heavy again, that same pressure digging into the back of my skull.

“What now?” she asked.

“We run,” I said.

“To where?”

I didn’t know.

Before I could answer, the lights flickered.

Outside, something moved.

At first, it was just distortion in the air. Then it stepped closer.

Tall. Thin. Limbs too long, joints bending wrong. Its skin looked like dead wood stretched over bone.

And it was covered in faces.

Human faces. Layered, stitched together, shifting as it moved. Some young, some old, some warped beyond recognition.

They slid over each other until one settled on top.

Mine.

Lily’s breath hitched. “Tell me that’s not—”

It smiled with my face.

“You are not the first,” it said, using my voice.

Glass shattered as the front windows blew inward. We ducked behind the counter. Shards rained over the floor.

The thing’s presence pressed into my head like cold fingers, probing.

You were built to be like us. Let go.

My skin crawled. I could feel something inside me twitch, like it wanted to answer.

“Got a plan?” Lily hissed, jamming shells into the shotgun.

“Yeah,” I said. “You’re gonna hate it.”

I scanned the ruined diner. No basement. One back door. Broken front. No way we both got out clean.

“We trap it,” I said.

“With what?” she snapped.

“Me.”

She stared. “Absolutely not.”

“If it gets both of us, that’s it,” I said. “If it gets me and you’re still breathing? You can make sure this doesn’t happen for nothing.”

The thing creaked across the broken glass, getting closer. The lights flickered again.

I shoved Carter’s communicator into her hand.

“Find him,” I said. “If he wants me that bad, use this to drag him into the open.”

She stared at it. “You’re insane.”

“Probably,” I said. “Still the best shot we’ve got.”

She looked like she wanted to argue.

Then she nodded once.

“Don’t die,” she said.

“I’ll try,” I said.

She slipped out the back.

I stood.

The thing waited in the center of the diner, limbs unfolding slowly. My face rippled across its features, eyes empty.

I stopped holding back.

The thing inside me, the speed and instinct I kept on a leash—I let it loose.

The world sharpened.

It lunged.

It came at me in a blur of limbs and teeth and open mouths. Faces tore and reformed as it moved.

I met it halfway.

We hit hard. Tables flipped. The counter cracked. The floor groaned.

I saw every opening. Every weak spot.

My fist punched into its chest, through fake ribs and pulsing tissue. I grabbed something solid and tore it free.

It screamed inside my skull, a blast of stolen voices trying to flood my head. It drove a tendril into my arm, trying to hook into my veins.

I yanked it out and didn’t stop.

I slammed my knee into its center, used the momentum to hurl it across the room. It smashed into the counter and tried to reassemble itself.

I was already on it.

I grabbed what passed for its throat—my own face buckling under my fingers—and squeezed until something cracked.

It clawed at me, raked across my side, but the pain was distant.

I dragged it across the floor and pinned it against the wall.

A broken length of rebar lay nearby.

I snatched it up and drove it straight through its skull.

The scream cut off.

The body convulsed, faces flickering in and out of existence.

Then it began to cave in on itself. Flesh blurred to shadow, shadow to nothing.

In seconds, it was gone.

Just me, the wrecked diner, and the ringing in my ears.

The thing in my blood burned hot, then cooled.

I was still me.

For now.

Headlights washed across the broken front of the diner.

Three black SUVs rolled into the lot.

The Division.

Doors opened. Men with rifles spread out, forming a perimeter.

Carter stepped out last.

He took one look at the destruction, at me standing in the middle of it all, and lowered his gun.

“Stand down,” he said.

The rifles lowered.

He walked closer, boots crunching glass.

“You won,” he said.

I didn’t reply.

His gaze flicked past me to where the creature had been, then back.

“We didn’t send that,” he said. “It was already tracking you when we picked it up on satellite.”

A cold weight settled in my stomach.

“What aren’t you telling me?” I asked.

He hesitated.

“You felt it,” he said quietly. “During the fight.”

I clenched my jaw.

Because I had.

That moment everything slowed. When I knew what it would do before it moved. When something inside me recognized it.

“We knew something was coming,” Carter said. “We just didn’t know when.”

He nodded at the woods.

“When we saw that thing moving straight for you? That’s when we realized it’s already started.”

“What has?” I asked.

For the first time, I saw it.

Fear in his eyes.

“Everything we’ve been hunting,” he said. “All the cryptids. All the anomalies. Every failed experiment. None of them were random.”

He gestured around us. “They were warning signs.”

Wind pushed through the trees, low and hollow.

“They’re waking up,” he said.

The words sat between us like a weight.

I wanted to walk away. Pretend none of it mattered.

But the pressure in my skull, the way the creatures had reacted to me—it all lined up too well.

“Then you’d better be ready,” I said.

He gave a humorless laugh. “You think I’m the one who needs to be ready?”

He shook his head.

“They’ll be coming for you, 18C.”

He turned to his men.

“Move out.”

The SUVs pulled away, tail lights vanishing into the dark.

I stood alone in the lot, glass crunching under my boots.

I’d survived.

I’d saved Lily.

I’d killed something wearing my face.

It didn’t feel like winning.

I looked at the treeline.

Something else was still out there.

And Carter was right.

It would come looking for me.

I found Lily an hour later.

She’d holed up in a small hunting cabin two miles off the road. One room. Old furniture. No tech. She’d ditched her phone and wiped down her truck.

When I knocked, a shotgun barrel poked out through the crack of the door.

Then she saw me and let out a breath. “You actually made it.”

“Still here,” I said.

She let me in and locked the door behind us.

“You okay?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “But I’m alive.”

She didn’t argue.

I told her about the mimic. About Carter. About his last warning.

By the time I finished, she was pacing, arms folded tight.

“They just let you go,” she said. “After all that?”

“Yeah.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” she said. “If they wanted you gone, they’d have done it. So why?”

“Because they think they don’t need to chase me anymore,” I said. “Because something worse is already coming.”

She stared at me for a long second.

“Then what do we do?” she asked.

I wanted to say “fight.” Go find whatever was waking up and put it down.

But you can’t hit what you can’t see.

“We go dark,” I said. “No phones. No cards. No patterns. We move. We get ready.”

She sighed. “Guess I’m officially on the run.”

“Welcome to the club,” I said.

We left that night.

Back roads. Cash. Cars we wouldn’t keep.

For a while, it worked.

But the same question kept circling in my head.

What’s waking up?

The things I’d hunted before were monsters, sure—but they were local. Self-contained. They didn’t feel like parts of something bigger.

Carter’s voice wouldn’t leave me.

They weren’t isolated incidents. They were warning signs.

Warning against what?

Lily glanced over at me from the driver’s seat one night as the highway stretched out ahead, empty and dark.

“You look like you’re solving math in your head,” she said.

“Trying to figure out the next move,” I said.

She drummed her fingers on the wheel. “If something bigger is coming, step one is figuring out what it is.”

I nodded.

Because if I understood what was waking up—

Then maybe I could figure out how to kill it

 It feels like we have a form of that survivorship bias here, where people who even think to come to this subreddit to give or receive advice probably struggle with the ADHD symptoms more and are less likely to have viable solutions and advice. I know that sometimes people go here just to find out they're not alone and that can help in other ways too. 

Sometimes I go here for solutions and advice, but this is a thought I regularly have about the content I'll find here.

 Doesn't mean every piece of advice won't work here, but the successful individuals with ADHD, if they already figured it out, they either may not have even thought to seek out this group in the first place, or would stop/reduce visiting this sub as it becomes less relevant due to having already formed working routines.

I know one successful unmedicated ADHD person and he manages just fine with coffee and stress. He's never been on this sub.

I don't really have anywhere to put it though, and I shared a list here last year and some people seemed to find it useful, so I'm doing it again!

 Let me know if I missed any! Hope this helps with the last-minute gifts. Merry Christmas!

1pq3pmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1pq3pmn/using_coffee_for_scrying/,Using coffee for scrying?,"Hey all! So I am still a pretty new witch and trying to nail down what I like to do for my practice. I have a strong interest in scrying, and would love to get started. Something I am drawn to, and feels right to me, is using coffee for scrying.

I make lattes every day. I dont really care about latte art, so I make no effort to do it. I pour the milk into the espresso very quickly and without care, and it usually swirls around and makes a random pattern if not just a bunch of foam. Sometimes after the swirling of the drink settles a second after I pour the milk in, I find patterns in them. Are *these* patterns an acceptable medium for scrying? To me, since I cant (and dont care to) control if I make them makes it an option, but since I am still learning I wanted to ask for the thoughts of other witches.

Also, either I am blind to the resource but I cant find any good short hand guides for meanings in scrying to help me get the hang of it. If anyone has a link or anything I would appreciate that as well!",1,1766095555.0,witchcraft,2,1.0,False

1pq3p6n,https://i.redd.it/ntzyajmqc18g1.jpeg,Free Early Access: I built Lumo a digital espresso recipe handbook & dialing helper web app,"Hello everyone
I’m Yan, a passionate home barista & IT guy
I recently built a web-based digital espresso recipe handbook (with smart features) that helps you keep track of your favorite recipes and learn to dial-in faster.
I made it because with every new bag I was in the same loop - I’d get close, change too much, forget what worked, and somehow dialing in cost me half the bag.
What Lumo App does:
1. Save recipes + shot logs (dose / yield / time / temp / grinder / notes, etc) so you can use the same recipe.
2. Full Recipe creator: snap a photo of the coffee bag or paste the roaster page URL, and it generates a solid starting recipe for straight espresso or milk based drinks.
3. Recipe optimizer: tell it …this tastes sour, bitter, astringent etc …and it suggests what to change and why (grind, ratio, temp,time) so you’re not guessing and wasting beans
4. Save your home, office or other equipment and link it to the recipes so you know exactly what you used.
+ more features and a lot more to come soon

Works on mobile, tablet & desktop so your recipes are always with you.

If you love coffee and want to check it out, I’m offering an early access for free for the first 100 users in the link below

Before this i had the blue bottle of nescafe and added vanilla or caramel, or even white chocolate syrup with 2% milk, or id use a flavored creamer. I obviously like a sweet coffee/latte lol. when trying all the pods, do i just make them how i normally would? i also have been mixing the espresso with milk and then pouring the mixture over ice. i just wasnt sure bc if i make them all the same way how will i know what pods i like or dont?

1pq3o30,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1pq3o30/smart_water_bottle_vs_smart_mug_whats_the_real/,Smart water bottle vs smart mug: what's the real difference?,"You've probably seen smart water bottles and smart mugs popping up everywhere lately. Both promise to make your drinking experience better, but what's the actual difference between them?

**Size and Capacity**

The most obvious difference is size. Smart water bottles typically hold 16-32 ounces, perfect for staying hydrated throughout the day. Smart mugs usually hold 8-14 ounces - great for coffee or tea, but you'll need refills if hydration is your main goal.

**Temperature Features**

Both devices can control temperature, but they work differently. Smart mugs focus on keeping your hot drinks at the perfect temperature - usually between 120-145°F. They're designed for beverages you sip slowly over time.

Smart water bottles often offer both heating and cooling options. Some can keep water ice-cold for hours, while others can warm it up when you want something hot. This makes them more versatile for different drinks throughout the day.

**Battery Life and Charging**

Smart mugs typically need charging every few hours because they're constantly heating your drink. Smart water bottles usually have better battery life since they don't work as hard to maintain temperature.

**Tracking and Apps**

Here's where smart water bottles really shine. Most connect to apps that track your daily water intake, send hydration reminders, and help you build better drinking habits. Smart mugs rarely offer this feature since they're focused on temperature control.

**Price and Value**

Smart mugs cost anywhere from $80-150, while smart water bottles range from $30-120. When you consider the hydration tracking features and larger capacity, [smart water bottles](https://athomewave.com/smart-water-bottle) often provide better value for your money.

**Which Should You Choose?**

If you're a coffee or tea lover who wants the perfect temperature every time, a smart mug makes sense. But if you want to improve your hydration habits while getting temperature control, a smart water bottle is the better choice.

Smart water bottles work for any beverage - water, tea, coffee, or even protein shakes. They help you stay healthy while offering the same temperature benefits as smart mugs.

stuff and ended up homeless and started living in a goverment provided hotel for 8 months we were never a wealthy family so this wasnt crazy situation my mother made it work with her 4 kids, we bounced around alot my mother left my father around when i was 10 our life was pretty normal paranormally never experienced anything really other then a creak or a bump at night nothing to write home about until we rented and moved into a town house in the city it all started pretty normal we had a date to see the house and we went it was more of a formality because at the time my mother was already sold on the house cause anything was better then the hotel the guy who showed us the house seemed rushed but we put it down to him being busy as soon as you walk in your in the living room theres a hallway across the living room going into a kitchen and the back door at the end of it bathroom door on the left of the hall way and basement on the right side at the end of the hall way there is a staircase going up to 4 rooms which consisted of another long hallway and a bathroom at the end of the hallway with 2 rooms on either side perfect for our big family he rushed us through showed us the living room the bathroom and he pointed at the basement door then as we were walking past the basement door to the kitchen and the rest of the house we heard a loud bang down stairs he immediatly said its most likely the furnace setteling but he seemd uneasy he showed us the rest of the house and we got the keys this was day 1  we moved our stuff in and got our beds through a refferal program my mom had found to help out struggling families they gave us some furniture for our rooms and some other odds and ends for our new homes now we all slept in our own rooms my friend came over he kind of stayed with us on and off in the hotel sleeping on the floor with us so he came and stayed in my room with me the next morning we woke up for me it was normal just a good sleep in our new house my mother woke up with some body aches she just put it down to her body adjusting to the new bed through out the day we had our cousin and his girlfriend come over to stay with us for a week they showed up it was normal nothing really happened that day we figured that they were gonna sleep downstairs and that was that that was day 2  the next morning this is where things picked up we had alot to share the following morning so my mothers body aches didnt get any better and she started to feel sick and get rashes my little brother he was a new born at the time was also not feeling good puking and had a drained look to him pale and queasy my younger and older sister both had night mares that night and my cousin had a very uneasy story to tell from there night they were scared to tell my mother at first but eventually they told her that in the night they woke up to something choking his girlfriend it was pitch black they said but they could still see something which they described as darker then dark us kids didnt get told this right away i was 12 gonne be 13 right away so i wasnt involved in coffee talk but my older sister was she was 15 going on 16 at the time but over the day we started to hear noises upstairs and down stairs up stairs sounded like our beds where getting moved around and then downstairs we heard bangs now this freakd out my mom it was a thing through out the day just random noises it kind of spooked all of us that when i found out about what happened last night with my cousin so my mom made us all sleep in the living room the following night in the day it was small quick noises it was dark outside now and the craziest thing happend we all were sititng in the living room getting ready to go to sleep then you start hearing a bunch of noise up stairs it was the beds again but this time it wasnt jsut a small move it sounded like they were all moving it went on for about 30 seconds we all just paused and listend when it stopped we were alll like wtf my sisters were scared i was scared but i was curious as to waht just happned me my mother and my older cousin he was probably in his early 20s all slowly walked down the hall way to the bottom of the stairs we called from the bottom of the stairs but nothing kind of dumb now that i think of it as if we were waiting for something to call back nothing did tho we went up stairs and sure enough all the beds in the room where either moved to the center of the room or displaced one of them was blocking the door now at this point my mom was in disbelief we all were we only seen this kind of stuff in the movies and we didnt believe it until that night we called around tried to get it do something else to make us feel less crazy but nothing for the rest of the night we all went back into the lving room i dont think i slept i was constantly waking my mother up telling her im scared she just kept telling me to go to sleep i eventually fell asleep i think when the sun came up and then its day 3 at this point we all knew something bad was in our house mom was still aching my baby brother was still super sick night mares where at a all time high now the only one i can recall being told about was a very unsettling one my older sister had a night mare the night after the beds which consisted of each one of us being dragged into the basement and thrown around until they stopped screaming my mom was struggling with episodes of sleep paralysis where she couldnt breathe she didnt tell me this till years later but as i was waking her up to tell her i was scared that night she was dealing with those episodes at the same time we spent most of our time outside in the car it was winter so we couldnt just go out to the park and we didnt have money to leave to a hotel my friend left after the first night after he heard about the choking incident but my cousins had to stay as they lived 16 hours away and took a bus to come see us my mom spent the day calling around to different churches trying to find someone to come help i leanred something that day that most churches dont beleiev in paranormal and they will call you crazy and to get mental help it wasnt until my mother called a pentacostal church and was basically begging/crying for help which  they said they cant come until the next day in the after noon  we went back into the house later in the day we all sat in the living room waiting for the next sound or bang but nothing my cousins decided they were gonna shower the only bathroom with a shower was upstairs they went to the bottom of the stairs we kind of did everything together in the house as everyone was to scared to stay alone so me my mom and everyone were standing at the bottom of the stairs and of course the classic paranormal thing the upstairs hallway light didnt work we they still decided to go up stairs thinkgin it burnt out well none of the lights worked upstairs  as they found out going down the hallway they got about halfway and siad it didnt feel right like something was watching them they screamed and came running back down stairs i didnt see it but there was a bed frame leaning against the wall and they said it got thrown at them i didnt quite believe it but when we went and check there was a dent in the wall that wasnt physically possible if it just tipped at this point we were all scared asf back in the lviing room my moms googling different things to protect yourselfs from spirits she came across salt being a barrier against the paranormal she grabs the salt and she rushes to block off the living room and the bathroom for us now this is the craziest part until this point me personally have only heard noises and seen the symptoms and heard things my mom puts a line of salt across the hall way she get about halfway across the basement door then all you hear is stomping coming up the stairs fast then a black shadow zip behind the couch we were all so scared at this point just huddled in a group staring at the couch we probably stood there for 15 minutes in pure silence waiting for something to happen nothing did my all kind of slowly crept back to our areas in the living room my mom wiped away the salt so it could go else where and not trapped in the living room with us and we all just were in shock my mother sat back down on the couch and insisted its alright its gone some time goes by and we were all jsut finally calming down after what we have just seen and all of a sudden you start to hear a rattle snake noise loud it was coming from behind the couch we all ran to the opposite side of the living room and the noise got louder and then the wall started looking like it was getting pushed out and cracks former where the studs are and then it stopped none of us got sleep that night pretty sure we all stayed awake until the next day as soon as it was light out we went to the vehicle and stayed in there all day until the priest showed up he introduced himself and talked to us about spirits demon entitys out side our house he blessed us as a family and then we all walked in he took us around the house he blessed every single room of the house with holy water commanding the what he called a demon to leave he stayed a bit inside the house after and then eventually left i shit you not the house felt better imediatly after my moms aches and pains were gonn my brother started to look better the following night the noises stopped and the night mares we continued to lice in this house for the rest of the year eventually moving for different reasons this was peak black ops 2 time i have alot of late night memories from there playing with my online friends telling them about the story but also how its all better now that we got a priest in and he blessed

1pq3go3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pq3go3/is_the_person_from_my_holiday_work_party/,Is the person from my holiday work party potentially interested?,"Here is my attempt at being coherent with my mind and heart still racing:

I was not notified of the party and was not shaved, lookong a bit rough and tumble as I work with mostly guys in a downtown district in a smaller city in New England. During this event, while I was getting finger foods, I noticed an absolutely beautiful person seemingly glace over casually multiple times. My coworkers somewhat jokingly attempted to play cupid by first confirming that she was not a daughter of any of the higher ups. Turns out she is working for a creative project for the city (potential Art/Design student, which is excellent and I thoroughly support). I kept my distance since I was too nervous and was not in the mindset to meet anyone. While I was in a separate room chatting with my coworker ( that has a large glass window where you can see directly into)  I glanced up, and at that exact moment she was walking through the room and we made eye contact once again. When she ended up leaving, I was in the corner of the main room chatting with two colleages. She looked directly at me and she even did a little 'hop' such as when one gets on their tippy toes for a brief period to get a better view of something. Yes, she could have been looking at/for someone else but based on our previous instances of fluttering/sustained eye contact, I perceived that she was looking at me. 

I was already acquainted with her creative project supervisor so I could potentially professionally propose a coffee meet or such and go from there. 
I do recognize that I lean slightly traditional in my approach and that I typically operate in a way on which potential partners have always sought me out. Also that some standards and approaches towards dating or meeting have shifted substantially in some regards. 

Should I attempt to follow up or just let this potential missed connection fly in the wind?

I am interested in finding my soul mate who ever it could be. I live a quiet life at this moment in my little duplex all by my lonesome. Not much to do this time of year besides indulge in my sedentary hobbies like movie/tv show collecting, gaming, or reading. I do also have physical activities I do when I can like jogging or cycling. I need to get in better shape and have all ready adjusted my diet as of late hopefully I’ll be in shape in no time! 

My personality is someone of curiosity. I enjoy learning about anything and would love to learn about you too! I find being able to have someone who is curious like me naturally is nice. I am also a shy person to people I don’t see too often or to strangers but once you get to know I will talk about anything. I enjoy good deep conversations because it’s how I bond with people in general especially someone I have romantic interests in! I am also a very abled bodied independent person so I am not diagnosed with absolutely anything, have my own car, and disposable income. 

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects. 

Other facts:

	◦	6 feet tall

	◦	fav color maroon

	◦	am a movie guy with a home theater system (also love documentaries)

	◦	 my fav move is twister

	◦	pepperoni is my fav topping on pizza

	◦	 coffee is the goat and so is unsweetened hot or ice tea sometimes with lemon

	◦	I do like being outside when it’s warmer but not in July as much (too hot sometimes)

	◦	Oreo ice cream/cookies and cream is the GOAT

A hand of cards, 

That’s how it all started. 

We spent years growing in friendship

Until you became a brother to me. 

We were family. 

Nearly a decade of playing games and hanging out.

All those late night O’Charleys talks, 

In the pursuit of sobering up. 

Going to Old Faithful for lunch just to

Sit on that patio and talk about the good and the bad in our lives.

Rolling dice past midnight,

just for my character to die anyway. 

I never thought you would be gone. 

I never thought I would lose the brother I chose. 

I always imagined you and I, 80 years old sitting across the table.

With our hands full of cards

While our wives sat in the living room drinking coffee. 

But here we are…

I doubt things will ever go back to the way they were. 

Realistically they can’t. 

I thought you knew me well enough to know I’m not a monster. 

I don’t even know what to say. 

Nothing I could would change anything. 

I do miss you big dawg.

I really do. 

Out of all of this. 

Losing you is what’s hit me the most. 

For not only did I lose you,

But we lost our future. 

But I guess that’s life,

And that’s the hand we were dealt. ",1,1766094681.0,Original_Poetry,0,1.0,False

I met a girl during one of my run club sessions. We were both wearing the same pokemon sweatshirt and we started discussing more about pokemon and other common interests and stuff. Things were going well, we kept meeting regularly for like the next 3-4 sessions and eventually I asked her out for a coffee.

I should also mention that I am 5'1"", and she was noticeably taller than me, as almost everyone I meet is. But I don't really care about it and I thought she didn't either.

Anyway, we went to a cafe and had a lovely time there. It was one of those cafes where you paint something on a clay object. After that we went on 3 more dates and things were going well. She decided to invite me to one of her friend's moving away party and I got to meet her friends. And that is where everything went downhill.

I got a lot of snide remarks from her friends. One mentioned that being around me must make her ""maternal instincts"" kick in. And I could feel her getting uncomfortable with all these comments and she basically stopped talking to me for the rest of the night. I asked her if she wanted me to drop her off and she said that she will find someone else. I insisted that it's fine and I can drop her off , but after she refused again I just let it go.

I texted her the next morning if she got back home and everything is fine and if I did something to upset her. I got a reply after 12 hours that she wants to end things.

It's so annoying because I know it was the height thing and maybe her friends which got in her head but I can't do anything about it because it's her choice. It's already hard meeting people who are willing to date somebody of my height but it gets infinitely harder when other people's opinions influence them. We had a great time before that wretched going away party.

Unfortunately, the illness has become too debilitating for Ms Tavener to continue in the giftware shop, forcing its closure. The shop's final day of trading will be Christmas Eve.

Ms Tavener founded the business in 2004 on Williamson Street, close to the Shamrock Hotel.

The business has grown in both size and design in the time since.

Her strong connection with the Bendigo art scene brought more than 100 exhibitions to the space over the ensuing years and showcased ceramics, painting, sculpture, printmaking and photography.

Ms Tavener, who was too ill to be interviewed, wrote a thank-you note to the community after years of support.

""I'm so sorry I can't be there to say hello to everyone. I have loved having bob boutique and meeting the wonderful customers, many of whom have become very special friends. I have always tried to do everything possible to support the community and have Bendigo made products. I already miss the shop enormously. I am hoping to be back online maybe in January. I love you all so much and thank you for supporting me for 21 years.""



Ms Tavener's mother, Gail, penned a loving letter highlighting the impact Bob Boutique has had on the community.

""The magic of Bob Boutique has tugged on our heartstrings for 21 years, bringing absolute delight to those who have passed through its doors,"" Gail said.

""People have loved the limited edition gifts and art based items in an ever changing, fascinating array of collections and exhibitions.""

Gail said her daughter's own labels - Sonia Brit Design, Cute Australia and bob hub - were the ""backbone"" of her vision and brought new ideas together through her own innovations.

Ms Tavener introduced local artists under the bob hub brand in the shop.

""Over the years she has created limited editions or ""one-offs"" of little squishy monsters, emergency ninjas and coffee monsters to larger Koalas, Teddy bears, owls, big ninjas and Vikings, just to mention a few,"" Gail said.

""These designs were made in Sonia's studio or at (her mother's) place.

""Sustainably, ethically and locally made has always been Sonia's objective.""

Gail said her daughter's last round of radiation was ""very tough"" and required her to be hospitalised for six weeks with a brain bleed.

Ms Tavener had suffered severe seizures, cognitive challenges, fatigue and serious mobility problems as a result of her brain cancer.

""She still tries to smile,"" Gail said.

Gail thanked her daughter's devoted partner Brian, Bendigo Health, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, the NDIS, family and friends for all their support.

A fundraising effort to support Ms Tavener in her continuing fight against brain cancer is now under way at Bob Boutique and will run from Thursday, December 18 through to Christmas Eve.",7,1766094382.0,Bendigo,0,1.0,False

I have tried various smell training kits over the last 12 months (0% smell detected) as well as very strong things from around the house, such as garlic, aftershave and ground coffee but I literally detect NOTHING. I was never told for certain whether my olfactory nerves were shredded, they just said ‘they could be’ and that ‘might be’ why I’ve lost my smell?!

Here’s the strange thing, I do still have SOME taste and enjoy food to a certain degree? It seems like most people who completely lose their smell also completely lose their taste? For me it’s just that I can no longer detect specifics really? For example, cherry soda and orange soda both taste the same, just like sweet fizzy drinks. Currys have  lots of TASTE but I can no longer describe the flavours, such as garlic, coriander etc?

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone here regained their sense of smell after TOTAL loss? If so, how long did it take and was it via smell training or just spontaneous?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Murray State Racers vs. Drake Bulldogs: A Tale of Offense vs. Defense (and Why You Should Bet on the Racers Unless You’re a Fan of Upsets)**

Let’s cut to the chase: **Murray State is the favorite for a reason**, and Drake’s “reason” is probably a really nice defensive résumé and a team that hasn’t lost to a school named *Indiana State* in its MVC opener. But let’s not let that fool us. This game is a clash of a **freight-train offense** (Murray State) against a **well-padded door** (Drake’s defense). Let’s break it down with the precision of a coach’s film session and the humor of a postgame press conference where a player accidentally calls the ref “a smooth operator.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The numbers scream **Murray State (-7.5)** as the pick, but let’s decode the math like we’re breaking down a pick-and-roll.

* **Murray State’s offense** is a points-per-game machine, scoring 90.5 (16th in college basketball) while allowing 78.5 (293rd). Their defense? Porous enough to make a sieve blush. But their **three-point shooting** (11.3 makes/game at 38%) is elite, and Layne Taylor’s 23-point explosion against Akron proves they can torch even decent defenses.
* **Drake**, meanwhile, is the yin to Murray’s yang: A **+137 scoring differential** (12.4 PPG) with a defense that allows just 68.5 PPG (80th nationally). Their offense? Respectable but not flashy (80.9 PPG), and their three-ballers hit 10.2 threes/game at 38.2%—statistically indistinguishable from Murray’s, but with less flair.

The **implied probabilities** from the odds (Murray at \~57%, Drake \~21%) suggest bookmakers see Murray as a near-coffee-flavored certainty. Drake’s +3.67 odds? That’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Bet on this team if you enjoy watching your money evaporate like a snowman in a sauna.”

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and That One Time Drake Beat Indiana State

* **Murray State** is riding a **four-game winning streak**, including a 15-point drubbing of Akron. Layne Taylor is their offensive engine, and with no injury reports to derail him, he’s as reliable as a microwave timer. Their defense? Wel

1pq35ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pq35ii/i_was_murdered_at_my_best_friends_wedding_now_im/,"I was murdered at my best friend's wedding. Now, I'm hunting that bitch down.","I HATED Astrid’s fiancé.

I know you should always respect your best friend’s choices, but Adam made it difficult. His family was rich, and I mean RICH. Initially, I actually liked him.

When Astrid first introduced us, he seemed like a pretty chill guy.

I think it was the way he spoke that enchanted me. 

Adam had a way with words, almost like everything he said was a song lyric. 

He was well-spoken, like he’d been chewing on a thesaurus, but I liked that about him. Adam was different from any guy I’d met. All of Astrid’s boyfriends had been questionable. Adam was different. 

He talked her through panic attacks and helped her with breathing exercises. 

He’d sprint to the store to buy an umbrella when the sky started to darken. 

He was everything I wanted to be if I was brave enough to tell her my feelings.

But this post isn’t about Astrid and me.

It’s about Adam and his family.

I’ve known Astrid since we were little kids. 

Astrid wasn’t just my best friend. 

She was my other half. My soulmate. 

I admit it, yes, I loved her more than she loved me. And I was planning on telling her that.

But life gets in the way, you know? 

I have a religious mother, so something as important and emotional as coming out meant a lot to me. It became even harder when she started getting serious with guys. Casual hook-ups turned into relationships that only lasted a few weeks or months because it was always the guy who suddenly turned on her.

She was always the metaphorical punching bag in these relationships, and I couldn’t fucking stand it. 

Oh, an old guy friend from school liked her Instagram post? Immediately, it was *her* fault.

Astrid was too nice. Too naive. I loved her, but part of me wanted to shake her and tell her that saying *no* was okay. 

She didn’t have to date these guys just to make them happy. 

Then along came Adam, who swept her away. Quite literally. 

The two of them met while we were studying in a Starbucks. 

I was trying to describe a TV show I’d been watching, using wild hand movements like I was playing charades, which had sent her into fits of laughter. Astrid was choking on her coffee, which made me laugh too. 

Those were the moments I treasured—just the two of us, hanging out and laughing over stupid shit.

I don’t know if it was my frantic hand movements or her hysterical laughter that caught his attention. 

Before I knew what was happening, Adam was crashing into our lives.

The guy sitting across from us, the one I’d glimpsed peeking over his dog-eared copy of Oedipus Rex, slid his chair over with an award-winning grin. 

His wide eyes were locked onto my best friend, and I didn’t blame him. 

Astrid reminded me of sunlight. 

I don’t think she was ever conventionally attractive; I just think I was in love with everything else.

She lit up every room she was in with just a smile and a laugh, and somehow, just her presence made me feel good.

In the beginning, I think that’s what drew Adam in.

Like a moth to a flame. 

Astrid was beautiful to me, but I think it was her smile, the way her entire body vibrated with laughter, that sealed the deal for him.The two of them exchanged numbers, and then Adam was suddenly a daily presence in our lives. Not just hers. Mine. Adam was pretentious, but in a “hot” way, according to Astrid. 

Yes, he could tell me with a straight face about all these artsy movies and that they were revolutionary, and Midsommer was a “spiritual” experience for him, but he could also sit and watch a comedy movie with us and laugh like an idiot. 

The three of us began hanging out.

It was fun. I liked his jokes, and his sardonic attitude. 

I liked his obsession with abolishing the patriarchy. I liked that he made Astrid smile, and she hadn’t once needed my support in public places.

Adam was always with her, holding her hand, talking about pretentious shit I couldn’t really understand. 

But I liked his voice. 

He had a lot of stories about vacations he’d been on, and his time at boarding school.

Adam was a good storyteller, and Astrid was always locked into a sort of trance, her eyes wide, lips slightly agape as he dramatically re-enacted the time he had almost joined a boarding school cult. 

Okay, I've said the thing I liked about him, because he wasn’t all bad at the beginning of their relationship. 

But like I said, the more time he spent with us, practically shoving himself into our lives and demanding to be given attention, I started to see his *act*. 

Initially, it was just small things. 

“You can’t afford *twenty dollars*?”

He didn’t sound like he was intentionally being a dick.

Adam looked confused, one brow raised, his chin resting on his fist. 

I figured he was just out of touch after finding out his family were insanely rich. 

I didn’t really think much about it, until I refused to buy a cocktail at a club, and again, he had given me that *look*. This time he was fully looking down on me. 

Instead of questioning me, he reached into his wallet with an over-exaggerated sigh, pulled out a wad of cash, and slammed it down on the bar. 

Okay, so, I was really drunk. 

Several strawberry daiquiris down, I had no interest in buying a cocktail that sounded like a euphemism. 

I would usually stay quiet, but at that point, I was pissed.

So, I made a point of sliding the money back to him, getting up, and pulling my best friend onto the dance floor. 

Adam joined us after acting like a spoiled child, realizing neither of us was going to buy into his shit, and I forgot about his clearly out-of-touch bullshit.

But then that kind of shit kept happening, and happening, until he finally revealed his true colors and freaked out at a restaurant that had seated us near “other people.”

By other people, he meant *normal* people. 

Adam said it was because of privacy but had zero problem when a high-profile singer came to sit near us. 

Astrid yelled at him and made a deal that he wasn't like that, and Adam pulled a face like a fucking second grader, only promising not to do it again when she threatened to leave him.

When we left the restaurant, he dumped money on a homeless person.

“What?""

Adam had this psychotic grin, watching the homeless man dive to grab the cash, stuffing each bill into his oversized trench coat. 

His eyes pricked with malice I had never seen before. 

He was enjoying the poor man’s very brief moment of joy. 

Adam nudged me with a laugh. “I told you I like *those* types of people!”

Again, he tried to justify it by saying he was giving to charity, which Astrid bought, hook, line, and sinker. 

I stopped hanging out with them because, every time we did, he would either go on an out-of-touch rant or be passive-aggressive to others.

All with this handsome smile and quirk of an eyebrow that was not cute in the slightest. This guy was an overgrown rat.

When I tried to tell her he was bad news, those interventions turned into arguments, and, unbelievably, she would call Adam to come and “act as the peacemaker.”

So, in short, I didn’t like him.

I didn’t like that he was fake and had already brainwashed my best friend with the promise of a life of luxury.

It was on April Fools’ Day that I got the text I didn’t think I’d be getting for at least ten years. We were twenty years old. 

The two of us had made a promise to each other that we would go traveling during our gap year. 

I thought it was an April Fools’ joke, and I repeatedly asked her if she was playing some kind of sick prank. But no.

Sent along with a message that just said, “We’re getting married!” 

Astrid, standing under a perfect sunset in some unknown location, maybe Bali—an engagement ring on her finger, her arms wrapped around a grinning Adam.

Astrid sent me a follow-up message asking if I would be her bridesmaid. 

I was speechless. She had barely known this guy for a few months, and she was marrying him? 

The last thing I wanted was to walk away from a lifelong friendship over a guy.

But this was *Adam*.

Adam, who was the most out-of-touch person I had ever met.

Adam, who snorted when I said I couldn’t pay for my phone contract and then offered to pay the whole thing for me.

These were not nice things.

He knew exactly what he was doing, and that was putting me in my place and reminding me that I was lesser than him.

Fuck, he even did it with Astrid when they started dating, laughing when she mentioned her mom’s house wasn’t mortgaged, and then asking if she was being serious.

He paid the whole thing off for her with a patronizing flip of his hair.

I did agree to go to the wedding.

After a lot of thought, I came to the realization that I was being childish. She was my best friend. I didn’t want things to move so fast, but of course, they did. 

Astrid started skipping class for sudden, unexpected trips to France. 

Her dress would be fitted by only the top designers. 

Which Adam had mentioned only a *thousand fucking times*.

He made it his mission to tell me my dress would have to be store-bought from a boutique because his mom didn’t know me well enough to include me in the fittings.

Astrid, however, called him out on it and insisted on all of the bridesmaid dresses coming from the boutique.

For which he paid. Obviously.

I don’t think there was ever a time when he let us pay for our own drinks or food. 

It pissed off Astrid at the start, though I think she got used to it. 

Wedding planning was something I had always dreamed of doing, especially for Astrid. 

I wanted to spend a whole night with her where it was just us, she would give me a basic idea and theme of what she wanted, and I would make that happen. 

Lo and behold, I got a text from her saying I didn’t need to do anything, that the wedding was already planned.

I thought that was strange, but I didn’t question it. 

Adam said he had everything under control, so I just smiled and nodded and resisted the urge to punch him in the face. 

It was pastel-themed. Astrid’s dress was a beautiful shade of pink, like a darker coral, while the bridesmaid dresses were pastel blue. 

I think Astrid was going for a fairy theme, or something close to it.

When I arrived for the rehearsal dinner, the theme was already set up.

I wasn’t expecting the actual ceremony to be at Adam’s house. 

Honestly, I was half-expecting him to announce that he’d bought Buckingham Palace. 

The house was exactly what I expected: a mansion with too many windows, too many doors, and a startling number of unnecessary swimming pools.

The ceremony itself was held outside, and once I jumped out of the Uber, my stomach swimming with nerves, I took a moment to take in the scene. Astrid had chosen a night wedding because she wanted it to be moonlit.

Magical.

I never really understood what she meant until I saw the setup, rows of pearly white benches canopied by cherry blossom trees strung with soft white lights. 

The benches themselves were tangled with wildflowers and greenery, vines and tendrils wrapping around the armrests. 

Entranced by the sight, I had a moment of realization: my best friend was about to walk down the aisle I was standing on and give herself to a man and I despised.

I should have been happy for her, but all I could really feel was frustration and a twist in my gut that was definitely jealousy.

Luckily, alcohol exists, and the rehearsal dinner wasn’t as bad as I’d thought.

I spent most of the night on the dance floor with Astrid, until Adam’s mother, a witchy woman with a patient smile, pulled her away to go over last-minute preparations.

So, I retreated to the snack table, which had to feature the most obnoxious food possible. 

I didn’t think it was physically possible to roast a full pig, but there it was, sitting with an apple lodged in its mouth. 

I knew I was being unsociable, but the other guests made no effort to speak to me. And when they did, it was with a wide, knowing smile that didn’t need words: Why are *you* here?

They knew who Astrid was, squealing and hugging her like they had been best friends their entire lives. 

But when I tried to join in or offer my name, I was greeted with dead-eyed stares. 

These girls weren’t even pretending to be nice. They looked at me and scoffed.

Just like Adam. 

I guessed half the people our age were trust fund kids he had grown up with.

At that point, I was close to leaving.

The wedding was set for 11:45, and I was hoping to get back to my hotel room and psyche myself up for what I was sure was going to be a night of hell.

Before long, the wedding had finally arrived. 

The sky was the perfect oblivion Astrid had hoped for, meaning a moonlit ceremony, and I was trying, and failing, to suppress the urge (now slightly tipsy) to pull my best friend aside and demand she call the whole thing off.

Because it was stupid. It was fucking stupid. Old Astrid wouldn’t have even liked it.

She would have raised her eyebrows at everything being so perfectly placed, at the handwritten notes on each table.

I refused to get ready with the other girls after walking in to find one of them mocking my lisp.

The dress was beautiful.

I did a little squee moment in the mirror. 

I thought the flower crowns for both the bridesmaids and groomsmen would be over the top, but I was wrong.

I guess what I wasn’t expecting was for the wedding to be… spread out? Is that the right word?

What I mean is, we didn’t have to sit down.

You could stand or sit wherever you liked.

I had been dreading sitting on the benches, but it seemed they were reserved for Adam’s immediate family, while the rest of us just had to stand around.

Another thing. I had been informed five minutes before stepping out of the fitting room that I wouldn’t be standing with the other bridesmaids. 

Again, an “inner family” thing.

Which, honestly, I was happy about.

After a while of trailing behind Astrid, telling her how beautiful she looked, I pulled her into a hug, whispered good luck, and made my way to the refreshments table.

11:35.

I glanced at my phone, noticing how the mood had shifted from girls dragging each other around for selfies and guys hyping themselves up to a more mellow murmur as the lights in the trees began to dim.

I noticed the reflection of a half-crescent moon slowly bleeding from the clouds onto a silver platter on the table. 

Adam and Astrid must have timed it perfectly. 

Like the lights on the trees, the moon almost mimicked them, not too bright, but ethereal when you really looked at it.

I was so entranced by the silvery glow slowly enveloping the sky that I barely noticed a figure looming behind me.

“Are you ‘er mate?”

It wasn’t just the voice that surprised me. It was the accent.

I had seen a lot of things at that party, things that had to be seen to be believed during my time stumbling around trying to find a bathroom. 

(A guy snorting coke off a girl’s stomach, an orgy in one of the many, many bedrooms featuring a diamond-encrusted dildo.) 

But a British guy? That, I wasn’t expecting.

The guy looked as uncomfortable as I felt, dressed in matching colors. 

Instead of a dress, he wore a long-sleeved shirt a shade lighter than what I had on, tight black pants, and a flower crown awkwardly perched on dark curls that I knew had been tamed by fingers that weren’t his. 

He looked around my age. 

From the way he gingerly held his champagne glass and poked at shrimp tartare and violet-colored macarons, I could tell this guy wasn’t part of Adam’s inner circle. 

I wasn’t sure what to focus on, the awkward way he saluted me with his drink, or the blonde girl hiding behind him. 

The ceremony was starting.

Without thinking, I downed my champagne, the sudden explosion of fizz overwhelming my mouth. 

“Astrid?” I spoke through a sour-lemon grimace, replying to his earlier question. 

Until then, I had been sipping in intervals because it tasted like rotten orange. 

“Yeah, I’m her…” I choked, spluttering on another cough. “... friend.” I briefly forgot my own name. “I’m, uh, I'm, um.. Penny?”

The guy’s lips quirked into a smile.

“Penny with a question mark.” He mulled my name over. “Did that taste good?”

“Yes,” I said, a little too fast. 

He grinned. “Liar.”

When I didn’t reply, he leaned against the table, then immediately sprang back when he realized tables like that weren’t meant for casually leaning on. “I'm Spencer,” he said. “I went to boarding school with Adam.”

All around us, guests were starting to shush each other, but Spencer continued talking loudly. 

“Adam and I have known each other since we were little kids. In fact, I was his best friend.” he spoke with a sour irony I was too tipsy to fully understand. 

I nodded slowly. “So, you’re his best man?”

“Seriously?” Spencer pulled a face. “Wait, you think I'm *friends* with him? I haven't spoken to him since we were sixteen. The asshole’s mother got me kicked out of school because, apparently, I was a bad influence.”

He winked, reaching into his pocket and pulled something out, a baggie of white powder. “Annnd it turns out, she was *right*.”

“That’s *sugar*, darling.”

The blonde girl, who had been practically bouncing behind him, finally strode forward, flinging an arm around Spencer. 

He tried to inch away before she dragged him back, grinning.

She shot me a wide smile. “Have you ever read TFIOS?”

I blinked at her, suddenly wary of speaking too loudly. The moon was yet to fully emerge. I think that was what Astrid was waiting for.

“…What?”

“The Fault in Our Stars,” the girl said with an eye roll. She nudged him. “That’s Spencer in a nutshell! He’s a walking John Green novel, and he wants everyone to know it.”

When I frowned at her, she shrugged. “The sugar’s a metaphor! Because of course it is.”

When Spencer sent me a panicked look, she rested her head on his shoulder. “It’s okay to grow up, you know,” she teased.

“You can let go of this…” She paused for effect before grabbing two macarons and stuffing them into her mouth. “…phase.”

For a moment, I thought she was joking before it dawned on me that they were being completely serious.

Rich kids.

“I wasn’t *joking*,” Spencer grumbled, slipping the sugar back into his pocket, his cheeks going a little pink.

He shrugged, stepping away from the blonde. I noticed a certain vulnerability when he spoke about him and Adam, a certain twitch in his lip. 

He was pissed. 

“Adam’s psycho bitch of a mother got me kicked out of school, after we…”

He trailed off, a reddish blush blooming across cheeks. 

The blonde shot him a knowing grin. “I'm sorry, did you get a little choked up? Oh, my god, like, that's so fucking adorable!”

“Drop it.” he spoke through gritted teeth. 

“Hmm?” she laughed. “Wait, are we talking about *why* you were kicked out, or why you no longer have brunch with our circle?”

Spencer averted his gaze, and she spluttered, giving him a passive-aggressive nudge. 

“Ohhh, you mean when your Daddy went, like, broke?""

He curled his lip. “Evie, you *know* that's not what I'm talking about–”

“I’m Evangeline!” The girl  cut him off, thrusting out her hand, talking to me. 

She reminded me of the human version of a golden retriever, blonde curls bouncing on her shoulders. 

Her dress looked perfect on her, and the flower crown was the icing on the cake. 

She kept playing with it, fixing it onto her curls. 

“I also went to boarding school with Adam, and we actually dated a few times in junior year! However, it turned out our *dearest* Adam was fucking someone behind my back.”

When I couldn't respond, she  bopped me on the head. 

“Oh my god, I love your crown! You’re Penny, right? I'm Evangeline! But you can call me Evie!""

This girl was speaking so fast I could barely keep up with her. 

I nodded dizzily. “I like your dress,” I managed to get out. 

Evie inclined her head, her eyes narrowing. “You think I'm hot?”

Her smile widened when my cheeks erupted into flames. “Oh my god, wait, are you, like *crushing* on me? That's so cute!”

She grabbed my hands and did a little dance, pulling me with her. 

“Astrid told me so much about you! Like, on our trip a few weeks ago, she told me you’ve been best friends your whole lives. I’m so jealous! You’re like, soooo cute! I love your dress!”

“It’s literally the *exact* same as yours,” Spencer rolled his eyes, downing another glass of champagne. 

In response, she thwacked him. “You're lucky you're even here, Setori,” she chirped, “Did you get the bus here, Spencer?”

His expression hardened, but he played along, mimicking her smile. 

Spencer leaned back, once again, almost toppling over the refreshments table. 

“I'm *so* sorry you're yet to get over your mean girl phase at the grown age of fucking *twenty* years old.”

Evie just grinned. “It's because I *like* you, babes!”

Spencer downed another glass of champagne, spitting out, “Ditto.”

Oh, wow. 

I stood, feeling incredibly uncomfortable in my thrifted heels. 

These two were *fun*. 

I did notice Spencer’s gaze kept scanning the crowd for Adam, and I started wondering what had happened between the two of them. 

However, I was more intrigued by what Spencer meant when he referred to Adam’s mother as “psychotic.”

Before I could speak up and snap him out of the trance he’d fallen into, his eyes suddenly on the sky, Evangeline whispered, “It’s starting!” 

I twisted around with the rest of the wedding party, and there she was. 

I remember thinking it was magical how the moon illuminated her, turning her ethereal as she floated down the aisle.

But then I wasn’t thinking of anything.

I was only thinking of Astrid and how angelic she looked. 

I caught her radiant smile, and it hit me. I could let go of my hatred for Adam if it meant she was going to be happy. 

I promised her.

Hours earlier, the two of us had sat together, crying and sharing memories of the mock weddings we used to have as little kids.

Then she had turned to me and told me the best wedding gift I could ever give her was myself.

Being there.

And that was enough to swallow my pride and watch her join hands with the love of her life.

When their vows were exchanged, the moon strayed in the sky, like she was listening.

They said the most important part:

""Till death do us part.""

Astrid turned to me suddenly, her eyes shining.

""Right, Penn?""

The wedding party’s attention was suddenly on me, and something twisted in my gut. Evangeline, standing next to me, nudged me playfully.

“Say yes, babes!”

“I… yes?” I said it more like a question, but I guess that was enough.

I thought the odd intrusion was over before Adam, still holding Astrid’s hand, nodded at Spencer.

""Till death do us part, Spence.""

Spencer looked startled for a moment, lifting a brow.

He shot me a slightly panicked look, which meant I wasn’t crazy. 

This was definitely weird. 

I was pretty sure the bride and groom weren’t supposed to rope other people into their vows. 

“Say it.”

Adam’s voice was strangely cold, and the knot in my gut tightened.

“Uh, sure?”

Spencer smiled and nodded, though his voice had a sarcastic drawl.

It wasn’t until I truly took in my surroundings that I noticed the moon’s light was spread unevenly. 

The bride and groom stood directly beneath it, illuminated as they should have been, but something was off. 

Catching its reflection in my glass, on silver platters, and even in the shadow behind Spencer’s eye, I realized, the three of us were glowing, just like Astrid and Adam.

Saluting the bride and groom, Spencer’s fake smile splintered into something sour.

""Till death do us fuckin’ part, *bro*."" he said, his lips breaking out into a grin, but his eyes were dark. 

“Because that's what we are, right, Adam?” he laughed. “*Bro’s*?”

I wondered why *we* were the sudden main attraction when something... pricked in my gut.

I thought I had broken my glass. 

But looking down, I wasn’t even holding a glass of champagne. 

I had a vivid memory of placing it on the table when the ceremony began. 

Slowly, my thoughts began to swirl as several things registered at once, including the growing red stain seeping through my dress. It wasn’t a clean slice, but it was definitely a stab.

I didn’t feel pain at first, or maybe I did, and it just wasn’t fully hitting me yet. 

My body felt it, though, when I felt myself slump. 

I didn’t fall, not yet, but I slammed my hand over the intense red coming through my dress. I think I screamed or maybe I just made mouth noises.

When I looked up, whoever had stabbed me was gone. 

I thought I imagined it until my eyes found Spencer, his frenzied gaze glued to me, watching the rapidly growing bloodstain just above my abdomen.

Time seemed to slow down after that.

Two things triggered my fight-or-flight response:

A sudden shriek from the crowd.

A girl dropping dead. Then a guy.

Spencer’s eyes, that had been stuck to me, rolled into the back of his head.

“*Fuck*.” was all he managed to splutter, before beads of red escaped his mouth. 

I barely saw the shattered glass plunged through his skull. 

His body swayed back and forth, his attempts at breaths becoming weaker, before his lips formed a single word: 

*“Run.”*

When Spencer’s body hit the ground, I stumbled back, ready to run, ready to grab Astrid and run for my fucking life. 

Evie was covered in Spencer, her cheeks slick with his blood. 

I thought her mind was slow to come to terms with what was going on, but her smile seemed to grow.  

She took a dainty step away from Spencer’s body, while the  rest of the party, excluding the inner family, exploded into chaos around me. 

I don’t know how they were dying. They were just dropping like flies. 

So many of them. So many girls I’d mentally rolled my eyes at, and guy’s with square jaws I didn’t like from first glance. 

Evie’s smile faded when a masked figure stepped in front of her. 

I expected her to run, like I was supposed to but I couldn’t stop looking at Spencer’s body lying in a rapidly growing pool of crimson and brain matter. 

I could see pieces of his skull littering the ground. 

“Wait, no.” Evie stumbled back with a laugh. “I’m on the list.” She kicked Spencer's body. 

“As you can see, my family donated a hell of a lot of money for this.”

She turned her nose up at him, her lips curving in disgust. 

“Unlike *him*, who's daddy went *tragically* broke, I deserve to be a spectator.”

Adam surprised me with a laugh. 

It’s amazing how you can forget about your own life when the world is coming apart around you.

Astrid was gone, guests our own age were dropping dead, and Adam was smiling like a fucking psychopath.

“Your parents are yet to tell you, but *you’re* broke,” he said with a shrug. 

“Sorry, Evie.”

Something in the girl’s expression turned feral. “What? That’s not right!” 

She clawed at her hair, stumbling back.

“Wait—”

Before she could speak, she was shot in the head.

Just… shot straight through her skull. 

I saw her brains hit someone else's face. 

When Evie’s body joined Spencer’s, I remembered how to breathe. 

I started to back away, and broke into a run. 

Slipping on pooling red drenched in moonlight, I made for the flowery arches, before someone stepped on my dress, and I was violently yanked back. 

I screamed, ducking to try and wrench myself free. 

“Penn! it’s me!”

Astrid.

Standing illuminated in white light, my best friend with wide eyes.

“Are you… are you okay?” She grabbed me when I dropped to my knees.

“Am I okay?” I managed to choke out, and it became more of a hysterical laugh. “What the *fuck* do you think?”

Astrid wrapped her arms around me, and she smelled like flowers. “We’re getting out of here,” She hissed out. “Right now.”

“Right.” I groaned, biting against a cry. I had to staunch my wound as best as I could.

Her eyes went to the gate ahead of us. “That’s a mechanical lock. “So, we… we climb over, right?”

Screaming from behind me.

We didn’t have time to think about it. 

She reached out for my hand, tugging me into a staggered run. 

I was the first one trying to scale the gate, planting one heeled foot on the fence and grasping above. 

When I was halfway up, I twisted around to see if she was following, when something cold and cruel sliced into my spine. 

I felt it cutting right through skin and bone, penetrating me. 

The shock of it was enough to send me backwards, tumbling, before my head hit concrete with a meaty smack, stars dancing in my eyes. No, not stars. 

Astrid. 

Through feathered vision, I saw the two of them, their eloping hands, their kiss under a suddenly startlingly bright moon, as I slowly bled out. 

When Adam and Astrid were pulling away, a darkness I had never seen before swirling in my best friend’s eyes, she dropped down next to me. 

My blood was ruining her dress, painting her crimson. 

“Isn’t this… amazing?” She whispered, her voice drifting in and out. 

I was trying not to choke on my own blood, but her words stayed with me, cementing themselves into my mind.

“My first love is giving up her own life for me to be happy. You and me, Penn. Joined by the moon herself, granting us her light, and entangling our souls so we can be together… forever….”

…

3 years.

1095.73 days.

1,000+ deaths later.


---

“Penn?”

Astrid’s voice was in my mind, and I wasn’t sure how. With my face pressed against wet grass, I instantly knew my injuries.

Sprained wrist, a stab wound on my leg.

Those words meant nothing to me.

Where was my bed? My body was twisted like a pretzel.

“Penn!”

The voice became a screech.

“Get up! You have half a minute until respawn. Are you going to spend it waiting to die? Come on, get on your feet!”

What?

Opening my eyes, I saw the sun poking through the trees.

Trees, I thought dizzily.

Where the fuck *was* I?

“Astrid?”

Her name slipped from my mouth, and I blinked rapidly, frowning at the big, bright thing blinding me.

The sun.

It didn’t make sense where I was, surrounded by thick canopies of trees.

“They’re coming, Penn! Get up! Now!”

I did, somehow. But the pain flattened me against the dirt, a raw cry escaping my lips. 

My feet were bare, dirt gritted between my toes.

But her voice was right.

I could hear them coming through the trees, branches snapping under feet, which immediately sent me flying up despite my wounds.

My mind knew what to do. 

Ripping off a strip of my dress, my hands trembled as I did my best to fashion a bandage. 

“That’s it,” Astrid’s voice murmured. Her voice sounded wrong, melodic.

Singsong.

“What’s going on?” I spoke to thin air, to her voice in my head. “Where… am I?”

“A bad place,” Astrid whispered. “But don’t worry. You’re almost winning this time, I promise. I have 800 dollars on you.”

“Winning?”

I started to walk, stumbling over myself.

“There’s a river just down here,” she said. “You can clean your wounds. I don’t see anyone. I think they ran the other way.”

“Astrid.” I tripped over a rock. All around me… trees. I was in some kind of forest. “What the fuck is… happening?”

“Just keep going, Penn.”

“I was at your wedding,” I whispered, my hands inching down my blood-spattered dress. “And you…”

“You’re getting close.”

“Killed me.” The words wouldn’t fully register in my head. “You… killed me.”

I could see the river, which bled into the sky. 

My steps quickened as I stumbled toward the water. It wasn’t until I waded into the shallows that the memory crashed over me.

“You fucking killed me, you psycho bitch,” I whispered, my voice shaking. 

I rolled up the tattered remains of my dress, searching for the wound on my stomach—

But it was gone.

My breath hitched. 

“What did he do to you? Adam. What did that bastard do to your head?”

I swallowed hard, my chest tightening. “But if you… if you killed me, then how the hell am I here?”

“It’s not *bad*.” Astrid was talking about the gaping, ugly wound on my leg.

While my mind wasn’t sure how I’d gotten it, my body knew I’d been stabbed by some asshole hunting me down.

I was chasing after him, and he’d disappeared, only for something to hit me from behind. 

I dragged my fingers across the back of my head, wincing. I had a pretty bad gash in my scalp, but it wasn't fatal.

Yet.

If I didn't find a med kit, however, it would become fatal.

Astrid’s voice startled me again. “Penny, do you remember when we tried on dresses for homecoming in junior year, and you said I looked fat in the pink one?”

I couldn’t resist a laugh.

“I said you didn’t fit it because you *didn’t*,” I said through my teeth, tearing into my dress to make a second bandage, wrapping it around my fist.

“I never said you were fat. Your figure was better than mine.”

“Well, right now you also look like shit.” Astrid giggled. “So, I guess we’re equal!”

I slammed my hands into the filthy water, splashing loudly. “Equal?”

“Hey! You need to be quiet! Don’t draw attention to yourself!”

“Tell me what’s going on.” I spat, plopping myself down on a rock, examining my wounds. I was mostly okay, except a gash on my knee, and my leg injury. “Why am I here?”

She didn't respond.

“Astrid!”

“Well. There are two groups. The ones who went feral and Lord of the Flies, and the ones who actually play the game—""

She cut herself off. “Two o’clock, Penn.”

I twisted around, and she groaned.

“No, don’t move! Remember in freshman year when Jake Hollster was totally checking you out, and you looked directly at him? Don’t do that.”

“He wasn’t looking at me,” I gritted out, grabbing a rock for a weapon. “He was looking at *you*.”

“They’re armed, Penn. I’m going to need you to go slowly, okay?”

I shuffled back on my hands and knees. “Armed?”

“Looks like a gun. Wait. Get down!”

I did, throwing myself into murky water. 

Not deep enough to drown in, but just enough to hide me. 

I could hear footsteps.

They were slow and deliberate, crunching through pebbles before splashing into the shallows. 

The water was ice-cold, a relief against my body. I held my breath.

“Don’t… move.” Astrid murmured in my head.

I didn’t, but still felt the sudden sleek metal of a gun slide under my chin, forcing my head up. 

Before I found myself face staring down at the barrel pointed between my eyes. 

Evangeline. 

The girl was in tatters of her bridesmaid dress, barefoot, a scar sliced down her face. Her finger was steady on the trigger. 

Evie’s flower crown was still perched on her head, though her wildly vacant eyes no longer matched it.

“Wait.” I managed to hiss out.

Her body moved like a robot, reloading the gun and sticking it between my eyes.

“Evangeline.” I said her name, and only her name, through a sob before her mouth twisted into a bloody smile, and she pulled the trigger, blowing my head off.

I didn’t feel my death, but I did feel an unearthly presence floating around in the nether, yanking me back.

And for the 1,000th time, I could once again feel my body being slowly rewritten.

Not long after that, I awoke face down in the grass, the memory of the gun ricocheting in the girl’s hands sending me upright, grasping hold of my throat. 

“You’re so bad at this game, Penn. I’m bored.”

Astrid’s voice disappeared after that.

I called out to her, but I was alone.

Alone, in my bridesmaid dress, still stained crimson. 

A small handgun lay next to me, a box of ammo, and a bottle of water.

Slowly, I stood up. Before I glimpsed something glistening in the distance.

A wall. 

Sliced between the trees was a wall made of glass. 

I made my way over to it in slow stumbling steps. 

Behind it was Astrid, dressed in a flowing  red gown. 

She looked older. 

Older than me. I was still 20.

How *long* had I been twenty? 

Astrid was sipping champagne. Her eyes reminded me of Adam’s. 

“Thank you,” she said, as my fingers sliding across the barrier became fists, rage boiling my blood. I dropped onto my knees, screaming out for my best friend. 

“The lives of our first loves,” she said. 

“Every time you die, our marriage becomes more magical and it’s all thanks to you,” her smile widened when a feral screech rang from my throat. 

You bitch. 

I said it, screamed it, until my throat was raw. 

I barely realized I was crying, pounding my hands into the pane. 

Astrid stepped back, her lips curling. 

“Now you've done it! You've attracted the freaks.”

Behind me, sudden war-cries rang out, bare feet slapping through the dirt, heading toward me like a pack of wild animals.

A sharpened spear flew past me, hitting the tree behind me with a thunk. 

I twisted around to see the spear wielder.

Spencer, still in his wedding getup, a flower crown sitting on his head, along with what was left of an animal, no, *human* skull. 

His eyes were vacant pools of nothing staring back. When his head inclined, an animalistic snort escaping his lips, I started to run, stumbling over myself. 

Astrid’s voice rang in my head, a melodic murmur as I threw myself into a run. 

“Spencer Setori is the new favorite to win! Penn, if you kill him, baby, you've won!”

Louder, she screamed in my skull, as I tripped over uneven ground. 

I felt the weight of his body crashing into mine, knocking me onto my face. 

His warm breath tickling my neck, sharp incisors grazing my flesh. 

“Penn!” Astrid was laughing now, her voice dripping with excitement. But her voice was Adam’s. 

“Get him. Bleed him out and guzzle it down. I want to see you fuck him, then kill him. I’ve got eight hundred dollars on him actually waking up! Spencer Setori is trash. Did you know his daddy stole, like, millions from Adam’s family? Oh, and I haven't even told you the best part—”

Her manic screech, thankfully, began to fade when Spencer’s teeth gnawed into my head. 

I felt the boy chewing, savoring his meal, his mindless gnawing splintering through my skull, the weight of him pressing down, crushing my chest. 

A raw, animalistic screech tore from my throat. 

His slimy fingers flipped me onto my back, and through blurred vision, I caught a glimpse of his face, symbols etched into bare skin, smeared with scarlet. 

The remnants of his flower crown were tangled and threaded through the hollow, gnawing black eyes of a decaying skull nestling thick brown curls.

The last thing I heard, as Spencer Setori let out a happy chitter, was the sudden roar of laughter slamming into me.

Followed by loud applause. Whooping.

*""Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!""*

1pq34yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pq34yp/dating_is_so_frustrating_as_a_short_guy/,Dating is so frustrating as a short guy,"Hey everyone!!

I met a girl during one of my run club sessions. We were both wearing the same pokemon sweatshirt and we started discussing more about pokemon and other common interests and stuff. Things were going well, we kept meeting regularly for like the next 3-4 sessions and eventually I asked her out for a coffee.

I should also mention that I am very short, 5'1"", and she was noticeably taller than me, as almost everyone I meet is. But I don't really care about it and I thought she didn't either.

Anyway, we went to a cafe and had a lovely time there. It was one of those cafes where you paint something on a clay object. After that we went on 3 more dates and things were going well. She decided to invite me to one of her friend's moving away party and I got to meet her friends. And that is where everything went downhill.

I got a lot of snide remarks from her friends. One mentioned that being around me must make her ""maternal instincts"" kick in. And I could feel her getting uncomfortable with all these comments and she basically stopped talking to me for the rest of the night. I asked her if she wanted me to drop her off and she said that she will find someone else. I insisted that it's fine and I can drop her off , but after she refused again I just let it go.

I texted her the next morning if she got back home and everything is fine and if I did something to upset her. I got a reply after 12 hours that she wants to end things.

It's so annoying because I know it was the height thing and maybe her friends which got in her head but I can't do anything about it because it's her choice. It's already hard meeting people who are willing to date somebody of my height but it gets infinitely harder when other people's opinions influence them. We had a great time before that wretched going away party.

Anyway, thanks for reading through my rant. Just had to throw my feelings out into the universe.",2,1766094172.0,dating_advice,5,0.75,False

I told myself that putting it into words would make it real, and if I didn’t do that, if I kept it vague, fuzzy, half-forgotten, maybe I could convince myself it was nothing more than a scare.

But then something else happened tonight, so I’m writing this while I still can.

Last night started normally, too normally. I worked late, the kind of shift where time blurs and you don’t notice how exhausted you are until you finally step outside. It was a little after 11 p.m., cold enough that the air stung my lungs. The streets were quiet, but not empty, just quiet enough to make you aware of every sound your own body makes, quiet enough that I could hear my own heart beating.

My walk home takes about twelve minutes. I know every crack in the pavement, every flickering streetlight. I like routines, they make you feel invisible.

Halfway through the walk, I cut through a small car park behind a row of flats. I’ve done it hundreds of times, that’s why the van didn’t register immediately.

White, no markings, parked awkwardly near the wall, angled slightly wrong, like it had been left in a hurry. I remember noticing that detail because it bothered me. I remember thinking, someone doesn’t care about parking tickets.

I had already walked past it when the door slid open, it was so quiet I didn’t hear it, just felt that sudden wrongness, like the world had shifted a fraction to the left, I turned around slowly.

A man stood there, half in shadow, one hand on the inside of the door, hood pulled low. I couldn’t see his eyes clearly, but I knew he was looking directly at me.

He smiled, not friendly, not threatening. Familiar, like he’d seen me before.

“Hey,” he said, voice relaxed. “You dropped something.”

I looked down, there was nothing, when I looked back up, he had stepped closer. I hadn’t heard his feet move. “I didn’t drop anything,” I said, my voice sounding too loud in my own ears.

His smile twitched, like he was amused by my answer.“You sure?” he asked. “Happens all the time.” The van door slid open wider, that’s when I saw the second man.

He was sitting inside, low and still, like he’d been waiting in that exact position for a long time. His hands rested on his knees, fingers flexing slowly, rhythmically. He wasn’t smiling, he wasn’t frowning, he was watching me the way you watch traffic before crossing the road.

Judging distance, timing. The first man took another step toward me, something inside me snapped into place then. No thoughts, no logic, just one overwhelming certainty. If he touches you, you’re not coming back.

I ran, I didn’t scream, I didn’t look back. My legs moved so fast they burned, my breath coming out in short, ugly gasps. I heard footsteps behind me, heavy, purposeful, and for a split second I was sure a hand was going to grab my coat.

I cut into the narrow alley between buildings, nearly slipping on wet concrete. My shoulder slammed into a wall, I kept going, I didn’t stop until I burst out onto the main road, where the streetlights were brighter and a car passed close enough that I could feel the rush of air, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there shaking, pretending to scroll through my phone so I wouldn’t look like prey. When I finally dared to glance back down the alley, it was empty, no van, no men.

I walked home the long way, sticking to lit streets, keys threaded between my fingers. Every shadow looked wrong, every engine sound made my stomach drop.

When I got inside, I locked the door, then I checked the windows, then I sat on the kitchen floor and waited for my heart to slow down.

I didn’t call the police, I kept telling myself there wasn’t enough to report, that I’d imagined the second man, that maybe it was a failed robbery, or some kind of sick joke.

I slept maybe two hours, this morning, I tried to act normal. Showered, drank coffee I couldn’t taste, laughed at something on my phone a second too late.

That’s when I went outside and saw the note, it was tucked neatly under my windscreen wiper. Folded once, no envelope.

Inside, written in careful, tidy handwriting; wrong place, next time. My car wasn’t parked near the car park, it was parked directly outside my building.

I stood there for a long time, reading it again and again, until a neighbour walked past and asked if I was okay. I smiled and said yes, I wasn’t.

All day, I felt watched, every white van made my chest tighten, I checked my mirrors constantly, I changed my route home. Tonight, I made sure someone was on the phone with me the entire walk back, nothing happened, I started to relax. Then, about twenty minutes ago, my phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. No text, just a photo.

It’s grainy, taken at night. The angle is slightly off, like the person holding the phone was trying not to be noticed.

It’s the back of my head, I can tell exactly when it was taken, because I’m wearing the same jacket I wore last night. And if you zoom in, if you really look, you can see the reflection in the glass of a parked car in front of me, a white van, parked across the street. 

I just looked out my window, there’s a van outside now, and its engine is running.",1,1766094104.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pq32i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1pq32i5/final_year_ms_3_leads_gone_need_advice/,Final year MS ( 3 leads gone) need advice.,"Hi! I don’t usually post here but I need advice. I am currently doing my final year of MS in Cybersecurity, did my undergraduate in math-cs, and I am a US citizen. I had a recent experience which is questioning if I should continue pursuing software engineering or tech field which is questioning things interpersonal. I recently had 3 leads for new grad opportunities rejected due to fit with company issues. Which is disappointing as I did well in them technically and behavioral wise, so these came as a shock. Here is the context a bit.

\* google new grad swe. I passed resume screening, passed coding assessment, and did round 1. Did well in both interviews but don’t move on. \[rejected\].

\* 2k new grad program. Passed resume, Info call, passes coding assessment, passed take home assessment, and did technical interview. Did well in technical part but I think my lack of game dev experience is what got me here I think. \[rejected\]

\* Cisco. Internal recruiter reached out, passed screening, and about to do technical round, Cisco data migration to new hiring thing happened ( wasted 1-2 months) got rejected because job requirements changed and they didn’t want me.

I think I am just lost here and need some advice on how to really process this. Should I keep applying still? Is it the resume problem do I need more projects? Or is new grad doomed with “AI “ and not having “right background” to move forward ? Should I just work as a barista at my local city coffee place and become a coffee artist 😅.

I guess I am trying to see if anyone else is dealing with something like this and if so how are you dealing with it. And for those who are working, what do you notice as the issue? It is difficult, but I think some clarification to find meaning is what I am looking for here. ",4,1766094006.0,csMajors,0,1.0,False

In both cases i made a coffee, filled it in the cup and brought it to my place. Then i rolled a cigarette, as i usually do when i drink a coffee at her house, and then without any touching, it breaks like that just in front of me..

Then, it happened, it said delivered! It was tucked away in the parcel box, so I sent my son on a mission to retrieve the treasure. When he hauled it into the house, the sheer size of it took my breath away.

I work from home, and that box became the ultimate coworker. It sat right there, inches from my desk, vibrating with mystery. I tried to focus on emails. I tried to ignore the tape beckoning me to tear it open. But the air in the room felt different—it felt electric. Every time I glanced over, the temptation grew until I couldn't take it anymore.

“I'm done,"" I whispered. I scooped up the massive box, retreated to the sanctuary of my room, and grabbed the scissors.

The tape gave way with a satisfying rip. I peeled back the cardboard flaps, the anticipation reaching a fever pitch—and then, I saw it.

Midoriya (Aged up!!),"This is sorta just a random snippet I wrote when the idea came to me and idk I felt like I should share:

TW: Swearing + like the SLIGHTEST bit suggestive. 

Bakugo remembered that his father once told him that you could tell a lot about someone based on how they took their coffee, that it gave up a bit of their personality.

So what the fuck did it mean when that god damn nerd—

when Izuku-the sweetest idiot known to man-Midoriya got his coffee damn coffee plain black of all things. Not with a single splash of milk, but god a damn near disgusting amount of sugar.

Bakugo watched the man from behind his cubicle with a look of utter horror as the he paced by the coffee machine. Other members of the office passed Izuku by, offering small casual bits of conversation that made Bakugo’s eyes roll, but Izuku took it in stride, keeping that stupidly bright smile on his damn face the whole time too, but Bakugo didn’t care about that.

What he cared about was the way the nerd paced by the coffee machine like a damn addict. He watched as he just started the brew but 2 damn minutes ago, yet here he was, pacing like it should have been done by now.

Well maybe it should have, after all that coffee machine was a piece of shit. The thing was probably older than him, and he found himself cursing upper management for going stingy on something like a goddamn coffee maker of all things. It was one of those old fashioned models that you loaded with a filter with ground coffee and then you had to watch as the thing sputtered out trickles of the worst coffee you’ve probably ever had—and yet that nerd stood there like he was about to pass out if he didn’t get another glass.

Bakugo watched him as he removed the pot from the machine just as it sputtered enough coffee for one glass and poured it into his cup without second thought. Izuku heaved a breath and returned the pot to the machine as it began to sputter a bit harder with left over coffee that sat in the filter while Izuku *oh so selfishly* took his fill.

This was getting to be a little creepy at this point but Bakugo couldn’t tear his eyes away as the green haired man pushed up the sleeves of his white buttoned shirt, up just below his elbows with seemingly no care about wrinkling the shirt. He watched him like a hawk as his scarred hands reached into the glass jar filled with sugar and began to pour disgustingly large spoonfuls of it into his ‘coffee’.

Fucking gross.

Izuku used the same spoon to haphazardly stir contents of his drink before he brought it up to his lips, spoon still inside the cup as took a big gulp. Bakugo watched as his eyes nearly rolled into the bag of his head, but what nearly had him choking on air was the utterly sinful sound that came out of Izuku afterwards.

1pq2ztq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pq2ztq/28f_ive_had_months_of_severe_acid_reflux_and/,"28F I've had months of severe acid reflux and vomiting leading to weight loss of more than 20kg, would an upper endoscopy help?","Hi everyone.

This is a long post, but please bear with me. 

I'm a South African living in China. Since arriving in February I've been having issues with my stomach. Since February I've gone from 116kg to 98kg right now. At my lowest I was 92kg (in August) but picked up weight when I was sick and not physically active. I know I'm overweight, and losing weight is good. This is just not a hethy way to lose it. I'm incredibly stressed out about this. 

I've had constant and severe vomiting, multiple times a day. My throat hurts and I keep coughing because of the sensation in my throat. Sometimes even water is hard to keep down. I try to self manage by staying away from trigger foods and acidity like coffee. 

I think it's just severe acid reflux, but I'm not a professional so I don't actually know. 

For history:

Back in SA it was recommended to get an upper endoscopy, but I couldn't afford it. I had severe acid reflux, and was prescribed Pantoprazole 40mg for around three years. It was initially prescribed as a protector for my stomach to NSAIDs and mild acid reflux.

After arriving in China, the Pantoprazole no longer worked. I was on a different anti inflammatory medication then (Etoricoxib) which I realised made my stomach worse. I didn't take it for a few days, then I took it and vomited within 10 minutes. I stopped that and changed to Celecoxib, which has helped. 

I was in ap tiny city with no English-speaking doctors. I had to rely on my boss to help me. They took me for a gastroscopy I think, and didn't even give me the results. They just sent me on my way with 10 esomeprazole 20mg pills and told me to use traditional medicine. That I tried, because I was desperate, and it didn't work. 

I spoke with an online text-based doctor using a translator app, and they very reluctantly prescribed esomeprazole 40mg daily. They told me to get an upper endoscopy. It doesn't work. I still cough throughout the whole day from the acid burning my throat. I gag from the coughing, which sometimes also leads to vomiting. 

I'm in a much bigger city now, and close to Shanghai. There are Chinese speaking doctors in my city. I could try and see one of them and hope they'll accommodate me by using a translator app, or I must use the little savings I have to see an English speaking gastro-doctor (sorry can't remember what they're called in English) at a premium price.

I need relief as soon as possible. This is really affecting my day to day life. But this is so expensive it's giving me pause. Would seeing this doctor help me find the cause? Is an upper endoscopy possibly the answer I'm looking for?

It would be around 2/3 of the price to go to a Chinese hospital. But I feel like paying a bit more for a doctor who can understand me is worth it. I'm just afraid that I will get no answers and my money will be wasted.

I can't go on living like this. Vomiting constantly, coughing from the acid, struggling to keep food and water down.

Background to my meda/Diagnoses.

Diagnoses: Axial Spondyloarthrits, GAD, Bipolar 2, ADHD.

Medications:

Mental health: Fluoxetine 20mg, Lamotrigine 200mg, Ziprasidone 80mg twice a day, Burpoprion 150mg twice a day and 225mg at night.

1pq2y4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pq2y4j/help_with_supporting_brother_without_pushing_too/,Help with supporting brother without pushing too much,"Hello! I'm seeking advice on how to handle a situation that I feel conflicted about. I want to offer support for my brother but am unsure how to bring it up and what to say.
This is quite long but I wanted to rant a bit and give context on myself and my brother.

I have noticed my brother struggling in finding his own path in life for pretty much his whole twenties. I think he might be struggling with depression and/or low self-worth and lack of motivation and direction. He doesn't really have any support, at least in real life. Now my brother has always been a very quiet and introverted person and as a child/teen he didn't have many friends, though from what I remember he did hang out with boys from his class sort of on the side of the group.

A little context about me and our family:
I was a very energetic child and honestly was probably quite a menace to my brother. I messed with him a lot and as an adult I feel bad about it and have apologised. I got a diagnosis for ADHD this year and have connected that behavior as a negative way for me to regulate myself. We were pretty close as kids though and have a lot of good memories playing together. Still I feel partly responsible for most likely contributing to my brother's self-esteem.

Our family life was a bit of a mess and there's some unresolved issues there, especially with my mother. My mother has emotional issues and kind of blocks that part of relationships. Her work was a place for her to escape confronting difficulties and responsibilities of family life. I think she probably wasn't ready or maybe even didn't want to have kids and probably just hoped everything would go smoothly. She was never taught to deal with difficult emotions and shuts down when issues arise in relationships. This most likely had a big part in our parents' divorce (I was 8 and my brother 9 when my mum moved out). We weren't exactly told about the divorce but rather my mum explained that she needed an apartment for herself so she would have a home office and more space for work. I think she also kind of tried to ""sell it"" as a fun new place for us to visit and play at. Later on I mentioned about my mum's new place at school and was told by my teacher that it sounded like my parents have divorced. Honestly the whole thing is still a bit of a mystery to me as to why it was handled this way. We have always had a culture of silence in our family and it's definitely a multi-generational thing.

Our dad had a lot of anxiety before and after the divorce (this I have learned and pieced together later on) and he wasn't all that present for a few years after. Me and my brother continued living with him in our childhood home and visited our mother's apartment on weekends. Our dad has taken steps to heal and reflect and his partner is a therapist so I think she helped him a lot as well.

I started to struggle with depression and panic disorder at twelve and barely would finish middle school. I am still only working one shift a month and haven't completed any degrees. Fortunately I am now doing farely well and have been in therapy for eight years and have supportive people around me.

But back to my brother. In 2017 he went to study at a university in a city about five hours away. He clearly struggled at university since the beginning and didn't have any support in the new town. He recently dropped out and moved back to our city. I suspect dropping out was due to mental health struggles and he could be on the autism spectrum. I know our parents had a hard time supporting him and honestly I don't think either of them really knew how. Our mum has always tried pushing us for education and working but not in a supportive way. She called me lazy a lot as a teen and had a hard time accepting that I was in therapy. She definitely can be very judgemental in her way of communicating and after a fight she and my brother had a few years ago she hasn't pushed as much. This is the only fight my brother has ever had with either of our parents since childhood. He was visiting our mum and left after my mum complained about his gaming and lack of progress in his studies. She called me after and was pretty shocked. I have a hard time confronting my mum as she tends to shut down emotionally from any criticism and I've basically accepted I just won't have that relationship with her. I get along with her but only really talk about surface level things. 

We are going to my mum's for christmas next week and I'm hoping for advice for me to subtly offer support for my brother. I don't know how to bring this up and don't really want to just ask about his plans for the future as I think he'll say he doesn't know and feel awkward. I have told him before that he can reach out to me if he feels like it but he didn't respond. A few years ago me and my partner asked him on nature walks a few times. I have also talked about him with my partner quite a bit and he wants to help too but also has the same issue of not knowing what to say. Last month my dad asked me to go for coffee sometime at my brother's apartment and I plan to arrange that in January. This doesn't feel like a good place to bring things up since I don't want to put him on the spot with our dad. So any tips are appreciated, thanks for reading!",1,1766093705.0,Advice,2,0.67,False

1pq2x66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BridgertonNetflix/comments/1pq2x66/passing_the_torch/,Passing the torch,"I thought it would be a good idea to take a look back at all the great things season 3 brought before passing the torch to the next leads.

Season 3 gave us one of the most anticipated couples in the series, Colin and Penelope aka Polin. It remains the largest subreddit for a specific couple in a show and Colin is the only Bridgerton brother to appear in all the books. Julia Quinn has also often said that most people who come talk to her about her books mention Penelope as one of their favourite characters.

Season 3 broke records set by season 1 and 2 and became the only returning show on Netflix to surpass its previous season in viewership. Additionally, season 3 remains in the top 10 most watched show of Netflix, alongside the first season.

The carriage scene basically broke the Internet and it became the scene used by Netflix to promote their new app feature where you can mark certain scenes to watch again. It was also nominated for a BAFTA award, as well as the Edinburgh Festival Awards, which it won. Nicola Coughlan aka our Penelope was nominated for a SAG award for her performance, as was the Ensemble cast of Bridgerton. Additionally, Luke Newton was featured as one of the sexiest men alive in 2024 and Nicola appeared in the cover of Time Magazine. Fresh of their season, Nicola landed a role in The Magic Faraway Tree alongside actors like Andrew Garfield and Clare Foy while Luke Newton got cast as the lead in a movie with Lucy Hale, shooting in Rome, also the same year. Nicola also helps raise millions of funds regularly for diverse causes, including pro LGQBT+, Palestine, etc. Feels important to me to also highlight the previous leads outside of their show. Luke also shared fundraisers for suicide prevention while working on his play, The House of McQueen in NY. Nicola is also currently staring in a play in the West End and Luke  is rumoured to be playing in the new movie by Destry Spielberg.

Coming back to season 3 again, it was the first time we saw a couple that has been there from the beginning and the beloved trope of ""friends to lovers"". When we come back to season 4 it will be the first time we get to see parents in BGT since sadly we never got to see Daphne with Simon.

Season 3 was also nominated for multiple Emmys including Best Costume which won, and Best Choreography. Thank you Jack Murphy for choreographing so many twirls for Polin aka their signature move. Season 3 remains the season with the most Emmy wins and it finally gave Dame Julie Andrews her first Emmy which was long overdue in my opinion. An icon truly for an iconic show. 

Season 3 also holds the highest score by critics (87%) and audience (77%) on Rotten Tomatoes. The show has gotten progressively better on this account and I can see this trend even improving in future seasons which is what we all should want. More engagement, more fun, more rewards for the cast, crew and fans!

Season 3 also led to the renewal of the show for season 5 and 6 which is amazing since that means we get to see Francesca and Eloise´s stories soon. I still cannot make up my mind as to who will be next.

Whatever your feelings are about season 3 there is no denying that it was a very successful show with a formidable promotional run, press tour stops and fan engagement, thanks mostly to the social media presence of the leads who engaged in comments on posts or reshared TikToks made by fans.

At the end of the day, thousands of people work on every season of this show, from writers to producers to actors to the person who brews the coffee every morning. Let us chat about what we loved about season 3 before we go into season 4 :)

Whether something that you loved about the performances or about the tour, the costumes, the soundtrack and score... share!

P.S. If this post offends you, I am only sharing my opinion and actual facts about the season. It is more than okay to have a favourite season but this post is about sharing the amazing work involved in these 8 episodes of television. And of course we should do the same when season 4 comes around.",5,1766093644.0,BridgertonNetflix,17,0.57,False

* **Purpose of Travel:** Tourism/Vacation (no specific events)
* **Traveling:** Alone
* **Location:** US Embassy, India
* **Past Travel History:** Only UAE (Dubai)

# Pre-Interview Process

# Arrival & Security Check

* **Appointment Time:** 11:10 AM
* **Arrival Time:** 10:00 AM (arrived 1 hour early)
* **Phone Storage:** Had to deposit phone at a nearby shop for ₹100 (received receipt)
* **Wait Time:** \~10-15 minutes in the initial line

**PS:** There was a girl trying to outsmart everyone by jumping the line, but the people at the counter told her to go back and stand in line. I don't know why we Indians think they can jump lines.

# Entry Process

* **Queue Time:** Approximately 30 minutes to enter the embassy
* **Separate Queues:** Male and female queues (female queue was shorter)
* **Priority Access:** People with kids and elderly were preferred to skip the line - guards would call them upfront and ask others to stand in the internal queue
   * Walked through metal detector
   * Jacket, belt, wallet, and papers were scanned for metal and electronics
   * At the end of the queue, a guy checked my passport confirming whether I had the appointment or not

# Inside the Embassy

* Washroom and cafe - you can get coffee or water for cash. I saw people having pastry there.

# Interview Experience

* **Note:** Before my interview, I saw VO reject a guy who was Indian, planning to go to Canada, and from there wanted to visit USA. The guy wasn't able to explain his need clearly, and that's why he got rejected. This made me really, really nervous when I went in front of the window.

# Questions & Answers

**The Interview Started:**

* I went in front of the window and gave my passport to the officer
* I just waited for a few seconds
* Then he said ""Start"" - and I was confused, like ""what start?""
* Then he said ""Start"" again, and I started with the question I had always assumed he wanted to ask: ""What is the purpose of your visit?""

**Q: What is the purpose of your visit?**

* **A:** I recently got promoted at work, so i have decided to fulfil my wish to travel to USA.

**Q: Who are you going with to America?**

* **A:** Alone
* **Officer:** ""No, you can't - you're not going alone""
* **Me:** ""Yeah, I'm going alone""
* **Officer:** ""No, you're not going alone""
* **Me:** \[Officer was going through my passport in a brisk manner while saying this\]
* **Officer:** ""Okay, okay""

**Q: What's your monthly salary?**

* **A:** \[Stated salary\]
* **Officer's Reaction:** He was surprised - ""Could it be?"" Then he asked me my salary again
* I explained my salary to him
* **Officer:** ""That's a crazy amount of money you're making for this early in your career. What do you do exactly?""

**Q: What do you do?**

* **A:** I explained what I do and explained my profession - the kind of work that I do here, the work that I do

**Q: Tell me about your clients in India and in America**

* **A:** I named our customers in India and in America

**Q: Will you be meeting any of your American clients in America?**

* **A:** No, this is purely a personal vacation

# Outcome

**VISA APPROVED** ✅

* Officer: ""Your visa is approved""
* I thanked him but hesitated, unsure if I should leave
* Couldn't hear his response clearly, asked twice
* Officer: ""Why are you so surprised?""
* Quickly left the counter, realizing I was lingering too long. Was extremely nervous throughout the entire process

# Key Takeaways

1. **Be Honest:** I was completely transparent - going alone, purely for tourism, no business meetings, no events to attend (no Shaadi happening, no concert, nothing I'm attending).
2. **Presentation Matters:** I think it's purely how you present yourself there. You have to be true to the reason that you want to go.
3. **DS-160:** I filled my DS-160 comprehensively. I wrote everything in detail - what I might be doing, basic itinerary. I filled it with a skeleton that I had in mind while filling it.
4. **Past Travel History:** My past travel history only includes UAE (Dubai), which shows limited international travel but still demonstrates some travel experience.
5. **Stay Calm:** I was really nervous before the interview, but staying composed helped (even though I was flustered at the end!)

# Personal Reflection

I don't know what exactly made me qualify and what exactly may qualify others. I think it's purely how you present yourself there because, if you think about it, I literally said to the guy that I'm going alone and I'm going as a tourist and I don't have any business there - like there is no Shaadi happening, there is no concert, there is nothing I'm attending. It's just pure fun. So if you think from that perspective, then it's quite foolish that they would let you go just like that, but they did. So I think you have to be true to the reason that you want to go.

Even with limited travel history (only UAE/Dubai), I was still approved, which shows that having extensive travel history isn't always necessary if you present yourself well and have strong ties to your home country.

# Tips for Future Applicants

* Fill out DS-160 comprehensively with detailed information - write everything in detail including what you might be doing and a basic skeleton itinerary
* Be honest and straightforward about your purpose - even if it's just ""pure fun"" or tourism
* Present yourself confidently
* Don't overthink - if your purpose is genuine, state it clearly
* Arrive early but don't stress about the wait times
* Be prepared for questions about your profession, income, and travel plans
* Limited travel history (like only UAE/Dubai) doesn't necessarily disqualify you - focus on strong ties to home country and clear purpose",0,1766093630.0,usvisascheduling,2,0.5,False

Upon arrival, front desk knew right away about the Edit perks and handed me this sheet. We were checked in to our room right away (and early) and given reusable water bottles, which could be refilled for still or sparkling water in the lobby. 

Upgrading would have required moving from two queen needs to a king suite so we declined. We were offered 2pm late check-out and were told to come back to request it. The next day they offered 1pm but probably would have done 2pm if we pushed. We left earlier anyway.

A few hours into our stay, room service came and offered us two cupcakes and nice waters as our welcome gift. We ordered room service with our breakfast credit. There’s a QR code in each room for easy ordering. There is also free self serve hot coffee and tea with an array of milks in the lobby for breakfast. 

We used our property credit at one of the two hotel restaurants. I recommend Blue Ribbon Sushi, our waitress was also aware of the $100 property credit and applied it quickly. We used our $150 dining credit at Toro, which was a wait to get our reserved table but the food was well worth it.

The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays. It is located right on a train line, by several buses and with easy access to ride share. It took us no more than 20 minutes to get around Boston. Looks like there was valet parking. Across the street from Fenway Park. We used the StubHub credit at a local concert.

I still want to see my friends in Reading but I'd like it if there was an actual \*thing\* to do that was free, ideally, or low budget and fun. This way we could all save money and not do the same coffee-and-a-chat we always do.

I’m in the early research phase of starting a small coffee project in the Netherlands and I’d love some advice from people with experience in cafés, restaurants, or roasting.

I’m trying to understand how private-label specialty coffee usually works here. Specifically:
	•	Are there specialty roasters in the Netherlands (or nearby EU countries) that offer private-label / white-label beans for small businesses?
	•	Is it generally acceptable in the specialty coffee world to private-label roasted beans and sell them under your own brand, as long as sourcing and quality are transparent?
	•	How realistic is it to focus mainly on Ethiopian specialty coffee (single origins or blends) when private-labeling?
	•	Are there any legal or food-safety requirements I should be aware of when selling private-label coffee beans in NL (labeling, traceability, certifications, etc.)?

I’m not looking to start roasting immediately — more like working with a trusted roaster first to learn the market and build a customer base.

Any insights, warnings, or personal experiences (good or bad) would be really appreciated.
Thanks in advance 🙏

1pq2ok1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pq2ok1/sending_a_hey_girlie_text_to_someone_whose/,"Sending a ""Hey girlie..."" text to someone whose partner is cheating on them","I (27F) have been frequenting a cafe for about 2 years. It's close to my house, the tea and coffee are good and cheap, and they host a ton of music and art events that I attend. I have become a regular part of the community there and am there at least once a week, maybe more.

About 3 months ago, one of the back-of-house guys (34M) took over up front. It was my first time meeting him and he seemed cool. I didn't think anything of it until he started flirting with me maybe 3 weeks ago. He was really cool, he has a pretty interesting background. I figured if I wasn't interested romantically, maybe we could be friends.

I think 2 or 3 times I stayed late at the cafe (mostly with other people) just to get to know him a little better. I think at two points we were alone for a little bit. The second time I stayed, one of his regulars brought up a partner of his. I confronted him and he told me he had two kids and him and his partner were split up and in the process of untangling their lives. That's a yellow flag, but I can understand, separations are hard with kids and I'm just getting to know him and I don't even know if I'm romantically interested, whatever.

A few days go by and we meet up outside the cafe for the first and only time. We go to a public park and walk around. There's some flirty touching and a couple of kisses. But he started getting antsy after reading his phone and my spidey senses started tingling so I confronted him again and asked him if he was being up front with his ex partner and he changed his story on me. Apparently now, they are not separated but they're in a rocky spot so he felt he had a moral grey area to mess around in. I did not like that and shit things down immediately. I'm not helping you cheat on the mother of your child.

I skipped the cafe events for a week and went ghost on socials before showing face and as soon as I showed up to the cafe he tried flirting again. He was being very aggressive with it and following me around the wherever I sat to talk \*at\* me. It was very uncomfortable and I again had to shut him down.

Well now I'm getting reports from mutual and regulars that he's retaliating. He is spreading lies about me to our shared community, he's trying to paint me in a bad light and telling people I talked bad about them. I was just going to leave everything alone because it's not my business but I feel like I am being pushed into a place to fight back if I want to hold ground within my long time community.

I'm thinking about reaching out to his partner on instagram and letting her know that he is actively trying to cheat on her but obviously that's a nuclear option. I'm trying to figure out a way to do that without blowing up my community spot. I'm not scared of confrontation or uncomfortable energy, but I don't know how reactive he is. I've heard some scary things through the grapevine about him as this has unfolded (he has multiple assault allegations from different women).

How would you tactfully handle a, ""hey girlie..."" conversation to his partner? Would you even go that far? Would you confront him? I don't want a smear campaign against me ruining my reputation. I could go above him to his manager and let her know that I'm being retaliated against for shutting advances from her employee down, but I don't know if that'd help anything. I just don't want to get banned or pushed out from one of my favorite places.",0,1766093075.0,Advice,9,0.33,False
1pq2me6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAb-o99zMt4,Why Restaurants Are EMPTY & OVERPRICED | Damon Cassidy,"From Kimi K2

  
-----

**“HOW FAST-FOOD QUIETLY QUIT BEING AFFORDABLE”**  
*Damon Cassidy deep-dive | Long-form summary | Dec 2025*

---

### **[00:00 – 00:58]  The 30 % Bomb That Lands Next Year**  
The National Restaurant Association’s own forecast, flashed on screen in the first 30 seconds, warns that menu prices across the United States will jump another 30 % during calendar-year 2026 alone.  That would come on top of a decade in which fast-food prices have already risen roughly 50 %—a pace that triples the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ headline CPI for the same period.  Cassidy frames the milestone as the end of an 80-year social contract: the industry that once fed a blue-collar family of four in under a minute for less than a dollar has mutated, in his words, into “just another shareholder extraction pipe” that raises prices at triple the national inflation rate because it can.

---

### **[00:58 – 04:12]  Value-Menu Death Spiral**  
Archive graphics show a 1975 Egg McMuffin priced at 63 ¢—about $3.70 in 2025 money—while current Austin, TX menus charge $7.29 for the same item.  The McDonald’s of the 1970s and 1980s used 63-cent breakfast sandwiches, 29-cent hamburgers and the original 99-cent Happy Meal to anchor the nation’s psyche around “quick, hot, predictable, cheap.”  The segment argues that the corporate race to the bottom—duplicated by Burger King’s 99-cent Whopper, Taco Bell’s 59-cent tacos and Subway’s $2 six-inch subs—gutted operator margins so completely that labour hours were slashed, patty weights trimmed and ingredient quality down-spec’ed until the public equated “affordable” with “low-grade.”  Between 1950 and 2005 the country lost roughly 3,500 classic roadside diners, while Subway alone ballooned from 13,000 to 20,000 units in just five years (2000-2005), crowding out independents that could not absorb 40 % food-cost ratios.

---

### **[04:12 – 07:31]  Consolidation = Pricing Power**  
Cassidy zooms out to the farm gate.  Four meat-packers—Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef—now control 85 % of U.S. beef processing, up from 36 % in 1980.  Court-filed testimony from ongoing “cattlemen vs. packers” lawsuits shows the quartet coordinating weekly slaughter volumes; a 2022 pork-price case documents identical behaviour in hog markets.  The video asserts these supply squeezes add “hundreds of dollars per year” to the average family’s grocery bill and flow directly into restaurant POS terminals.  Simultaneously, the number of U.S. hog farms collapsed from 667,000 to 60,000 since 1980, while average herd size exploded and 99 % of farmed animals now live in concentrated animal-feeding operations that three-quarters of polled voters say they oppose.  Because Tyson supplies chicken to McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell and Burger King simultaneously, one quarterly production decision ripples through every drive-thru in the country.

---

### **[07:31 – 10:40]  Calorie-for-Calorie Rip-Off**  
Armed with a food-scale and a studio kitchen, Cassidy buys identical 8-piece nugget servings from McDonald’s, Chick-fil-A and the Austin-based chain P. Terry’s.  McDonald’s product: 386 calories, 20 g protein, 5.99-$6.49, 37-ingredient label.  Chick-fil-A: 250 calories, 27 g protein, $8.85, longer additive list.  P. Terry’s (antibiotic-free breast meat, hand-breaded in-store): 300 calories, 42 g protein, $5.00, six ingredients.  The pattern repeats in fast-casual: a Chipotle chicken bowl (510 cal, 44 g protein) costs $10.40 in Austin; the closest Sweetgreen build-your-own bowl (500 cal, 27 g protein) is $13.60.  The segment concludes that once marketing budgets and stock-buyback priorities replace ingredient spending, consumers pay 30-70 % more for 20-40 % less protein per dollar.

---

### **[10:40 – 13:20]  Franchisees Trapped Between Royalties & Record Rent**  
McDonald’s Corp. owns 55 % of its U.S. real estate and collects rent calculated as a **percentage of gross sales**, not of profit.  When headquarters urges a 15 % menu increase to cover soaring commodity and labour costs, the operator’s rent bill **automatically rises** even if traffic drops 10 %.  Fixed costs (royalty 4.5 %, advertising 4 %, mandated tech upgrades) leave the typical franchisee with a **5 % net margin** that lenders will not tolerate falling below.  The only dials left are labour hours (cut), patty weight (shrink), and add-on fees (delivery, service, “convenience”).  Cassidy interviews a multi-unit operator who says the **$12 Big Mac combo** killed the **low-income daily customer** McDonald itself trained for decades: “We got out over our skis and now we’re begging them to come back with a $5 value meal that barely covers our food cost.”

---

### **[13:20 – 15:50]  CEO-to-Worker Pay Insanity & the Tip Jar Take-over**  
SEC filings flash on screen: Starbucks CEO pay ratio = **7,000:1** versus median worker; the same executive earned **3,000:1** while running Chipotle.  Rather than channel margin gains into sustainable wages, chains have rolled out **20 % automatic tip prompts** at digital kiosks—the highest average gratuity rate of any restaurant segment.  RBI (Burger King parent) tells investors its **$400 million “Reclaim the Flame”** rebrand will include **“100 % kiosk stores”** and **“full digital labour scheduling”**—automation first, food quality second.  The video argues that the industry has **externalised labour cost onto the consumer** while maintaining **double-digit corporate operating margins**.

---

### **[15:50 – 18:30]  Independent Survival Mode & the $45 Sit-down**  
Mom-and-pop sit-down restaurants still account for **60 % of U.S. units** but only **~35 % of revenue**.  Lockdown debt, 18 % food inflation and supply-chain whiplash push plate costs so high that Cassidy’s neighbourhood **casual spots now average $45 per person** after tax and tip.  He can walk to **nine chain outlets**; only **two independents** remain busy, both forced onto **20 % auto-service-charge** models that price out weekly visits for anyone under six-figure income.  P. Terry’s counter-example is **deliberately lower per-customer margin**, higher throughput, beef sourced outside the Big-Four packers, and **open-book protein specs** posted above the shake machine—**“created the sandwich first, then asked what fair price moves the most units.”**

---

### **[18:30 – End]  Culture Erosion & the 2030 Meal Desert**  
Cassidy closes with a cultural argument: the **Seinfeld diner booth** becomes impossible when coffee costs $8 and tipping is compulsory.  He predicts that by 2030 the **bottom 80 % of earners** will simply **skip meals** rather than pay **$18 for a drive-thru combo**, accelerating a **“you will own nothing and be happy”** service economy where **community gathering spaces are replaced by app-based delivery pods**.  The plea: **scout the independents**, **say thank-you even if you can’t buy today**, **share names online**, and **“hold the line for the few places still pricing for community instead of spreadsheets.”**

1pq2jw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/finishing/comments/1pq2jw7/refinishing_walnut_tinting_sapwood/,Refinishing Walnut - tinting sapwood,"I picked up a solid walnut coffee table at a resale shop, just a few knicks and dings and though it would be easy to refinish. [Found an original retail listing](https://www.allmine.com/product/godenza-coffee-table-small-3).   
The first spot I tested sanding off the finish on the bottom of the legs went great. I was going to use Osmo Polyx Clear Satin. [I thought it looked good](https://i.imgur.com/SLKrsbZ.jpeg).     
I worked on another spot sanded down and using an iron and wet cloth to raise some dents, not recognizing the difference in the grain colors until after I applied the Osmo Polyx. [Image](https://i.imgur.com/7zWtsir.jpeg)  
After realizing I might I have sapwood and heartwood, I sanded another small spot between planks to confirm. I'm pretty sure I have sapwood edged planks glued to heartwood which creates a very abrupt transition without some sort of tint or stain [Sanded and dry](https://i.imgur.com/nAxXRhx.jpeg), [Wetted with alcohol](https://i.imgur.com/aKHXYdY.jpeg). The ease at which I sanded through the finish/color makes me think that this was some sort of surface tint, not a penetrating stain of any sort. [Overhead view of entire bottom of table](https://i.imgur.com/JEK2yCn.jpeg)  
     
So my question is how can I refinish (after repairing some other dents and dings) this table and get a uniformish look like the original. Mask and stain the sapwood? Find a lighter stain and just go over everything in layers? Some sort of after-finish tint? Note: I am not a woodworker, just someone who often lurks in /r/woodworking and got some ideas in his head.",2,1766092771.0,finishing,1,1.0,False

1pq2h2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1pq2h2i/disappointing_egg_freezing_cycle_only_got_2_eggs/,"Disappointing egg freezing cycle, only got 2 eggs :(","Not sure what I'm looking for here, maybe to vent, or to feel like this isn't unusual, or hoping next cycle will be better.

I'm 38 (39 in 4 months), AMH 1.26, with low Vitamin D (I'm on 5000IU supplements now plus prenatal) and my initial scan showed 9 follicles. So I knew I wasn't going to get a huge number, but decided to proceed anyway because some is better than none right?

It was quite last minute that I decided I wanted to do this, like in mid-November. So time for lifestyle changes was minimal. I wasn't taking vitamins, drank occasionally and drank a lot of coffee. As soon as I decided to do this I limited caffeine to 1 cup a day and took vitamins, didn't drink and changed up my diet a bit, but it probably wasn't long enough to make a difference.

I started Dec 5th and was on 300 Gonal, 150 menopur, clomid, cetrotide and pregnyl for the trigger.

Halfway through the cycle, they were noticing I was a slow responder, and asked me if I wanted to continue as they might only get 2-4 eggs at the rate I was going. I decided some was better than none and I couldn't get the money back for the meds anyway, also there was a cancellation fee, also due to my type of job I'm not allowed to go back to work until 2 weeks after the retrieval due to some weird rules with the medications, so I decided to proceed with low expectations.

The follicles started responding better later on in the cycle, and they were hoping for 4-6 eggs. My retrieval was today and there were able to get 3 eggs. The doctor seemed a bit disappointed and that she was hoping to get more. 2 of the eggs were mature, 1 they will try to mature overnight to see if it can be frozen. So worst case I end up with 2, best case I end up with 3.

To be honest, this wouldn't really phase me if I didn't have to take a whole month off of work (I'm on disability for the month due to this), and the out of pocket cost was about $16k for everything including the meds, plus the time off work (which I'm not even including in the $16k).

I'm wondering if it's even worth doing another cycle, taking a whole month off work again, footing the out of pocket cost for potentially another disappointing result.

I am kind of a fence sitter when it comes to having kids, and I haven't even met anyone I'd want to have kids with. But I had the money and for me this was more of an insurance policy in case I meet someone who I end up wanting to have kids with.

I knew with 2 cycles I probably wouldn't end up with the recommended 15-20 eggs, but the thought of doing 2 cycles, spending $32k, and ending up with 4-6 eggs total seems just like... so much money. I know you can get lucky with 1 egg, or have zero luck with 20. So it's hard to know what to do, think or feel in this situation.

I am leaning toward doing another cycle just because I can, but I don't think I can do more than that. But I don't know, maybe I'd just like to hear some success stories of bad first cycle or good second cycle? Or having success with a live birth just with a few eggs.

He approached job hunting as a sales process. Top funnel -> early interest -> conversations -> closing. Nothing too insightful here. However, right after applying, he'd message 3-5 people at the company (I think he was using some kind of tool to find relevant contacts/automate outreach), asking for coffee chats. 

Shockingly to me, 1 in 5 or so agreed to meet. During the ""coffee chat"", he sussed out who the hiring manager was, what they were looking for etc. and asked for an intro. And most agreed! 

  
I think he submitted 250 or so applications, had 15 or so ""coffee"" chats in 3 weeks, and eventually got to an offer by week 5.

1pq2cus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pq2cus/aio_about_red_flags_in_my_roommates_mothers/,AIO about red flags in my roommate's mother's relationship?,"I (F21) live with three total people. My best friend (22F), her youngest brother (M17), and their mother, (F43).

I landed in this living situation due to my parents kicking me out after not pursuing college. I work a job where I earn $15/hr and they refuse to employ me full time, so I do painting commissions on the side.

Unfortunately, the mother (We'll call her Edie) is going through a legal divorce. Edie has had many traumas in her life, including her first husband being a convicted murderer, being pregnant at 15, her second husband being an abusive manosphere alcoholic that broke up with her over the phone around a year and a half ago, etc. Essentially he is trying to drain her of all of her money through lengthy legal fees and a refusal to settle this respectfully. She works two (and at one point three!) jobs over the summer. My best friend (We'll call her Rose) and I both pay 25% of the rent and utilities, she pays for 50%.

So she has started dating this guy (M40) for probably about five or four months now. It is incredibly clear that he is autistic. He can hold something that I can only legally call a conversation, he's decently attractive to Edie, and he's very passionate about his art. These are the reasons I've been able to identify why Edie may consider him attractive.

However. He has a multitude of flaws that I genuinely cannot fathom that Edie has accepted. He barely eats, he drinks only black plain coffee. He smokes a cigarette every 2-3 hours, and permanently smells like it. He barely sleeps. No car. His appearance is that of a neurotic grown-up paperboy with a face that looks like a cross between Hugh Laurie and a bag of loose coal.

But the more pressing red flags were that he's not employed, he lives with his parents, and he has since essentially been at the house 24/7 when he's not fighting with Edie. He is never not here. I usually hide in my room, politely engage whenever he tries to make those 'conversations' but I genuinely hate it. They both drink and smoke so much that the ashtray hasn't been empty in weeks and there's not a single clean cup in the house.

Edie had found him through a dating app. She went on about 3 dates before with other men before finding him. On their first date- he completely ghosted her. When she prompted him for a response, he just said he was 'nervous'. They had one successful date after that, and he then ghosted her again for an entire week. Edie decided to go on a date with another man, and he called her right before he left, where she let slip where she was going. He then SHOWED UP AT HER DATE, AS IF HE WAS CATCHING HER CHEATING. She scolded him, and somehow that ended up being the inception of their relationship. I wish I was lying.

It wasn't until Edie told Rose and that he 'breaks up with her every week', accuses her of not being a communicator, of 'being terrible' to him. This culminated in the first incident where he was screaming at her in front of the house while she cried. Since, we've seen her cry and bemoan over his habit of shotgun break-ups repeatedly. As you can imagine, my sympathy is turning into disdain.

My best friend intended to gather family members together to talk to Edie about his behavior, until Edie found out about it early. She essentially went ballistic and claimed her daughter had betrayed her. She spun a few minimizing statements about his behavior, and they all pinned the plan on Rose. Due to this, the tension between Rose and Edie is extremely high on this subject, and Rose is no longer willing to try and organize anything again, which I find extremely understandable.

After that, we hadn't heard much about their conflicts from Edie, but he was over all the time again. He even gifted me one of his ugly paintings, which has found it's way to storage so I never have to look at it again.

But just last night, Rose and Edie were out shopping to spend time together. I was at home, until Rose texted me that Edie's boyfriend had broken up with her again- this time, 'for good'. This was the same day her other college-age children were coming home to visit, where she was so broken up that she couldn't do anything. I found out because she begged me to take one of my weed pens.

I allowed it, and I thought we were finally rid of him. But Edie told me he was calling her nonstop, I could hear her phone ringing. She told me he was texting her disgusting, sexual insults. That he was calling her horrific things. I wasn't able to read them myself, but I thought 'that's it, then, they're done.' She started talking about how 'when he's hungry, he just gets crazy, that's it', or 'when he's tired, he goes nuts', 'it's just the weed he said he'd quit doing', 'he probably has a cold', 'it's not really him', etc. 

But obviously the day has passed and the sun came up, and she's still with this awful man. Edie's mother has accepted abusive men into her life, kept them around, and everyone else has faced the consequences in the exact same way, and even she is trying to warn him. It's hard not to point out a pattern because it's such a clear one. She also mentioned she had a fucking PREGNANCY SCARE with this man.

If I'm an asshole, I'm really hoping you call me one. If I'm being judgemental, I really hope I am. I just hate that she is allowing this behavior for herself. 

Am I overreacting? And if I'm not, what do I do?",1,1766092308.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

# ""Alessandro Vieira: O Bolsonarista Moderado ou um Camaleão?""

**Introdução**

E aí, galera! Hoje vamos papear sobre o senador Alessandro Vieira, esse figura que tá dando o que falar por suas idas e vindas no cenário político. Sabe aquele amigo que vive mudando de opinião e você nem sabe mais em quem confiar? Pois é, é exatamente assim que a galera tem visto o Alessandro. Vamos dar uma espiada nessa história toda!

**Desenvolvimento**

Então, Alessandro Vieira, o “moderado”, tem se metido em várias polêmicas por conta de suas ações no Senado. Recentemente, ele levantou a voz contra a tal da PL da dosimetria, um projeto que, segundo ele, estava na cara abrindo as portas das cadeias para a galera da criminalidade. Ele foi lá, se disse super contra e até falou de como ia apresentar um novo texto porque o original era uma vergonha. Mas, adivinha? Na hora da votação, esse camaleão político mudou de ideia e resolveu apoiar o projeto!

Imagina o cenário: Alessandro, munido de seu discurso contra a tal da lei, do nada, decidiu que a maioria tinha que ser respeitada! E se foi lá, tirou o voto contra para votar a favor. Gente, isso não é só um desencontro de ideias, é uma mudança radical! Ele até se atreveu a sugerir que havia um plano secreto do governo para aprovar essa parada e que os senadores do PT estavam em conluio. Mermão, que reviravolta!

https://preview.redd.it/qeeo12tt218g1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6646f872690183078a1804498fc3627c8f80e82

Mas a história não para por aí, porque o “Batman” da política, se tornou rapidamente o “Coringa”. O Lula, que segundo o Alessandro estaria de acordo com o projeto, veio a público e disse que iria vetá-lo. E aí, meu amigo? A cara de quem estava tentando fazer um deal foi pra água! Alessandro viu seus planos ruírem, enquanto a ministra Gleisi Hoffmann e os colegas do PT jogaram a real.

E olha, essa não é a primeira vez que ele dá uma dessas. Lembrando que ele veio do bolsonarismo, né? Ele foi eleito em 2021 meio que puxando a sardinha pra esse lado. E quando foi candidato ao governo de Sergipe, estava atacando o STF pra todo lado. Agora, ele tenta se posicionar como um moderado, mas está parecendo mais um político que simplesmente tenta agradar todo mundo para se manter na boa.

O que a galera tem dito é que a incoerência dele é quase palpável. Ele é como aquele amigo que fala que vai te apoiar sempre, mas na hora do vamos ver, é o primeiro a desistir. E sabe qual é a verdadeira jogada? Ele quer se reeleger em Sergipe, onde a concorrência é bem acirrada. Tem uma galera da direita se candidatando e ele sabe que se não agradar, vai ser difícil seguir na política.

**Conclusão**

Então, é isso, pessoal! Alessandro Vieira tá na dança das cadeiras, mudando de lado como se não houvesse amanhã. O negócio é ficar de olho nessas movimentações porque, no fim das contas, a verdadeira política acontece nos bastidores e as promessas muitas vezes são só isso: promessas. E aí, vamos continuar acompanhando esse desenrolar de novela. Quem sabe a próxima cena não é a dele caindo de vez?

1pq2b6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pq2b6c/in_an_alternative_universe/,In an alternative universe,"We were supposed to make a life together. You support my dreams. I support your dreams. Together we hold each other accountable, optimistic, and realistic. We were meant to be each other's special person through it all. 

Every good, every bad, every step of the way.

I was waiting for you. You made it sound as if you were finalising your business there. As if it was a matter if days, or just a few weeks 'til you were back. As if the only thing stopping you for making us official, was the distance. You said it would be wonderful when screens were no longer our method of communication. What the hell happened? 

We could have had a physical house together, you know? Until we found something we both liked in an area we both liked - that forever home. We could have stayed in my grandparent's old house. Paid a rent that didn't break the bank. If we respected the place and helped fix it up for a good sale... it could have been our space. I know you're so handy and you'd have been able to sort every plumbing, electrical and building issue out. 

Nothing huge, nothing expensive. No mansions or state of the art universal light controls and touch-sensitive cupboards. Walls would have had to be painted. A new stove would have had to be bought - I would have argue electric because it makes me feel safer than dealing with gas and you'd have argued for gas because it's cheaper and if/when loadshedding hit, there'd be a way to warm food and water. The garden needed TLC, but gardening together would been amazing. We could have filled the house with second-hand items we would fix ourselves. I wanted to buy us a new bed - king sized so that we could both finally plop down with all the space in the world... and I'd still crawl up closely against you. A dog. A cat. Furbabies we'd love, train, and spoil. As a start to a life together, we could have moved into my grandparent's house, started settling, together.

You have travelled around the world, jumping from place to place, trying to find somewhere to call your own. Your house. Your home. We wouldn't have anything fancy, but we'd have had a home. A place you could call your own. A home for you and me. I wanted to be your home.

Instead, you disappeared. Disappeared, to hop from place to place. Pulled me from my roots and left me dangling in the wind. Dangling, but stuck in a tar. Everything all at once. You were meant to calm the storm inside of me, quiet the hurricane in my mind.

I know I could have handled us better too... I was just so cautious and nervous. I worry. I overthink. But maybe if I had been more open to talking about you to the people in my life. I mean, you know at least my one good friend knew about you - we were on a call together when I quickly dropped something off by her place for my nephew. She wanted the gossip. She thought we were going to be double dating soon. 

I was so excited for you to come back to the city. To be close. To introduce you to my family and friends. Petrified and scared... but... you don't know how I was preparing myself. I know we would have a bit of a fight on our hands with the age difference. I know my parents would raise their eyebrows and be unhappy. But age would probably come second to us sharing different views on the existence of God. I don't know how we'd navigate that, but I was ready to try. If they saw how calm you made me, how you looked out for me, how safe and special you made me feel... if they saw how you provided and supported me.... I was just waiting for you to come back. Waiting to pick you up from the bus station or airport. 

We brought out so much good in each other. 

I wanted that intimate wedding with you. To say ""I do"" to you. For you to say ""I do"" to me.

A little bit of Greek Orthodox, a little bit of Roman Catholic, a little bit of Protestant, a little bit of ""marriage is just a legal binding"". 
We both have out battles with religion and faith. I don't known how the church would receive it all. Let's imagine there aren't limitations, that there aren't ceremony ""flow"" issues. A mixture of elements, weaving together our ancestry, and our preferences as individuals. 

Our small families, our close friends. Well, you being a extrovert happy to talk to anyone, would probably need more space for the people you'd invite. No ""bride's side"" and ""groom's side"" - everyone just welcome to sit together. In a church? In nature? In a little chapel on a farm? I don't know. 

Rose gold, a colour we both like. Gentle, romantic, light pinks. Refreshing, calm mints.

Maybe a princess neckline, or a deep plunge, or a halterneck, for me. Long, delicate see-through sleeves. A skirt part with a bit of a proof: ballgown, princess. A long veil, trailing on the ground. 

You, in a 3-piece suit. Tie and pocket square in matching satin. You'd look so exceptionally handsome in a waistcoat. I love you in white - against your naturally tanned skin, those dark brown eyes that sometimes look black in the dark, blending with your naturally lightening hair - maybe a white shirt. A little bee charm on your pocket.

After you asking his blessing for my hand... my dad, the most amazing man it the universe, would walk me down the isle and hand me to you, trusting you to care and protect me for the rest of our days. 

I always thought handfasting was beautiful. My ancestors must have done it. Perhaps some of yours too. Cords in our colours, tying us wrist to wrist and pulse to pulse together. 

Stefana, fashioned from olive branches and vine leaves, placed on our heads, taking our first steps as husband and wife. A church bell. 

Melktertjies, koeksusters, ystervartjies, bom casados, brigadeiro (of course, not made by me because when I did try, it was an ooey gooey sickly sweet mess) and bonbonniere lining a table in odd numbers, inviting guests to take in 5s.

A moment of magic, a moment of fantasy, the moment we take our first dance. I don't care if it's choreographed, or if it's just swaying. As long as I'm in your arms, I'm happy.
A daddy and daughter dance. A mother-in-law and son-in-law dance. And on to the sirtaki we go to get everyone involved! A ikariotikos, a kalamatianos! Throw on sokkie and langarm music! Throw on that EDMing music you like! Just make sure I get my rock 'n roll hour, okay? 

As long as there is sugar, I know you won't mind if it's a wedding cake or wedding cupcakes. I like the cupcakes be cause I think they're a bit easier to handle. The idea of cutting a cake together, and feeding each other a little slice, it fabulously cute though. Maybe it should be a double-layered cake: death-by-chocolate for you and a light vanilla for me. Nothing messy... I think we'd both be annoyed being covered in frosting!

I wouldn't want your groomsmen to cut up your tie and auction it off because I want to be the one to slip your wedding tie from your neck.... Would it be acceptable for your brethren to cut a second, identical, tie? 

I wanted to support you every step of the way. Every business ventures, every design, every excitement. Realistic, of course, offer constructive criticism... sometimes your brain worked so hard and so far ahead that you just needed to be brought back to the present. But how amazing your mind is, how many ideas you have and how brave you are and dedicated to better yourself and the world. I saw my dad's business succeed, with the support and encouragement from my mother and her parents. Don't you know you would have had that from us too? I was your biggest fan. I might still be, even after you cracked and split my heart.

You made my head spin and made me think of things that had never bothered me before. 
If you wanted children... we were meant to try together. 

I know you would have been an amazing dad. You would have fought and defended your child(ren) - tough exterior, but a heart full of compassion. 

I heard that pang of pain when we spoke about whether you wanted children - if you weren't worried about not being able to spend decent time and have amazing adventures together because of excessive age gaps. And I did understand that viewpoint... you lived that life as a young boy too.
You pulled at my heartstrings and for the first time, I allowed myself to imagine, what if. What if I faced my demons? What if I tackled medical issues? With you at my side, with us taking it on together. What if I maybe perhaps could possibly have wanted my own children... with you? 

We would have hoped that making love is enough. Every bit of science, every bit of wives' tales. If we struggle, we don't need to debate IVF procedures. We both put in the work. Every stupid injection, panic attack, cramp, dizzy spell - you're like a personal doctor. It would have been now or never... if children were in our future, it had to happen within the next 5 years. Do you know what an absolutely scary thought that was? 

And YOU made me think that. Feel that.

In an alternative universe, we relax in the lounge. We sink into the L-shaped couch, my head on your lap, binge watching one of the hundreds of zombie series. It is low effort comfort, the kind where time disappears and nothing else is required of us. I play National Theatre Live recordings of Frankenstein - we watch both versions, discuss the differences between Jonny Lee Miller and Benedict Cumberbatch's interpretations and performances as Victor Frankenstein and Creature.

In an alternative universe, we grocery shop together. You insist we always have Greek yoghurt, cucumbers, honey, Neapolitan ice cream and potatoes for air-fried chips. I insist on mascarpone and ricotta with sun-dried tomato and basil pesto, chicken breasts, pineapple, salt and vinegar chips, and carrots. We are both happy with this arrangement. I read labels and compare prices. You wander off and return with something unfamiliar, insisting we try it. We compromise, one sensible choice and one impulsive one. At the checkout, I reorganise the bags so nothing gets crushed. You make small talk with the cashier. It is ordinary. It feels like belonging.

In an alternative universe, we embrace a domesticated life together. We take turns cooking, playing a Spotify playlist and dancing around the kitchen while chopping carrots and onions. If you mess with my bread dough, I shower you in flour. The washing machine beeps and you decide it is the perfect summer day to wash all the protectors and blankets. I leave you to it because you are particular. I wash the dishes. We talk about everything and nothing.

In an alternative universe, we drive with no real destination. I control the playlist, jumping between nostalgic songs and something new. You drum your fingers on the steering wheel. We talk about childhood memories, the strange ones we do not usually share. The road feels endless in the best way. One of your hands rests on my thigh. If you move it any further, I make you turn down a quiet farm or mountain road.

In an alternative universe, I sneak back to our seats just in time for the race start. Coke and a lamb/beef gyro in hand for you, cream soda and a chicken döner for me. The engines rev and the cars speed off. We cheer, sitting on the edge of our seats. You explain how the mechanics work. I offer a few physics facts of my own.

In an alternative universe, we host friends for dinner. Yours and mine, people from all different walks of life. The table is mismatched but full. The food is not perfect, but everyone eats seconds. You move through the room easily, comfortable and confident, while I hover and check if people need anything. At the end of the night, we clean up together, tired and content. Social butterfly you is ready for the next gathering. Introverted hedgehog me is ready to hibernate.

In an alternative universe, it is a quiet Sunday morning. The windows are open just enough to let the breeze carry in birdsong and distant traffic. I am half asleep, curled toward the warm space you left behind. You return with two mugs, sweet coffee for you and citrus tea for me, no milk and no sugar, exactly how I like it. You smile your sweet crooked smile, your eyes wrinkle ip a bit. We barely speak. We do not need to. The day stretches ahead without urgency.

In an alternative universe, I am working at the table. I do snail mail crafting and watercolour painting. You sit nearby with your laptop, watching videos about coding apps and building your ideas into something real. Sometimes I think you are naive and too optimistic, but I love how you always see the light and keep moving forward.

In an alternative universe, we volunteer together. At least one day a month we go to the local animal shelter to play with and walk the furbabies. Another day we help at the church or community soup kitchen. We might not have much money, but we give time, and that makes a difference to someone.

In an alternative universe, we don't have a financial care in the world. We have all we need, and can want. We have billions and we can spend it on organisations doing good, providing for friends and family, and share random acts of monetary kindness daily. 

In an alternative universe, I pull you away from everyone else for a bit of TLC. You always do things for other people. You need a break. I put a kawaii bright pink headband on you, steam your face, and let hot water run down your back. Carefully and gently, I shave your beard and moustache with a cut-thriat blade. I take my time and make sure I do a decent job. You finally just breathe. You slow down. I choose a clay mask for you. You let me follow a 10-step skincare routine on your face. You know it makes me happy, and you enjoy it as well. 

In an alternative universe, I am sore and exhausted. I lie face down on the bed after a long day, my back and hips angry from running around and standing too long. You melt some of my French pear massage candle oil and drop the wax onto my back. You pess your palms into my skin, slow and knowing. Your nursing knowledge is exactly what my body needs. The pressure is welcomed. The physical touch is healing.

In an alternative universe, I am sick on the couch. Wrapped in too many blankets, half asleep. You keep checking my temperature like it might change if you look often enough. You make soup from scratch even though there is a perfectly good packet in the cupboard. You lay out my meds and pretend not to notice when I fall asleep mid-sentence.

In an alternative universe, we argue. Quietly and respectfully. No raised voices. No cruel words. No swearing. No dragging the past into the present. We pause when emotions spike, take space when needed, and always come back. Even when we disagree, we never doubt that we are on the same side.

In an alternative universe, I am overwhelmed and spiralling. My anxiety is loud and relentless. My chest pounds and my hands tremble. You do not try to fix it immediately. You sit with me on the floor, backs against the couch, breathing slowly until I can match your rhythm. You remind me that I am allowed to rest, that I am safe in your arms, and that you will protect me.

In an alternative universe, we finish our studies. Maybe we knew what we wanted earlier in life. Maybe not. But we are content with our career choices. We even find a way to combine our skills and talents into something shared.

In an alternative universe, we travel Greece together. Santorini, Crete, Milos, and hidden beach gems only you know about. We spend our days in the sun and sea. I nag you to wear sunscreen while I hide my pale, vampire skin in the shade. Some mornings we walk silently along the shore, hand in hand, breathing in salt air and listening to waves. Some days are for swimming, snorkelling, or scuba diving. Late afternoons are for lookout points and gelato stops. You make every ice cream pun imaginable. The shop owners laugh. I blush, fighting social anxiety, but stay because I want kaimaki with far too much cherry syrup and a scoop of double chocolate brownie. You leave with an absurdly tall stack of scoops, every flavour possible.

In an alternative universe, we country hop together. We discover new foods, languages, nature, architecture, cultures and people. You cross borders easily with your three passports. My boring one gives us headaches. You are relaxed and adaptable. Your elephant memory recalls the strangest and most wonderful details about places and people. I make lists, schedules and maps. If we walk through Hyde Park at 07:30, we are there at 07:30. We speed walk to Trafalgar Square. We sit early for the choir at St Martin-in-the-Fields. We arrive at the theatre well before The Lion King begins. I stress about time and perfection. You take my hand and remind me that a few minutes here and there do not matter.

In an alternative universe, your parents are still here.
We go on outings together and share long meals. Your mom makes traditional Brazilian food and always makes sure there is calamari for me, because she knows it is the only seafood I eat. She teaches me basic Brazilian so we can gossip about you and your dad when you are being silly. In this universe, the darkness that sits in your chest does not exist. You have time, real time, to make more memories with them. And you want me in those memories too.

In an alternative universe, Christmas is special. The table is set for six, my parents, my siblings and her partner, me, and a place for you. The tree glows. Presents sit underneath, with extra treats tucked into each furbaby’s bag because you love the cats more than you admit. My mother and I prepare the vegetables and salads. My dad and you carve the lamb. Desserts arrive with my sibling and her partner. We wear silly hats and festive headbands. After years of spending Christmas alone or drifting between places, you have a seat that is always yours. We chose each other as family.

In an alternative universe, there is a tiny body between us. We lie on a king-size bed on a cool, rainy day, facing each other, close enough to touch. I drape my leg over yours. You kiss my forehead. Between us sleeps a little dark-haired girl with your brown eyes and thick hair. She has my sharp nose and both of our hooded eyelids. Ballet shoes rest near the bed. She wears a tutu and a crocheted beanie shaped like an old pilot’s hat. She dreams of airplanes and pirouettes. She is her daddy’s girl, bold, friendly, already full of personality.

In an alternative universe, early morning cries wake the house. You say you will check and I drift back to sleep. A fox teddy rescue, a bottle of milk, and gentle rocking later, the house is quiet again. When I wake, the bed is empty. I find you on the couch, asleep with our son on your chest. His tiny fingers curl into your chest hair. He listens to your heartbeat. I cover you both with a light blanket and kiss your foreheads. It is your turn to rest. When you wake, there will be pancakes waiting, worthy of sweet tooths and twin smiles.

In an alternative universe, not a day goes by that you don't kiss me. Every day your lips meet mine. You hold me close. My fingers running through your salt and pepper hair. You gently brush my auburn brown hair from my face, curling it around your fist and holding my head stead. You touch me. You make me sigh. You see to my physical touch, quality time and acts of service needs. 

In an alternative universe, nothing dramatic happens - no big milestones, no grand gestures. Just days stacked on days. Chosen. Shared. Steady. And somehow, that’s everything.

In an alternative universe, you haven't broken my heart. You haven't shattered my soul. I don't cry myself to sleep at night. I love you endlessly. You love me back.

But this is this universe. I loved you - love you. You don't love me. And you did break my heart. ",8,1766092196.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.9,False

There’s this weird, almost poetic vibe about pulling out your phone in a cramped, noisy train and suddenly . bam . you’re looking at the vast, golden horizons of New Hanover. It’s like you’re stealing a piece of another world and tucking it into your pocket. Everyone around me is doom scrolling through brain rot TikToks or answering boring work emails, and here I am, watching Arthur Morgan stare into a sunset that’s bleeding over the edges of my screen. It feels like I’m holding a dream in my hands.

It’s not even about the tech or the cloud gaming stuff anymore. It’s the contrast that hits different. You’re surrounded by the smell of stale coffee and city noise, but your thumbs are navigating the dead silence of a snowy mountain pass. There’s something about having the screen that close to your face... it makes the details feel sharper, idk. Like, the texture of the leather saddle or the way the light catches a rusty cattleman revolver feels way more personal when it’s right there in your palms.

Even at home, sometimes I just don’t want to sit upright in front of a TV. I just wanna curl up on the couch, forget the world exists, and hunt some legendary animals in Owanjila while I’m half asleep. It’s about taming this massive, brutal world and making it a personal companion that goes wherever you go. Whether you’re waiting at the barber or just killing time outside, RDR2 on mobile isn't just a ""portable version"" it’s a middle finger to being stuck in one place.

Honestly, it’s wild we live in a time where a literal visual masterpiece fits in your hand. Every time I lock my phone and look up at the real world, I feel like I just stepped out of a time machine.

    (a Morningwood Story)
    
    
    Epilogue
    
    
    October, four months later.
    
    
    Cody stood in the kitchen of the apartment he now shared with
    Alex--yes, that Alex. His best friend and now roommate.
    
    
    After their trip to New York in June, Chase found out that he would be
    working remotely for the tech company he worked for. Within just a few
    weeks, he and Jake figured that it was the right time to try something
    new, so they decided to move to Brooklyn.
    
    
    At first, Cody thought that this would completely turn his world upside
    down. He had just started to really come into his own, and now his
    brother was moving away! After plenty of reassurance from Jake and
    promises of many visits from Chase, he finally accepted it. They agreed
    that Cody would sublet the apartment, and Alex moved in right after Chase
    and Jake moved out.
    
    
    Now, four months later, life felt like it was back to normal for Cody. He
    felt at ease in the neighborhood. Alex had helped him get a job in a new
    bar that catered to others in the industry, and Cody loved getting to
    meet all kinds of people each night.
    
    
    Since Chase and Jake left, their kickball team was down two players, so
    Cody and Alex stepped up and joined. He loved getting to spend his
    Saturdays with the team, and it felt like he was still connected to Chase
    and Jake through the other players.
    
    
    Cody even went on a few real dates with Zach, but they ended up deciding
    that they were better off as friends, though they continued to hook up
    occasionally after a kickball game here and there.
    
    
    Cody loved his life and he felt like he was finally able to be himself.
    Standing in the kitchen, he caught his reflection in the big glass
    window. He looked hot, he thought to himself. His upper body was getting
    even bigger, with his wide shoulders in stark contrast to his narrow,
    trim waist. His legs had always been his best asset, and now they were
    undeniably thick. His thighs were bulging out of every pair of shorts he
    owned, though right now, his attention was on his ass.
    
    
    He was wearing only a jockstrap as he stood in the kitchen, waiting for
    his coffee to brew. It was a black Nike jockstrap that had belonged to
    Jake.
    
    
    ""Keep this to remember me by,"" Jake had said as they were packing up.
    ""It's the one I was wearing the first time you caught me jerking off
    here.""
    
    
    Cody thought back to that day as he ran his hands over his ass and then
    squeezed his growing bulge. He liked knowing that he filled out the
    jockstrap just as nicely as Jake had.
    
    
    Alex wandered in from the bathroom, hair wet from the shower, a towel
    barely clinging to his waist.
    
    
    ""Stop touching yourself!"" Alex said. ""Or at least stop touching
    yourself when I'm not around to touch, too!"" He took his towel and
    swatted at Cody, snapping him back to reality.
    
    
    ""Hey, watch it!"" Cody replied, grabbing Alex's cock and giving it a
    gentle tug. ""If you leave a bruise, then I'm not gonna fuck you for at
    least a week!""
    
    
    ""Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before,"" Alex said. ""When's your
    brother getting in? I'm ready to party!""
    
    
    ""Their plane should be landing any minute,"" Cody replied, picking up his
    phone to check for messages. ""I'm so fucking glad they decided to fly
    down for Pride!""
    
    
    Alex sank to his knees and pulled down Cody's jockstrap. His big cock
    flopped out, and Alex immediately started sucking it. Within a minute,
    Cody was fully hard, barely fitting inside of Alex's mouth. He looked
    out the window, reminiscing about all the times he was down at Piedmont
    Park with Chase and Jake. His hands absentmindedly tousled Alex's hair,
    guiding his head back and forth.
    
    
    Daily blowjobs were one of the perks of having such a slutty roommate,
    and Cody and Alex had fallen into a routine rather quickly. Alex would
    smell the coffee brewing, and he would know that he had about 10 minutes
    before Cody would be finished with his cup.
    
    
    Today, though, Cody wanted more than just a blowjob. He reached under
    Alex's arms and lifted him up. Cody leaned in for a quick kiss and then
    turned him around to face the kitchen island.
    
    
    ""Bend over,"" he growled.
    
    
    Alex stretched his torso out on top of the countertop, reaching forward.
    Cody got on his knees and spread Alex's hairless ass, exposing his tight
    hole. Leaning in, Cody began to rim him, darting his tongue back and
    forth, in and out. After a minute or two, Cody stood and lined his cock
    up with Alex's now-wet hole.
    
    
    ""Do it,"" Alex said.
    
    
    Cody pushed in, finding very little resistance on Alex's part. He
    started fucking him quickly, knowing they didn't have much time.
    
    
    Just as he was really beginning to pound Alex, his phone rang. Chase was
    FaceTiming him.
    
    
    ""Hey, big bro!"" Cody answered the call, holding the phone up so only
    his face was in view. ""I guess y'all just landed?""
    
    
    ""Yeah!"" Chase beamed, his voice energetic. ""We're unloading right
    now, shouldn't be much longer.""
    
    
    ""I'm about to unload too,"" Cody said as he panned the phone down and
    showed Chase what exactly he was in the middle of at this moment.
    
    
    ""Oh fuck,"" Chase said, quieter than before. ""Babe, look at this,"" he
    said as he passed the phone to Jake.
    
    
    ""Oh yeah, that's my boy!"" Jake said proudly. ""Don't go too hard on
    him, we might need an extra hole later tonight.""
    
    
    ""Stop teasing and just fuck me when you get here!"" Alex yelled, his
    face still pressed against the island.
    
    
    ""Hey, bro, I'm about to cum, wanna watch?"" Cody asked as Chase's face
    came back onto the screen. They were off the plane now, and it looked
    like Chase and Jake were standing off to the side, away from others.
    
    
    ""Oh yeah, little brother, show me how good you can fuck his ass,"" Chase
    said, still quiet enough so that no one would overhear him.
    
    
    Cody held the phone in one hand and gripped Alex's shoulder with the
    other as he began to pound him fiercely. After a few thrusts, he let out
    a boisterous groan and shoved himself deep inside of Alex.
    
    
    ""Fuck yeah!"" Chase and Jake both said in a hushed cheer.
    
    
    ""OK, guys, I'll finish up here and meet you at the Arrivals Terminal in
    a few!""
    
    
    ""All right! We've still got to go through baggage claim. See you
    soon!"" Chase said as he ended the call.
    
    
    Cody slowly pulled out of Alex after his orgasm subsided. ""Now what was
    that you were saying earlier about wanting to party?""
    
    
    Alex smirked. ""I just meant your big ol' bed is probably about to get a
    lot of action this weekend.""
    
    
    ""Well, I offered to bunk with you for the weekend, since I know you
    can't get enough of me,"" Cody said as he jabbed a punch at Alex's
    side, ""but Chase said he'd rather the three of us just pile into my bed
    together.""
    
    
    ""I saw the video from New York, hun,"" Alex grinned mischievously, ""and
    I know Chase is gonna be begging for Round 2 before he gets both feet in
    the door!""
    
    
    Cody's face turned bright red. He hadn't told anyone except Alex about
    hooking up with his brother and Jake. Honestly, he knew Alex found it
    incredibly hot.
    
    
    ""Hey, who knows,"" Cody said as he grabbed a pair of thin running shorts
    and a tank top, ""maybe this time Jake will let you film all three of
    us.""
    
    
    Cody stuck out his tongue and laughed as he grabbed his keys. ""If you
    clean the kitchen up, I promise I'll give you a present later.""

My ex is 31 and we broke up four years ago after dating for about eight months. It wasn't a bad breakup, just kind of fizzled out. But before we split, he'd been really into photography and convinced me to do some ""artistic"" photos. I was 25, stupid, and thought I was in love. The pictures started innocent but ended up pretty explicit. He promised they were just for him, that he'd never show anyone, and like an idiot I believed him.

When we broke up I asked him to delete everything. He said he did. I blocked him on everything and moved on with my life. Met my husband a year later, fell hard, got married. I never told my husband about those pictures because honestly I'd convinced myself they didn't exist anymore.

Last Tuesday I got a text from a number I didn't recognize. ""Hey, been thinking about you. Coffee sometime?""

I knew immediately it was my ex. Don't ask me how, I just did. I didn't respond, blocked the number, and figured that was that.

Then yesterday my husband came home early from work. He didn't say anything, just walked past me into the kitchen. I followed him and there were printed photos spread across the entire kitchen table. Every single picture I'd ever taken with my ex. Full color, high resolution, probably twenty photos total.

I actually thought I was going to throw up.

My husband was just standing there with his arms crossed. His face was completely blank which somehow made it worse. He said ""I got an email this morning. Anonymous sender. Every single one of these attached with a message that said 'Ask your wife about last Tuesday.'""

I tried to explain. Told him these were from years before we even met, that I'd blocked my ex everywhere, that I had no idea he still had them. My husband cut me off and said ""Last Tuesday. What happened last Tuesday?""

I showed him the blocked number, the single text message. He looked at it for maybe five seconds and said ""You could have told me about this years ago. Instead I had to find out when some psycho decided to blow up our marriage.""

I kept trying to talk but he wouldn't listen. He said he'd already spoken to a lawyer, that the papers would be ready by Friday, and that he'd be staying at his brother's place until I could move out. I told him that was insane, that I hadn't done anything wrong, that this was revenge from a crazy ex. He said it didn't matter because I'd lied by omission for our entire relationship.

He packed a bag and left. That was sixteen hours ago and he won't answer my calls.

I'm sitting here surrounded by printed photos of myself from four years ago wondering how my marriage just ended because I was too embarrassed to mention some stupid pictures I took when I was basically a kid. My ex hasn't responded to any of my messages asking why he'd do this. I reported him to the police for harassment but they said unless he keeps contacting me there's nothing they can do.

My sister says I should have been honest with my husband from the start. That if I'd told him when we got serious this never would have blindsided him like this. But how was I supposed to know my ex was keeping everything this whole time, just waiting to destroy my life?

I don't even know what I'm asking. I guess, was I wrong for not telling my husband about those pictures before we got married?

A new girl joined my group that is very nice & cool. She hangs out with girls from another group, which I dont see very often due to different schedules. In this group, there is a girl that I really like, lets call her F & there are a few occassions that I hope she feels the same. We've met through this common girl we know, so she knows me & we also follow each other in socials. Here is a breakdown of the events in chronological order:

1) In a lesson, my group & F's group were together. F had a book with a disney princess on it, which I noticed. I commented in a funny but cool way about it, & she bantered with me about it back & forth. 

2) I was with 2 friends of mine in a hang out spot for a coffee. 2 tables to my left, F was sitting there with her friends. At some point, a person sitting next to me, tapped me in the shoulder & said: ""hey man, this girl wants to know where you' re from"". I look & the girl he talked about was F, giggling in a funny way, lets say. I didnt say anything, cause maybe she was joking, so I just laughed too & continued my conversation.

3) Before a morning lesson, we all sat in a corridor waiting for the prof. to arrive. I sat with my group & in front of me sat F with her friend from my group. When she sat she looked at me & together with her friend, F said ""Good morning, wont you say hello to us?"" In the same way when we bantered about her book. So I responded in a smart way & again we bantered for like 2 minutea, before she left for a separate room

4) In a lecture, while I was sitting down, I noticed F standing in a wall to my left around 6m distance from me. So I looked towards, her way & she saw me, smiled & waved her hand in a hello gesture. I did the same to her. After a while, I kept looking towards her. At some point, she was talking to her friend in her ear, & at that point I looked at her. Our gazes again found each other & she continued speaking to her friend, while keeping eye contact for a good amount of lets say 15s. 

Now, these are very minor events, maybe they dont mean anything. So, in your opinion, is there a possibility she is interested to me?

You’ve orbited me for years and given me Mr. Darcy  behaviour. You longingly looking at me across the room, cloaking me, smiling at me and teasing me. You act like a school boy around me and honestly, I love it. The dopamine loop is intoxicating.

It’s been beyond intense and it hasn’t been comfortable for me, while it’s been safe for you. It’s been insanely confusing and deregulating. Your special attention without action or a conversation has created a lot of guilt within me. Self blame around your loneliness. Self sabotage because I desire you. You fed something within me slowly and then denied me clarity when I asked for it.

Your post orbiting was not kindness. It was painful. Orbiting without commitment is safe for you and harmful for me. You are not allowed to keep this door ajar. Know, this will be a boundary.

You know, this is a once in a lifetime connection for you. I say this confidently, nothing else will ever compare mentally. You‘re “so so stupid, so very very stupid.” Even if you don’t want to go out for coffee or dinner to talk about our vibe, I deserved a real answer to my card. Not deflection and ambiguity. We’ll stay professional. Just know I’m not waiting for you at all.

I am not your play thing. I am not your ego boost. I am an amazing catch and if anyone teased you about it, please know jealousy is a green eyed monster. I want to be humble however we both know what I am. I am a woman who people walk up to and comment on my beauty, we both know I’m unusually smart, I have professional level culinary skill, I’m really good at my job, I make you laugh and we have similar interests and we both have baggage. Do you enjoy being miserable? A martyr of your own self inflicted wounds?

Or have you been dating someone and still hooked to me like cat nip. That’s why there is spurts of engagement with periods of silences. You’re passively aggressively avoidant and therefore cannot end this relationship with the other person yourself. Yet, your relationship will fail because now I take up even more furniture in your brain. You will eventually make her leave. I am your internal fixation and it will haunt you.

You know this is true to the marrow within your bones.

Now, I will rotate myself away. You no longer deserve my proximity that you have not earned. You will receive neutral cordial professionalism. As this is what your text advised me of yesterday.

I’m happy I went there it’s freeing. I no longer feel like I’m responsible for wasting your life. You’re wasting it independently of me.

Warm Regards,

It’s obvious…

Thanks to everyone taking the time to read and share feedback, I really appreciate it.

While I’m waiting for the extruder hardware to arrive, I’m focusing on the step before extrusion:

how to prepare failed prints and scraps in a fully DIY, home-friendly way.

At the same time, I’m also redesigning my puller to be optimized for:

\- air / water cooling before pulling

\- filament diameter measurement using a dial indicator before entering the puller

Current approach for scrap preparation (intentionally low-tech):

\- failed prints are pre-cut by hand

\- shredded using a basic coffee grinder (short pulses, cooling between runs)

\- material is then sieved to remove dust and oversized pieces

\- only reasonably uniform granules go to the extruder

\- a mesh screen is used as a safety filter, not as a fix-all solution

This is obviously not an industrial process and it’s not meant to be fast.

The goal at this stage is:

\- repeatability

\- predictable extrusion behavior

\- something a normal hobbyist could realistically replicate at home

Early observations so far:

\- running the grinder too long creates dust and heat (bad idea)

\- short pulses + sieving give much more consistent results

\- consistency upstream matters more than trying to fix issues in the extruder

I’m still in early testing, but I wanted to share the process and get feedback from people who may have tried something similar.

Questions:

\- what granule size worked best for you when extruding recycled PLA?

\- any DIY-friendly tricks to reduce dust during shredding?

==================================

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: March 9th, 2130.*

*\[6.5 hours until Operation Voidwhisper\]*

***Memory Transcription Subject: Theodore Grant, Drill Instructor of the Boarding and Sabotaging Squadron Training Facility.***

The venlil squad left the simulation room with a defeated look. It was clear that they expected some harsh scolding.

Luckily for them, I never believed that yelling actually solved things, having grown up in a household with extremely strict but respectful parents certainly helped.

""Raise your heads, soldiers, stop cowering in fear."" I spoke up, my tone strict, but without any kind of emotion embued into it.

This 'kindness' was, apparently, something shocking to them. But they recomposed themselves regardless.

""Vasti and Zenyl."" I started, both of them immediately straightening themselves up.

""Your performance was... Not as bad as I was thinking it would be. Overall, you both did a good enough job, although you're still rough at the edges in some aspects alongside the rest of your team.

*However*, there was one glaring mistake that got both of you 'killed' in the simulation, do you know what it was?""

""...I hesitated, that allowed the enemies to take advantage of us."" Zenyl muttered, not meeting my gaze.

""...The same here, I hesitated. Vasti spoke up too.

""Why did you hesitate?""

""I wasn't sure whether I could take aim and fire at the enemy before he could pull the trigger of his own gun, sir."" Zenyl responded.

""And you?"" I asked Vasti.

""...My aim was shaky due to adrenaline. Hitting something as small as the head of that bandit from 30 meters away was beyond what I could do reliably, I'm afraid.""

""Hm, alright, that should be able to fix, just gotta improve your stamina and your aiming."" I mumbled while rubbing my chin.

""And you two."" I spoke up once again, this time directing my attention to Roldn and Vyrt.

""Roldn, you died because you just decided to *rush* into the room, *why did you do that?* Are you stupid?""

He grunted, ""I guess I'm, sir, I let anxiety get the better of me, time was running out, decided to try and speed things up by rushing in, got gunned down as a result, sorry about that.""

""You shouldn't apologize to me, you should apologize *to your colleagues*, had you followed your training and waited for the others, you might've been able to win."" I corrected him before turning my attention to the last member of their squad.

""And you, Vyrt?""

""Got too confident, sir, I should've ducked behind cover between the bursts, though I can't help but feel like I could've dropped them faster and survived if my aim was better."" He admitted.

I sighed. ""Whelp, there it is, you acknowledge where you failed, that being said, I managed to spot two glaring issues on all of you: Lack of endurance and a very bad aim. The first one can be fixed with physical training, though I'm certain you will never be able to match a human in terms of stamina, the lack of thereof can be mitigated to an extent. As for the latter... Given that you have side facing eyes, your depth perception is, and I apologize for my words, *shit.""*

""There have to be ways of mitigating that, I hope?"" Vyly asked.

""There's two option I'm currently thinking of right now: Either put them through relentless training, or fit them with specialized helmets that will make them see things as if they had forward facing eyes. And give the time constraints, I'm afraid that we will have to go with the second option. We have nowhere near enough time to allow them to improve their aim through training alone.""

""It can't take that long, right?"" He pondered.

""...2 to 3 months of training, give it or take. Unless I were to make you a plan alongside a set of instructions for you to take home to implement in order for them to practice, it won't be feasible. Modified helmets to make them see similarly to *us*, however...""

""I'm having a bad feeling about this..."" Vasti mumbled.

""Don't worry, I won't be as harsh with you as I usually am with human recruits, can't have any of you hurt due to training too much. *Anyway!* I want you all to do 2 more runs, both with different scenarios, it will give me more time to spot more mistakes. I will give you 5 minutes to rest before you're back at it. So prepare yourselves!""

=========================================================

\[Time skip: 80 minutes\]

***Memory Transcription Subject: Theodore Grant, Drill Instructor of the Boarding and Sabotaging Squadron Training Facility.***

Their performance improved, somewhat.

They weren't as worried about the time limit as before, nor were they trying to clear rooms solo anymore.

Sure, they still committed a few basic mistakes, like not fully clearing rooms and leaving unchecked areas, but those were easy fixes, their aim, however, continued to be horrible...

Vyly had been silent during their whole training, only speaking in order to make small talk and point out mistakes when he saw one.

He also decided to help me modify the last scenario involving a standard rescue mission with a different layout, but instead of using human models for the 'enemies', we had them replaced with Arxur looking ones. Their performance decreased by a few percent, unsurprisingly.

I didn't fault them, the bastards were *huge*, the vast majority almost a whole head taller than your average human.

*Heh, our own boarding crew will probably like to fight those Arxur enemies later*. I thought.

""I did notice that they're clearing rooms slightly slower and are slightly hesitant to enter rooms that have potential hiding spots."" I mumbled.

""Y-yeah, I'm pretty sure fighting the ones we've been at war with ever since before I was born doesn't help a whole lot."" He responded sheepishly.

""You're aware that they can't keep hesitating like this, right? A tenth of a second can be the difference between life and death, Roldn is the only one that's actually not letting fear take hold of him.""

Vyly said nothing.

I sighed, ""Alright, follow me, I will take you to the restaurant for you to get something to eat while I go get your new helmets ordered up, they should be done by tomorrow morning, Tyvil gave me your measurements, thankfully. After we finish that, you all will be going straight to training again, there's a few other mission scenarios I want y'all to go through before we finish for today.""

""Can you at least give us a few moments for us to regain our breath before we leave again? That caffeine thing you gave us surely helped a ton, but not enough to allow us to start walking for another 10 minutes without at least resting a bit first."" Roldn requested.

""5 minutes, give it or take.""

They all made some type of complaint, but proceeded to crash on the couch near us, nonetheless.

""It's sad that our kind can't keep going like yours can, I wish we had the endurance of you humans."" Vyly muttered.

I snickered, ""Don't be so down like that, although you will never reach the level of human soldiers, you can get close, at least it's what I'm confident I can help you pull off with the right training.""

Time flew by relatively quickly, and before I knew it, we were on our way to the cafeteria

""Why not just pick up our helmets and modify them instead of manufacturing new ones?"" Vasti asked, moving to be near me.

""I don't want to ruin your old equipment; I don't even know if you will be able to adapt to having your vision facing forward instead of to the sides.""

""...You have a point, I guess.""

""Damn good point, might I say."" Vryt spoke up from behind us. ""Can you imagine? Living your entire life with your eyes on the sides of your head and suddenly you're seeing things as if they were facing forward? I bet a hundred credits it will take us at least 3 days to get used to it!""

""I bet 60 credits we can do it in less, you are *wayyy* too pessimist, Vryt!"" Zenyl exclaimed.

""I will dare to say the same."" I admitted. ""It won't be that hard, if your brains are anything like ours, then you will have a very easy time on adapting to the new situation.""

""You really think that? I really, REALLY doubt that relearning how to use your vision will be easy."" Roldn commented.

I snickered, ""8 hours of relentless training per day? I doubt you won't be able to adapt at all, if anything, we can install an advanced intelligent companion system in the helmet to help you to be able to better function without THAT much training.""

""...Advanced intelligent companion system?"" Practically everyone asked at the same time.

I stopped, turned to them, blinked a few times, before recomposing myself enough to answer them.

""In a nutshell, it's a non-self-aware, non-sapient, intelligent program capable of performing a myriad of tasks on its own based on available data, it's comparable to the programs we had back a century or so ago. They will be able to follow your commands and will help you in general. Such a program will certainly be useful for you all, at least on helping you keep yourselves together during the adaptation period of the new helmets.""

""...Alright, there's not really a way to escape this, I think. Anyway, let's go order something, I'm hungry."" Roldn commented while we approached the restaurant.

""Vyly, take care of them, I gave you a list of the rules in here, they aren't difficult to follow. I will be right back after ordering the helmets.""

He flicked his tail in response.

I quickly went off to my destination. Something told me that this wasn't going to be easy...

=========================================================

***Memory Transcription Subject: Vyly, Commander of the third Venlil Scouting and Self-Defense Fleet.***

""Alright... we have a few dozen *minutes* until he comes back, anything you bunch wants to speak about?"" I asked them after we sat down on a table in one of the corners.

The restaurant was surprisingly full of humans, too, I was glad that they were able to eat plants like us, even though I wouldn't admit it to anyone.

""Honestly? I thought that Theodore would be a lot harsher with us. I will admit, I really appreciate that he didn't raise he voice a lot this far."" Vasti admitted before utterly *devouring* the tofu on her plate.

""Vasti! Where the brahk are your manners?! We're in public, for Protector's sake! Slow down!"" Vryt half yelled while lightly slapping the back of her head, which caused her to slow down with a pained grunt.

""The way he also made us acknowledge our mistakes was also a plus in my point of view."" Roldn muttered.

""There's one thing I don't think I'm going to like."" Vyrt spoke up, too. ""Did you guys remember how he said we would be training 8 *hours* per day?!""

I shrugged, ""Didn't worry me that much, standard human life cycle apparently, and if we get access to more of that 'coffee' thing and human grade stimulants? I think we can handle it.""

After that, silence reigned between us, we ate only doing some small talk about our stay and their current opinion on humanity as a whole.

Thankfully, it didn't take long for Theodore to return and sit near us, waiting to take us back so that my squad could go back to training.

Thankfully no one said anything bad in front of him...

""Alright, let's move, there's a lot to do today before I dismiss you back to your quarters."" He finally spoke up for the last time before getting up and gesturing us to follow.

=========================================================

\[Time skip: 4 hours\]

I felt pity for my boarding crew.

The previous few *hours* have been... Tiring for them.

Even though they only made 8 more boarding runs so far, 4 of which ended significantly earlier due to mistakes committed by them-

Theodore forced them to continue until they stopped committing said mistakes, drilling into them correction-

""Roldn! Stop rushing so much! You aren't solo on these damn missions; you are a boarding squad *MEMBER! ACT AS SUCH!* And you, Zenyl! Stop damn hesitating! It killed you in the first run! Just aim and pull the trigger!""

After-

""Vasti, stop letting your instincts take the better of you! Adrenaline does *shit* if you can't keep yourself in check! Staying calm under pressure is fucking crucial for you to stay alive!""

Correction-

""Vryt! Remember that you aren't the best out there! Stop trying to pretend you're some badass character of a cheap action movie, because you're not!""

After barking at them on where they could improve, he would usually yell-

""Again! Get yourselves together! Come on! He spoke up in a stern tone.""

Luckily for the ones receiving his attention, who were all in varied states of exhaustion, Theodore never once raised his voice to the point of yelling, that didn't stop him from getting the point across, though.

""W-We are tired sir! Please, let us rest for t-today!"" Vasti whimpered.

Theodore looked at them not with a look of anger, but *disappointment*.

He sighed, ""Well, I had at least a few more scenarios for you all to go through, but considering you're all almost collapsing from exhaustion, might as well finish it for today. I will send Tyvil the directions to the gym on his holo pad."" I will wait you there at 5 *AM,* sharp, not a single minute earlier or late. You all understand?""

He received a bunch of weak tail flicks.

He nodded, ""Alright, we're done for today, then, go to your rooms.""

That was the last thing said by Theodore before he left the room. Leaving us alone in the room.

""Well, you heard him, get up you bunch."" I said nonchalantly.

""...5 more *minutes*..."" Roldn mumbled.

""Nope! Get up!"" I responded.

They protested a bit, but complied.

""Alright, let's rest, then, follow me, I guess..."" I mumbled.

=========================================================

\[Time skip: 3 hours\]

***No one's POV.***

***Location: Kolshian home system, Host star's outer proximity.***

A sleek, arrow like object appears the main star of the system, a countdown of 3 hours starting almost immediately.

The stellar objects energy leaks the underside of the vessel, even though it was made to operate in the worst environments, being this near to a burning ball of plasma wasn't still that good.

But it didn't matter, the onboard autonomous system, even though not fully sentient, knew it had a job to do, and it was going to fulfill it. Dozens upon dozens of sensors were activated and redirected to the nearest habitable planet.

According to the information that Tyvil had given, this body was called *Aafa.*

One of the core worlds of the so called Federation, and therefore, of uttermost importance when it came to data gathering.

The probe quickly fired its RCS, briefly adjusting its position to allow for a better observation, and then got to work.

Photo after photo, reading after reading, megabytes became gigabytes as minutes turned into hours.

Hundreds of tiny little readings indicating intense ship activity, even more around the rest of the system, focused in certain areas, probably factories.

Sadly, it didn't have much time left, the intense heat was starting to affect it, the warp drive that had been spooling up ever since it began collecting information quickly activated, it managed to warp out of the system before succumbing to the heat.

Its siblings in other systems had much more success, the vast majority were significantly less guarded, and therefore, much easier to spy.

What they found was... relatively troubling.

=========================================================

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: March 10th, 2130.*

***Memory transcription subject***: ***No one, third person POV.***

*Location: UN Space Forces Command Center, Earth.*

""...How many ships did you say they have in total?"" Pierre asked, incredulous.

""40 thousand, spread across the home systems of the Kolshian, the Krakotl, the Farsul and the Gojid, and a few dozen others, roughly 27 thousand of those, however, are concentrated around the first 3 systems I mentioned, around 9 thousand are in the Gojid home system, with the rest spread around other systems. There could be many, MANY more given the sheer number of systems out there."" One of his employees responded.

""Bastards outnumber us 10 to 1, then, possibly more...""

""Look at the bright side, Pierre, from the information we managed to gather, our weaponry will be insanely effective against them, and that virus we managed to infect that ship with proved that their cyber security is nowhere near enough to defend against us."" Stephane chipped in.

""10 ships against one is still a lot, Stephane! That's practically a whole fleet! You remember that one of the first four dreadnoughts fought one its own against the Arxur, but it still took quite some bit of damage! Even if we were to only produce dreadnoughts, it still wouldn't be feasible, we have what, 700 or so dreadnoughts built so far? Nowhere near enough.

""...45 drone carriers, 540 unmanned drone fighters, 1193 destroyers, 1098 corvettes, 300 dreadnoughts, 1524 cargo ships for the logistics... How much we double the total number of vessels?"" Another employee asked.

""With all the current factories working around the clock? Probably by the end of the next month, I would say. The construction of new building facilities across the asteroid belts has allowed us to build many more, but that's still not enough, I would say.""

""Probably a good idea to suggest to the guys overseeing the production of ships to focus on building more carriers and unmanned drones, big and heavy ships are only good so long as they have ammo, and swarms have proven to be able to take them out pretty easily during the world wars..."" Another spoke up.

Pierre briefly ran his hand through his hair, ""Well then, let's do that, I think it's safe to say that we're done for today.""

When the cop came into our room and spoke to us, she sat in her kitchen and read her Bible aloud to herself. Of course, she now has some food grade iodine that she puts in her water. And of course I had a picture in my phone of the wound cleanser iodine that she had been putting into the coffee maker and it was sitting on her kitchen counter in the picture. So I showed the cop that. He went back out there and showed her the picture on his phone of that iodine that he took off of my phone and she did admit that she was putting that into the coffee maker because she didn't have the food grade stuff available to her at that time. But she convinced the cop that she's an innocent old lady and he thinks that she was just doing it because she was worried about her water and she also told him that I didn't have to use her coffee maker, but she didn't even want my boyfriend and I having something like that plugged into our room so we had to use hers! But it was my word against her's so in the end they believed her, they think she's just being innocent and that she's not trying to hurt anybody and she gets away with it, scott-free.

1pq1nd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/speedreading/comments/1pq1nd5/how_i_developed_my_own_speedreading_method_out_of/,How I developed my own speedreading method out of necessity,"I developed a way to increase my reading speed by reading journal articles published in political science journals when I was helping a grad student enrolled in a Latin American Studies program, even though I never formally studied Latin American society, culture, or history. 

This grad student thought Latin American Studies would be a fun concentration, thinking the courses would focus on culture and society--things like cuisine, art, travel, etc. She was completely off. The program was focused on the history of conflict, ideology, and politics in the region, and all the reading material was taken from academic journals.

We would arrange to meet in a coffee shop, and she'd send me the reading material a day before. Sometimes she'd just hand me a print out when we sat down. I can't tell you how fast precisely was able to eventually read the material but I read every word, although I noticed articles 'the' or 'a' and conjunctions like 'and' or 'but' seemed to just attach themselves to the other words.

First off, **I was very interested in the subject.** So that definitely was an asset. Also, **I didn't have a big stake in understanding the articles since it was she that was taking the courses for credit.** Something else was that **I really enjoyed what I was reading**, so it was almost like eating my favorite ice cream. I just wanted to eat as much as I could. After reading articles at regular speed, maybe 300 words an hour, I realized I had to read faster to help her given the time limit. After about four or five meetings, I decided I had to change my regular reading style. So I positioned myself a little further back from the text than I'd normally do. That tactic gave me a sense **of ""openness"", like I could just start moving my eyes from left to right an**d see an entire sentence in my field of vision even if I hadn't read the entire sentence. I then decided **to try relaxing as I read**, telling myself it was a low stakes activity. My task was just to help explain the material. I didn't have to worry about taking an exam, although she did.  Relaxing allowed my eyes to just glide across the page, as though my eyes were a pair of ice skates. At first, I tried to keep my place by moving a few fingers across the text as I read and allow myself to follow them, but I stopped doing that since my fingers began to burn and I felt weird sensations in them.  So I changed my technique and **kept my fingers about an inch or two over** the text so I wouldn't have to touch the page. Since all the articles were in the same field, I started absorbing the vocabulary, so that I didn't have to think about the meaning of the words. I'd understand the word or phrase as I read them. **Usually I didn't have to think about what I was reading. I just 'absorbed' the material** even though I read every word.I got to the point where I could read a journal article of about 8,000 words in about 10 to 12 minutes, and then explain the content in pretty good detail. 

Three ancillary points: 1)  I have ADHD, so I usually superfocus if I'm interested in something, but space out if I find reading material that's really boring to me. 2) My eyesight is 20/10 in my right eye and 20/15 in my left eye. 3) I was reading non-fiction. I just focused on understanding the text. I think if I was reading a novel or poetry, I'd slow down since I'd want to think about style, vocabulary...the art aspect of writing.

The St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers are set to clash in a game that promises the excitement of a spreadsheet audit and the drama of a coffee refill line at 8 a.m. on a Monday. Let’s break this down with the precision of a goalie tracking a puck and the humor of a Zamboni driver with a punchy sense of humor.

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bigger Sieve?**  
The Rangers (-141) are the chalk here, which translates to a 58.5% implied win probability. The Blues (+118) offer a 45.4% chance, leaving a 16% vig for bookmakers to enjoy like a warm hot tub after a long shift. Both teams are offensive duds: the Blues have scored two goals or fewer in eight of their last 10 games, while the Rangers have managed it in five straight. It’s like watching two leaky sieves try to hold water at a bakery—present, but useless.

The total is set at 5.5 goals, and the Under is favored (-115). Given that both teams’ offenses are about as reliable as a blindfolded baker trying to frost a cake, this feels like a safe bet. The Rangers have hit the Under in 48 of their last 86 games, which is statistically suspicious—almost like they’re conspiring with the Blues to make statisticians rich.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Fatigue, and a Goalie on a Reset Button**  
The Blues are playing back-to-back games, a schedule as brutal as trying to skate through a mud pit in flip-flops. Jordan Binnington, their starting goalie, last played in a 7-2 loss where he allowed six goals on 25 shots. Coach Jim Montgomery called the break “necessary to reset mentally,” which is NHL-speak for “we’re not sure what’s wrong, but we’re hoping he forgets how bad it was.” Backup Joel Hofer has a 1-0 shutout record recently, which is impressive unless you’re the Blues’ offense, which needs a wake-up call as much as a Zamboni needs a nap.

The Rangers, meanwhile, have Igor Shesterkin between the pipes—a human

I already feel like it’s my fault when I do see a roach in the kitchen especially because I have a phobia of bugs and usually tense up. I have audiobooks that get me through the chores which I sometimes aren’t motivated to do at all and today I am not motivated, my mom has been off 2 days each week and I keep trying to ask her to help me with my cosmetology school work but it’s been 5 weeks and I’m starting to lose that motivation especially because the social security office has once again failed me.. anyways sorry for ranting but I’ll get to the part today that caused me to post this and maybe I am overreacting but to me it hurts a lot when I do the dishes, wipe the counters sometimes twice like yesterday, mop and sweep the floors only to be told that my work doesn’t pay off and I haven’t done anything, my boyfriend made a comment about how if she expects me to clean she should pick up her mess, I’ll wake up and go into the kitchen to see the sugar doesn’t have the lid, the coffee stains are on the counter, egg pan is out, butter is out, coffee cup isn’t poured and at least rinsed and for a long time I’ve noted in my head why it upsets me but I understand that I lack in cleaning the fridge when it’s overwhelming full, dishes that weren’t dried not put away before bed, dishes after dinner should be washed the night before.. however after my mom yelled at him and said he shouldn’t be talking because he’s home more than she is but he works 11-9:30 sometimes other times 5 and a half hour of work at auntie Anne’s and gives my mom 50 bucks each check or more depending on the time and check money he makes..  I was grumpy and I got mad but my boyfriend noted that I was upset and tried to cover my mouth, I felt as if no matter what I do I am never going to get up to my moms expectations of me 

I have wanted to be a forensic scientist, a Anthropology forensic person, a nurse of some sorts, join the army when I was in school, become a cop or met when wanted to study philosophy or even become a Catholic or satanist she never really agrees with this stuff.. I love my mom and I don’t want her kidney disease or leukemia claiming her life.. sometimes I do wonder though how would life me differently if she wasn’t here to hover over me and maybe that’s bad to think, I just want to feel like I am understood even if I am in the wrong and should correct my behavior based on how much my mom does for all of us, she got me a kindle, pierce the veil tickets, a study bible that would allow me to critically evaluate my beliefs and question my beliefs in a way I don’t feel condemn me, I want to focus on the good parts of my mother but sometimes it’s hard, sometimes I see the good in myself and other times I see the negative within myself 

I will say that we have grown closer compared to my childhood and teens era because she’s now aware how my autism, my adhd, my depression and anxiety work all together, she understands that every change I get I try to help around the house compared to some others within our household she also understands that I felt alone and that’s why I self harmed, had sucidal thoughts and put my hands on her which I deeply regret, I’ve learned to understand what she does for me and my family, how much she works, how much work she puts in to make money for me and my family to have comfortable life’s at the best of our ability.. I don’t want to grow up and have kids and have them turn out the way I did with my mother, I don’t want them feeling more comfortable speaking to their dad than to me about things that upset them because of me, I don’t want them to feel alone or burdened by memories from childhood that would cause them to be uncomfortable in their own skin, to hate themselves after the fact they yelled at me or hit me.. I’m not perfect but I want my kids to feel comfortable around me 

I want to get help for my anger issues and not have it bulid up inside and explode at the worst times.. I want them to be able to do whatever they desire as long as it’s lawfully subjectively and objectively moral ",1,1766090438.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1pq1jrs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pq1jrs,"Santa Puppy, Hurry Down the Chimney Tonight","I present to you my Santa Puppy! He is 100% of my own design and creation, so much so that I am not even sure I could remember the pattern to recreate him. Particularly with the shaping I did with his facial features. 


I started him a few days ago without any idea of what I wanted to make. I started with the body working up and once I realized he was kinda pudgy, I decided on a puppy. From there I continued onto the head as one piece with the torso then separately added the legs, arms, ears and tail to be sewn on. I used 15mm safety eyes and a similar sized fuzzy nose (I don't know the size since it came from my junk box of random crochet-related items). 


Once I was done with the puppy himself, I figured I'd Santa-fy him because, well, why not? It's Christmas! 


The coat was made using the only red chenille yarn I had left in my stash and comes from Dollar Tree (size 6) in red. I started with a chain of 50 then slowly decreased as I worked from bottom to top to conform to his body. You can see in the back I got a little overzealous with the decreases because there are a few bulges, but oh well. He'll grow into them. 


I added the sleeves separately then went around all the edges with size 7 chenille yarn (Loops & Threads Sweet Snuggles in White). The boots and hat were made with the same red yarn and the boot bottoms with Yarn Bee Velvety Smooth size 5 (bulky) in black. 


The tips of his paws were made with a coffee-colored size 6 chenille yarn, but I've lost the packaging long ago. 


He's 15 inches (38cm) long from Santa hat tip to toes and about 12 inches (31cm) in arm length and his belly is about 16.5 inches (42cm) in circumference. 


It might be hard to see, but I used black embroidery thread to give him a little mouth. I wish I had given him a muzzle to make him appear more dog-like, but I have so many other projects and requests to work on before Christmas, so as far as I am concerned, he's finished! 


I hope you all enjoy and happy holidays! ",3,1766090338.0,Amigurumi,2,0.81,False

He was just staring at me from the back seat of the dull grey 90s Toyota Corolla (E90) then he smiled. The smile happened quick then he disappeared with the car. After that, I felt confused and my head was hot and dizzy. They say not to look at this young boy in the backseat of the car or bad things would happen to you. Well… I failed that challenge already.

Now my heart is racing and it was making me want to crash. I couldn’t control my driving. I wanted to but I can’t because of that boy. This was not something wanted on my first day of work at 6:00 am. I should have taken my coffee. Luckily my engine was going on again and I drove away from out that weird tunnel. And I was already late for work.

After that experience I kept seeing visions of that boy in windows etc. I prayed but he didn’t go away. He was stuck there forever. He gave me more strong headaches and people kept asking me if I was okay. Which I said “Yep, I’m fine!” with a teeth smile. That was the weirdest thing that happened in my life. My headaches was so bad I spilled my coffee on my new t shirt which I had to change. I wondered to myself is that tunnel cursed. I swear to myself not to drive that tunnel again.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Penguins vs. Senators: A Tale of Two Teams (and Why Ottawa Deserves the ""Dad Bod"" Trophy)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s equal parts statistical analysis and slapstick comedy. The Pittsburgh Penguins, fresh off a six-game losing streak that could make a vegan cry, face the Ottawa Senators in a game that’s less “showdown” and more “hope the puck doesn’t catch fire.” Let’s break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a deflated air horn.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Math, Not Magic

The betting lines make this a lopsided bet. Ottawa is the consensus favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.57-1.62** (implied probability: **62-64%**), while Pittsburgh’s odds of **2.35-2.45** (**41-43%**) suggest they’re the NHL’s version of a team that forgot to show up. The spread favors Ottawa by 1.5 goals, and the total goals line sits at **6.0-6.5**, with “Under” slightly more enticing given Pittsburgh’s recent defensive play (more on that in a second).

Historically, Pittsburgh has dominated Ottawa since 2013 (**20-7-8**), but context matters. The Pens’ last four games in Ottawa have gone to overtime—like a bad breakup that just can’t end. Yet this year’s Penguins are a shadow of their former selves, mired in a rebuild so deep even Crosby looks like he’s playing for keeps.

---

### News Roundup: Injuries, Streaks, and One Very Tired Goaltender

**Pittsburgh’s Woes**:

* **Evgeni Malkin** is out, injured, and probably whispering “*Why me?*"" to the hockey gods. Without him, Pittsburgh’s offense is like a penguin trying to fly—entertaining, but ineffective.
* **Tristan Jarry**, their former starter, was traded mid-season, leaving **Stuart Skinner** to inherit the net. Skinner’s debut? A statistical nightmare. It’s like handing a toddler a flamethrower and asking him to brew coffee.
* The Penguins are allowing **4.33 goals per game** in their losing streak. Their defense? A sieve that would make a leaky colander blush.

**Ottawa’s Silver Lining**:

* **Drake Batherson** is the real deal, leading the team in goals and points per 60 minutes. His December Corsi For percentage (**61.0%**) is better than my ability to parallel

Edit: a while back I did have to restart my entire PlayStation, and a cousin of mine, changed my PSN name to something so ridiculous I’m embarrassed to have it lol, and yes, I would love to change it, but I can’t, because A: forgot my password to account, and B: I got no money lol",4,1766089534.0,GamerPals,2,1.0,False

So, I am 30F. All my life I have been “different”. Very creative child and was a great student, but started falling behind in 4th grade.  I used to get in trouble for “taking too long” because I would be in my head a lot. Hardly had friends, still don’t really. I am behind all of my peers due to my lack of concentration/inability to finish things. I tried to go to college like everyone else right after high school. Guess what? Failed out of it. Not because it was too hard, I just couldn’t make myself do the work. I almost didn’t graduate high school because I failed the state math test because I just physically could not pay attention to learn the formulas. I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I have lived a thousand different lives lol I have a hard time sitting still and doing “nothing.” I also have 3 kids. 2/3 have autism and ADHD. My younger two have the same father and my oldest has a different father, so I am the common denominator there. I’m saying all of these to say that it is incredibly likely that I have adhd as well, yet when I try to ask people in my life for validation I guess? It’s blown off. “That’s just you” they say. Or I’ll hear, “oh it’s just anxiety.” I am so sick of everything being blamed on anxiety. Is it anxiety when I’m laying in bed at 11:30 pm googling, “why is it called sourdough?” Is it anxiety when I have forgotten my child’s morning dose of medicine again? Is it anxiety when if I an unable to move I am chewing my nails or bouncing my leg? Is it anxiety when I didn’t hear a word you just said because I was thinking about what kind of life I would have lived in the 1800’s? Is it anxiety when I can drink an entire pot of coffee and STILL go to bed at 9pm?

I have that eval on Tuesday but honestly I am becoming anxious (and yes, I can tell this is anxiety lol) over it because what if they DON’T diagnose me with it. What if I am just lazy and stupid? 😔",2,1766089513.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.

I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.

This is my first coffee machine, and I’m really enjoying it so far. The Pixie is surprisingly compact and fast, though I have to say — it’s pretty loud while making coffee 😅

Any Pixie owners here?

Which pods are your go-to for everyday coffee, and which ones are worth saving for a proper “slow morning” brew?

It’s not counterfeit either because somehow the TikTok shop orders connected to my real aeropress website account and gave me points for the purchase.

Maybe not a big deal to most of you but could make good gifts if you know other people who like good coffee (I don’t I bought them for myself lol).

For Halloween I was able to find nut free chocolates but they’re pretty pricey for a small amount, and I don’t want to just always give them the same thing. 😂 Then I thought a coffee shop gift card would be nice, but only one drinks coffee!

If you’re looking to make some easy side money, I’ve been using AttaPoll for a while now. It’s basically an app where you earn by doing small surveys, simple tasks and even some games. Nothing fancy, but it’s legit and payouts are real.

I usually do a few surveys when I’m free or just bored, and it adds up slowly. Not a get-rich thing obviously, but good for coffee money or small expenses.

If anyone wants to try it, you can use my referral link here (helps me and you too - will get 10% extra):

Totally optional, but thought I’d share since there are a lot of scams out there and this one is actually trusted.
