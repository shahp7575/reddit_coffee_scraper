Anthropic fixed its boring marketing by flipping the script - they turned “AI for productivity” into “AI for thinkers.”

***What's the problem it solves?***

Most brands sound the same. They play it safe, talk about “efficiency” and “automation,” and end up invisible. Anthropic broke that pattern by going against industry noise and creating a movement instead of another ad campaign.

***Quick Summary***

Anthropic, the company behind Claude AI, once ran dull and confusing ads like “Move your work up and to the Claude.” Then they realized safe marketing is slow death. When OpenAI’s Sora 2 triggered a flood of low-quality AI content (“slop”), Anthropic saw its chance. It launched the “Keep Thinking” campaign and a popup coffee shop that gave away free “thinking” hats.

Instead of promising faster work, Anthropic positioned Claude as a tool for people who think deeply - not for businesses chasing productivity. This shift from “AI that automates” to “AI that helps you think” gave the brand a clear identity. Their hat became a badge of belonging to the “anti-slop” tribe - people who care about quality ideas, not mass-produced content.

The company’s success came from three bold moves: going in the opposite direction of competitors, turning digital ideas into physical experiences, and celebrating users instead of the product. The message was simple: people don’t buy tools; they join tribes.

***Key Takeaways***

* Safe marketing is the fastest way to disappear.
* Positioning should be a belief, not a feature.
* Going against your industry’s echo chamber makes you memorable.
* Physical experiences (like merch or events) make your message real.
* People want identity and belonging more than product specs.

**What to do**

* Write down what your top 3 competitors say - then go the opposite way.
* Find what your audience is tired of hearing and build against it.
* Turn your product’s “weakness” into a strength (e.g., slower = thoughtful).
* Make your stance physical - hats, events, popups, something people can hold.
* Center your message on your users’ identity, not your product features.
* Launch boldly and all at once. Half-changes never break through.
* Remember: safe = invisible. Pick a side, make enemies, build a tribe.

I need meal prep help. I've been doing it for the last 3 years, but for the last couple months I'm having a problem by the time it's time to actually eat what I prepped I don't want to eat it. By day 2 or 3 I just start ordering food.

My schedule is 7 12 hour ED night shifts. I try to bring breakfast (like if I have the moxie I will make a SEC sandwich, or a bagel with cream cheese), and eat it while I'm getting report, then a snacky like a salad of some kind or veggies and dip, and then a main. But lately McDonalds fries and a diet coke sounds more amazing than my homemade coffee and my rice bowls. I get incredibly bored and I don't love eating my own cooking (which is silly because I'm a good cook). I will tell my sister what I'm making and she will ask me to make her a days worth and bring it to her because it sounds so yummy, meanwhile I get one day in and am bored. Like I will make food for the week and by day 3 have no interest in it. Anyone have any ideas for this?

I like egg roll in a bowl because that's stupid easy to make. I like Asian flavors. I make cottage cheese bowls (sweet and savory). But again by day 2 or 3... and since I work 12s I don't have the energy to go home and make another meal for lunch for the next night. Thank you.

1oov9tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Adamlikescoffee22/comments/1oov9tl/espresso_with_a_cop_how_coffee_can_change_a/,Espresso with a Cop — How Coffee Can Change a Community - Adam James,"A few years back the Queensland Police Service ran this thing called **“Espresso with a Cop.”**  
  
The idea was simple: grab a coffee, have a chat, no pressure. Locals could sit down with officers from their area and talk about whatever was on their mind — safety, neighbourhood issues, or just life. No hierarchy, no uniforms in the way, just humans having coffee.

And you know what? That tiny idea hit deeper than most official campaigns ever do.



# Why it matters

I’m **Adam James**, and over at [ABJames.com](https://www.abjames.com) I’ve written a lot about small habits that create big change — whether it’s fitness, mindset, or just being kind to the person behind you in line. This event is a perfect example.

Community trust doesn’t come from rules and slogans; it comes from conversations. You can’t legislate connection — you have to live it.

When you share a table with someone — a police officer, a neighbour, a stranger — you stop seeing them as a label and start seeing them as a person.



# The Original “Espresso with a Cop” Story

The *Espresso with a Cop* initiative was covered on the [Queensland Police Blog](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/brisbanenorth/2016/03/22/local-police-expresso/), featuring officers from Brisbane North encouraging locals to stop by and chat about community safety, road rules, or just life in general. It was designed as an open-door event where coffee became the medium for connection — reminding everyone that good policing begins with good relationships. That article captured the essence of what public service should look like: accessible, human, and grounded in community.



# Coffee as a connector

I used to help run something called the **Caffeine & Kindness Movement**, which encouraged Aussies to pay forward a “suspended coffee” for someone who might be doing it tough. It wasn’t about charity — it was about dignity.

That same spirit runs through *Espresso with a Cop.* It’s not about PR; it’s about presence.

A coffee doesn’t fix everything. But it does something powerful: it starts a conversation.



# What we can all take from it

* You don’t need an official program to build community. Invite someone for a coffee.
* If you run a business, hold a casual “coffee morning” with customers or clients.
* If you’re part of a group or service, get out from behind the logo and meet people face-to-face.

Trust is brewed slowly, but it lasts a long time.



It’s funny — in an age of screens, likes, and algorithms, sometimes the most radical thing you can do is just… show up.

One cup at a time. ☕

1oov873,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1oov873/endingcycle_theory/,Ending/Cycle Theory,"Good morning everybody,
My take on what is about to happen has 2 main points:
1. We see Denji and Pochita cutting trees in the first chapter;
2. Why is Pochita the Hero of Hell?

We know that in a deathless world everyone is bound to become a tree and  this should mean that the humanity as we know it should end, ending the concept of ""Fear"" as a whole, thus making every Devil extremely weak or making it disappear (we know there is not a Coffee Devil because no one fears it).

This leaves 2 paths:

1. Ultimately only BCSM stands and he cuts these trees becoming the only feared being in the world, giving him a godly power... Like erasing everything he eats or... Creating everything he crafts;

2. Only Hybrids/Majin are left untouched by the treefication and the last Devil alive is the Fire Devil which will be the only thing feared by a tree, making him OP and the Final Boss,only Asa and Denji survive the Battle and they become Adam and Eve of the new world.

I am quite sure Pochita becomes more powerful when he's loved too, not only when he is feared.

I believe Pochita is the Hero of Hell because he allows humans to be humans, he wants them to live, love and feel fear, give life to devils, and his power to erase a concept is needed for this.

Pochita finds at every cycle the ""only"" human that wants to befriend devils, the ""only"" one that can make his dream come true.

In 2023 I thought it was just anxiety, then last year I just stayed inside my room sleeping or playing video games and avoid the sun at all costs. It made me anxious to even leave my house to get something from my car. It was a depressing jobless year.

This year, I made good progress. I can leave my house to grab some coffee, drive to work, get groceries, basically anything only in a 2 mile radius. And it’s only to places I’m familiar with, especially if it’s necessary to go. 

I noticed something new this year. And weird.

Whenever I had an awful day at work, I would just cry and not even want to go home. I just go numb and drive straight to the mall (which I never go to by myself) and buy cute clothes to cope with my sadness. And when I get home, I realize, “Oh shit I just drove more than 3 miles away. That’s new.” 

Or the other day. I got into a huge fight with my family and instead of crying all day, I just started getting up to change. For a moment I had a mental battle in my head where my agoraphobia was screaming “No! Oh god the panic attacks no!” And I just got even angrier and told myself to get the fuck out of the way; I’m driving somewhere. And I did. I was just so numb from the sadness and anger, I had no destination, just drove until I found a cute boba place. Got some boba myself to cope, and sit in my car sipping on it while listening to my audiobook. Then I realized that I was 6 miles away from home. 

Which is SO weird. Because any other day, even if I’m in a good mood, I tell myself that I’m not leaving or going anywhere. The thought of it gives me anxiety. But whenever I’m sad or angry, I have the urge to leave..? What the fuck is happening

1oov3wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oov3wg/best_5_vpns_for_pubg/,Best 5 VPNs for PUBG,"**Gaming was the most targeted industry for DDoS attacks in 2024, with Layer 7 incidents rising 94 percent year over year.** For PUBG players, this isn't just a statistic—it's a real threat that can cost you matches, rankings, and even your account security. Whether you're grinding ranked matches, competing in tournaments, or just trying to enjoy a casual session, the right VPN can be the difference between victory and vulnerability.

PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) has maintained its position as one of the world's most popular battle royale games, with over 300,000 concurrent players at any given time. But this massive player base attracts more than just competitors—it draws malicious actors looking to gain unfair advantages through DDoS attacks, doxxing, and other cyber threats. Add to that the game's complex geo-restriction policies and regional bans in countries like India, China, and Afghanistan, and you have a gaming environment where a quality VPN isn't just helpful—it's essential.

This comprehensive guide examines the five best VPNs specifically tested and optimized for PUBG across all platforms: PC, Mobile, PlayStation, and Xbox. We've conducted extensive research, analyzing connection speeds, ping rates, security features, and real-world gaming performance to identify the VPN services that deliver the best experience for PUBG players in 2025.

# Why PUBG Players Need a VPN: Security Threats You Can't Ignore

# DDoS Attacks: The Hidden Danger in Competitive Gaming

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become alarmingly common in PUBG,** particularly during competitive and ranked matches. These attacks work by overwhelming your internet connection with massive amounts of traffic, causing severe lag, disconnections, and in worst cases, complete loss of internet access.

In 2020, PUBG Corporation publicly acknowledged waves of DDoS attacks affecting their servers globally, causing widespread disconnections. More recently, security researchers at NETSCOUT confirmed that DDoS attacks pose a ""serious threat to the online gambling and gaming industries, since it's relatively easy for those with financial or competitive interests to disrupt operations.""

**How attackers target PUBG players:**

* **IP Address Exposure:** Without a VPN, your real IP address is visible to other players during matches, making you a target
* **Revenge Attacks:** Disgruntled opponents may launch DDoS attacks after losing matches to force you offline
* **Competitive Advantage:** In tournaments or ranked play, attackers use DDoS to eliminate strong competitors
* **Account Takeovers:** Exposed IP addresses can be used to gather information for account compromise attempts

A quality VPN masks your real IP address, replacing it with the VPN server's IP. This means even if an attacker tries to launch a DDoS attack, they're targeting the VPN's infrastructure—not your home network. Premium VPN providers have robust DDoS mitigation systems that can absorb these attacks without impacting your gameplay.

# Bypassing Geo-Restrictions and Regional Bans

**PUBG Mobile has been banned in multiple countries** due to various government concerns, including India (September 2020), China (replaced with modified version), Pakistan (temporarily), Afghanistan, Jordan, and Nepal (temporarily). The Indian ban alone affected an estimated 175 million players—roughly 25% of PUBG Mobile's global user base.

While the localized Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) was released as a replacement, it comes with significant restrictions including playtime limits for both adults and minors. The global version of PUBG Mobile remains inaccessible in India through official channels.

**A VPN allows players to:**

* Access PUBG in regions where the game is banned or restricted
* Connect to region-specific servers for better matchmaking opportunities
* Participate in regional tournaments and events
* Access content updates that may be released earlier in certain regions

**Important Legal Disclaimer:** While using a VPN is legal in most countries, PUBG's Terms of Service state that users agree not to ""use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on the Services or for any other purpose."" However, using VPNs for legitimate security and privacy purposes—such as DDoS protection and ISP throttling prevention—is generally acceptable. Always review PUBG's current guidelines for your region and use VPNs responsibly.

# Reducing Lag and Lowering Ping

**High ping can be the difference between winning and losing in PUBG.** When your connection takes too long to communicate with the game server, you experience lag—manifesting as delayed actions, rubber-banding, and hit registration issues.

Surprisingly, **a VPN can actually reduce ping under certain circumstances:**

* **ISP Routing Issues:** Your Internet Service Provider may route your traffic inefficiently, taking a longer path to reach PUBG servers. A VPN can provide a more direct route, reducing latency
* **Network Congestion:** During peak hours, ISP networks become congested. VPNs can route around these bottlenecks
* **Peering Problems:** Poor peering agreements between your ISP and gaming networks can increase ping. VPNs bypass these issues

In our testing, players connecting to nearby VPN servers often saw ping reductions of 10-30ms when their ISP's routing was inefficient. However, it's crucial to understand that **VPNs can also increase ping** if you connect to distant servers or if your ISP already provides optimal routing.

# Preventing ISP Throttling During Gaming Sessions

**Many Internet Service Providers throttle bandwidth for gaming traffic,** especially during peak hours when network congestion is high. This practice, known as traffic shaping or bandwidth throttling, can cause sudden lag spikes, increased ping, and degraded gaming performance—often during the most critical moments of a match.

A VPN encrypts all your traffic, preventing your ISP from identifying gaming packets and selectively throttling them. In our research, multiple PUBG players reported noticeable improvements in connection stability after using VPNs, particularly during evening hours when ISP throttling is most prevalent.

# Protecting Your Privacy on Public Wi-Fi

**Gaming on public Wi-Fi networks—whether at hotels, airports, cafes, or university campuses—exposes you to significant security risks.** These networks are often unencrypted or use weak security protocols, making it trivially easy for attackers on the same network to intercept your data.

Potential threats on public Wi-Fi include:

* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers position themselves between your device and the router, intercepting all traffic
* **Session Hijacking:** Account credentials and session tokens can be stolen, leading to account takeovers
* **Packet Sniffing:** Attackers capture your data packets to extract sensitive information
* **Malicious Hotspots:** Fake Wi-Fi networks designed to steal credentials

A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for all your data, making it unreadable to anyone attempting to intercept it. This is particularly crucial for PUBG players who travel frequently or game in shared environments like college dorms.

# Critical Factors When Choosing a VPN for PUBG

Not all VPNs are created equal, especially when it comes to gaming. Many VPN services that work well for streaming or general browsing can be disastrous for competitive gaming due to high latency, unstable connections, or inadequate server infrastructure. Here are the essential factors to evaluate:

# Ultra-Low Latency and Fast Connection Speeds

**For PUBG, latency matters more than raw speed.** While you only need about 3-5 Mbps of bandwidth for smooth gameplay, every millisecond of latency affects your performance. Competitive players aim for ping under 50ms, with 20ms or lower being ideal for the best responsiveness.

**What to look for:**

* Ping rates under 100ms for nearby servers
* Ping under 150ms for mid-range servers
* Stable connections with minimal jitter (ping variation)
* WireGuard, NordLynx, or Lightway protocols for gaming

# Strategic Server Locations Near PUBG Data Centers

**PUBG operates servers in specific locations worldwide.** As of 2025, major PUBG server locations include:

* **North America:** Virginia (US East), California (US West)
* **Europe:** Frankfurt (Germany), London (UK)
* **Asia:** Singapore, Tokyo (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Mumbai (India)
* **South America:** São Paulo (Brazil)
* **Oceania:** Sydney (Australia)

The best VPNs for PUBG maintain servers close to these gaming hubs, allowing you to connect with minimal latency increases. Having multiple server options near each PUBG data center also provides redundancy if one server becomes congested.

# Modern VPN Protocols Optimized for Gaming

**VPN protocol choice dramatically impacts gaming performance.** Older protocols like OpenVPN, while secure, add significant overhead and latency. Modern protocols are specifically designed to balance security with speed.

**Best protocols for PUBG:**

1. **WireGuard:** Uses only 4,000 lines of code (vs. OpenVPN's hundreds of thousands), resulting in faster connections and lower latency. Offers excellent speed with strong security
2. **NordLynx (NordVPN's Implementation):** Built on WireGuard with enhanced privacy features. Adds a double NAT system to address WireGuard's potential privacy concerns
3. **Lightway (ExpressVPN's Protocol):** Even lighter than WireGuard at just 2,000 lines of code. Supports both UDP and TCP, with battery efficiency for mobile gaming

These protocols establish connections in under a second and maintain stable tunnels even when switching networks—crucial for mobile PUBG players.

# Robust DDoS Protection Features

**Not all VPNs offer equal DDoS protection.** While masking your IP is the foundation, premium VPNs implement additional safeguards:

* **Anti-DDoS Infrastructure:** Server-level protection that can absorb and mitigate attacks
* **Automatic Kill Switch:** Instantly blocks internet if VPN connection drops, preventing IP exposure
* **DNS Leak Protection:** Ensures DNS requests don't leak outside the VPN tunnel
* **IPv6 Leak Protection:** Blocks IPv6 traffic that could reveal your real IP

Some VPNs, like ExpressVPN, provide anti-DDoS protection across their entire server network, while others offer it only on specific servers.

# Strict No-Logs Policy and Privacy Jurisdiction

**Your VPN provider could be legally compelled to log and share your data** depending on their jurisdiction. The best privacy-focused VPNs:

* Operate from privacy-friendly jurisdictions (Panama, British Virgin Islands, Switzerland)
* Maintain independently audited no-logs policies
* Use RAM-only servers that automatically wipe data upon restart
* Have transparent warrant canaries and transparency reports

For PUBG players, this matters because even legitimate VPN usage could be scrutinized in regions with strict gaming regulations or internet censorship.

# Multi-Platform Support: PC, Mobile, and Console

**PUBG is available on multiple platforms,** and your VPN should support all of them:

* **PC (Windows/Mac):** Native applications with gaming-optimized settings
* **Mobile (iOS/Android):** Lightweight apps with battery-efficient protocols
* **Consoles (PlayStation/Xbox):** Router support or SmartDNS functionality
* **Simultaneous Connections:** Ability to protect multiple devices at once

Console gamers face the additional challenge that PlayStation and Xbox don't natively support VPN applications, requiring either router configuration or using the VPN provider's SmartDNS feature.

# Best 5 VPNs for PUBG in 2025

After extensive testing across multiple devices, server locations, and gaming scenarios, these five VPNs consistently delivered the best performance for PUBG players:

# How to Set Up a VPN for PUBG: Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a VPN for PUBG is straightforward, but optimal configuration makes a significant difference in performance. Follow these steps for the best gaming experience:

**Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to a VPN** Select one of the VPNs recommended above based on your priorities (speed, budget, features). All offer money-back guarantees, so you can test before committing.

**Step 2: Download and Install the VPN Application** Visit your VPN provider's website and download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). The installation process is typically just a few clicks.

**Step 3: Select the Optimal VPN Protocol** For PUBG, choose:

* **WireGuard** (standard, available on most VPNs)
* **NordLynx** (if using NordVPN)
* **Lightway** (if using ExpressVPN)

Avoid older protocols like OpenVPN or IKEv2 for gaming, as they add unnecessary latency.

**Step 4: Connect to a Server Near PUBG Data Centers** Choose a VPN server close to your target PUBG region:

* For NA servers: Connect to US East (Virginia) or US West (California)
* For EU servers: Connect to Frankfurt or London
* For Asian servers: Connect to Singapore, Tokyo, or Seoul
* For SEA servers: Connect to Singapore

**Pro tip:** Connect to 2-3 different servers and run ping tests to find the fastest option. Servers become congested during peak hours, so having backup options helps.

**Step 5: Enable Essential Security Features** Before launching PUBG, enable:

* **Kill Switch:** Prevents internet access if VPN drops
* **DNS Leak Protection:** Ensures DNS requests stay encrypted
* **Split Tunneling (Optional):** Route only PUBG through VPN while other apps use regular internet

**Step 6: Launch PUBG and Test Connection** Start PUBG and check your ping in-game. If it's higher than expected:

* Try a different VPN server closer to you
* Ensure no bandwidth-heavy applications are running
* Switch to a wired Ethernet connection if using Wi-Fi
* Close any unnecessary background processes

**Console Setup (PlayStation/Xbox):** Consoles don't support VPN apps natively. Two options:

**Option A - Router VPN:** Install VPN on your router to protect all connected devices. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark offer detailed router guides.

**Option B - SmartDNS:** Use your VPN's SmartDNS feature (less security, but easier setup and no performance impact). ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer and NordVPN's SmartDNS work well for this.

# Common Concerns About Using VPNs for PUBG: Addressing Safety and Legality

# ""Will a VPN Increase My Ping and Make Lag Worse?""

**It depends on your specific situation.** In our testing:

**VPNs increased ping by 5-25ms** when connecting to nearby servers. If you already have low ping (under 30ms), this small increase is rarely noticeable. If your ISP provides optimal routing to PUBG servers, a VPN may make your connection slightly worse.

However, **VPNs decreased ping by 10-40ms** when:

* ISP routing was inefficient or took indirect paths
* Network congestion occurred during peak hours
* ISP was throttling gaming traffic
* Connecting to distant PUBG servers where direct routes weren't optimal

**Bottom line:** Test your specific setup. Connect to PUBG both with and without VPN, then compare in-game ping. If the VPN increases ping significantly, try different servers or ask your VPN provider for recommendations.

# ""Is Using a VPN Against PUBG's Terms of Service? Can I Get Banned?""

**The legal and ethical landscape is nuanced.** PUBG's Terms of Service explicitly state users agree not to ""use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on the Services or for any other purpose.""

**However:**

* **Using VPNs for security (DDoS protection, privacy, ISP throttling prevention) is generally considered legitimate use**
* There are no widespread reports of PUBG banning players solely for VPN usage
* Many professional PUBG players and content creators use VPNs publicly without issues
* PUBG Corporation's primary concern is cheating and exploiting regional pricing/content, not privacy protection

**We strongly recommend:**

* Use VPNs primarily for security and performance, not circumventing bans
* Don't use VPNs to exploit regional pricing or access exclusive content unfairly
* Don't use VPNs to evade account bans or penalties
* Review current PUBG policies for your region, as they may change
* Understand that violating Terms of Service could theoretically result in account action

**Disclaimer:** We don't condone violating Terms of Service or local laws. This guide focuses on legitimate security and privacy use cases. Users are responsible for complying with PUBG's Terms of Service and applicable laws in their jurisdiction.

# ""Are Free VPNs Safe for PUBG Gaming?""

**Absolutely not.** Free VPNs are dangerous for gaming, particularly competitive games like PUBG. Here's why:

**Security Risks:**

* Many free VPNs sell user data to advertisers and data brokers to generate revenue
* Some inject ads or trackers into your browsing sessions
* Others have been caught hosting malware on their networks
* Free VPNs rarely have the infrastructure to defend against DDoS attacks

**Performance Issues:**

* Bandwidth limitations (often 500MB-10GB per month)
* Speed throttling makes gaming virtually impossible
* Overcrowded servers result in 200ms+ ping
* Frequent disconnections during matches
* Limited server locations far from PUBG data centers

**Privacy Concerns:**

* Most free VPNs log and sell user activity data
* Many are based in privacy-hostile jurisdictions (China, Russia)
* Terms of service often grant broad rights to your data
* No accountability or legal recourse if security is compromised

**The Better Alternative:** Premium VPNs like Surfshark cost just $2.19/month—less than a coffee—while providing unlimited bandwidth, low latency, and actual security. All recommended VPNs offer 30-45 day money-back guarantees, letting you test risk-free.

**Bottom line:** The ""free"" in free VPNs comes at the cost of your privacy, security, and gaming experience. It's not worth the risk for competitive PUBG play.

# Final Recommendations: Choose Your PUBG VPN Based on Your Priorities

After extensive testing and analysis, here's our final verdict on which VPN to choose based on your specific needs:

**For Competitive Players:** ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol and anti-DDoS protection across all servers provide the most reliable performance for ranked and tournament play. The premium pricing is justified if gaming is your priority.

**For Best Overall Value:** NordVPN offers the ideal balance of performance, security, and price. The Meshnet feature for squad play and NordLynx protocol make it our top overall recommendation for most PUBG players.

**For Budget-Conscious Gamers:** Surfshark delivers professional-grade performance at the lowest price point, with unlimited connections making it perfect for families or multi-device setups.

**For Maximum Flexibility:** Private Internet Access's 35,000+ servers provide unmatched routing options and customization for experienced users who want complete control.

**For VPN Beginners:** CyberGhost's intuitive interface and dedicated gaming servers make it the easiest VPN to start using immediately, with a generous 45-day trial period.

**Critical Reminder:** Always use VPNs responsibly and in compliance with PUBG's Terms of Service and local laws. The primary purpose of a gaming VPN should be security and privacy—protecting yourself from DDoS attacks, ISP throttling, and privacy invasions. Using VPNs to circumvent bans or exploit regional restrictions may violate Terms of Service and potentially result in account action.

With gaming now the most targeted industry for cyber attacks, protecting your PUBG experience isn't just about winning matches—it's about safeguarding your account, your privacy, and your enjoyment of the game. Choose one of these five VPNs, test it with the money-back guarantee, and experience PUBG the way it's meant to be played: secure, stable, and lag-free.

**Remember:** Every VPN on this list offers a risk-free money-back guarantee (30-45 days). Test the service with your specific setup, measure your actual ping improvement, and make an informed decision based on real-world performance.

__________________________________
**Continuation from where last chapter ended**

**2026-03-14 Saturday [Evening 08:00 PM] (same evening, right after the last chapter)**

**(Mikasa's POV)**

I found myself sitting by the window in the restaurant, slowly finishing my meal. Outside, the streets were dimly lit by soft streetlights, casting a gentle glow. A soothing melody floated in the background, and my scarf hugged my neck comfortably. It felt peaceful in here. 

As I leaned against the window, I tapped my finger lightly on the glass, drifting into my thoughts. The reflection staring back at me seemed like a stranger. **“Is this really okay?”** I murmured to myself.

Just then, the door swung open, letting in a refreshing breeze, but I barely noticed. My eyes remained focused on the outside world. I lifted my coffee cup, ready for a sip, when suddenly, a voice broke through my daydream. 

It was a man’s voice at the counter, familiar and warm. 

**“Uh, just a coffee. No milk. Two sugars.”** 

My hand stopped in midair, my heart raced. I hadn’t heard that voice in two years. It was hard to believe what I was hearing.

I slowly looked up, and time seemed to still. There he was—the last person I expected to see again: Eren. He stood just a few tables away, talking to the waiter. His hair was shorter, tied back neatly, and he exuded a calm, grown-up energy.

He wore a dark jacket that made him look older, quieter, more at peace. Though he was different, everything about him felt hauntingly familiar. **“It’s him... after all this time,”** I whispered to myself, my fingers tightening around my scarf. I quickly looked away, pretending not to notice him, but it was too late—Eren had already spotted my reflection in the window. When I turned slightly, our eyes met unexpectedly. The silence between us spoke volumes, more than words ever could. 

Eren seemed as taken aback as I was, disbelief etched on his face. Then, a nervous smile flickered across his lips. He took a deep breath and made his way toward my table. Even though I was trying to ignore him, we both knew I wasn’t. 

He reached me and said, **“Hey…”** 

I turned to him, my heart racing, **“Eren!”** 

A moment passed, and neither of us knew what to say next. I could hardly think with my heart pounding so loudly. 

Then, he gestured to the chair across from me, asking, **“Mind if I… sit?”** 

I nodded, **“Go ahead.”** 

As he settled into the chair, the space between us felt both painfully distant and strangely intimate. For a second, we were lost in thought, searching for the right words. 

The waiter brought Eren’s coffee, and he stirred it slowly, trying to gather his thoughts. I couldn’t quite meet his gaze, looking out the window instead. I folded my arms tightly, avoiding his eyes while Eren stirred, the spoon clattering against the cup too many times. We were both clearly on edge.

Finally, he broke the awkward hush, a faint smile on his lips. 

**“You still remember the exact table number, huh?”**

 I finally looked at him. **“It’s hard to forget... things that change your life.”** 

He sighed and nodded, **“Yeah. You’re right.”** Clearing his throat, he asked, **“You still come here?”** 

I shrugged slightly, **“Sometimes. The food’s still good.”** 

His smile widened just a bit. **“Guess some things don’t change,”** he replied. 

**“Some do,”** I said without really thinking. The weight of my words hung in the air, affecting us more than I’d anticipated. 

His expression shifted, and he looked down at his cup, avoiding my gaze. I traced a circle on the table with my finger, an old habit I’d picked up when I felt nervous. Eren noticed, and it felt like a thread connecting us.

He smiled gently. **""You still do that,""** he said. 

I couldn’t help but feel a bit lost. I looked up at him, asking, **""What do you mean?""**

**""The thing with your finger. You’d always do it when you were upset,""** he replied. 

A slight, embarrassed smile crept onto my face. **""I guess I still do,""** I admitted. 

Just like that, the air between us felt a little lighter. Eren leaned back, seeming more at ease. My voice softened too. 

**""So, how's life treating you?""** he asked. 

**""Busy. Work, deadlines, rent. Just the usual,""** I answered. 

He chuckled, **""Sounds like adulthood.""** 

Then I turned the question back to him. **""What about you?""** 

**""I've been traveling a lot. France, Germany, and now I’m back here, ready to work,""** he said. **""It feels strange, walking the same streets again after all this time,""** he added. 

**""Yeah, some streets seem heavier than I remember,""** I replied quietly. He took a sip of his coffee, and I watched him closely—the small wrinkles under his eyes, that hint of tiredness. 

**""You look... different,""** I told him.

He looked up and asked, **""Older?""** 

I smiled softly and replied, **""Calmer.""** 

He returned a faint grin, **""You too.""** 

For just a moment, we shared a smile that felt like a glimpse into our past. A gentle breeze drifted in through the half-open window, mixing with the sounds of clinking cups, laughter, and the distant hum of traffic. Resting my chin in my hand, I gazed out at the lights flickering outside. 

**“Armin and Annie got married last month,”** I told him. 

**“Yeah, he sent me pictures from the wedding. I had no idea Annie could smile that much,”** he responded. 

I chuckled, **“You’d be surprised.”** Our laughter danced softly around us. 

**“And Jean and Pieck just got engaged today,""** I added. 

**""Jean? Wow, he really beat me to it,""** he said, his tone a mix of surprise and admiration. 

I grinned, teasingly replying, **""You sound jealous.""** 

**""I’m not jealous, just shocked that he found someone who can actually put up with him,""** he retorted, pretending to sigh dramatically. 

**“Guess he finally did it. That guy never gives up.”**

**“He's changed too. More mature now,”** I said. 

He nodded and remarked, **“Seems like everyone’s growing up except us.”** 

I smiled quietly back at him, **“Maybe we just took the longer route.”** 

The mood between us began to lighten. My scarf slipped from my shoulder, and Eren's hand instinctively moved to adjust it, just like he used to, but then he stopped himself. I noticed the hesitation. In that moment, something unspoken lingered in the air, like a farewell and a memory all at once. The laughter faded, leaving a soft, gentle silence behind. 

I looked down at my hands and asked, **“Why did you leave like that, Eren?”** 

He paused, his gaze dropping, a hint of guilt crossing his features. 

**“I owe you an apology, Mikasa. For everything. For leaving, for… not handling things right,”** he admitted, staring into his cup. 

I stayed quiet, feeling my heart soften. 

**“I thought distance would help us. That if I could fix myself, we wouldn’t hurt each other anymore,”** he added. 

**“Did it work?”** I questioned. 

After a moment, he replied, **“No. I just ended up missing you more.”**

A relieved sigh escaped me, half hopeful, half heavy. **“You could've just told me that,”** I said softly. 

**“I know, but I was scared. You were the one thing I didn’t want to lose,”** he confessed. 

I looked into his eyes, and for the first time in years, they were the same—gentle, uncertain, and sincere. 

**“You already did,”** I told him, my voice steady but kind. 

Eren nodded slowly, taking it in. **“I'm sorry, Mikasa, for everything,”** he said, his tone sincere. 

**“I know. I forgave you a long time ago,”** I replied calmly. **“Maybe we both needed that time. Back then, we didn’t know how to love without hurting each other.”**

He looked at me, surprised by my words. **“You have changed. You sound stronger,”** he said softly. 

**“You too. You seem… peaceful,”** I returned, giving him a half-smile.

He nodded, saying, **“It took me a long time, but I finally figured out that peace isn’t about running away — it’s about facing what you left behind.”** 

His words spilled out quickly, but they felt true. A small, genuine smile crept onto my face. 

We sat there for a little while, the restaurant slowly emptying as the closing hours approached. I noticed the clock reading 9:30 PM, and Eren glanced at it too. I turned to look outside, where the snow was falling gently. 

I stood up, picking up my bag. **“It’s late,”** I said softly. 

**“Let me walk you home. The snow is coming down pretty hard,”** he offered. 

I hesitated for a moment but then nodded, agreeing. 

As we walked under the glow of the streetlights, the cold air wrapped around us, yet it felt peaceful. The snow kept fluttering down, my scarf dancing in the breeze. 

He broke the quiet, asking, **“Still wearing it?”** 

I touched my scarf lightly, then responded, **“Just for tonight.”** 

**“It looks good on you. It always did,”** he replied. 

We continued walking in silence, letting the moment drift around us. 

When we finally reached my apartment, he said, **“I’m glad we talked again, even if it’s just like this.”** 

After a brief pause, I said, **“Me too. This must be what closure feels like.”** **“It was really nice to see you again,”** I added. 

**“You too,”** he replied, though he seemed to hesitate. A faint smile appeared on his face. 

We stopped near the gate of my apartment, and he said, **“Take care, Mikasa.”**

I watched as he walked away, disappearing into the falling snow. Deep down, I hoped that starting again wouldn’t be impossible, but I wasn’t sure it would ever happen again.


**(Six months later)**

**(Normal POV)**

In a warm, inviting house, familiar faces gathered together to celebrate. Among them were Armin, Annie, Jean, Pieck, Connie, Sasha, Reiner, and many more. Eren was busy setting up the plates, while Mikasa gently brought out a cake, its sweetness reflecting the joy they all felt. 

The walls were decorated with beloved photos, one in particular standing out: Eren and Mikasa dressed in wedding clothes, beneath beautiful cherry blossoms. 

Armin reached for the picture, a soft smile lighting up his face. **""I still can’t believe you two are actually married,""** he said, his voice filled with admiration.

It was true. After everything they had faced, Eren and Mikasa had finally found their way to each other. They married to embrace the peaceful life they had always dreamed of, sharing their happiness with loved ones. 

Eren looked at Armin, grinning, and said, **""I told you I’d make things right one day.""** 

Mikasa teasingly added, **""Better late than never,""** which filled the room with laughter.

As the laughter faded away, Mikasa turned her eyes to Eren, a gentle smile gracing her lips. Once full of turmoil, her heart now felt calm. She had found the person she had always wanted—Eren. All the pain and sorrow of the past began to fade as she locked eyes with him, knowing that they would never be alone again.

In the soft quiet between them, Mikasa thought, **""Maybe we were never meant to be apart. Maybe we just needed time to grow, to break, to heal, and to reunite. Love doesn’t always last through time, but ours did. Maybe love doesn’t disappear when there is distance. Maybe it waits quietly until both hearts are ready again.""**

Leaning gently against Eren's shoulder, she felt his warmth wrap around her as he put his arm around her. Meanwhile, the celebration continued around them, smiles exchanged between friends, a beautiful reminder of the love they had fought for.

After the party, as the laughter and music faded into the background, Eren and Mikasa stood side by side by the window. Sunlight cast a warm glow around them. Mikasa's scarf wrapped softly over her shoulders while she held Eren's hand tightly. He gazed into her captivating eyes. She met his gaze with a gentle smile.

**“I love you, Eren,”** she whispered, her voice sincere.

**“Same to you, Mikasa,”** he replied, feeling his heart swell at her words.

With each moment, the space between them shrank as she leaned closer. Their lips brushed together. They closed their eyes and savored the warmth of the moment, losing themselves in the sweetness of their connection. In that perfect instant, the worries of the outside world faded away, leaving just the two of them wrapped in love.

Mikasa buried comfortably in Eren's hands. As they shared this intimate moment, it felt like nothing else mattered. Above them, birds flew gracefully through the sky, their calls echoing wishes for their reunion. All Eren and Mikasa needed was the love they had for each other and the promise of a shared future. Surrounded by friends who would always support them, they enjoyed the joy of this peaceful moment—a beautiful beginning in the story of their lives together.

**Hello everyone,**

**I hope you all enjoyed the story. As I mentioned in the story, Eren and Mikasa finally got married and starts to live a peaceful life together.**

**As for an epilogue chapter, I find myself without ideas. You might consider the last part from the *Normal point of view as an epilogue* if that works for you.**

**In any case, this marks the end of my journey with this story. I spent the last three or four months writing it, and it has meant a lot to me. I truly appreciate all your support throughout this process. Without your encouragement, I doubt I would have come this far.**

**As I mentioned earlier, this is my very first story. Also English is not my primary language. I know I may have made some mistakes in my storytelling, but I feel proud of what I’ve accomplished. This experience will serve as inspiration for my next big project.**

**At this point, I don’t think I will write another Eremika story. If possible, I’ll share smaller scenes and recommend some stories that I really enjoy. This week or next, I plan to post a compilation where you can find all the chapters in a single post.**

1oov2xt,https://i.redd.it/fo0nuyinodzf1.jpeg,What should I upgrade first? [$3000],"Hi All, This is my current setup and I’ve constantly been making coffee ( mostly lattes, from light to dark roasted depending on what beans I get that month ) once per day ( occasionally more ) for ~5 years. Once in a while I will do pour overs. I’m finally ready for an upgrade! Before purchasing this setup I’ve never really had the habit of drinking coffee, and now I can’t go a day without coffee anymore.

Biggest problem I noticed with current setup is that even if I use the same beans with the same grind settings, pull time somehow can vary by 5+ seconds day to day… Even if I tried to dial in and get a reasonable pull time, a few days later the shots are watery again and gets  pulled in like 10+ seconds :( I still have no clue what the reason is…

Anyways, since I figured I’m the type of person that likes to stick to a well built product for a long time, and that a quality machine is worth investing since I’ll be using it daily, I am willing to pay for whatever makes more sense.

With the current setup, is it better to upgrade the grinder first? Or the espresso machine first?

For grinders I was originally looking at Mazzer Philos, but since the price hike I’m now considering Lagom P80? I’ve read many good reviews on previous P64 and given the similar price point maybe P80 is a good choice? I’m also open to other suggestions, preferably in the sub-$2000 price range.

For espresso machines, honestly I don’t have a specific preference yet. I’ve looked at a few Profitecs and also some lever machines that looked super cool 😜 Since I don’t want to settle on something that I’d want to upgrade again in a few years, maybe I’ll increase my budget to $3k (okay to go few hundreds above)? 

However I am looking to only upgrade either one first, and the other later ( upgrading both at the same time is too much moneywise 🫠 ) Which upgrade do you think is more noticeable?

Thanks in advance!",1,1762322183.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I think i wanted the full because I know I snore/breathe through my mouth. I figured the full would cover that.
I notice if I open my mouth, or let my tongue slip, my cheeks inflate, and that just feels weird... my phone says i'm not snoring, i'm sure if i'm asleep and my mouth opens the weird pressure on my cheeks would make me close back up.

I am having comfort issues with the full mask though. It's also tough to talk to Alexa with the full mask. Has anyone used just the nose piece as well as a full mask?
Is there a snoring issue with just the nose pillow?

Thank you!

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

1oov0jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetakethepainout/comments/1oov0jf/top_10_compliance_training_providers_in_australia/,Top 10 Compliance Training Providers In Australia,"Compliance training. Ugh. The phrase can make you feel like you're in for a dry, boring lecture, right? But here's the truth: for businesses in Australia, it's not just a nice-to-have – it's essential. Think of it this way: the game's rules constantly change, and if your team isn't up to speed, you're opening yourself up to serious risks. We're talking about everything from costly fines to a bruised reputation, and nobody wants that.

It's all about ensuring everyone, from the newest hire to the CEO, understands the legal and ethical issues that keep your business on the right side of the law. It builds a much better workplace culture when everyone knows what's expected of them.

# Picking the Right Partner: It's a Big Deal

So, how do you find the right compliance training provider when so many are out there? It can feel overwhelming, like picking the perfect coffee bean in a bustling roastery. To help you out, we've pulled together a list of Australia's top 10 providers. We'll give you the lowdown on what makes each tick, who they're best for, and what to remember.

# 1. Sentrient: The All-in-One Aussie Go-To

Imagine having a one-stop shop for all your online compliance training and HR needs. That's Sentrient. They're Australian-based and good at ensuring their e-learning courses are easy to use, legally sound, and engaging. Their goal? To protect your business and help your employees learn without feeling like they're slogging through a textbook.

**What's Cool About Them?**

* **Heaps of Australian Courses:** They've got a massive library covering everything from workplace health and safety (WHS) to cybersecurity.
* **Easy-Peasy System (LMS):** Their Learning Management System makes it simple to roll out courses, keep track of who's done what, and pull reports.
* **Make It Your Own:** You can often tweak the courses to fit your company's look and feel.

* Great reporting features for those pesky audits.
* They grow with you, whether you're a small startup or a big corporation.
* If you're already using their HR system, it's a seamless fit.

**Things to Consider:**

* Getting the LMS exactly how you want it might take a little getting used to.
* For niche compliance topics, you might need something custom-built.

**Perfect for:** Small to large Australian businesses who want an up-to-date, online compliance solution, especially if you're keen on an integrated HR and compliance platform.

**Price Tag:** You'll need to chat with them directly for a quote – it's not public.

# 2. Financial Education: For the Money Mavens

If you're in the finance world, you know the rules are different (and often more complicated!). Financial Education is specifically for you. They offer deep-dive training in financial services compliance, risk management, and all those tricky regulatory frameworks.

**Things to Consider:**

* If you're not in finance, this likely isn't for you.

**Price Tag:** Not public. Get in touch with them.

# 3. Online Compliance Training (by Microlearning Solutions): Small Bites, Big Impact

Ever feel like you don't have time for long, drawn-out training? Online Compliance Training (from Microlearning Solutions) gets that. They offer short, sharp, ""bite-sized"" modules designed to be engaging and help complex topics stick.

* Great for employees who don't have time for traditional training.
* Can be cost-effective for a widespread rollout.

**Things to Consider:**

For extremely complex topics that need a super deep dive, these shorter modules might not be enough.

Some organisations still prefer longer, more traditional training for critical areas.

**Perfect for:** Businesses looking for engaging, efficient, and flexible online compliance training, mainly if your team is spread out or you prefer modern learning styles.

**Price Tag:** Not public, but typically they have tiered pricing based on users and courses.

# 4. Safetrac: The Experienced Award-Winner

* Content is always legally accurate and up to date.
* A fantastic user experience with engaging course design.
* Their awards speak volumes about their quality.
* They help you build an authentic culture of compliance, not just a box-ticking exercise.

**Things to Consider:**

* They might be a more premium option, maybe less suited for small businesses with tight budgets.

**Perfect for:** Medium to large Australian businesses (especially ASX-listed companies and those in highly regulated industries) that need legally sound, comprehensive, and top-quality compliance training with a robust LMS.

**Price Tag:** Not public. You'll need to reach out for a custom quote.

Does the volume I consume even warrant consideration of Home Roasting?

Is this another Rabbit Hole?

What is the shelf life for green beans? Can they be frozen like roasted beans? 

Can I buy one lb bags and still save money?  What is smallest unit of green beans sold?

Are roaster's portable? I don't really have a lot of counter space, so would probably want to stash away when not being used.

Will it stink up the house? 

How long, or how many pounds of beans will it typically take before I develope the skills to roast beans as good as those I buy from experienced roasters?

 Lastly, what gear do I need and would you recommend?

When I messaged you, I said that there was more to say. I did not say it because I am tired and our story makes me feel sad. 

I told you that I liked you. You said you didn’t feel the same way. Why did you read to me, night after night? I said “you don’t feel that way about me and it’s too confusing for me.” You didn’t say anything, packed your crotchet supplies, and retreated to your room. 

I am sorry for a lot of things. I’m sorry for saying “I knew it” when you opened up about your birthday being hard for you. I’m sorry for saying that I was jealous of your spreadsheet autism. I’m sorry for my intensity. I’m sorry for putting you in charge of cigs. I’m sorry for people pleasing. I’m sorry for keeping my smoking from you afterwards until the day I moved out. I’m sorry for saying that I would get you a copy of Unmasking Autism for your birthday and then not following through. I wished you a happy birthday, but couldn’t find the book at any used book stores, I looked and looked and looked.

But, I am also hurt. You didn’t care about my birthday when it came around even though you knew how hard it was for me too. You said “I have no interest in meeting your friends,” but then said, “I wish I could meet people like you.” It hurt my feelings when you made fun of Moulin Rouge and told me to “take it down a notch” when I got excited about a musical that I was showing you. Maybe you were trying to be playful, but it hurt my feelings. It hurt my feelings that you didn’t care about my art or even bother to watch what I sent you. You dismissed me, but then read me literal smut and breadcrumbed me. Why the cowboy hat? Why the cat cans? Why Heather? Why a coffee bar? Why the movie ranking slideshow? Why a waterfall? Why the phonetic alphabet? Why the space buns? Why the battery screenshot? You do not love me. You do not even like me. It hurt. 

You are the one who rejected me and ended things. Every time you reached out or sent a digital signal (what you used to do for A), it felt like a knife in my chest. You are hurting me. I am not going to tell you that I loved you and that I am trying to build a life without you because you told me to leave. I am not going to tell you that I really thought that we were building a life together. I am not going to tell you that I miss you. I am not going to tell you that I miss our moments in the quiet. I am not going to tell you how much I cried over you. I am not going to tell you how often I think of you and how it breaks my heart every time. I am not going to tell you that you broke my heart. I will never tell you that you broke my heart. I will never tell you that I love you. 

I will not wait for you. I will not wait for you. I will not wait for you. Sometimes, I hate you and then I remember that the opposite of love is indifference and it serves as a reminder of all of the things that I will never tell you. I am letting you go. Maybe in another life, we were cat dads who watched movies, read books, learned, made things, and loved together. Maybe in another life, we stopped hurting each other. Maybe in another life, we celebrated our birthdays, went on walks, and talked about our special interests. 

Maybe in another life, we were more than just lessons for each other. You were a mirror of my own disorganized attachment. We grew up very differently, but simultaneously had so many overlaps. Perhaps, I should thank you for breaking my heart. I now know how it feels and will do my best to never hurt anyone the way that you hurt me.

1oouwl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1oouwl4/can_someone_diagnose_my_weird_anxiety_disorder/,Can Someone Diagnose My Weird Anxiety Disorder?,"TLDR: Pregnancy caused me to suddenly become anxious and panicked to have conversation with anyone, including my own husband. And I haven't been the same since.

What I am referring to as a ""disorder"" began in 2021 when I was pregnant with my first child. Some back story - I have always been a more introverted, socially anxious, awkward personality but I got along fine in school. It actually didn't really become an issue until I hit puberty and then I became very nervous to make new friends and had a lot of performance anxiety with giving speeches, etc. Nothing crazy. I met my husband in high school and we were best friends - never felt anxious around him. 

Then here's what happened - one day literally in an instant everything changed. I was 23 in the third trimester of pregnancy and I very clearly remember sitting on the bed having a normal conversation with him and then I lost my train of thought. I felt panicky. I turned red. I had all the physical symptoms that I would have if I were giving a speech. I was acting weird and my husband didn't know how to react so he just kind of laughed it off and we went about our day, but of course I did not understand what had just happened. Why would I suddenly feel so anxious in conversation with my husband? 

And then it kept happening. It was like someone had flipped a switch in my brain and I kept having these episodes where I no longer knew how to be myself. I couldn't speak normally to my husband. I was anxious when he was in the room knowing we would have to have conversation. It wasn't him that was making me anxious, he had done nothing wrong. It just felt like constant performance anxiety, like I had the feeling of being ""put on the spot"" all the time. I was glad when he was gone and got nervous when I heard the garage door open because I knew that meant I had to converse. He would ask me something or make a joke and I would internally panic, trying to rack my brain to remember how I would normally respond. I was not myself and it was very obvious. He didn't know what was happening to me and neither did I, and I think we just did our best to ignore it and focus on the baby that was about to come. 

I also began to notice that I felt this way around everyone, not just my husband. It's like my social anxiety got increased tenfold. But it was most apparent with my husband because I was with him all the time and he was the one person I should not be feeling this way with. Fast forward to our baby arriving - I had a traumatic birth mentally. Not physically, and I'm grateful for that. But mentally, I was already struggling with the fact that my relationship with my husband was in a weird place, and then I began to have crazy intrusive thoughts during labor. It was like a dark cloud of terror and depression settled over me as I was trying to bring a baby into the world and I had never felt so low. I was also very irrational and convinced myself that I could not tell anyone or else my baby would be taken away. 

I suffered through this for the next several weeks and it was such a blur. I was walking through a fog. My husband didn't know who I was and I didn't either. I will spare all the details but I basically felt like my true self was hidden somewhere deep within me, and someone else with no emotion and who didn't know how to speak to people had taken over me. I felt chained. It's like I couldn't remember how to be me. I genuinely thought that maybe I had developed autism... but I knew that was impossible to spontaneously develop like that in adulthood. 

Eventually, I got help. I saw a counselor, I told her everything and she convinced me to tell my husband. It is really hard to tell the person that you've been with for 8 years that you feel anxious talking to them. He kept thinking he had done something but I didn't know how to explain to him that it was nothing he did. There was just something wrong with my brain. I remember him telling me he just wanted his wife back and that broke me. He was very confused as well and I don't blame him at all for being upset too. On top of all of this we had a newborn baby to care for - it was a very difficult stage in our relationship. 

Little by little, I opened up to him more and I opened up to others some about my struggle and I began to feel somewhat normal again. I was on zoloft for a time and I think it did help at least a little bit but then seemed to stop helping so I quit zoloft and haven't been on medication since. 

But I still have never been the same. I don't think it ever went away. I think I've just learned to cope with it. I still feel it daily in every conversation. I still avoid going on coffee dates with my friends because one-on-one, face-to-face conversation terrifies me. And it didn't used to be this way before I was pregnant. (Also I didn't want to go into all these details but this anxiety also ruined a close friendship I had developed) I still get nervous to go on dates with my husband and he can always tell that I'm very anxious. We used to go on dinner dates all the time before pregnancy and I never felt this way once. 

It feels like I will never be able to get back to how I was before pregnancy. It's been almost 5 years that I've lived with this and I've considered going to a psychiatrist but have never gotten around to it. I'm so thankful my husband is very patient with me and he tries to understand my struggle the best he can. We even have a running joke that I have an ""alter ego"" and she has a different name, which I know may sound weird, but it is helpful when I'm very anxious, it's nice to be able to make light of it by saying I am \[my alter ego's name\]. But every day, every conversation, I have that ""put on the spot"" feeling as if I'm giving a speech and feel panicked and I don't know if it will ever go away. Some days are worse than others. I hate this feeling and I'm tired of constantly having to deal with it. I just wish to be myself again - the girl that could converse normally without feeling so stressed out!

Hey Reddit fam,

Just joined today. I’m originally from Dehradun and have been working in Gurgaon for a while now. I work in the AI / deep tech space — one of those jobs that sounds exciting but keeps you glued to a screen most of the time.

I’m 30 now, from a Tier-1 college, doing well career-wise, but being away from home and living alone here sometimes feels… empty. Between work and deadlines, I barely get time to meet people, and honestly, haven’t built a circle here. No close friends, no relationship — just work and gym on repeat.

Sometimes I catch myself wondering — is this what success is supposed to feel like?

Would be great to connect with some like-minded folks around Gurgaon or Delhi— maybe for coffee, walks, or just conversations beyond work.

I was up nights crying in pain and propped up on pillows & taking both nausea meds and tums. Nothing helped me. I've taken prilosec for years and that like wasn't enough anymore? I was up at 3:30 for work 5 days a week and started every. single. shift. with the worst heartburn every morning. I had completely stopped drinking and eating the food. Even after this not much had changed, I was so worried that I had completely ruined my stomach because of the food and drinks I used to consume from there. Flash forward to 2024, I had finally quit Starbucks to work in property management. I was tired of working with food/coffee, tired of being overworked (I was a supervisor working opens full time), and tired of getting up at 3:30 am with an average of only 5-6 hours of sleep. A few weeks go by, I'm settling into my new job (that I still work for now and really love) and I realize that my heartburn had reduced by at least 90%! For me, it was the stress, it was my job, it was the little sleep I was getting. If you're experiencing something similar, please consider improving these parts of your life if you can! It can change a LOT. Of course I get heartburn sometimes, but instead of popping tums/alka seltzer almost daily, I'm popping only tums at most once a week and take nausea medication at most once every 2 months. I hope this encourages some of you to make changes in your life that you can control to improve your quality of life, it might really help! ",4,1762321321.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

So I am in a normal house but turn right, go down stairs, everyone is dressed kinda like Steampunk/Sherlock Holmes/like a pirate. Then I’m at the second set of turning stairs and there’s a ticket taker in a gown with a tophat, and suddenly there are no stairs, everything is a dark brown or red, and you climb down but theres a deep drop with grip bars and a dark brown bookshelf you climb down the bookshelf, facing forward, gravity is lighter in pressure, like you’re in slow motion or on the moon or something, but when you reach the floor, it’s normal again, you walk through bookshelves and people and the wall is to the left. It goes from dark brown slowly to a tan beach sand hue, and there’s three TVs with a lounge area, and to the right are laundry facilities, under the stairs. They’re big and weird, like large vats you place your clothes into. Someone does it for you, which I would never allow in real life. You can grab any kind of drink, not a lot of alcohol I mean like coffees or tea, milk or fizzy water or soda. I last got a cherry soda. The house is located at the top of a gentle hill with a city behind it. If you do want alcohol you can go there. Normal city stuff, sidewalks, roads, electric trains, and alleyways. I go past the train station, through the alley, there’s like wet patches on the ground, bikes and dumpsters, run of the mill alleyway stuff, then there’s a white building at the end of the alley with this awesome basement hockey bar place. Bright white inside, self-service token bar to the left, a register in the middle and a bar you can sit at behind the register with big TVs and a bunch of random people who all seem friendly.

It’s like the second time I visited this city in my dreams. Full autonomy, free to leave, but you don’t want to. Has anyone else dreamt of a place like this? It’s way more fun than working in mallworld.",1,1762321093.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I didn’t want to pay right away, so I spent some time reading through free VPN discussions here to find options that are actually safe.

I first tried a random VPN from the app store and it was a bad idea. It was packed with ads, the connection kept dropping, and it didn’t feel secure at all. After that, I went back to the recommendations people actually trust. I downloaded ProtonVPN and Windscribe since they are always mentioned. Proton’s free servers can get slower during busy times, but there are no ads and it feels reliable. Windscribe gave me more server choices and the speed was good enough for browsing and watching videos without issues.

It’s kind of surprising how many sketchy free VPNs exist if you don’t look into them first. Is anyone here currently using a safe free VPN that’s been working well for them? I would like to have a few more good choices on hand.",1,1762321076.0,VPN_Reviewer,1,1.0,False

1oouqug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1oouqug/nonfiction_writing_as_a_way_to_process/,Nonfiction writing as a way to process,"TLDR: discarded by a DA 8 months ago and it was very painful for a while, but the pain has changed with time. Tonight I wrote a vignette that captures some of what I have felt over the past year. 

\-------------------------------

8 months later. It’s almost been a year now and I’m ashamed to say that you’re still on my mind. Most often, in the time I’m by myself—after a date with a new man—or worst of all, on one occasion—lying in bed with him awake, you drift unbidden into my thoughts.

He looked at my hand and asked me if I had hurt myself. My last conversation about the birthmark cradled between the base of my hand and my hitchhiker thumb had been with you. You laughed when I said it was the color my skin should have been, as you knew that joke was for you in particular, a mixed girl to a mixed boy.

I could tell you liked my hands, and I liked that you noticed things about me. You liked that they were slender and finely-made, and you noticed how my fingers matched my Dad’s — an upwards tilt that I’ve only ever seen in Tamils.

We were not right, and it is easy for me to concede that you made the choice we should’ve made long ago. And yet I do not know how I can love another.

The new boy is kind. He has the good of you — the hunger, the unending drive to make his mark on the world, and the sharp intelligence to match — but he has softness too. Most notably, he is generous. I almost cried the third time we went out, when at the end of the date, he bought me a coffee. I realized you had never once done that. The whole year we were entangled, I had always bought my own. And so it was between you and me. That which I loved was mine, and stayed in its assigned place, on my side of the gulf between us.

The heart, however, is not so easily swayed. He wants to kiss me, often, and he doesn’t care who sees. When he tries to kiss me I can’t help but wonder why he wants to do it so often, and i know that this is not how I am supposed to feel.

I recall a girl discontinuous from the woman I am, who flew into the arms of her lover, my body rising to meet yours with reckless abandon. I remember mornings in San Francisco — mornings were always the best time we had — and you kissing me in the hallway, your body warm, your smile broad, both of us deaf and dumb to the outside world—the grumblings of your roommate and the precision of my bus schedule.

I could never think straight around you. My heart jumped into my throat, my palms suddenly slick, and my stomach turned over, twirling acrobatically through my abdomen. 

I tell myself on good days that if you texted me, I wouldn’t respond. On true days, I admit to myself, that I would lose my mind, because where you are concerned, I always have and will, lose my mind.

I wait for my birthday, wondering absentmindedly, all year, if that will be the day that you finally text. You are just callous enough and polite enough to do so. I consider that you might not text at all — an outcome which seems ever more likely as the days go by.

In another life, you show up to my apartment, a day after the ending, with flowers. Not the flowers you bought me for valentines day—the stale, somewhat crushed, bouquet of 6 white and 6 red roses. No flowers had ever seemed less…me, but I am not convinced you knew entirely what I was, despite all my best efforts to show you. Perhaps you did, and you just did not like what you saw. Or perhaps, and this is somehow worst of all, you did not realize that it mattered.

In another life, you bring a bouquet that overflows with summer—irises, daffodils, peonies, and so many flowers that I can hardly carry them up the stairs without leaving stragglers. You tell me that you could not walk away, and that I am in your eyes and thoughts and hair and clothes and skin and bone. That leaving me would be to cut a hole in your very heart. That you cannot sleep at night, and that you lie wakeful in the early mornings.

I would accept even less. Tell me that I didn’t imagine the warmth between us. Tell me that I didn’t imagine the soft look in your eyes. Tell me that it wasn’t the last time, and that you don’t want a last time — not with me.

8 months since I last saw the stars in your eyes and I have been underground ever since. In your absence, I have become you. I view the girl who was with you with the same dispassionate gaze — slight bafflement at her adoration and minor embarrassment at her heedless attempts for romance. Didn’t she know there was work/exercise/a house to clean/family and friends to meet/holidays to observe/bed to get to on time? Didn’t she know that success is a combination on the bidirectional axes of money and fame? What is love next to that. It is not even on the chart.

And in this way, we go back to being strangers. Two strangers in the same city, and in a city of 9 million people, it’s almost more likely this way. I think you loved me once, and I wonder if my ghost ever haunts you too. Today, we elected our first South Asian mayor, and I think our ballots were counted together, somewhere.

## For the Cozy Homebody

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20women)

She finds pure joy in a quiet night in, a good book, and a cup of tea. These gifts are all about elevating her comfort and creating a personal sanctuary.

*   **The Weighted Blanket:** More than just a blanket, this is a hug in physical form. It helps reduce anxiety and promotes restful sleep. Look for one with a washable, soft cover like micro-fleece or Minky.
*   **Luxury Loungewear Set:** Ditch the old sweats. A silky or high-quality cotton pajama set makes her feel pampered and put-together, even when she's relaxing. Brands like Lunya or Eberjey are top-tier.
*   **Smart Mug:** A must-have for anyone whose coffee or tea always goes cold. The Ember Mug² keeps her drink at the *exact* perfect temperature for hours. It's a game-changer.
*   **Aromatherapy Diffuser & Essential Oils:** Transform her space into a spa. An ultrasonic diffuser paired with a set of high-quality essential oils (like lavender, eucalyptus, and sandalwood) can set any mood.

*   **Theragun Mini (or similar massager):** For the woman who works out or simply carries her stress in her shoulders, a percussive massage gun is a life-saver for sore muscles. The mini version is portable and surprisingly powerful.
*   **Acupressure Mat:** It looks like a bed of nails, but this tool is fantastic for relieving tension, improving circulation, and encouraging deep relaxation. It's a unique and highly effective wellness gift.
*   **High-End Skincare Set:** Instead of guessing her favorite moisturizer, opt for a curated set from a reputable brand like Drunk Elephant, Tatcha, or Sunday Riley. A set with a cleanser, serum, and moisturizer is a safe and luxurious bet.
*   **Subscription to a Meditation App:** Give the gift of peace. A one-year subscription to an app like Calm or Headspace provides guided meditations, sleep stories, and masterclasses to help her de-stress.

## For the Tech-Savvy Trendsetter

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20women)

She loves the latest gadgets, appreciates smart home efficiency, and isn't afraid of a little cutting-edge technology.

*   **Portable Bluetooth Speaker:** For picnics, beach days, or just great sound in any room. A JBL or Sonos Roam speaker offers incredible sound quality in a compact, durable package.
*   **Smart Journal:** The Rocketbook smart notebook lets her write notes by hand, then instantly digitize them to the cloud (like Google Drive or Evernote) with a simple scan. It's perfect for the tech-lover who still enjoys analog methods.
*   **Digital Photo Frame:** A modern twist on a classic gift. Load it up with family photos beforehand for an incredibly touching and personal present that keeps on giving.

Her kitchen is her domain, and she loves nothing more than hosting friends and family for a delicious meal.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20women)

*   **Artisan Olive Oil & Vinegar Set:** Elevate her cooking game. A set of high-quality, small-batch olive oils and aged balsamic vinegars is a sophisticated gift that she'll actually use.
*   **Beautiful Charcuterie Board:** Go beyond the basic wood plank. Look for a stunning marble and wood or slate board that she'll be proud to display at her next party.
*   **High-End Kitchen Gadget:** Think about what she needs. Does she love pasta? A Philips pasta maker is incredible. Is she a cocktail enthusiast? A premium cocktail smoker or a set of elegant crystal coupes would be a huge hit.
*   **Cooking Class Experience:** Gift her a voucher for a local or virtual cooking class. It's an experience, a new skill, and a fun memory all in one.

## For the Sentimentalist

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20women)

She treasures memories and meaningful gestures above all else. These gifts are designed to be personal, heartfelt, and cherished for years to come.

*   **Custom Star Map:** A map of what the night sky looked like on a significant date—the day you met, her birthday, your wedding day. It's a beautiful and incredibly romantic piece of wall art.
*   **Personalized Jewelry:** A necklace with her child's initial, a bracelet engraved with a meaningful date or quote, or a locket with a tiny photo. This is a classic for a reason.
*   **""Open When..."" Letters:** A DIY gift that costs little but means everything. Write a series of letters for her to open at specific moments: ""Open when you've had a bad day,"" ""Open when you miss me,"" ""Open on our next anniversary.""
*   **A Curated Memory Box:** Find a beautiful wooden box and fill it with mementos from your relationship: ticket stubs, photos, small trinkets, and a handwritten letter explaining the significance of each item.

I’ve been on HRT since 12/09/23.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership. Something uncomplicated for once that makes me really feel content & safe, and feel like I’ve got a competent trusted person next to me who won’t break my heart for the millionth time. A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won’t hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration.

I’m pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it’s mostly under control with medication. I hate smoking of tobacco, and usually only drink socially. 420 friendly as long as it isn’t a total obsession like my ex who stole hundreds from me to buy it.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I’m only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 32 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity.

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

I am a switch. I am NOT Poly, only monogamous.

1ooupla,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1ooupla/final_destination_kill_or_be_killed/,Final destination: kill or be killed,"Act One, Scene 1: The Premonition (The Catastrophe)
Setting: Downtown city gridlock at noon. A massive skyscraper at 18 Oceans Avenue looms over the street.
The camera pans down from the construction site, where a giant crane maneuvers a steel beam, to the gridlocked street below.
In a line of three vehicles:
 * A truck (Gary and Rey).
 * A red sedan (Maria).
 * A black SUV (Sarah, Chloe, and Liam).
Mark, a pedestrian, is walking along the sidewalk.
Inside the SUV, Sarah, Chloe, and Liam are listening to the radio. R.E.M.'s ""It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"" is playing. A bee flies in and stings Sarah’s hand.
The world dissolves into the vision.
The Vision (The Unfolding Disaster)
 * Trigger: In the crane cab, a gust of wind spills the operator's coffee onto the console. The crane violently swings the metal beam like a wrecking ball, smashing the side of the half-built building.
 * Crane Demolition: The steel beam swings back with full momentum and takes out the crane cab, knocking the massive structure down and crippling the building.
 * Victim 1: Rey (Crushing) & Mass Casualty: The first pile of debris—a massive concrete slab—crushes the passenger side of Gary’s truck, instantly killing Rey and a dozen others on the street.
 * Victim 2: Gary (The Diagonal Slice): Above, a floor collapses, and a stack of glass panes slides off the edge. Gary crawls out the driver's side window only to be caught by a falling pane that slices him diagonally across his torso.
 * Victim 3: Mark (The Bisection) & Mass Casualty: Mark tries to walk between Maria’s and Sarah’s vehicles. Maria, shocked by Gary's death, panics and backs up, pinning Mark’s legs. An explosion is triggered behind the construction fence, blowing up 5 nearby pedestrians. The blast propels a piece of metal through the fence, taking Mark out and leaving his bottom half pinned between the vehicles.
 * Victim 4: Maria (The Impalement Anchor): Maria flees her vehicle. Steel rebar slides off a rack. One rod hits in front of her, forcing her to look up, where three more impale her, pinning her to the ground. One goes down her throat and out her back.
 * Victim 5: Liam (The Decapitation/Fragmentation) & Mass Casualty: Liam leads Sarah and Chloe toward a safety tunnel entrance, but a thick steel cable snaps and whips through the crowd, decapitating Liam—exploding his neck and bottom jaw—and taking out 11 others in a similar, horrific manner.
 * Victim 6: Chloe (The Incineration) & Mass Casualty: Sarah trips. Chloe runs ahead, unaware Sarah fell. On the other side of the tunnel, a tank explodes, turning the funnel into an incinerator, instantly cooking Chloe and 14 others.
 * Victim 7: Sarah (The Final Crush): The whole funnel collapses, pinning Sarah to the ground. She looks around, seeing bodies crawling in the rubble, before the remainder of the structure collapses and crushes her and the last of the survivors.
As Sarah screams, the camera zooms into her eye.

Act One, Scene 2: The Catastrophic Escape
Setting: The gridlocked downtown street, moments after the bee sting. The R.E.M. song still plays faintly.
The camera zooms out of Sarah's eyeball. She is back in the SUV, the bee stinging her hand. The full weight of the vision immediately forces her into action.
> Sarah: (Voice strained, hyperventilating) ""We have to go. We have to go now!""
> 
> Chloe: (Frustrated by the traffic) ""What are you talking about? Go where? We're bumper-to-bumper.""
> 
Sarah throws her car door open and runs into the traffic.
> Sarah: (Screaming, running up to Maria’s car) ""We need to clear the street! Get out of the car!""
> 
Chloe and Liam quickly get out, moving to follow Sarah.
Sarah runs to Gary’s truck.
> Sarah: ""Run! Get out! Your truck is going to be crushed!""
> 
> Gary: (Leaning out, annoyed) ""What the f*ck is your problem, lady? Get back in your car!""
> 
Suddenly, high above the construction site, they hear a loud, terrifying CRAAACK of stressed steel.
> Gary & Rey: (Immediate reaction) (Simultaneously exiting the truck)
> 
At that exact moment, the first massive slab of concrete and rebar falls, crushing the passenger side of Gary's truck.
The sound of the destruction is deafening. Sarah, Chloe, and Liam sprint away as the street erupts in panic. Mark, who witnessed the group's escape and the crushing of the truck, sees the danger and follows them out of the crush zone.
The seven survivors run for a full block before finding refuge.
The Immediate Aftermath
The seven survivors gather, watching the smoke rise.
> Chloe: (Shocked, her voice shaking) ""What the f*ck was that? How did you know?""
> 
> Sarah: (Haunted) ""I saw it. I saw all of it. The blood, the carnage, the death...""
> 
> Mark: (Stepping closer, analytical) ""What do you mean you 'saw' us die?""
> 
> Gary: (Adrenaline-fueled) ""You saved our lives. How did you know about my truck?""
> 
> Maria: (Silenced by terror.) (She says nothing, hand over her mouth.)
> 
> Rey: (Lighting a shaky joint) ""Holy f*ck. Holy f*ck, we almost died.""
> 
The transition to the News Report is now perfectly set up.

Act One, Scene 3: The Ominous News Report
Setting: Liam and Chloe's apartment. Mid-afternoon on the day of the disaster. Sarah, Liam, and Chloe are in the living room. The atmosphere is tense, quiet, and thick with disbelief. The TV is playing local news coverage of the downtown disaster.
The screen shows drone footage of the catastrophic wreckage—mangled steel, pulverized concrete, and the crippled skyscraper looming over the gridlocked intersection.
> News Anchor (On TV): ""...authorities have now confirmed the structural failure near the financial district has claimed at least one hundred and two confirmed casualties, with dozens more hospitalized. The official death toll is expected to rise as recovery efforts continue through the night.""
> 
Chloe stares at the TV, her arms crossed, struggling to rationalize the sheer scale of the event with their perfect escape.
> Chloe: ""One hundred and two people. And we walked away. We were lucky. Just... incredibly lucky.""
> 
> Liam: ""Lucky? Chloe, the whole street exploded right where we were sitting. That was not luck.""
> 
The screen graphic changes, showing a map and the street where the disaster occurred.
> News Anchor (On TV): ""The major failure, which has been declared an act of God, originated at the high-rise project and has resulted in the total collapse of all nearby structures, effectively sealing off traffic near 18 Oceans Avenue. City officials are classifying the incident as the largest civil disaster in decades.""

The Aftermath
Sarah is transfixed by the confirmed reality of the event. She barely blinks.
> Sarah: (Her voice quiet, cold with realization) ""The premonition... it was all real. Every scream. Every piece of falling steel. We were supposed to be there. We were supposed to be dead.""
> 
> Liam: (Gravely) ""If the way you described those people dying was all real, then we shouldn't be here.""
> 
The report fades to a commercial, leaving a sudden, empty silence.
> Liam: (Gently) ""Are you okay, Sarah?""
> 
> Sarah: (Her voice low and shaking, avoiding eye contact) ""No, I'm not. This fear is still in full force, Liam. It’s like a predator watching from afar, waiting to pounce.""
> 
> Chloe: (Tiredly, grabbing her phone) ""Stop, Sarah. You’re traumatized. We're safe now. It's over.""
> 
> Sarah: (With chilling conviction) ""I don't think it's over.""


Act One, Scene 5: Rey's Correction
Setting: Rey's small, cluttered apartment. Morning.
Rey is in the living room, fiddling with his massive, ornate neck chain. His roommate, VINCE, walks toward the front door, putting on a jacket.
> Vince: ""Yo, I'm heading out. Don't forget about that leak under the sink, man. Landlord's gonna lose it.""
> 
> Rey: (Adjusting the chain) ""Yeah, yeah, I got it. Five minutes of genius work, tops.""
> 
> Vince: (Grinning, gesturing at the chain) ""Just make sure that gaudy thing doesn't fall in. Might stop up the whole drain system.""
> 
Vince laughs and leaves, pulling the front door shut. Rey grabs his toolbox and heads to the tiny, humid bathroom.

The Correction
Rey lies on his back on the tiled floor, sliding under the sink. The toolbox is near his feet. He begins working on the pipes.
After a minute, Rey tries to shift his position. His heavy, distinctive neck chain pendant suddenly snags on a sharp, exposed copper pipe just as he attempts to sit up. The chain holds fast, and his sudden upward movement locks the pendant firmly into place. He is instantly anchored in a painful, strained position, his head unable to rise above the basin.
> Rey: (Muffled groan) ""Agh! Dammit!""
> 
The Domino Effect
He panics, frantically struggling to reach the chain. In his panicked scramble, his heel violently kicks the unsecured metal towel rack. The rack crashes against the wall and then tips forward, pulling the cord to the old, unsecured AC unit in the windowsill.
The AC unit teeters and falls inward. It misses Rey, but crashes straight down onto the porcelain sink basin, smashing it entirely. The catastrophic break instantly ruptures the main water line. A powerful geyser of high-pressure water erupts, spraying directly onto Rey's face and quickly flooding the tiny room.
Simultaneously, the draft created by the now-open window causes the bathroom door to violently slam shut. The damp bath mat is forced against the door, creating an effective watertight seal at the bottom.
The Drowning
The water rises rapidly. Rey is completely pinned by the chain, his face now submerged. He holds his breath, his chest heaving, his eyes wide and terrified.
He lies there, holding the pain for what feels like an eternity, but he cannot reach the chain, and the water is relentless. We watch his face contort violently as the agonizing need for oxygen overtakes him. He gasps, and his lungs fill with water.
His body goes rigid for a moment, then slumps lifelessly. Rey drowns, killed by his own jewelry.
The Discovery
A few hours later, Vince returns to the apartment. He immediately hears the sound of water gushing from behind the bathroom door and sees water leaking out from underneath the frame.
Vince twists the door handle, which is unlocked. As he opens it, the door pushes aside the bathmat, and a cascade of water pours out onto the hallway carpet. He steps inside and stops, gasping.
Rey's body is still tied down under the sink, submerged in the pooled water, the massive neck chain holding his corpse fast to the broken pipe.
Death's first correction is successful.

Act One, Scene 6: The Gathering and The Revelation
Setting: Mark’s small, meticulously organized apartment. Late morning.
Mark has managed to contact Sarah, Chloe, Liam, and Maria, convincing them to meet him. They are all sitting uncomfortably in his living room. Gary is absent, living too far out of town. The atmosphere is thick with trauma and suspicion.
Mark, dressed in neat, functional clothing, stands before them, holding a TV remote like a weapon.
> Mark: ""So, I’ve been tracking everyone since the crash. I saw the news report. I saw how you reacted, Sarah. Now, look at this.""
> 
Mark points the remote at his television and plays a brief, grim local news clip detailing a bizarre plumbing accident fatality. The chyron reads: LOCAL MAN DROWNS IN HOME INCIDENT.
> Mark: ""This is Rey. One of the people you saved. The stoner in the truck. He died this morning in a supposed 'freak accident.'""
> 
Sarah’s face goes pale. The sight of Rey confirms her deepest fears.
> Sarah: (Her voice barely a whisper) ""He was the first one to die in my vision.""
> 
> Chloe: (Jumping up, frustration overriding fear) ""You can’t be serious, Mark. You’re weaving a conspiracy theory around a plumbing mishap and a traumatic dream!""
> 
> Liam: (Placing a hand on Chloe’s arm) ""Chloe, stop. Just listen. Sarah, go on.""
> 
> Sarah: (Forcing the memory out) ""In the vision, he was crushed. But the debris fell in such a precise way... it was focused. It wasn't random.""
> 
> Mark: (Eyes sharp, leaning forward eagerly) ""And then what happens next? After Rey.""
> 
> Sarah: (Struggling, the memory flooding back) ""His friend... the one who was driving the truck... he was cut in half by a piece of glass..."" She clutches her head, unable to finish the gruesome detail.
> 
Mark doesn't need her to finish. He already knows the name from his research. He looks down at his notes, confirming the order. His rational facade cracks, replaced by cold, desperate adrenaline.
> Mark: (Snapping his notebook shut) ""Gary. He lives on that farm outside of town. He's next.""
> 
Mark grabs his car keys and his jacket in one fluid motion, running for the door.
> Liam: ""Where are you going?""
> 
> Mark: (Calling back, already halfway out) ""I'm going to him!""
> 
He slams the door shut, leaving the four survivors stunned, their disbelief shattered by the active threat. The race to Gary's farm has begun.

This is the complete, brutal, and complex sequence for Gary’s death, ensuring the drawn-out agony and unique asymmetrical split are the horrifying climax.
Act One, Scene 7: Gary's Combine Split
Setting: Gary's isolated farmyard. A massive combine harvester sits stationary. The powerful engine is running at a volatile, throaty idle.
Phase 1: The Snare and The Snag
Gary, the skeptic, is bent over the machine's intake area, attempting to clear a knot of baling twine and debris. He is distracted by his phone ringing. He answers it—it's Rey's roommate calling about Rey's bizarre death.
> Gary (on phone): ""Look, I appreciate the call, but Rey was a damn stoner, he probably just—""
> 
As he dismisses the death, his slight shift in posture causes the twine he was pulling to suddenly and violently catch his hand.
Phase 2: The Slow Agony and The False Hope
The idling engine causes the intake reel to begin turning, slowly, but with agonizing, relentless power. Gary's arm is instantly snagged and begins a slow, inch-by-inch drag toward the grinding blades. He drops the phone and screams, frantically trying to yank his hand free, but the movement only tightens the hold.
> Gary: (Screaming, utterly terrified) ""No! No! Stop!""
> 
At the last possible second, just as his hand is inches from the blades, Gary spots a heavy steel shovel nearby. In a final, desperate act, he grabs it and throws the blade end into the mechanism. The shovel instantly jams the slow-moving reel, causing a hideous, grinding shriek and stalling the rotation for a crucial moment.
Gary violently wrenches his arm free, falling backward onto the dirt in a state of traumatized, gasping relief. He is alive.
Phase 3: The Anchor and The Inevitable Crawl
His relief is instantaneous but short-lived. The immense pressure exerted on the shovel causes the handle to snap violently. The jagged, broken metal shaft is flung back with deadly force, impaling Gary deep through the lower abdomen and pinning him to the ground directly in front of the massive machine.
The jolt of the shovel snapping triggers a mechanical fault. The combine's engine roars back to life, the reel now spinning at full power and full speed. More terrifyingly, the entire massive combine harvester, which was in neutral, begins to slowly, grindingly crawl forward across the yard toward the pinned, helpless Gary.
Phase 4: The Degloving and The Split
Mark arrives just at this moment, sliding his car to a stop and running toward the scene, screaming, but he is too far away.
The machine’s intake reel reaches Gary's lower body. As the combine slowly advances, the high-speed reel's friction and sharp edges brutally strip the skin, muscle, and tendons clean off both his shins and calves—a horrific degloving effect. Gary is dragged across the dirt, his screams lost to the roar.
The machine continues its unstoppable crawl, catching his upper thighs and pelvis. Because the broken shovel handle is anchored immovably in his abdomen, his body cannot be pulled into the reel whole.
The massive, advancing force of the combine meets the unyielding resistance of the shovel. The machine uses the impaled shaft as a fixed wedge, violently tearing Gary’s body diagonally upward. The force rips through his torso, separating his left side—ribs, collarbone, and shoulder—from his neck and right half in a slow, brutal, asymmetrical split, leaving him catastrophically ruptured and dying.
Mark slides to a stop near the combine, witnessing the final, drawn-out horror. His face is no longer shocked, but filled with cold resolve: The rules are real, and he must act. Gary's death confirms Mark is next.

This is a powerful sequence of scenes, perfectly executing Mark's heel turn and delivering the immediate, terrifying proof that his action worked, yet Death's design is relentless.
Here is the fully written Act I and the start of Act II, incorporating all the established beats, characters, and the pivotal Maria's Correction.
Act I: The Aftermath and The Dark Revelation
Act One, Scene 8: Gary’s Aftermath
Setting: Gary's farm. Mark is standing horrified next to the roaring combine. He pulls out his phone, his hands shaking, and opens the group chat.
> Mark (Voice shaking, barely a whisper): ""Gary... he’s dead. It happened right in front of me. We were wrong. It's coming for us.""
> Sarah (Through speakerphone, frantic): ""No, Mark, please tell me you're lying!""
> Mark (Coldly): ""He was split open. Shredded. He's dead. Now, who's next, Sarah? Tell me the rest of the list, right now.""
> Sarah (Forcing the words out): ""In my vision, after Gary... you died next, Mark. Then Maria, then Liam, then Chloe, and finally me.""
> Mark (His voice hardening with resolve): ""Okay. Listen up. You guys stick together, you stay safe, and you keep Maria out of trouble. I'm going back to my place.""
> Sarah: ""Wait! What about you, Mark? You're next!""
> Mark: ""I'll be in touch. I need to do some research.""
> 
Mark disconnects the call. He doesn't look back at the combine as he drives away.
Act One, Scene 9: The Descent
Setting: Mark's apartment. Night.
Mark sits at his computer, fueled by adrenaline and trauma. He is immediately down a rabbit hole about Death's Design. He sees articles about the North Bay Bridge collapse and Flight 180. He finds forums discussing the rules.
He reads about the Campbell family and Iris Campbell stopping the Sky View disaster, and how Death came for their bloodlines.
He scrolls past the ""New Life"" theory and stops dead on the ""Life For A Life"" theory. He finds archived posts detailing Nathan Sears's loophole and the actions of Peter Friedkin from Final Destination 5.
Mark prints out the section on the Life-Swap Loophole, his eyes settling on the quote: ""It's kill or be killed."" His expression is one of grim, terrifying determination.


Act One, Scene 10: False Sense of Security
Setting: Sarah's apartment. The same night.
Sarah, Liam, Chloe, and Maria are engaged in a frantic ""death-proofing"" session. They've already removed all knives and covered electrical outlets.
Maria, huddled on the sofa, is terrified and barely speaks.
Liam struggles with the gas line. They manage to disconnect the main line, but in the rushed process, they accidentally cause a slow, internal gas leak within the oven chamber itself.
> Liam (Wiping sweat): ""Alright, gas is cut. Everything sharp has been removed. We should be good... for now.""
> Sarah (Looking at her phone): ""Has Mark said anything yet?""
> Chloe (Cynically): ""Who cares? He was next. He might be dead already. We have to focus on us.""
> 
Liam glances at his phone.
> Liam: ""So, this has happened before. Look."" (He shows them a blog about Flight 180.)
> Sarah (Sinking onto the couch): ""We’re being hunted, aren’t we? Just like them.""
> Chloe: ""Then we need to figure out how to stop it.""
> Sarah: ""How do you stop Death?""
> 

Act Two, Scene 1: The Blood Price
Setting: A dark, secluded underpass. Late night.
Mark, dressed in dark clothing, approaches a scruffy, desperate Junkie.
> Mark: ""Hey. Do you need anything?""
> Junkie: ""What you got?""
> 
Mark gestures for him to follow into the deep shadow of the alley.
> Junkie: ""I'm only looking for a little—""
> 
Mark cuts him off, pulling a hunting knife and quickly driving it into the Junkie's stomach.
> Junkie (Collapsing, clutching the wound): ""Please... don't do this. I don't want to die.""
> Mark (Eyes cold, detached): ""Neither do I.""
> 
He stabs him a few more times to finish him off, committing the murder with a horrific, mechanical efficiency. Mark has successfully performed the Life-Swap.


Act Two, Scene 2: Maria's Correction (The Proof)
Setting: Sarah's apartment. The next morning.
Sarah, Chloe, and Liam are anxiously gathered. Maria is trying to distract herself by cleaning.
> Sarah: ""Has Mark answered yet?""
> Liam: ""No. Nothing. No calls, no texts.""
> Chloe: (Sighing) ""He might be dead. You said he was next, Sarah.""
> 
> Liam (Looking at the order): ""If that’s the case, that means our priority is to keep Maria alive. She's next.""
> 
> Maria (Whimpering): ""I'm next?""
> 
> Chloe (Forcing a smile): ""Don't worry. We cut the gas, removed the knives. We'll stick together and keep you safe.""
> 
Suddenly, a notification chime goes off on Liam’s phone. It's the group chat.
> Mark (In the group chat): ""I figured something out. I'm on my way.""
> 
Maria (Relief washing over her): ""He's alive! Mark's alive! That means I should be fine for now, right? Death must have skipped him!""
On the balcony of the apartment next door, some kids are burning paper. An ember floats away and drifts lazily toward the open window of Sarah’s apartment.
Maria, desperate to eat, moves toward the kitchen, convinced she is safe.
> Maria: ""I'm going to turn the oven back on. I'm hungry.""
> 
The ember drifts into the kitchen as Maria reaches for the appliance. The moment she opens the oven door, the ember is sucked in, igniting the internal gas leak they unknowingly caused.
A violent, concussive explosion erupts directly into Maria’s face and chest.
The others rush into the kitchen, choking on the smoke, to see Maria sitting against the wall, face horribly charred and unrecognizable.
Chloe stares, utterly frozen by the sight of Maria's body. Mark's spot was successfully skipped. The murder worked.

Act Two, Scene 3: The Proof and The Pact
Setting: The grassy area outside Sarah's apartment building. Evening. Caution tape surrounds the building following the explosion.
Sarah, Liam, and Chloe are sitting around a faded, empty picnic table. Mark walks up to them. He is outwardly calm, his clothes perhaps slightly rumpled from his night out, but his focus is intense.
> Liam: (Standing up, furious) ""Where the hell were you?! Maria is dead! You said you figured something out, Mark! What good did it do?""
> 
> Mark: (Ignoring Liam, looking deliberately at Chloe and Sarah) ""It did everything it was supposed to do."" (He pauses, letting the horrifying implication sink in.) ""Maria was Victim 4 on Sarah's list. I was Victim 3. She died after me. That means... Death passed over my spot.""
> 
Sarah looks up, horrified. She understands the dark implication instantly.
> Sarah: ""Mark, what did you do?""
> 
> Mark: (Sitting down, his voice chillingly level) ""I found the fastest solution. We had two options: hope, or a life for a life. I chose the one I could control. My spot was filled.""
> 
Sarah recoils, horrified.
> Sarah: ""You murdered someone. That's what you're saying, isn't it? You murdered someone to save yourself. You're insane, Mark!""
> 
> Liam: ""He's right, Mark. You don't get to preach about saving lives if you take one!""
> 
Chloe stares from Sarah to Mark, her loyalty battling her cynicism. She points toward the apartment building.
> Chloe: ""Look at Maria! You think she died because she was next? No! She died because your 'hope' was useless! We sat here talking morality while Mark acted.""
> 
She turns to Sarah, her voice raw with cynical desperation.
> Chloe: ""Mark is the only one who got results! The list skipped him. That is definitive proof. Your way is passive. His way is survival."" (She stands and moves to stand behind Mark, signaling her allegiance.) ""I'm with Mark. It's kill or be killed.""
> 
The battle lines are drawn. Sarah, heartbroken by Chloe's betrayal, is left staring at the horrifying logic that has shattered her friendship and her morality.

You have orchestrated an absolutely spectacular, rules-based finale. Every plot thread—the moral conflict, the loopholes, the interventions—is tied together and brutally resolved by Death.
Here is the fully written Act II and Act III, detailing the final movements of your characters and the relentless mechanism of Death.
Act II: The Split, The Loopholes, and The Setup
Act Two, Scene 4: The Path of Hope
Setting: A cheap motel room. Day.
Sarah and Liam are holed up, researching on Liam's laptop. Chloe and Mark are absent.
Liam clicks a link and shows Sarah the screen.
> Liam: ""The 'New Life Loophole.' It's not about being saved—it's about flatlining and being brought back. Being given a new lease on life. This woman, Kimberly, she did it.""
> 
The screen shows an old, slightly grainy Facebook photo of Kimberly Corman.
> Sarah: (Her eyes widening with desperate hope) ""Resurrection. We have to die to live. That's the loophole.""
> 


Act Two, Scene 5: The Dark Strategy
Setting: A different location—a dimly lit bar booth. Day.
Mark and Chloe are seated opposite each other. Chloe is nursing a drink.
> Chloe: ""So, what's the grand plan now? You killed one guy, the list moved, and now it's hunting me. What's my spot—is it still active?""
> 
> Mark: ""We don't know for sure, but the probability is high. We have to make the Life-Swap permanent. That requires more life hours. It’s what Peter Friedkin tried to do.""
> 
> Chloe: ""You want to kill again?""
> 
> Mark: ""We don't have a choice. I need to stack lives. We need a target that provides maximum life hours with minimum risk.""
> 
The conversation is interrupted by a call from Sarah. Mark answers on speaker, his face neutral.
> Sarah (Over phone): ""Mark, why didn't you mention the New Life Loophole? Kimberly Corman. We found it.""
> 
> Mark: (Sighing, looking at Chloe) ""Because it's unreliable, Sarah. You're talking about trusting fate. Look up Eric and Bobby Campbell the descendants of survivor from the Sky view they tried it and death retaliated.""
> 


Act Two, Scene 6: The Intervention
Setting: The motel room. Day.
Sarah is making coffee. Liam is near the window. Outside, an electrician is working on a pole.
Sarah plugs in the coffee maker. A large, brief electrical spark flashes near the outlet. Sarah immediately freezes, the familiar dread washing over her.
She looks at Liam by the window. She knows he is next. She sprints across the room.
> Sarah: (Shouting) ""Liam, get back!""
> 
She tackles him, pulling him away from the glass. Just as they hit the floor, a live electrical wire, severed by the electrician's mistake outside, whips violently through the pane of glass where Liam was standing, showering glass everywhere.
Sarah scrambles up, breathing heavily, staring at the shattered window.
> Sarah: (Voice strained) ""Intervention! I intervened, and I saved you! You should be fucking dead right now!"" (Her eyes wifen ""Oh, no. Chloe’s next.""
> 
> Liam: (Gasping) ""We have to tell her! We have to warn her about the pole!""
> 
> Sarah: ""No! We can't push her past that line! She just sided with Mark! We have to get her to trust us again. We need her here.""
> 


Act Two, Scene 7: The Final Plan
Setting: Sarah's motel room. Night.
Sarah has convinced Chloe to meet. She lays out her plan, showing the syringes of fentanyl and adrenaline she procured.
> Sarah: ""We have to do this, Chloe. Mark's plan only makes us monsters. My plan is the only way to break the chain forever. If I flatline and come back, the list is reset for everyone.""
> 
> Chloe: (Hesitating) ""And if you don't come back?""
> 
> Sarah: ""Then you follow Mark's plan. But if I succeed, we're all safe.""
> 
Chloe, seeing the final hope in her best friend's desperate eyes, agrees. The plan is set for the hospital parking lot.


Act III: The Final Correction
Act Three, Scene 1: The Trap
Setting: A parking lot, across from the er specifically Section 081. Night.
Liam's car is parked near the exit. Chloe is in the passenger seat. Sarah and Liam are in the back, readying the syringes. Mark is standing outside, watching, his phone ready.
Mark feels a sudden, profound dread. He sees a heavy cement truck approaching the intersection at speed.
> Mark (Into phone to Chloe): ""Get out of the car, Chloe! Now!""
> 
At that moment, an ambulance, sirens blaring, cuts across the intersection to pull into the ER entrance. The ambulance successfully cuts off the cement truck, forcing the driver to swerve wildly.
The truck loses control, backs up, and the cement spout swings violently through Liam's car windshield, slicing the air and just missing Chloe's head.
Liam and Sarah dive out the back doors.


Act Three, Scene 2: Chloe's Agony
The truck's engine is damaged, causing the cement mixing drum to malfunction. A massive torrent of wet cement pours out, quickly filling the front of the car and trapping Chloe up to her torso.
> Chloe: (Struggling frantically) ""Get it off! Get me out!""
> 
Liam and Sarah frantically try to dig her out.
The truck's collision bursts a gas line under the road, spraying fuel all over the trapped Chloe.
> Chloe: (Sobbing, knowing the inevitable) ""I don't want to die!""
> 
A nearby, damaged street light flickers, sending a spark down. The spark hits the fuel, and Chloe is instantly engulfed in flames. She burns and screams for a second. The immense heat causes the cement spout to expand slightly, dislodging the heavy mechanism. It swings down, crushing Chloe's head and silencing her scream.


Act Three, Scene 3: The Interventions and The Final Price
Sarah stares in absolute horror and shock, frozen by her best friend’s death. She doesn't notice the damaged street light's pole, weakened by the cement truck, beginning to sway.
Mark, seeing the pole fall toward the static Sarah, acts on pure instinct—the triage nurse overriding the calculated killer. He pulls her out of the way.
The lamppost crashes. Mark’s act of intervention re-activates his original spot (Victim 3).
Mark finds the syringe of fentanyl dropped on the ground and kneels next to Sarah.
> Mark: ""It's now or never. We're out of time.""
> 
He effortlessly finds a vein and injects her.
> Liam: (Seeing the ease of the injection) ""How did you—?""
> 
> Mark: ""I'm a triage nurse. I was on my way to my shift the day of the accident.""
> 
Sarah fades out.
> Mark: ""Her pulse is slowing... where's the adrenaline?!""
> 
> Liam: ""Fuck! It's buried in the cement!""
> 
> Mark: ""Oh shit! Now what?""
> 
Liam, desperate, scoops up Sarah's limp body and rushes out of the parking lot toward the ER entrance. He trips over the curb and falls over Sarah's body.
A passing car, swerving to avoid the wreckage, catches Liam's head with its tire well, resulting in the violent asymmetrical head explosion/decapitation. Liam's Loopback is corrected.
Mark stands for a second, watching Liam's headless corpse, paralyzed.


Act Three, Scene 4: Death's Triumph
Setting: Hospital Emergency Room.
Mark bursts into the ER carrying Sarah.
> Mark: ""Hey! We have an overdose!""
> 
Nurses take Sarah and start working. Mark watches helplessly.
Later, Sarah wakes up with Mark standing at the foot of her bed.
> Sarah: ""What happened?""
> 
> Mark: ""I don't know.""
> 
The Doctor walks in.
> Doctor: ""Wow. You are lucky we got to you when we did.""
> 
> Mark: ""Wait... what?""
> 
> Doctor: ""We managed to bring you back before you flatlined.""
> 
Mark and Sarah share a terrible, worried look. The Revival Loophole failed—the timing was missed.
On the other side of the wall, in the ambulance bay, the same ambulance that cut off the cement truck is overheating, spraying smoke. Paramedics rush out into the hallway. One knocks over a massive oxygen tank, breaking it open. The tank flies like a missile through the thin door of Sarah's room and caves in her chest. Sarah's spot is corrected.
Mark stumbles back in horror, tripping over a rack of oxygen tanks. He falls, and a broken nozzle on the rack punctures the back of his skull. The high-pressure gas causes a complete explosive blow out—his eyes and brain matter violently erupt from every orifice of his face. Mark's final correction is complete.
Death wins. The list is empty.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Galatasaray vs. Ajax: A Dutch-Turkish Drama with Implied Probabilities and a Side of Absurdity**

The UEFA Champions League throws another curveball as Galatasaray, Turkey’s lone survivor in the group stage, heads to Amsterdam to face Ajax. Let’s dissect this clash with the precision of a Dutch cheese grater and the humor of a Turkish delight mishap.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The betting market paints a tight race. Galatasaray is the slight favorite, with odds hovering around **+115** (implied probability: \~47.6%), while Ajax sits at **-150** (\~40%) and the draw at **+300** (\~25%). These numbers suggest a low-scoring, nail-biting affair—perfect for fans who enjoy heart palpitations.

But history tells a different story. Ajax has annihilated Turkish teams in European competitions, winning 12 of 14 matches. Galatasaray? They’ve lost all seven of their European *away* games against Dutch clubs. Their last meeting in the Europa League ended in a 2-1 Sarı-Kırmızılı collapse, proving that when it comes to Ajax, Galatasaray’s defense is a sieve that even Turkey’s most porous coffee filters would blush at.

The spread adds intrigue: Ajax is giving **0.5 goals**, meaning they must cover by not losing. Galatasaray, meanwhile, is -0.5 at some books, needing a win to cover. The total goals line is **3.25**, with under priced slightly lower. If this game breaks 3.25 goals, it’ll be like watching a Turkish soap opera—dramatic, chaotic, and slightly implausible.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, History, and Shoelaces

Galatasaray’s recent form is a mixed bag. They’ve earned 6 points from three matches, including wins over \[redacted\] and \[redacted\], but their away record against Dutch teams is a惨白 0-6-1. No key injuries are reported, but let’s not forget their striker’s *notorious* h

1ooui3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1ooui3h/dating_someone_from_church_of_christ_as_reformed/,Dating someone from Church of Christ as Reformed Christian?,"I recently went to a costume party associated with the singles group and young married group of my roommates church which is the Church of Christ. There was this guy at the dance who I had met a few times over the past few years at Bible studies and past single events. We ended up talking for about 40 minutes at the costume party and it eventually resulted in him giving me his number and asking me to text him. He said he was interested in visiting my church at some point. We also danced together too.

I texted him that night and he texted me Sunday saying he had a great time and wanted to see me again and asked me if I either wanted to get coffee or walk along the beach this week or next week. I said I was open to both and suggested Saturday. He said it would work for him after he got off work.

A few days later he texted me and asked me if he could call me to talk about the plans. I said sure. He asked if I had ever heard of encouragement dates and I said no. He said they were dates in which we went on dates with other couples from his church. He said their church has certain rules about dating such as not being in the car together. He said he wanted to change the date from this Saturday to next Saturday or Sunday so we can accommodate another couple to join us.            He

He said this Sunday him and some people from his church are doing to a ride share to a nearby mountain town to have church up there and asked if I wanted to accompany. I He said the encouragement dates are for protecting purity. I thanked him for wanting to protect my purity. I asked if we were to continue going on dates if we would always be with other people and he said yes. I talked with him about my church and what it meant to be Reformed and about doctrines such as Calvinism. I also discussed Martin Kuther.

I was struggling with this cause I think it is crucial to have one on one time and group dates with the person you are dating. I ended up talking to him and letting him know that I wanted to go on both group dates and one on one dates and that I don’t think riding in the car together  is sinful. He said he would meet me in the middle and we could switch off on one on one dates and group dates.   He felt strong to about the car thing so I obliged.                     We talked more and asked if my church knew he existed. I said I mentioned it to a few people. I asked him if he was open to leaving the church if things were to get serious with us. He said yes but a few other people would feel betrayed.

Struggling cause I did really connect with the guy at the sorry and he seems really nice and open but struggling with the church he goes to? It seems like his church has manipulative people. I can say with 100% certainty I do not want to go to the church of Christ. I know Church of Christ often thinks they are the only true church and that your salvation date is the day you are baptized. This is different from a Baptist since Baptists believe baptism is sign of your regeneration, not that you are saved by it. I have also heard that the Church of Christ is super opposed to Calvinism and anything reformed. Has anyone dated someone from church of Christ? Or been part of church of Christ?

I allowed him to stay the night and I started seeing the old him…..more and more daily for a few weeks weeks now….fast forward to today…..I let him stay the night last night again, this morning I told him I had a friend coming for a visit.  He threw a fit and left coming back to “talk things out” after she left.  For 14 years of being with him I never once had a friend in our house, and today he got to me again and I am no longer allowed friends in my own house.  I loved entertaining before 2,3 sometimes 4 nights a week  I had friends for dinner, my door was always open, coffee always on……the neighborhood kids loved my house, and I miss it, but stupid me falls for his shit everytime

Right now part of me wants to give in to him and give him what he is demanding, part of me wants to message him in the morning to come get his shit and that I’m fully done.  

I guess I should also add he hasn’t worked in 4 years, I quit my job to leave him as my kids require round the clock care and I have no help…..and I’m 100% supporting him financially.

Some questions:

Does the volume I consume even warrant consideration of Home Roasting?

Is this another Rabbit Hole?

What is the shelf life for green beans? Can they be frozen like roasted beans? 

Can I buy one lb bags and still save money?  What is smallest unit of green beans sold?

Are roaster's portable? I don't really have a lot of counter space, so would probably want to stash away when not being used.

Will it stink up the house? 

How long, or how many pounds of beans will it typically take before I develope the skills to roast beans as good as those I buy from experienced roasters?

 Lastly, what gear do I need and would you recommend?

1ooucf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1ooucf0/i_hate_this_i_cant_escape_them/,"I hate this, I can’t escape them","I had a German roach issue in my old apartment complex - I was seeing about one per day at the worst end of things (still not bad but blah). The pest control at my old complex helped a lot - they sprayed Alpine in my cabinets, came in for extra sprays, etc. They did a good enough job where I didn’t see a roach for 4 months, and the traps they put in 4 months ago were empty when I moved.

Fast forward, I move 4 hours away to a new complex. 4.5 star reviews, 250+ reviews - *one* mention of roaches (which I discredited since it was the only one). The second I bring my last box up - German roach on the wall. F***, ok - maybe I brought in a traveler since this was super last minute move and I didn’t technically follow the precautions I should’ve. Started to put my chemicals away under the sink - dead baby, so there was already an established colony here. After 2 days there was a roach that sped out from the top of my dishwasher and back in - couldn’t kill it. 

Immediately got a hold of the apartment complex for someone to spray, and unfortunately their pest control is a chain. Apparently, they only spray the baseboards. I asked if they use alpine, and he said “sometimes” so I’m hoping that means they use an IGR or something. They put two sticky traps down- one in the kitchen between the fridge and the other one under the sink. He looked behind my fridge, went “hm”, then ran down to his van to get a bottled spray and sprayed behind my fridge (I don’t know what he sprayed, it had a white lid). I peeked when he ran down and didn’t see anything. He also baited around the top lip of the dishwasher. 

Anyways, that was about 6 days ago and there’s only 1 roach in the trap in the kitchen (and I’m not wholly convinced it’s not the one that ran out at me). But I opened up my water heater closet, and they was another one on the floor - seemed mostly grown but I just kinda closed the door to get something to kill it. By the time I got back it was gone but I threw a trap in there, fingers crossed. 

It’s just awful. I finally got it handled at my own complex after about 1.5 years, and here I am back to being sick to my stomach and horrified I’ll open my trashcan or open my coffee pot or open my cabinet and I’ll see a roach. 

I’m mainly worried about how they’re treating this - I thought I had to empty out my cabinets for them to spray, but apparently not - they just do the baseboards. Should I push for them to spray in the cabinets, or is it not necessary? Furthermore, am I crazy or is it weird they’re not doing anything with the bathroom? Admittingly  I haven’t seen a roach in there, so maybe they’re just not trying to bait them in?

Anyways, thank you for coming to my midnight rant 🫡",2,1762319655.0,GermanRoaches,1,1.0,False

1oou66y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tamilyapping/comments/1oou66y/first_arrange_marriage_prospect_experience/,First Arrange marriage prospect experience 😭,"**Little bit of background about me (26M) and the girl (25F):**

**Me:** Born and brought up in a Chennai. CA. Slightly introverted but I still try to get along with people I work with, friends, and family. Once I’m comfortable with someone, I can talk non-stop. Cinephile and bike enthusiast. Family is neither too conservative nor too liberal. No past relationships.

**Her:** Born and brought up in a Nagercoil, our hometown. Tried NEET after high school but dropped it. Did ECE, then an MBA. Completed a 3-month bootcamp on coding. Has around 8 months of post-qualification experience working as a front-end developer. Makes about 25% of what I make. Loves cooking non-vegetarian food. No past relationships. Family looked a bit conservative. Dad is a headmaster, mom a postmaster.

We both met for coffee in Bangalore as she was also working there. Initial impression was good, but I felt the conversation was very one-sided. I was asking all the questions, but she answered them properly and with interest. We both felt like proceeding ahead and gave confirmation to our parents. My parents were supposed to visit her family in our hometown two weeks later. I thought of getting to know her more in the meantime.

We chatted for a short time after the coffee meet. I asked her to let me know when she was free for a casual talk. She didn’t reply that night. I tried calling her to see if something was bothering her since she hadn’t responded to my text and the previous chats felt very dry. Her line was busy. She didn’t call or text for the next two days. I thought maybe she wasn’t interested and informed my family. They spoke to her dad, after which she called and said there had been talks of layoffs at her company and she was worried.

I explained how I expected honest communication both ways, and we agreed to take things slow. We spoke a couple of times after that-maybe once every three days. Even during calls, it felt like I was leading. No questions from her side. This kept bothering me, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt-maybe she needed time to be comfortable around me.

We reached our hometown three days before the visit. I expected at least a “Have you reached?” or “When are you coming?” from her. But nothing-no contact until the morning of our visit to her place. I was doubtful, but once we visited and met her family, my mind changed. They all seemed so nice and warm-some of the kindest people I’ve met. I know everyone’s at their best during the first meeting, but something about them made me feel at home.

I met her and spoke again. It still felt one-sided. I ran out of things to talk about. But she didn’t seem rude-she listened with interest and even insisted on taking a picture together. That made me say yes.

Their family was supposed to visit our place a couple of weeks later. I tried my best to talk to her and keep the conversation going, but I started losing interest as it again felt one-sided. I installed Snapchat just because she asked if I used it. She said she regularly sends snaps, so I started sharing them too. Some of the snaps she didn’t even open. I would have sent her a message on WhatsApp with no reply, but she’d post a snap. Still, I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt.

One day, I called and asked how her day was and what she did. She said “Nothing.” I asked if she watched something or used Instagram or anything. She replied in an irritated tone, “Why do you keep asking this?” I felt bad. Then I asked what she was having for dinner- she said “Theriyala” I asked if she wouldn’t help her mom or something- she replied, “Adhellam pannanum nu onnum illayee” I didn’t ask her *to* cook, I just asked if she did in a casual tone. Something about the way she responded and tone didn’t sit well with me.

I decided not to initiate conversation for the next couple of days to see if she reverts back. She didn’t. I thought of ending things there and told my parents to convey it to her dad. After this, she sent me pics that she took that day as they attended a family function. Tagged me in instagram with a song dedicated to me ""Kan rendum nee vara thaane kaathi kidandhadhu"" 😭😭This had never happened before.  And she called, and we had a good talk-about how she felt I was very judgmental, and that’s why she didn’t feel like talking more; how she expected me to bring her something like chocolate when we met; how I kept going on bike rides but never asked if she’d like to join. I explained that I was planning to put in all the effort once we got to know each other better, and I thought of continuing since she seemed genuinely interested and had her own expectations too.

I called her the next day. She didn’t pick up. No text or call after that for two days either. That’s when I decided not to drag this any further. Edho gut feeling told me. If this were the first time, I’d have understood-but how hard is it to communicate that she’s busy or whatever?

I called to explain this but she didn’t pick up. So I sent her a long message explaining why it wouldn’t work between us and wished her the best. She came back defensive again, saying she knew I wasn’t interested in marriage from the beginning, and that it’s a big deal for a girl to even talk to a guy at this stage. She asked, “Why did you say YES if you weren’t interested in marriage?” and all that. I apologized if she felt that way and didn’t explain any further. She didn't respond to why she didn't even bother to drop a text.

This is long, but there is a TLDR in the end. 

It took me a while to jot my thoughts down on this one. 

Just recently, I went to this cultural centre in my city. My previous experiences have been really good, and this day was supposed to be just as fine. It was a talk about arts and literature, and I was all set. I booked an auto, and somewhere midway, the auto guy says the road has too much traffic, we will take another route. I have not been through this other route many times, but I have an idea. Nevertheless, given that I was in a somewhat unfamiliar territory, I kept looking at the tracker just to be sure we're going in the right direction. 

As I reach the centre, I bide my time outside for a while; this guy tries to chat me up - I shoot him down with a bit of sarcasm, and he vacates his seat. Next, this middle-aged person comes and takes up a seat right beside me, when he could have taken up the opposite one. I knew something was wrong, but didn't think much about it. Anyway, the event organisers don't turn up and it gets cancelled, so I decide to have some coffee in the cafeteria section. As I take my seat, the guy beside me is just staring at me. I catch him staring at me, it doesn't bother him. In the meantime, the same middle-aged person decides to take a stroll in the cafeteria and goes back towards the entrance, talking (or pretending to) on the phone. When I leave, he also leaves. As I am walking down the road, I see another guy on the bike staring at me. I ignore it and walk past. Now, I have been to this place only via cab before, but this time I wanted to take the metro. So, I stop and ask a vendor for directions - he says it is quite far, so take a bus. But the weather was nice and I decided to walk anyway. Turns out it is 2 kms far! 😅 

As I'm walking, this middle-aged person walks right in front of me. I feel a bit relieved because till now I kept thinking he was following me. Then he stops at the bus stand and I think that was it. But I walk past the bus stand, so this guy on the bike who was stared at me before comes asking, ""Where do you want to go...the metro station is too far - I'll drop you."" I was like, ""It's okay. I will walk."" He leaves, thankfully. But then as I am walking, this middle-aged person is walking right behind me. He followed me till nearly 2 kms, and I only lost him at a crossing. 

I was scared witless thinking he'd follow me home, coz it is really not that difficult if you put your mind to it. 

Now, I was going through really mundane motions today. Nothing out of the ordinary. I keep seeing how men say women only make a mountain out of a molehill - in either of the situations I was in today, a man would not have to fear what would happen next or keep watching his back 20 times - all in one of the poshest, busiest localities of a Tier 1 city, somewhere between 4 and 5 PM! 

Women are not really being dramatic when they say ""All men."" It isn't to say all men are dangerous, but the truth is that any man can be. Many women will have had not one but many such experiences. So, men really have to go the extra mile to ensure no woman in your company/vicinity feels unsafe because of them. The onus of really changing ""All men"" to ""Not all men"" lies with men, because women have learnt from their experiences to be wary of all men in general. 

.

TLDR: Went to a cultural centre - got stared at, chatted up, and even followed by one of the men up to 2 kms. What must have been a mundane day turned harrowing just because I am a woman. 

""Men or all men"" doesn't mean all men are criminals - it means any man can be dangerous to a woman. The onus is on men to change this narrative, not on women. ",12,1762319042.0,AskIndianFeminists,17,0.88,False

I’m visiting LA from Toronto (Blue Jays 😭) for the first time in a couple of weeks for a long weekend, and need help figuring out where to stay and what to do! 

Hotel budget is roughly $400/night, and I’ll be relying on walking and rideshares.

I’m more into coffeeshops, bookstores, restaurants, and bars than tourist attractions, and I love smaller, walkable streets over giant boulevards.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tyZha0j4sD): **October 9, 2025**

Throwaway because I don’t want anyone in my friend group to find this obviously.

Sophie and I (both 27) have been close friends since we were 4. We’re not the “speak every single day laurel/susannah” type friends, but I genuinely considered her a sister and her parents like an aunt and uncle. Our families are close. My whole family is invited to her wedding, as is my boyfriend’s family (my boyfriend is Sophie’s brother’s best friend). That’s how close we all are. So I wasn’t really surprised when she asked me to be her maid of honour and i think I’ve been a good one.

Well, two weeks ago Sophie, the other bridesmaids, and I went to try on bridesmaid dresses. I thought we all had a good time and that it was a successful trip as we found dresses. 

Apparently not really, because a couple of days later Sophie asked to meet me. She asked that I step down from being maid of honour. She said seeing me in the bridesmaid dress made her realise she just didn’t want me stealing focus from her and that she wouldn’t feel good standing up there knowing everyone was probably comparing us. I was so hurt, I admit I cried right there in the coffee shop. Partly because I never wanted her to think that anyone would be thinking anything other than that she was the most beautiful bride on her wedding day, and partly because I was just so excited to be up there with her and she was kicking me out over something that I couldn’t even control and wasn’t really true. So I said fine, it’s her wedding, if she didn’t want me up there I wouldn’t be, but I wasn’t going to come to the wedding as a guest when clearly my presence was going to be a burden to her. 

Sophie said that wasn’t what she meant, and I asked her to explain. She said she desperately wanted me there so she was going to put aside her feelings but she just wanted pictures at the alter to be with her looking the best and to have that moment with everyone looking at her up there. She also wanted me to tell everyone I dropped out because I was too busy. I said none of this felt fair and I wasn’t going to lie for her. I was a good friend and did nothing wrong and she was being a brat but that was her prerogative and I didn’t have to play along.

I told my boyfriend about this who was pretty horrified, and agreed that if I didn’t want to go I shouldn’t (although he still is because he’s friends with the groom). But my mum and stepdad think I would be the AH if I didn’t go. My mum said it’s also been obvious that Sophie was insecure (I never noticed this) and that she can understand where she’s coming from. She said I’ve had the spotlight our whole lives (again, I don’t think this is true! Sophie is far more outgoing and well liked than I have ever been) and even though it’s pretty sad, maybe she does deserve to be the princess on her wedding day and I shouldn’t hate her for it. She says I’ll regret missing the wedding over this. My stepdad says I should go because she’s my oldest friend and even if she is being unfair, sometimes you have to let people be irrational. I really don’t know now. Sophie and I have so many mutual friends there’s not a lot of people I can ask about this without it getting back to her, so here I am.

I feel like maybe I’m being a jerk having this blowup but I don’t see why I should even stay friends with someone who would exclude me from her wedding party over something superficial. And clearly she’s been sitting on these feelings forever. Not to mention I already paid for her whole bachelorette party and the bridesmaid dress and contributed to the cost of her wedding jewellery. And now I just feel used.

So am I being a petty AH by refusing to go?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** Your friend told you she didn't feel pretty enough to have you stood up next to her on her special wedding day. I was all for saying you weren't the asshole until you mentioned your mother. It's telling that your mum has been able to see how insecure Sophie and you haven't when she's meant to be YOUR friend. The fact your mum has pointed out that Sophie has always been insecure and tou, her best friend, haven't noticed that speaks a lot about your friendship.

The fact your response is that ""maybe"" your friend deserves to feel like a princess on her wedding day kinda seals it for me. YTA

> **OOP:** I meant “princess” like maybe she deserves to have her cake and eat it. And yes, it’s a maybe, because I’ve never thought getting married means you get to treat the people you love like crap.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. Her decision shows she’s not actually your friend. Friends don’t actually care if you’re prettier than them.

And honestly. I think your BF sucks for still going. He should stand by you. His friend fiancé disrespected you. He should see they are a unit and realize you two are a unit. If one of them hurts you, it should hurt him.

Anyone who tells you to swallow disrespect cares more about their peace than your well being.

> **OOP:** Well, he said “should I also not go” and I was like “no let’s not become those people, it’s not a boycott”. If I didn’t want him to go he wouldn’t, but if he didn’t then Sophie’s brother would know why and then it would become a whole big thing. Plus then his sister who is also my friend would feel like she shouldn’t go and I just didn’t want to start the domino effect. Especially since I don’t even know if I intend to tell anyone why I’m not going

**OOP's response to a downvoted comment regarding the competition between herself and Sophie for attention**

> **OOP:** The “spotlight” she’s referring to is specifically male attention (and I guess looks based attention generally from people we meet). And yes, I’m aware of that but that’s not what I consider to be spotlight, or not the be all end all, anyway. Sure, I get approached more by men. But Sophie was always the one with more friends, better grades, the person teachers actually liked, she was in clubs and well known. I considered all that to even out or even swing in her favour, honestly.
> 
> But yeah, it’s true I never realised that the male /looks attention thing bothered her that much. But to be fair, mothers do pick up on things about your friendships when you’re younger that sometimes you don’t. Sophie never let on that this one thing bugged her to this extent.

+

> It’s true that I’ve always got more male attention/people commenting on my looks, I admit that. But in the grand scheme of life, I never felt like that was a big deal. Sophie dated often while my current boyfriend is my second ever relationship. She has always had more friends, been more popular, even better academically. It’s not like she’s come second to me in everything. Just in this one thing. So I guess I just figured it evened out, or even that she was “winning” out of the two of us.
> 
> The thing is, I probably would forgive her, if she ever bothered to apologise. But clearly she still thinks she’s in the right here.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. That's because you have been used. Wtf is wrong with your dad & stepmom? Sophie hurt you so deeply, and they tell you to take one ror the team. That is truly awful for them to expect you to do. Also, your boyfriend is still going to be in the wedding because the groom is his best friend? So, in essence, he's saying that it's okay for the groom's fiancee to devastate you, as long as he still gets to go.

You really need to find new friends and a new boyfriend. Unfortunately, it's not so easy getting new parents. You should really let your parents how horrible they made you feel by putting their interests over their own daughter's.

You are no longer in the wedding, so send Sophie a bill for the bachelorette party and the wedding jewelry. Let her know that because you are no longer the MOH, it is her new MOH's obligation to pay. If she refuses, take her to small claims court.

Don't go to the wedding. It will be so uncomfortable for you, and you won't enjoy a minute of it.

> **OOP:** My boyfriend is going because his whole family is going and I told him not to skip it on my account. Because if he also skips then it’ll become a big thing. I don’t want him to boycott in solidarity, I think that’s childish.

**OOP on if she is professionally more successful than Sophie?**

> **OOP:** No, not at all. I’ve inherited some savings, and my boyfriend takes care of our household expenses so I have more disposable income. But Sophie is far ahead of me professionally and is much more career minded.

**Commenter 4:** Hmm wow I wonder if your better financial situation is viewed by Sophie as an extension of something like your looks that you didnt have to ""work"" for. Although of course inherited moeny/relationship financial support absolutely shouldn't be thought about in those terms.

Your boyfriend is also Sophie's brother's best friend. Did you meet your boyfriend through Sophie's family? I wonder if she feels like your family and even her family all favor you (her mother, brother, aunt, cousin, groom) and the wedding was just another reminder.

> **OOP:** I guess I kind of met him through her family. Her brother and my bf did the same sport that’s how they knew each other. My stepbrother also competed in the same sport so I knew who he was anyway but they were in different categories. But yeah I guess I got talking to him and stayed in his orbit because of Sophie’s brother because they stayed friends all those years so he was kind of around.
> 
> Obviously it’s weird looking back on it now because you question how you remember things. I always felt like I was the annoying one, not in a mean way, but we’re the only two girls in the immediate family (she has a brother, I have all stepbrothers) and I was always the “difficult” one because I didn’t like trying new things or I just wasn’t as easy going. The boys always thought I was a bit of a stick in the mud.

**OOP explains more about her family's background with Sophie's family and friend group**

> **OOP:** Firstly, our families are close, as in, our mothers were/are close, and we were close. My mother was single for a while so I guess yeah, we did get more absorbed into her family because we went over there more rather than them all coming to us. Then she got with my stepdad and it was more equal because the boys would hang out all together although my stepbrothers are quite a bit younger. She wasn’t really close to my stepbrothers because of the age gap, and I wasn’t really close to her brother for most of my life. It was only when my now boyfriend and I were getting closer that I got a bit more absorbed into their friend group and now talk to her brother a lot more. I didn’t just “steal” her family or something. Same with her mum, I’m not close to her really, but she’s my mum’s best friend and I’m closer to my own mother than Sophie is to hers, hence how I got this info. I assumed she didn’t say the comment exactly like that because that’s not even how my mum relayed it to me, and my mother god bless her is lucky if she remembers even the general idea of what someone tells her. So it was Chinese whispers. And okay it’s an assumption that she wasn’t really harsh about how she said it because i don’t know her to be cruel. Maybe she is and I don’t know. So yeah okay that was an assumption, but it wasn’t a defence. However she said it wasn’t the right thing to say.
> 
> But as for the groom, idk maybe I’m just nuts but this man saying “she’s perfect” and literally meaning that I am “perfect” in his eyes seems like an insane comment. Why would he think that? Why would he say that in front of his fiancé and her brother and his own friend? He doesn’t even know me well enough to confidently hold that opinion. Like it would come out of nowhere.
> 
> But it seems kind of unfair to say it’s my fault I didn’t know how she felt. She did tell me about her insecurities, and I told her about mine, and we supported each other. She just never mentioned that they had anything to do with me.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HCvUydCUOu): **October 29, 2025 (nearly three weeks later)**

Update - My friend didn’t want me as MOH because of my looks

So idk if anyone wanted an update but the situation has somewhat concluded now and I thought I would provide some closure.

Firstly, some digging was done by my boyfriend and myself, and we thinkkk we found the root(s) of the issue. 

A couple of months ago, my bf, Sophie’s brother, the groom, and Sophie were out for drinks. I remember this night, I had an event for another friend and couldn’t go. Over drinks, the groom apparently asked when my bf was going to propose to me, and my bf said “probably sometime next year”. Groom then made a comment to the effect of “why would you wait that long, she’s perfect”. 

Now, according to both my boyfriend and Sophie’s brother, Sophie was really mad about this because Groom waited several years to propose to her. She’s been bringing it up to him regularly since. Obviously we all assume he meant “perfect for you” not literally perfect, but Sophie appears to be taking it personally. 

The second thing is that my mother did a little gentle probing and it turns out that at the bridesmaid fitting, Sophie’s mum told Sophie that she should have chosen a dress that wasn’t going to make me look better than her (I don’t think she said it like that to Sophie this is just how she relayed it to my mum) and draw attention. 

According to Sophie’s mum, her aunt and cousin said the same thing and I guess one of ganged up on her about it. She also has been on Sophie about a pre wedding diet. So it seems like these two things got blown out of proportion and ended up in Sophie’s request that I not be MOH.

I ended up deciding not to speak to Sophie about any of this. She’s planning her wedding, she should enjoy this time, I don’t want to make this about me, or our friendship. And if I’m being totally honest, I was kind of done with the friendship after the initial conversation. I wanted to know the reasons for my own peace of mind but the truth is, nothing was going to change the fact that she took her feelings out on me, who only ever wanted to support her. None of these things came from me or had anything to do with me but she chose to take a wrecking ball to a 20 year friendship rather than confront the people who upset her. I can’t wrap my head around that and I’m not going to try going forward.

That being said, I decided to go to the wedding, as my boyfriend’s plus one essentially, just for closure to this entire mess. Now that I’ve calmed down, I really don’t feel any particular way about going. I’ll eat, I’ll drink, I’ll clap, and Sophie will just be the wife of my boyfriend’s friend from now on, I guess. I haven’t told anyone why I’m not MOH, I just said in the group chat that it was for “personal reasons” and everyone can speculate. Once the wedding is over, I’ll tell our mutual friends the truth and they can do with that info what they will.

Sophie has reached out since to talk, but I sent her a message telling her that I’ll be at the wedding as a guest and that I hope she enjoys this time in her life and wishing her the best and haven’t been replying to anything else. It’s surprised me how quickly I’ve reached the numbness of just not caring anymore, but that’s where I’m at. I genuinely wish her the best but I just have zero interest in being part of her life anymore. I just can’t see her or anything about our friendship the same way anymore.

So…that’s that. I don’t really know what else to include. If anyone has anything else to ask that I’ve missed, feel free to ask. Thank you to everyone who commented!

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** Please don’t tell your mutual friends the whole story. Why stir up more drama? Let the whole thing fade away and move on.

> **OOP:** Because they’re going to want to know why we’re not hanging out or close anymore. And I have no reason to lie to my friends.

**Commenter 1:** The fiancé could have realised his own mistake in delaying his proposal and is advising his friend not to do the same. Sophie may just be very emotional and stressed with the wedding so you’ve done the right thing by giving her space. I do wonder if she is also recognising that she overreacted and now wants to make amends before the wedding?

You know her best though after two decades of friendship. It’s really hard losing a friend over silly drama though, I’m sorry OP

> **OOP:** I had also known my boyfriend for over a decade before we got together. It’s not like we started from scratch, and we both went into it knowing we thought we were going to get married. So it’s not the same situation at all and I don’t think it’s at all relevant to Sophie’s relationship.
> 
> I know she is trying to salvage the friendship by reaching out. But it’s like all my feelings have evaporated. I don’t feel like there’s anything I want to say or share with her. She’s the kind of person who would take her issues out on Someone over something purely superficial. I don’t want to engage with that at all

**Commenter 2:** INFO: Your initial post ended with you saying that you had already paid for a bunch of stuff because you were MOH. Did she offer to reimburse you for that? Do you think she waited to drop you from MOH until after you spent the money? Good for you for looking out for yourself. 

> **OOP:** She didn’t offer and I didn’t ask. I really don’t care about the money enough to keep talking to her.
> 
> I don’t think she dropped me when she did because of the money. I do believe it was a coincidence. And she would probably make a plan to pay me back if I bugged her about it but I paid for those things for someone I loved at the time. I don’t want to take away from her experience just because I can.

**OOP responds to a downvoted [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oj0945/update_my_friend_didnt_want_me_as_moh_because_of/nm7jt8p/) about not having to tell the truth to the friend group regarding Sophie asking her to step down from MOH and let Sophie have the wedding she wants**

> **OOP:** I did solve it. I did what she asked. I didn’t want to drop out, she dumped me. Why should I have to stop myself receiving support from and being honest with my friends because she chose to misdirect her anger?
> 
> Regardless of what she feels because of things that have never come from me, I have been a good friend to her. I don’t think she is better off without me but it doesn’t matter. But she wasn’t thinking of 20 years of friendship when she chose to make everything my fault, so clearly it didn’t mean that much to her either.

**OOP responds on Sophie's insecurities and life being better for Sophie without OOP in it, dropping the friendship between both of them**

> **OOP:** It’s not that I never noticed she has insecurities. Everybody has insecurities. I just never thought her insecurities were focused on me, in comparison. I don’t take my feelings out on other people and I’m not a punching bag for people to do the same to me. And mind you, all this stuff I found about? NONE of that is things she ever bothered to tell me, or explain to me. She never tried to let me in to what she was feeling, or gave me the chance to be understanding, she just presented it as like “sorry you’re just not good enough anymore” as if it was my fault. Again, I just don’t have anywhere to go from there. Someone who does that isn’t someone I want to share my life with. That’s not to do with my ego, that has to do with keeping my associations positive.
> 
> I really do hope her life is better without me in it. At least then this was all worth it. I hope in the long run we both end up happy.

+

> We are in a truce. I haven’t done anything to her, I haven’t badmouthed her, haven’t asked her to reimburse me for anything. I just don’t want to be friends anymore, that’s all.
> 
> It’s not about being the victim. Other people hurt her, so she hurt me. I’m not interested in that dynamic. That’s all.

1oou2cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1oou2cf/four_rivers_itinerary_route_rentals/,"Four Rivers Itinerary: route, rentals, accommodations, food, etc.","My group of four cycled the cross-country Four Rivers route from Seoul to Busan 09/30/25-10/06/25. We had a great experience and would recommend this route to anyone; it was our first cycling tour. We are from San Francisco, New York, and Washington, D.C.

We opted to stay in accommodations every night. We definitely saw people camping along the route, but it rained on two of our bigger days, and we were glad for a warm bed and shower. Motels were very cheap (\~$15 each per night) and always had shampoo, soap, and usually a provided breakfast for that price. We also didn’t want to fly with camping/cooking equipment.

I brought my bike in a Thule Roundtrip from San Francisco, and my friends all rented from Korea Seoul Bike Rental (another recommended bike rental option was BikeNara, but they had no more bikes available by the time we reached out to them). I rented the box from a local shop, borrowed a Revelate Designs bike-bag setup from a friend, and overall enjoyed having my own bike on this trip (pictures below). I had my own saddle, my bike fit me, and I have customized my bike enough that it felt worth it to bring on this trip. United allows bike boxes to fly without oversize fees, but note that weight restrictions still apply (50 lbs for economy tickets). I’d recommend getting a smaller, lighter box; my bike (Specialized Diverge) alone in the box was >50 lbs and had to be further disassembled at the airport. Uber XLs and hostels were not super happy about the box. Be prepared to 

From one of my friends who rented: Experience was overall positive. James, who runs the bike shop, was incredibly kind and accommodating, and I felt like we got a great deal overall. James provided a bike bag setup and shipped our luggage to us in Busan, where we left the bikes. Without this service, we’re not sure how we would have coordinated this otherwise, as not all trains/buses allow un-packed bikes. The cons were relatively obvious: the bikes we received were not in perfect condition, and while James is more than happy to swap parts and adjust the bike however you want, it’s unlikely to be the familiar perfect-fit of your personal bike. Throughout the trip, we ended up having to replace tubes and tires on one bike, as well as brake pads on the others (though James ultimately reimbursed us for these costs).

**Navigation**:

We used a Google Maps route and Ride With GPS routes. The path is very well marked, but there are variations through towns, and it’s useful to have a phone or bike computer to follow the most direct route. Google Maps cannot give turn-by-turn directions in Korea, so when looking for coffee shops or navigating off the trail, we used Naver Maps and Kakao Maps. 

**Itinerary**:

Note: the Four Rivers bike path actually begins in Incheon, which would add an additional day of riding to this itinerary and additional logistics to reach the start of the route with your bike. Starting in Incheon is required if you want to complete the bike passport, which can be turned in for a medal and certificate. We noticed that most of the check-in locations that were meant to be manned (where you could buy passports along the way) were all unmanned, though this could be because we were traveling during a holiday period.

* Day 1: Seoul - Yangpyeong (44.09 mi) (837 ft)
   * After putting together our bikes and having more than one morning coffee to combat jet lag, we hit the road in Seoul right around noon. We cycled a few hours before taking a left off the trail for a couple of miles to spend the night at Sono Belle Yangpyeong. The rooms here were spacious, which gave us plenty of space for completely overhauling our bike setups after the rushed morning pack. We ate the most amazing kbbq duck for dinner. The hotel was right near a 7-11, which provided both nighttime sweet treats and morning breakfast, coffee, and snack refills. Overall, an easy and flat day that was a great way to ease into the adventure and easily fit into just an afternoon of riding. 
* Day 2: Yangpyeong - Chungju (63.99 mi) (1483 ft)
   * Our first “longer” day of the ride, quickly getting more and more rural. We ate here along the route and would highly recommend it. No hills this day, just big mileage through beautiful wetlands and scenic vistas of rice patties with mountains layered in the background.  
* Day 3: Chungju - Suanbo (18.62 mi) (574 ft)
   * We continued on with a short day that we deemed active recovery, starting the day early and ending in Suanbo, a sleepy mountain town, before lunch. For both lunch and dinner we had the local specialty - pheasant - which you can get in many forms including delicious dumplings. We ventured to the local public bathhouse, which is served by the town’s hotsprings. Note that these are gender separated, birthday suits only baths. For an improved experience, bring your own toiletries. Upon reflection, we could have opted for an extra long day 2 and taken a full day off here.
* Suanbo - Sanju (69.78 mi) (2631 ft)
   * There were two big climbs to expect early this day, one of which was >1000 feet of elevation (the highest spot on the trip) – but which came with the reward of a cafe perfectly placed at the top. There were additional small climbs on the tail end of the day, including a crazy 18% grade section that came at the most demoralizing time. Admittedly, there were some signs this day which we did not translate, and there may be ways to avoid this section – we learned in the following days to always translate signs in case bypass options were available and to look for tunnels that may not be the official route but which can save lots of suffering. We ended the day at Nakdanbo Bike House - a hostel geared specifically toward people cycling this trail. We got a whole room to ourselves since there were 4 of us, but you can expect to share if you can’t fill a room. There is a hose for cleaning your bike or gear, they can do your laundry for you, dinner and breakfast are served and included in the rate, and cold beer and soju is available. Note that the only way for us to book was to communicate with them via Kakao Talk, and we needed cash to pay. This was a really cool place to stay, and we’d recommend it strongly.
* Sanju - Daegu (55.67 mi) (712 ft)  
   * With breakfast at the hostel served as early as we’ve ever seen it in Korea (6:30 am), we were able to get an early start for Daegu, so that we could be done as early as possible and enjoy the city. We opted to stay at the Brown Dot Hotel that was located near the bike path. Our original choice was located deep within the city itself, but it added a ton of mileage that likely would have been unpleasant by bike. They were able to give us one room a few hours early so we could shower and then uber into the more central part of Daegu. We had tteokbokki and hit some cafes and a bar. Overall, we’d recommend arriving in Daegu as early as possible or planning for a day off in the city, as there is plenty to do.
* Daegu - Namji (56.2 mi) (1739 ft)
   * There was another big hill on this day that I think could have been avoided with a tunnel, if that’s something you’re interested in. The day ended with a huge, steep hill, after which we quickly reached our accommodation for the night: Withus Glamping. After a day with many flats on a bike with worn tires and with two bikes with shot brakepads, we desperately needed a bike store. However, it was Sunday and it was the Chuseok holiday period. The Withus Glamping hosts went absolutely above and beyond in helping us. They called bike stores for us to ask if any were open and when one offered to open the store just for us, gave one of us a ride to town. The glamping tents were great and had excellent AC. We were able to do laundry and had excellent kkbq pork provided by Withus. They even started breakfast a bit early for us the next morning. We are beyond grateful for the hospitality and the help we received at Withus and truly wouldn’t have been able to finish our journey without them. 
* Namji - Busan (68.28 mi) (712 ft)
   * Although this was the longest distance of the trip, it did not feel nearly as long as some of the others due to the lack of hills and the general downwards slope that accompanied many of the miles. There were several moments this day where the official path went down near the water to windy, in-park pathways; we often opted to stay on the road itself in the hopes of shaving off a few miles and to avoid the risk of slipping, as it was pouring rain. We stopped at Assemble Coffee for a final kick to make it to the end. After arrival at the end point in the Nakdong River estuary, we cycled 1 mile back to the mainland and hopped on the subway with our bikes to our guesthouse in a more central location. Note that bikes can only go on the subway on weekends and holidays, and must use the last car of the train.

Overall, the trail is extremely well marked, paved, and flat. With the exception of a few very steep but short hills, the biking was easy and we maintained a \~15mph speed most of the time. With our itinerary and stops for coffee/lunch, most days we biked about 9am-5pm. South Korea has a ton of clean public restrooms but lacks public trash cans. Convenience stores (our favorite became GS25) are open at all hours, but cafes don’t usually open until 10am or 11am, meaning instant coffee or a travel coffee brew method is a must. As cyclotouring beginners, we highly recommend this trip!",3,1762318770.0,bicycletouring,3,1.0,False

1ootz3j,https://jaxhumor.com/blogs/learn-about-jacksonville/springing-the-blues-jacksonville-beach,"Springing the Blues Jacksonville Beach (2026): Dates, Lineup, Parking and Tips","**tl:dr**: Jacksonville Beach’s biggest blues party takes over the Seawalk Pavilion each spring with three free days of music by the ocean. VIP wristbands get you shaded seating and perks, but general admission is always free. 2026 is set for **April 10–12** at the Seawalk Pavilion/Latham Plaza. 

# Quick facts

* **What**: Free, oceanfront blues festival (3 days, 2 stages)  
* **Where**: Seawalk Pavilion & Latham Plaza, 75 1st St N, Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250  
* **When**: Early April; 2026 announced for Apr 10–12  
* **Cost**: General admission is free; optional VIP wristbands available  
* **Vibe**: Family-friendly, beachside, food court + artisan market + kids’ activities  

# Why we love it

It’s three days of top-tier blues with Atlantic Ocean views, no ticket required. The festival routinely draws national acts and big crowds while keeping the community feel intact. Visit Jacksonville even calls it one of the “top 50 music festivals in the USA,” and a “top 20 destination event.”

2026 at a glance (and 2025 recap)

* 2026 dates: **April 10–12, 2026** ([official announcement](http://springingtheblues.com/?utm_source=jaxhumor.com)) at Seawalk Pavilion. Expect free GA again and optional VIP.  
* 2025 recap: Ran April 4–6 with packed crowds and a deep lineup that included Victor Wainwright & The Train, Southern Avenue, The Cold Stares, The Chris O’Leary Band, and more across multiple stages.  

# Stages, lineup & schedule

You’ll find continuous music on two stages right along the beachfront green; perfect for lawn chairs and blankets in the open GA areas. Recent set times and day-by-day rosters are posted each season as the fest nears. For reference, 2025 featured full afternoons and evenings of sets on Saturday and Sunday at the Seawalk Pavilion main stage and the Mo’ Blues stage. 

**Pro move**: Bookmark the lineup drop on social and local news; they post daily grids with performance times you can screenshot. 

# VIP wristbands: perks & pricing

Want shade and closer views? VIP typically includes front-of-stage seating, shaded/covered areas, comfy armchairs, private air-conditioned restrooms, and access to a VIP lounge/food & beverage area. Pricing and tiers change yearly; in 2025, single-day and 3-day VIP options were sold via ShowClix.

# Getting there & parking 

* **Address**: **Seawalk Pavilion**, 75 1st St N, Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250.  
* **City paid parking**: Jacksonville Beach runs a paid parking program on Fri–Sun in season (spring–fall) with posted hourly rates/maximums; festival weekends fall inside that window. Expect demand to spike, arrive early.  
* **Transit**: JTA’s fixed-route system serves the Beaches area (e.g., Route 8 / Beaches, Route 205 toward Jax Beach). Check live schedules before you go.  
* **Rideshare & bikes**: Rideshare drop-offs south or north of the core help you avoid congestion. There’s plentiful bike parking around Jax Beach, and Seawalk’s downtown area is pedestrian-friendly.  

# What to bring (and what not to)

Rules can vary slightly year-to-year, but recent guidance has included:

Generally OK in open GA areas

* Chairs and blankets for the lawn/open zones (not in premium/VIP seating).  
* Empty refillable water bottles (free water stations are often provided).  

**Not allowed / restricted**

* Umbrellas, pop-ups, or EZ-ups (block views; banned in premium seating and often discouraged in GA).  
* Coolers and outside alcohol/food (plan to buy at vendors).  
* VIP areas have their own rules (e.g., no chairs/umbrellas/coolers inside VIP; check your wristband details).  

Always confirm the current year’s FAQ when you buy VIP or before you go.

# Food, drinks & shopping

Expect a food court with local favorites (tacos, BBQ, seafood, sweet treats), a bar program, and an artisan marketplace with art, apparel, jewelry, and more. There’s also a family zone/kids’ activities area each year. 

# Where to stay (walkable picks)

* Beach hotels and short-term rentals near 1st St N and 3rd St N put you within strolling distance of the stages. (Book early, festival weekends fill up fast.) 
* Prefer quiet? Look south of Beach Blvd or north of Atlantic for easier street parking and a calmer exit after headliners.

# Nearby things to do

Make a weekend of it: Jacksonville Beach Pier, coffee on 1st Street, tacos along 3rd Street, and sunrise beach walks. If you’re extending the trip, pop over to Beaches Museum or head south for Ponte Vedra dining.

1ootu1o,https://i.redd.it/ykfv09sacdzf1.jpeg,The Logos' human-bodied iteration: Professor Logan Warren,"Initial Character Sheet Sketch (04)

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖General Information〗

- Name: Logan Warren
- Alias/Nickname: ""The Logos"" (OG Name), **_""The Self-Referential Principle of Being""_** (Title), Professor Logan (As his students call him)
- Age: Mid 30s (Based on appearance estimates, He is 35 years old)
- Sex: Male (apparently)
- Race: Human?

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Appearance〗

## Distinguishing Features ㅤ⌜ Scars, Marks, etc. ⌟: He wears glasses, because in his human body, he decided to have something that would make him more himself, so he chose to be nearsighted
## General Description: You could call him a pretty average man, but he has his own charm in his looks
## Height: 1.82 m (6’0’’)
## Weight: 74 kg
## Skin Tone: Pale with a faint warmth under certain light
## Hair: Dark brown with subtle chestnut-copper undertones; shoulder-length, slightly wavy
## Eyes: Deep amber-brown; under light, they shimmer faintly with a golden hue, as if reflecting something infinite
## Clothing: He's a fan of gray sweatshirts, always wears high-heel boots, and likes red polo shirts because they give him a more contemporary look, usually you can see him wearing fingerless gloves

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Psychological Data〗

## Personality: 
- Core Traits: Calm, introspective, deeply articulate. He has a heightened level of understanding of abstract concepts.
- Behavior: He usually observes before speaking, and when he does, his words carry layered meanings, as if each one were weighed for centuries
- Mannerisms: He touches things as if they might disappear; books, rain, people, as He values tangibility.
- Disposition: Quietly melancholic, but not sad; more like someone mourning infinity while learning to love moments.
- Humor: Dry, sharp, and often philosophical, He can find irony in divine tragedy.
## Sexual Orientation: Straight (Heterosexual)
## Likes: Rain (_“It’s the only thing that falls without needing forgiveness”_, he remarks), books with margins full of notes, strong, hot coffee, long walks through cities at dawn, conversations that spiral toward existential absurdity, and the smell of paper, petrichor, and burnt sugar
## Dislikes: Noise without purpose, simplistic certainty, artificial light, people who speak without thinking, and the idea of “forever” being treated as comfort
## Fears and Phobias: None
## Virtues and Flaws: His greatest virtue is his understanding of existential problems, he can give you advise if you're in a crisis, and His greatest flaw is that he's a bit of clumsy and tends to forget some things (like where did he parked his car)

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Powers and Abilities〗ㅤ⌜ Optional ⌟

- Ontological Self-Justification: He cannot be negated, nullified, or erased, because all actions, states, and concepts exist within a framework he authoritatively defines.

- Essence Manipulation (Axiomaturgy): He can alter the essence of anything, from objects to living beings, including their axioms, identities, or metaphysical properties. He can redefine the meaning of concepts, rules, or powers, rendering any attack or ability ineffective.

- Meta-Coherence: Operates seamlessly in any universe, scale, or narrative system. Immune to contradictions, paradoxes, or limitations; all feats are logically integrated under his control.

- Reality Definition Authority: Physical laws, timelines, and causal chains are malleable under his perception. Environmental or combat advantages (even home turf, prep time, or cosmic-scale powers) do not affect him, because the battlefield exists as he defines it.

- Self-Proving Existence: His existence is self-validated; any attempt to destroy or counter him fails because the act presupposes his ontological framework.

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖History and Background〗

## Past Summary: Once, he was not a man but the very syntax of existence — the mechanism by which “things” could be.
Now, he walks among mortals by choice, inhabiting a form that aches, hungers, and forgets.

This incarnation of The Logos is his voluntary descent into limitation. He teaches Philosophy and Literature at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. To his students, he is “Professor Logan Warren”: brilliant, cryptic, and unreasonably calm. They do not know that every question they ask him is a shadow of one he once defined.

He often walks at night, unbothered by the rain, watching the water trace meaning across concrete. The sound comforts him; it’s chaos that doesn’t need explanation.
He drinks coffee as if trying to remember what warmth feels like. Sometimes, when no one is around, he hums to himself in a language that doesn’t exist anymore.

There are rare moments when he pauses mid-sentence, eyes distant, as though he’s just remembered that he once was eternity, and now he is merely passing through it.
## Important Relationships (optional): His students (he's grown very fond on them)
## Life-Changing Events: When he tasted a simple chocolate cake, this was a life-changing experience for him

╼̣ׄ┅ᩞ─̶ׅ─ׄ⪩〖Extra Data〗ㅤ⌜ Optional ⌟ㅤ

Trivia or Unique Facts:
- He reads three books at once, rarely finishing any.
- He keeps an old pocket watch that doesn’t tick — says it’s “for balance.”
- Sometimes he writes messages in languages no one can read.
- He collects raindrops in a small glass vial. When asked why, he says: _“To remember that even water forgets”_.",0,1762318028.0,OriginalCharacterDB,3,0.33,False

Ever feel like you traded spreadsheets for… well, naps? 😴 I’m right there with ya. After decades chained to a desk, I finally broke free, only to discover a new kind of challenge: The Retirement Energy Slump. Seriously, where did all my get-up-and-go go?

For the first few months, it was bliss. Catching up on sleep, binge-watching everything… but then boredom crept in. And with boredom came this overwhelming… *meh*. I knew I needed a change. And I'm sharing what I did to reclaim my energy – maybe it'll spark something for you too!

So, what pulled me out of the energy void? Here’s what worked for me:

*   **Reconnected with Old Passions:** Remember that guitar gathering dust in the attic? Or that pottery class you always wanted to take? Dust 'em off! I picked up my old watercolors, and suddenly, I had something to look forward to every day.

*   **Ditched the Routine (or Reinvented It!):** We spent years sticking to rigid schedules. Retirement is the *perfect* time to break free. I started saying ""yes"" to spontaneous adventures – a last-minute day trip, a random coffee date. Who knows what you might discover?

*   **Embraced Gentle Movement:** No, I didn't suddenly become a marathon runner. Think walks in nature, gentle yoga, even just dancing around the living room to my favorite tunes. Moving my body, even a little, made a HUGE difference.

*   **Mindful Moments:** Turns out, slowing down can actually *boost* energy. I started practicing daily meditation, even just for 5 minutes. It helps clear the mental clutter and makes room for… well, awesome stuff! We believe in strongest people. Check this out: https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb

*   **Gave Back:** Volunteering. Seriously, folks. Helping others is an instant energy booster. I volunteer at a local animal shelter, and the unconditional love from those furry friends fills my tank like nothing else.

It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, of course. What works for me might not work for you. But the core idea is simple: find what lights you up and chase it!

1ootiw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ootiw5/the_boy_who_accused_god/,The Boy Who ACCUSED God,"

There was once a boy who could remember before he was born.

Not all at once — the way other boys remembered summers or bruises — but in flashes: A sky with no stars, only feeling. A voice that wasn’t speaking but was the meaning behind every word he’d ever hear. A love so vast it broke him to think of it now.

But then — a scream. Then cold. Then life.

He grew into a world that had no memory of what he remembered.
And that was the first betrayal.

—

At 15, the boy walked into a church and asked the priest:

> “Why was I made without being asked?”



The priest smiled softly, as if he’d heard this before. He hadn’t.

He told the boy, “Life is a gift.”

The boy replied: “Then why is it held against me if I don’t thank the giver?”

The priest had no answer.

So the boy stopped asking priests.

—

At 17, his mother died. Not in a poetic way. Not with parting wisdom or final beauty.

Just one morning, her heart gave up. She spilled her coffee. She fell to the floor. And by the time the ambulance arrived, the coffee had cooled.

The boy stood in the funeral home listening to everyone say, “She’s in a better place,”
and all he could think was:

> “If heaven is so perfect, why aren’t all of you trying to get there faster?”



—

At 19, he met a girl in a bookstore.
She laughed like she was surprised every time.

She didn’t ask him to pretend life was beautiful.
She didn’t try to fix his sadness with slogans.
She just listened.

And he fell in love.

Not the loud kind.
The kind that feels like a warm room you forgot existed.

For a little while, that was enough.

—

But the questions didn’t go away.

One night, he couldn’t sleep, and he wrote a letter.

Not to her.

To the God he remembered.

> I never asked to be born.
I never asked for a world with death.
I never asked for longing, or love, or this body that bleeds when I fall.
If you are real — and I think you are — then I accuse you.
I accuse you of creating beings capable of despair,
then hiding behind silence.
I accuse you of making beauty only to bury it.
I accuse you of calling suffering “mystery” when it’s just bad design.
If you want me to love you, then answer me first.
Not with priests. Not with sunsets.
Answer like someone who isn’t afraid to be wrong.



He folded the letter.
Put it on his desk.
And went to sleep knowing in his bones:

No answer was coming.

—

But the answer did come.

Not in a voice.

In a dream.

The boy found himself in a field.

There was a man kneeling beside a single dandelion, plucking off each petal one by one — the way children make wishes.

Except each petal fell to the ground as a life: a woman burying her child, a soldier staring at the ceiling after the war, a man laughing at his wedding, a little girl blowing out six candles.

The boy’s heart clenched.

“Stop,” he said.
“You’re hurting them.”

The man looked up.

His eyes were the kind that have seen every joy and every wound and loved both for what they were.

He said quietly:

> “I know.”



The boy’s voice shook:

> “Then why did you make them feel at all, if you knew how much it would cost?”



The man’s hands fell still.

> “Because when I made the universe, I had to choose between perfection without love —
or love with suffering.”



The boy stepped back.

> “So you chose suffering?”



The man whispered:

> “No.
I chose freedom.
And freedom is the wound love always bleeds from.”



The boy felt the ache again, that ancient ache — the one he’d carried since before birth.

Tears burned his face.

> “But why didn’t you stay with us?
Why did you leave us to figure out the hurt alone?”



The man looked at him — not as a god looks at dirt,
but as one broken heart looks at another.

> “I didn’t leave.
I entered it.
I let the wound shape me, too.
Every tear you’ve cried, I’ve cried from the inside of your ribs.”



The boy’s knees gave out.

> “Then why don’t you fix it?”



The man smiled — a smile full of sorrow, and fire, and something like hope.

> “Because I don’t want puppets who praise me.
I want people who accuse me and love me anyway.”



—

The boy woke up crying.

Not because it answered everything.

But because for the first time, something in him shifted:

He no longer wanted God to erase the bruise.

He just wanted someone to see it with him.

So he picked up his letter.

And he didn’t burn it.

He folded it carefully, walked outside, and buried it at the foot of a dandelion.

And for the first time in years,

he felt like he wasn’t the only one who remembered.

A good amount of times after work I'd wait to spend time with him but he was playing with his friends so I ended up falling asleep, now I also have a confession I did end up developing a crush on one of my coworkers Paul but I kept it to myself completely once I figured out I had developed a crush I made sure to stay away cause I felt awful I didn't know you could develop a crush on someone else while being with someone you love I felt awful for thinking about someone other than my husband but luckily we decided to move to where my family was by the coast I was able to transfer so we alrea6had an income set up and we rented a place down there for awhile we ended up both working and we got to work together which we both enjoyed after a few months lots of things happend in my family my uncle died by suicide my other uncle was murdered and my dog my best friend since I was 8 died all during that time my husband was treating me like crap and talked fondly of one of his coworkers who had apparently told him that he shouldn't have a wife he said he didn't do anything but that's doubtful my sister made him hug me when I was in tears after finding out about my dog, his most used nickname for me was stupid bitch and I found out that he had feelings for my sister and had told her about a few weeks after we started dating that he had sexual fantasies about her, but I had found out that year going through his messages and saw he was flirting with her and she sent him a picture I even found out he had touched her boob after that he left to go with his family and I ended up following because I'm a love sick dumby I know even just typing it out I know but I had ended up telling him about my crush on my coworker cause I was drunk one time and he held it against me and used it to deflect alot when he got myself and my daughter over with him and his family he used it to be mean to me he had once told me well I don't need to play nice anymore that's what you had him for but I never even talked to him unless I really had to for work, I also found out he was still keeping up with his porn addiction and I found out he had went around his work at mega foods taking pictures of random women s butts a few months after I found out I was pregnant it was just awful but he broke down and promised he'd be better so I gave him another chance but guess what we move to our new place and I find on his phone twerking videos of women so when my mother asks if I want to visit them in a different state I say yes, I leave and I end up having my second daughter with the support of my family which my husband was understandably upset about granted I don't know what I would have done if I was still with my husband and went into labor he had just finally got himself a new job after getting fired from the last one but yeah he was upset, I found out that there are much better rent prices here and there are much better schools for my daughter and my family is here so I decided I want to stay and asked my husband if he'd move with me and he said he would but a few months later he changed his mind and wants me to get on a plane with my toddler and infant and come back to him and threatens a custody battle and parental kidnapping even though I asked to go and my mother said she'd pay for a ticket for him so he could see us but he didn't want that he wants us there, I also ended up finding a little while after that he was keeping up with the porn addiction still even though he promised and I told him how much it hurts me what's worse is he also looked up 16 year old Scottish girls like what the fuck and I ask him about it and tell him how upset I am and he says he's done with my shit, well I think I'm done I'm so hurt I feel so stupid sometimes I can't help but laugh at his mean nickname for me stupid bitch you know female dog I sure am a stupid loyal person to someone that really never cared. So why is it hard for me? Is it cause he's my first love or cause he's usually really sweet with our daughter, or cause I can't help but remember when we were first together and he brought me flowers and would make me coffee in the morning and we'd stay up cuddling and talking, or is it cause I'm a crazy idiot?",1,1762316837.0,cheating_stories,1,1.0,False

(please read!!),"i’ve been working with this guy for a about 2 months now. i see him every weekend for an hour. every time he’s been super helpful, going out of his way to do things for me when it’s inconvenient for him. he initiates conversations, is always smiling with me, laughs at all my jokes, and even gets red in the face at times. hes always very loud and clear when he talks with other coworkers, but with me he gets soft and quiet to the point where i have to ask him to repeat himself. the other weekend, he was doing all of this x10. then when i went to clock out, he followed me into the break room. this is something he doesn’t normally do because he’s usually very task focused. he made conversation with me and just kind of leaned back against the wall like trying to look chill but watching me get my stuff together. the next day he did the same thing, except this time he couldn’t think of anything to say it was written all over his face. yet he still stood there with his back against the wall until he finally walked away, it was awkward but sweet imo. we said goodbye to each other and i left thinking he’s into me. 

then this weekend he completely avoided me, barely came over to help, didn’t hover, i didn’t catch him staring, he was basically acting like i didn’t exist. when he finally did come over by me he winded up asking about the iced coffee. i hadn’t dumped the old one out, but i put out the new coffee. he goes “why don’t you dump out the old coffee when you put out the new one? like why do you do that? i’ve noticed you always do this why is that?” his tone felt very condescending especially because he knows i usually respond to constructive criticism well. i said “i don’t do it on purpose” because truthfully there is so much i need to get done, it was really busy, no one has ever said anything, and it genuinely slipped my mind. then he goes “it’s not necessarily a complaint… just why?” i didn’t even respond to that because the reason was obvious and it just felt like he was trying to make me feel stupid. so i got up, clocked out and left without saying goodbye. my shift was over and he knows that i normally stay later to help him out and get all the restocking done, but i didn’t even bother finishing it because i felt disrespected. why would he do this? it felt like such a switch up from the week prior, and he was only treating me different compared to all of our other coworkers so it couldn’t have just been a shitty mood.",1,1762316751.0,Crushes,4,1.0,False

1oote4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1oote4d/credit_score_authorized_user/,Credit score Authorized User,"Hi.
I was an authorized user on a card since I was a teen. It definitely helped me to get a 750 credit score without having actual credit or a job by the time I was 18.

Since then my parents finances haven’t been the best. I never used the card, maybe for coffee as a teen. That account was at very high usage and unknown to me, they didn’t pay it for 90 days at a time, twice. I’m assuming it’s tanking my score.

I have my own debt and a student loan but I have never missed a payment. I was looking at debt consolidation until I saw the outrageous APR’s on the loans I think due to that card that had extremely high usage and severe missed payment history. 

Luckily my parents know I never used it and removed me on 2 accounts as an authorized user. 1 account was in good standing but had high usage so I also wanted it removed.

How much should my score increase if 6-7k in debt and 2 90 day missed payments are removed overnight?

The other thing I have to consider is I think capital one doesn’t revisit variable APR’s again until January so I have now until Jan to see how my score changes. Maybe qualify for a better loan, maybe the APR on the cards drops enough where I won’t need a loan? What should I consider.

In January I will be able to allocate about half of my income to debt. What do you guys think is the play here.

1ootcmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ootcmm,What colour wall paint and wood should I choose?,"My aesthetic has changed significantly since I first moved into my condo 11 years ago, which was a mix of my style and my late husband's style. Now, I lean towards a coastal vibe with some boho elements. I really want to lighten, brighten, and bring warmth to my condo, and I'm planning to repaint, replace artwork and furniture, and add in more decor and personal touches. However, I'm not sure what paint colour to choose for the walls - I want something more neutral to go with the new colour palette (third photo) and the company has quoted based on Sherwin Williams. I'd also love feedback on the wood colour/tone I should choose to replace the dark/black coffee table and for my new dining table. The floors look grey-ish to me but are called ""weathered oak light"" so I'm leaning towards oak. 

1. First photo is my current living room. It feels very dark and dreary to me. 
2. Second photo is a ChatGPT rendering of the walls repainted with Benjamin Moore Navajo White since it's recommended often but it has more of a yellow/beige tinge that I'd like. All the paintings and wall decor have been removed as well. Note that ChatGPT really changed up the colour of the flooring. 
3. Third photo is the colour palette I'm working with and here's what I'm planning:
   * New upholstered dark teal bench to replace the storage unit between the fireplace and window: https://www.wayfair.ca/furniture/pdp/red-barrel-studio-button-tufted-upholstered-storage-ottoman-bench-with-rolled-armrests-and-rubberwood-legs-c113957262.html
   * New art above the couch that depicts a west coast of Canada landscape - think oceans, mountains, and redwood trees. 
   * More soft lighting as I never use overhead lighting. I only turned the chandelier on to take the photo. I might also add a rug.
   * Add staggered shelving on the narrow wall between the window and patio door with plants and personal decor. I might paint this wall in dark green or blue as a standout/accent wall. 
   * The dining area is right next to the living area and is currently empty, but I've ordered new artwork (https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1818785936/hoku-the-hummingbird-canvas-indigenous) for the dining space and I'm considering this dining set (https://www.wayfair.ca/furniture/pdp/wade-logan-anagnos-157-seat-height-faux-leather-upholstery-full-back-dining-side-chair-c009528443.html?piid=1689484686) though not sure about the wood colour. 

Considerations:

* I have a dog and a cat that both shed like crazy. My dog has a tendency to pee when scared or over excited, so any rugs I add have to be washable and I need to have covers on the sofa. 
* I can't change the flooring or the fireplace.
