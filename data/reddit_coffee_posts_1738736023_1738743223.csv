1ii5ao2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ii5ao2,Just beck from Padang Besar border post,"UPDATE: just back from Padang Besar border.

The Thai officer suggested I spend 2 nights in Malaysia, which I duly did. 

Found a cheap guesthouse for 500b/night. The owner let me pay in baht, and exchange baht to ringgit to buy some food, drinks at the 7-eleven.

I'll plug the guesthouse, cuz they were within walking distance of the border, very quiet, fast wi-fi. They're called: Padang Besar Homestay Firdaus.

Got to the border this morning and was pulled into the office, same as Sadao. But no interrogation this time. Just a brief glance at my passport and a 60 day stamp plomped in.

Total expenditure: 480b for transport to and from where I live in southern Thailand (270kms from PB), 1000b for 2 nights at the homestay, 500b for meals, snacks, coffee.

Am I wrong?","Hello, i should probably go to a therapist for this but the therapist at my college is the worst and i cant really afford therapy rn (i cant use insurance either my parents would see and they dont believe in therapy) 

I (F18) live with my parents because i attend community college. My mother is screaming her lungs out as i type this. shes getting screwed over by her brothers. Her health is constantly at risk from the amount of anxiety and lack of doctor appointments. She never goes to any doctor, ever, she strongly believes that as long as she doesnt know that anything is wrong that means nothing is wrong. She doesnt eat enough, shes constantly complaining of some sort of health issue. She has frequent panic/anxiety attacks. Growing up i tried my best to help her. Im her therapist, caretaker, and everything I could be. I had an incredible amount of anxiety as a child especially due to the way she doesnt take care of herself. Anyway, other than that, shes incredible critical of everything I do and say. I mean i walk on eggshells around her. She takes EVERYTHING personally, and i mean everything. To get a better idea: the other day she was showing me the doilies she made when she was younger (i know shes really proud of them) I said ""wow theyre so pretty, when i have my own house I want to out these on my coffee table they will look great"" and she seemed to like that compliment. Anyway, then a few days later she wanted to borrow press on nails but I told her i dont have any and she tried to look in my drawers anyway and i said ""dont"" and then she slammed my door and yelled for about 40 minutes. I usually stay quiet when shes screaming but she said (pretending to be me saying this) ""Im gonna move out and im gonna live alone and make my own money!!!!"" and i had to step in and say that thats not what i said at all its not true at all. She also seksualises everything i wear (im not sure if that word is ok to say on here ha). She would try to break the bathroom door when I was like 15 thinking im sending nudes when i never even gave her any reason to think that + i always take my phone to the bathroom she knows this. Regardless, basically i hope thats a good idea of the kind of person she is. Shes very controlling but i feel bad. I feel bad for everything. I have 2 jobs, I attend college full time, and I take care of housework when I can (im shamed if i dont for even one day). She tells me im selfish and horrible, that I only care for myself and that I am the worst person in the world and that Im an idiot. She says how happy i will be once shes dead. 

I have 2 older brothers and a dad and ill make this one short 

The two brothers are very different but theyre both super controlling, especially the oldest one. Hes kind of like my mom in the sense that everything i wear is seksualized. My dad doesnt care what i wear, he has anger issues tho. Big anger issues. All my life ive gone between feeling bad for my dad for marrying my mom and vice versa. My mom convinced me that my dad is evil for the first like 8 years of my life. I was made to hate him since the day I was born and I feel so guilty about that. I dont hate him, but he is very hateful. My parents argue at least twice a week on a good week. When they dont argue it feels like the air is still and im just waiting for them to yell again. my brother yelled today and called me selfish and that i dont appreciate anything in this world (he drives me places), he yelled this because I asked him to clean the mess he left in the bathroom. 

im just very confused on where i stand. i want to say i love them but i never do because i dont know if thats how i feel. I dont hate them. Like i dont want anything bad to happen to them i just want them to be healthy and happy but they wont do that for themselves. I feel bad and angry. Im so angry all the time. This past year i have been short fused because i just cant take it anymore ill explode anyminute at this point. I have 2 more semesters before i transfer to university...

TLDR; complicated family relationship, my mom screams and says she hates me - criticizes me then love bombs me. 2 older brothers are over bearing and dad with anger issues. I feel guilty like all of this is my fault even tho i know its not and im so so angry i dont know what to do. ",1,1738742273.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1ii530t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ii530t/a_tincture_of_frost_and_madness/,A Tincture of Frost and Madness,"
The cold is a fickle thing, no less human in its endeavours than beast. It is a case of split personality, a calm, idyllic expanse, a gentle inviting face, with a deep vindictive streak ready to pounce at the opportunity. 

You can try to withstand it. Yet, it will reciprocate by pushing through the cracks, creeping in while you are none the wiser, blowing at your fires, and breaking through your woollen layers. 

A stand against it will surely meet with a punishment which will rarely leave you without a story to tell, blackened vestiges, or a lack of both. 

And if you are met with the misfortune, the frost will toy with you. It will nibble at you, grip your lungs, and paint your skin white. 

Then as it is just about to encompass you in a whirlwind, both elegant and merciless, it gives you a false illusion of warmth, a fake sense that everything is alright, allows you to believe you succeeded in defeating the beast, 

and in your lunacy, while you could just jump for joy, it rips this life from you. 

Perhaps an act of mercy, killing you not in your misery, but in your delirium, or perhaps it is the cruelty of a predator playing around with his prey. Like a tomcat to a battered mouse, cut open and exposed, letting it believe for a moment, there is a path of escape, only to reel it back in for another round of torment.

Regardless, you are dead all the same. 

The void greeted me, and I greeted back— briefly. Linger too long; you are bound to be swept in its embrace. With a resolute slam, I shut the door to the hold. It was 13:00 and I was the fortunate participant of a 5 hour habitat analysis. As I took off my glasses, I winced at the deep indent left on the bridge of my nose, then aptly began wiping the coating of frost which dressed it. 

My temporary residence in Antarctica was designed to make use of almost all ‘state-of-the-arts’, even the arts unknown to the average person of the states. To me, it looked like you rented a hospital room and then followed the directions of a home decoration magazine. The place wasn’t horrible, don’t get me wrong, but it was a zoo, just a hollow replica of one’s true habitat. 

It was the size of a New York apartment, and shaped like a capital D when viewing from the front. As a result, the interior was designed to be modular and compact. Opening the pressurized doors greeted you with your workspace, a hollowed out part of the wall to suit your monitor, a chair, and the computer built into the wall adjacent. I was fairly certain that work being the first thing you saw was management's idea. To the left, your bedding sat, with another hollow out in the structure to fit a potted plant. If you were ever kept up at night, the curve of the roof just beginning to dip gave comfort to all but the claustrophobic. To the right was a kitchen, everything that could be built into the structure was. It featured an upside down L shape, starting at a fridge on the end closest to the computer, and a dishwasher on the farthest. In the middle sat an island block with a single chair for eating.  As an afterthought, the bathroom was squeezed in the empty space where kitchen and wall were separated. On the horizontal of the L, the fridge was coupled with a sink and counter.  Opposite, a complete bio-monitor panel, 5 feet in length and 3 in width. Two arcs of white light extended from its middle, encased in white paint, and wrapped around the whole structure; the exception was the cupboards, seeming to flow behind. It provided a visual break from the soft rose tones present everywhere else but the black floors and marble tiling. 

It was all such a rush, declassified documents, the slaps on the backs from my colleagues, looks of admiration from my superiors. Finally, it was time to make a name for myself, like a great explorer of old, I was to pursue the unknown. But like any rush, it left without saying goodbye, leaving me yearning for times lost in the sands. The whole operation was menial work dressed up in a fancy covert package. If I had known what I know now, I would’ve slapped myself for even considering wearing a suit to the mission debrief— a symptom of a ‘Bond’ binge. 

As if to further dismantle my delusions of grandeur, a team of 10 arrived alongside me, all outfitted in identical units. A larger central hub housed a mess hall, vehicles, and laboratories. Inside of which was where you had a few moments of socialization; the rest of human interaction was the glance of your reflection upon computer startup. 

I was still burnt from my dance with the climate, my nose trapped in a perpetual cycle of leaking and freezing. When I went to heat  my hands under the warm stream of the sink, it felt as though a match was lit under them.

And ever lurking was the hound of the north, its howl present to remind all of its dominance. It whipped at you with winds sharper than most blades, and a flurry of snow encapsulated you from each direction. 

Observed even from the research facilities mobile units, the storm's vicious nature remained on full display. 

I had ridden in a robust one man vehicle, the designer clearly taking inspiration from a space rover. The cockpit was a fair compromise between a claustrophobic nightmare, and a well spaced laboratory. 

The majority of my time was spent noting behaviours of various organisms, and albeit fascinating, began to get dreary as the hours grew long. I did notice however, a thriving population of cross breeds between what looks to be a bear and some kind of aquatic animal, lacking any fertility issues. I recalled my enthusiasm outpacing the truck's engine on the ride home. 

I sat on the stiff office chair, and a quick biometric scan of my face confirmed my identity. The computer sprang to life, with the monitor displaying the motherboard’s manufacturer. I extended a cord from its spot on the desk into the usb slot on the wall. It was a bridge between the raw data held on the vehicle connected to the larger compound to my housing unit. I cracked my numb fingers, and let out a yawn as the computer parsed the info. As soon the files were available, I clicked into the external camera log. The trip had been a slog up until now, but perhaps this discovery would be a respite from the boredom. 

Recordings of the species frolicking about, in and around a small patch of forest were served to my display, and I ate it hungrily. Potential names, the fact that an interbreed of such distant animals could produce offspring, all of it, and more raced through my mind. At first glance it could be mistaken for a classic polar bear, sporting a fat insulation layer, white fur, a round robust build. Yet, little details gave it away, its paws partially webbed, its form more streamlined than the average bear. The head was strong, broad, but the snout was sleek. Ears pinned back, and eyes faced forward. The thick muscular tail was the biggest clue that this was a unique creature.

A true apex predator, both land and sea adaptations, and if I had to guess it had a form of sonar. The genetic incompatibilities between whatever parent species seemed to have been remedied in some unique way. It fascinated me, encouraging a raw, powerful, curiosity. 

Yet, something else, it was just past the tree line. It flickered in and out of frame, a deep, rich black that would have blended in with the forest if not for its glimmering, slimy, sheen. I immediately chalked it up to a bug in the enhancement AI. Still, I laid my elbow on the desk, hand to my temple, brow furrowed as I pressed ‘enlarge’ and rewound the log. Normally, I would have ignored something so trivial, but the possibility of a second discovery lured me in like a fish to water.

That, and the storm had begun to call. The wind picked up, scratching at the walls, searching for a way inside. I wouldn’t be leaving this room for quite some time. 

Just as I was nearing the unidentified footage, the program buffered, then promptly crashed.

I placed my hand to my head, palm rubbing my eyes. I had just realized how long it had been since I last blinked.

A deep sigh left me as I leaned back in my chair. The screen had gone black, save for a faint reflection of myself, illuminated by the dim emergency light overhead. For a few seconds, I just stared—half at my own tired expression, half at the void where the footage had once been.

Then, the monitor flickered.

A soft click. Then another. The system whirred back to life, but something was wrong. The playback window reopened on its own, skipping ahead. Lines of corrupted data scrolled past like something was sifting through it faster than I could follow. My fingers tensed over the keyboard.

I hadn’t touched anything.

Another flicker. Then, the screen stabilized.

The footage had changed

it was as if time itself had stopped to gape at what I was looking at. I took a sharp breath, and for a moment, it felt harsher than if I had thrown myself into the midst of the storm beyond my door. 

AI glitches are supposed to resolve themselves after reanalyzing the affected frames. There was no glitch of the system. When I replayed the footage, I bore witness to what now clearly appeared to be the thin limb of a creature that dwarfed even the animals beside it. But something else had changed.

The flickering stopped.

I was certain, the line, well limb, in the distance had been perfectly straight yet it’s shown … bent. Impossible, I thought. I rewound the footage again. No. I was sure of it. It had definitely moved. My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer, and even with the conditions threatening to pull the roof off my head, the only sound in that room was my own pounding heartbeat.

And then, any resolve I may have had dispersed. A misshapen head glared back at me from the screen. No, a moose skull, charred and melted. My eyes darted back and forth between, its head, its legs, how it began lowering itself to peer at me. 

The walls of the cabin groaned under the storm’s relentless assault. The wind howled through unseen gaps, rattling whatever was not tied down, sending them toppling one by one. And somewhere in the madness, my heart joined the chaos, hammering in time with the storm.

The footage became more convoluted; my head thundered with every second I kept my eyes pressed on the screen. My eyes began to twitch, and my agape mouth rattled back and forth. It felt as if my body was a generator, my capacitors ravaged by a surge too powerful. 

A flash of light illuminated the room, driving  out any wayward shadows. I was there in that moment for eternity. My eyes peeled open by an unseen force. The white expanse was unnatural, it was too bright. I felt as if I was looking straight into the sun, but there was no warmth. Only cold. 

Then in an instant, my monitor cracked, and my glasses flung to the ground. A mesmerizing display of light lit up the room as the rays danced off the glass shards. In a daze, I was on the floor, gasping for air, my vision covered by blanching spots. I was left with no memory of the past hour and a dying urge to return back to that thicket. 

A primal, raw, maddening call no man could dream of refusing. 

I arose into a seating position, one knee up and one down, and gasped at the chaos that surrounded me. The panel on the monitor was completely destroyed, and its remains circled me— along with those of my glasses. Cupboards flung open, dishes strewn across the room. The plant above my bed seemed to have exploded, with its former inhabitants caking my mattress. I shook my head, gazing at the fridge door which was hanging on by a twisted scrap of metal. 

What the hell happened here? I had asked no one in particular. I looked at the monitor in front of me, squinting my eyes. For the life of me I could not recall what I had just been doing, or where I was for that matter. It was not exactly forgotten, I could feel the emptiness which my memories were supposed to fill. It was as if they were stolen, and there was an imprint left in their wake. 

I blinked.

Everything was back in order.

The cupboards closed, my monitor whole. The fridge steadily humming, door shut as if it had never been disturbed. The plant above hung lazily, lush and thriving. 

I sucked in a breath, my pulse started pounding again. The air had gotten tight, each rise of my chest harder than the last. 

The details of my setting blurred, and merged together. Fine lines dissipated as colours bled into one another. 

My eyes strained trying to keep track of the shapes' choreography, before I squeezed them shut. 

I wanted to curl into a ball and scream until I had no throat left to do so. The hum of the fridge grew louder, sharper, until it became a loud whistle shrieking overhead. 

My eyes shot open, and began darting around. 

My surroundings began to solidify, I recognized the dim concrete, a faint red glow all around. it felt so familiar to me, but for the life of me I couldn’t imagine why.

The air felt no less suffocating than if I were drowning. The room— no, the walls, the men in white coats, everything was wrong. 

They sat hunched at rows of box computers lining the walls. Their fingers punched the keys urgently, dots of sweat beading on their foreheads. Each wore a pistol strapped to their chest, but knowing these gear heads they weren’t using it for offensive. Just for a way out. 

I blinked again. Hadn’t I just been somewhere else? 

Yes, that’s right. 

I had thrown up in the bin just 15 minutes ago. Spent the next 15 cleaning any remains off my uniform. The tan and green kept my secret safe. I recall looking to my chest, the 3 pointed stars a reminder that any sign of weakness can be the whole platoon's downfall.  

A second whistle cut through the air. 

Red lights now pulsed powerfully overhead, flashing against the barren concrete walls. 

I braced for impact, grabbing hold of a chair with my left and desk with my right. 

An explosion sounded out in the distance, rattling the dust in the bunker. it had just missed us. 

A thin man ran to me, whose oversized helmet banged around his pinhead. I could see the wisps of blond hair cut short, betraying the confines of his headgear. 

“General, we need to retreat from the eastern front,” he stammered out, the bunch of papers he held falling as he spoke, “it’s imperative that—“ 

“Not another word Jenkins,” I barked, “how can we afford losing our advantage?” 

My vision sharpened, the haze lifted as the spell melted away. The air grew lighter, the bunker quieter. How dare this lackey, Jenkins, mean to tell me how to win a war? I’d fought my way into this world, and by god, would I be willing to leave the same way. 

“Sir, how can we afford not to?” 

I closed the distance between us, my eyes burning into his. I jabbed my finger into his chest as I spoke, my voice low and dangerous. 

Then I paused, taking a puff of my cigar for dramatic effect. I leaned back in my leather chair, drumming my fingers on the polished wood of my desk. My colleague, Tom, sat across from me, mouth slightly agape, hanging on every word. 

“Well, what’d he say?” Tom asked me, his brown suit crinkled as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees. A half empty glass of whisky caught the light of the June sun. 

“Ah, I hadn’t gone that far yet,” I said, glancing around my office. The rotary phone next to a stack of papers, faint hum of the typewriters being worked in the next room— it all felt so mundane opposed to the war time narrative I recounted to Tom. 

“Don’t just stop there,” Tom said with a smile, “I smell a best seller coming from you, pal” 

I stood up and turned away from Tom, taking in the large green plant in the corner of the office. The tiger carpet, which had cost a pretty penny, lay lazily gazing at my mahogany doors, their gold finish catching the sunlight.

Striding over to the large glass windows adjacent to my desk, I clasped my hands behind my back. The city sprawled below, bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. Dust motes danced in the light, normally unseen but now illuminated like tiny stars. A Presley song played softly in the background, its melody at odds with the unease creeping into my chest.

I turned my head slightly. “Tom, you never did tell me why you have a moose’s skull for a head” 

Tom leaned back into his chair, fingertips touching. There was nothing behind the charred bone— but I could tell he was burning a hole into my back. 

The eye socket partially melted, like glass pulled too soon from a furnace. A sickly sheen coated the head, as if routinely dipped in oil. 

I stared back at him, his jaw rattled as his head tilted slightly, as if to raise an eyebrow.  

A soft chuckle, before he spoke, “what are you talking about buddy?” 

The warm glow of the office was gone, the music faded, and I sighed as I was no longer immersed in my recollection. The therapist’s concerned eyes met mine, her pen poised over her notepad. “And how often do you have this dream?” She said gently. 

“I dunno, maybe once a week? I always tell some different story.” I said, looking up from my vantage point on the therapist's lounge chair. 

“So tell me”, she leaned forward, gaze steady, “how does this dream make you feel?” 

I hesitated, the image of the skull flashing in my mind. “Feels like I’ve been lying to myself,” I said finally, “You know what I mean, like I’ve been ignoring something so obvious, staring me right in the face” 

“It’s interesting you say that,” with a soft tone, quite mother-like, “ if you don’t mind me asking, what would you say is your biggest fear?” 

“Well, truthfully, losing control of who I am, my personal compass, it terrifies me, really.”

The therapist began dotting something down in her notebook. I took a moment to scan the office, a habit I’d picked up. The lounge chair beneath me was familiar as ever, and across a small coffee table sat my therapist, in a recliner. I turned my head, glancing over my shoulder at the large window behind me, where the second story view overlooked a bustling downtown street. A few feet away, a bookshelf stood beside a bamboo tree.

Even though I never read the books, nor the titles, their presence made me feel welcomed. As if to say, you are grounded, their colours touching a spot of comfort in my mind. The midday light caught the leaves of the bamboo. I sat staring at them, analyzing the plant’s intricacies. 

“Mr. Hansen?”

I glanced up quickly, “Ah sorry,” I said, embarrassed. “What was the question?” 

“I want you to look at a few images and tell me how they make you feel,” she peered at from behind her glasses, “can you do that for me?”

On the table, she had laid out a series of printed black shapes that could be interpreted this way or that. I picked up the stack, and started to make out the first one. 

“Uh,” I furrowed my brow, “I see a couple” 

“Hmm, interesting.” She wrote a quick note, “keep going and I’ll write what you say” 

“A person- no, a group running.” I set the page on the coffee table atop the previous. 

“A man crying out, his hand, I think, is raised?” 

“I- oh, oh man.” 

My chest conscripted, I tried to make a sound but to no avail. This time, I wasn’t guessing. I knew this shape, and very well at that. 

“Is something the matter Mr. Hansen?” 

“No, it’s uh, just that”, I trailed off, the papers falling from my hand. 

I recoiled back on the lounge, like a scared animal. My heart threatening to pound through my rib cage, mouth hanging agape. 

“Mr Hansen,” 

the sound of bones clicking after each word.

“Get control of yourself.” 

The lifeless sockets tore into me. I couldn’t bear to look for longer than a few seconds, yet I could describe the features as if I marbled them in stone. 

The face of my tormentor. Just a glance and its grip grasped my lungs. My attempts at breathing were futile. 

The bookshelf, had it always looked so dilapidated? Was the dressing of mold, the black rot of the bamboo stem, ever so present? 

My eyes winded, as if forcing me to take in my surroundings.

“Stay back,” I commanded, though my voice betraying my words. 

“I swear to you,” it was more pleaded than threatened, “stay.. stay back” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME.” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME,” the man repeated. 

I groaned, and b-lined for the living room. My half chopped carrots kept vigilant in my wake. 

I stood in front of the television watching the scene play out a little longer, then I changed the channel. 

Reruns of cheesy horror dramas are all they play these days. 

A hop and a whistle and I was back to preparing dinner. Now, what would Linda like  in a soup? Does rice work in a soup? 

To not keep the carrots waiting any longer, I got back to work, making a mental note to fully flesh out my recipe. 

Chip, chip, chip. 

A quite therapeutic sound, it brought me back to when I was a lad.

My mother loved the kitchen, even devising a cookbook of her own. She made an effort to always hand it out at every neighbourhood function. It was truly an example of her determination, I recall many times she invited friends for tea— just to hand out that damn book. 

Shaking me out of my daydream, a fat blob of red stained deep in the hem of my white shirt caught my eye. I held my arm out and stared for a moment. 

Did I knick a vein? No, that wasn’t my blood. Well, no bother, I’m not hurt, but this shirt might be done for. A quick wash under cold water and I was finishing up with my carrots. 

She might like some beef, that woman is half carnivore I swear. 

Or, I could ditch the soup, go full on fried rice. Although, we did eat at that Asian place just last week. Anywho, I’d have to decide by the time I finish cutting the onions. 

I set the carrots aside and picked out an onion from the fridge. A second mental note was made to add onions to the shopping list; I had just picked out the last one. 

“So, ya’ve gather’d your boys here to g’wan with my treasure, have ya?,” the television blared out lines from an old western. 

I gave a few curious glances at the action, a tense drawing of pistols, and a gunfight ensued.  

As I returned to my task, I took note of the knife. Heavier than before. The onions, soft. Too soft, and supple. 

For some reason, I felt a chill raise its way up to my nape; I grew acutely aware of the beating California sun shining on my forehead through the window overhead the counter.  

Was my hand shaking? “Get a hold of yourself man,” I spoke out loud. 

I cracked the window, this heat must be making me delirious. 

The breeze hit like a crashing wave to a beach shore. I could hear the neighbourhood kids yelling. I smiled, oh to be young. 

Shunk, shunk, shunk. 

The onions were chopped in halves, then in strips.  

Again, I managed to become distracted by the tv. There was an actor, whose face of abject terror was discernible even in my peripherals.  

I stood inquisitively, turning to face the screen. I get the sense I worked with that fellow, but just where? 

As I tried to recall, the chill creeped up on me again, as if to let me guard down. I shook my head, and, partly to distract myself, continued the chopping. 

Thunnk, thunnk, thunnk

Without exactly knowing why, I began to cut the onions with more passion. I felt, almost a sense of rage begin to bubble, my hands felt clammy. I began to dive the knife harder into the cutting board. 

It no longer felt like I was cutting onions, nor was it in the kitchen. 

Thunk, Thunk, Thunk.

Shadows began to feel longer, the lights a little dimmer. Yet, all the same, I felt like a puppet, my hands moving of its own accord. 

Thunk…. Thunk.

At times I didn’t even realize it was moving at all, I had intense focus only on what was in front of me. 

My knuckles grew white as I gripped the handle tighter; my breath became ragged. 

My attention was solely on the board, each stroke my blade slid more powerful than the other, all the while— CRACK. 

“Ah, brother,” I said exasperated. I had cut a deep indent in the cutting board, which pulled me out of my stupor. 

I breathed heavily, could I be having a stroke? A sick unease washed over me. Without a moment's notice, I grabbed a rag and thrust it under the cold of the sink. I put it overtop my forehead and made way for the dining room chair, knife in hand. 

I had to get out of the sun. 

“Are you going to still live in ignorance?,” the television blared before I had the chance to sit. 

My interest piqued, I turned my head. It was that actor from before, yet this time in a white lab coat. An infomercial was playing. 

Seeing him twice raised my spirits, I cracked a smile. Albeit, tainted by the lethargy that seemed to infect deep into my body. What could be the chances he’s shown in a time slot back to back. 

“You can’t keep chopping away forever,” the actor grinned. A gleaming smile so bright you could light a room with it. 

“How long do you want to live in your fantasy world ignoring everything you’ve done?” 

The children playing, the birds chirping, the dripping of the tap I never bothered to tighten. All ceased as a close up of the man seemed to encapsulate me into keeping my eyes locked forwards. 

It was as if he turned directly at me. As I titled my head slightly, I could swear his eyes tracked. 

“And what of our families? Who let you become executioner of the innocent?”

Then the sound of applause and laughter began to fade in, ushering out the silence. 

Hot iron passed into my veins. 

I felt my chest struggle against a crushing weight. 

I slowly peeled my head off the screen, whatever else the man was saying a blur. 

I ran to the cutting board in an attempt to regain normalcy, to no avail. 

The feverish cuts synchronized with the sound of glasses clinking. 

My crisp suit began tugging at the seams, with every powerful thrust of my blade. 

Tears began welling in my blood shot eyes. Any confidence left had finally dissipated, evident of shaking breath 

In a desperate attempt to keep myself grounded, I prepared a powerful swing of the blade. 

I pulled my hand back, intended a slam of the blade with everything I had in me. 

But— 

There was no knife. 

Instead, my champagne glass sailed to the ground, shattering on the ballroom floor. 

The music didn’t stop, nor did the laughter waver. 

Although, a whale-like man turned to face me, jowls trembling with rage. A dark stain now present where my drink had caught him.

“Composure, man! You ought to learn it” he huffed, a thick, gruff voice from under a bellowing moustache. The fat on his neck shook ever so slightly as he spoke. 

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered, “I seem to have lost control of myself.” 

He left with an astound “harrumph” and turned away into a mess of people. 

I took in my surrounds, shimmering balls reflecting off crystalline dresses. A mess of fur scarves, tailed suits and men with a skewed sense of importance. A fat air of sophistication hung over the crowd. 

My hands were still trying to grip a phantom knife when a woman touched my shoulder. 

“I see you stuck to your usual dramatic introductions, dear” a voice teased. 

I turn, a sly mood overcame me, though I was unsure why. 

The woman wore a flowing, obsidian gown, The diamonds at her throat seemed to ripple and move along with the light of the crowd. 

“I took it you were going to make me find you” she laughed, stepping closer. 

A heavy scent of lavender, and something metallic, accompanied her. 

I must know her, of course, but the name my lips searched for was nowhere to be found. 

“You were always good at making a scene,” she smiled knowingly, as if we shared some unspoken secret. 

My hand twitched, there was no knife, yet my fingers curled as if they grasped a handle.

I let my gaze wander, a subtle attempt to jog my memory.

It’s when I noticed— everything was too perfect. 

They danced in unison, movements seamless, like they practiced this a hundred times over. 

Yet, when they laughed, mouths moved, faces contorted, but the sound came moments later. 

The glow of the chandeliers too bright, as if to drown out fine details, not illuminate.

Why did every man have the same smooth skin, every woman an hourglass figure.  

Why did the air tug at my throat, like a turtleneck one size too little? 

She touched my cheek, fingers softer than the feathers. She guided my face to hers.

“But tell me,” she whispered, brushing her nails on my chin “did you enjoy the show” 

My stomach jumped. 

“..what?” 

The music warped, the elegant waltz lurched, now jumped from one tune to the next. 

The dancers didn’t stop, they jerked in painful movements to the new beat. 

Why couldn’t I remember the woman’s name?

Why was I here? 

What was my name? 

Who.

Am.

I?

A breath. 

A twitch. 

A snap. 

I lunged. 

The moment my first collided with her face, it was not flesh, nor bone, but painted ceramic that shattered on impact. 

Beneath? 

Hollow. 

Panic took hold of me. I began lashing out at the guests. 

legs, torsos, all to the same effect, all cracking and splintering revealing nothing underneath. 

Not one person turned to address the commotion, even the ones smashed in half. 

Simply keep laughing and dancing. 

I fell to my knees and raised my hands to the sky, tears rolling into my gaping mouth. 

In the flash of the waiter's belt, I caught my own reflection. 

A man grinned back at me— wide eyes crazed with desire, a flush smile too wide for his face. 

It was me. 

And it wasn’t. 

The scene all around me spun, as if I were caught in a tornado. Everything blurred together, and details crashed into me, sharp and sudden, like a head on collision. 

Distant screams pierced through my head as I struggled to make sense of what was in front of me. 

I shut my eyes tight, knowing it was no true protection against the cruelty of the outside. Then— drip. It was soft at first, barely a whisper. 

Despite the chill creeping into my bones, I smiled. 

It was just a bad trip, nothing more nothing less. An adverse reaction to some frozen airborne deliriant I must have inhaled. 

That had to be it. I was back in my dorm, and absently-minded-me forgot to tighten the sink again! 

But no matter how hard I tried, the cruel mistress of reality had other plans. I could not deny the feeling of snow, as I kneeled down on the ground.  

I finally mustered the courage to peel my eyes open. I was instantly aware of the frostbite gnawing at my fingers, the cold seeping deep into my bones. What I saw next was worse than any injury, My hands were dressed in a cruel glove of blood. The crimson was too real, there was no denying it. 

I wiped myself off and clambered to my feet. Just behind me, the door to the main faculty lay open. A faulty component let off sparks. Inside was dark– though the sun, bleeding through the jagged frame, betrayed any notion of serenity. 

My knees buckled as I made my way towards nowhere in particular. The wind whipped around me, a symphony of my misery. 

I had no direction, nor a plan. The open room seemed as good as any. 

I took a few steps, then under my boot a squelch. 

I looked down to see a beady eye, dislocated from its owner, gazing at me accusingly. 

With muted acceptance, I lifted my leg, shaking off what had once been a man’s face.

Out of habit, I dragged myself to a powerswitch.

For a few moments, the fluorescents burned my corneas. As things stabilized I lay witness to the full, grotesque splendor– my massacre. 

The dorm was in utter ruin, tables and chairs pushed aside in a mad frenzy, clearing the space for the real spectacle.

The conglomerate of the research team, those accompanying me, had been arranged in a stiff, unnatural display, their bodies forced into grotesque vaudeville poses. Their muscles, pulled taut into exaggerated smiles, were stitched in place by sharpened molars and jagged shards of bone. Those not propped up, presumably their pieces repurposed for the set, laid scattered around the would be theatre crew. 

At the center of it all, the man, the one who had spoken to me in my daze, stood grinning. His own peeled-off face dangled from his fingers like a discarded mask. His other hand, gripping a blood-slicked blade, pointed toward the wall behind him.

It was not a question that it was intended for my eyes. I lurched forward, past the twisted remains of my coworkers. I was waiting for one to move, pat me on the back, tell me “Hey, buddy, we wouldn't have done much better in your shoes.”

No respite came. There would be no salvation. 

On what used to be the tray collection table lay a pile of photographs—every photograph from the facility’s records.

Each had been replaced with a picture of me— and the charred skull of a moose.In each, I was the central figure. My face inserted seamlessly into group photos, with everyone else replaced by the blackened skeleton. There was a wedding photo with me standing in place of the groom, the bride now a skeletal husk. The edits were flawless, as if I had always belonged in those frames.

I picked up one particular frame, and laughed. 

It was a harsh, strangled sound at first, then built up to a maddening roar. 

I turned my back slowly to the frigid metal behind me, and sank slowly to the floor.

I began to sob, laughing all the while

The most vicious thing winter’s mistress– No. that damned creature, had done was leaving me alive to witness my massacre, not killing me in ignorance. Maybe I should do it myself after I put down the pen.

“*I intend to detail this log as a last service to the company and to humanity, so this mission is not clouded in secrecy, speculated on, then green lit once more for  fresh victims to embark on.*”

I concluded, having detailed everything I could on some wayward tablet which I had clearance for, before tossing it aside.

With a sigh, I realized my mask of temperance had begun to slip. I was going to come to terms with myself, whether I liked it or not. 

I rubbed my thumb over the frame I had grabbed. 

“Don’t keep your mother worrying! My fav picture of you ;) XOXOXO!” 

My tears fell over the childhood photo, of who I would never know, as my face had been plastered over his.

Am I wrong?","Hello, i should probably go to a therapist for this but the therapist at my college is the worst and i cant really afford therapy rn (i cant use insurance either my parents would see and they dont believe in therapy) 

I (F18) live with my parents because i attend community college. My mother is screaming her lungs out as i type this. shes getting screwed over by her brothers. Her health is constantly at risk from the amount of anxiety and lack of doctor appointments. She never goes to any doctor, ever, she strongly believes that as long as she doesnt know that anything is wrong that means nothing is wrong. She doesnt eat enough, shes constantly complaining of some sort of health issue. She has frequent panic/anxiety attacks. Growing up i tried my best to help her. Im her therapist, caretaker, and everything I could be. I had an incredible amount of anxiety as a child especially due to the way she doesnt take care of herself. Anyway, other than that, shes incredible critical of everything I do and say. I mean i walk on eggshells around her. She takes EVERYTHING personally, and i mean everything. To get a better idea: the other day she was showing me the doilies she made when she was younger (i know shes really proud of them) I said ""wow theyre so pretty, when i have my own house I want to out these on my coffee table they will look great"" and she seemed to like that compliment. Anyway, then a few days later she wanted to borrow press on nails but I told her i dont have any and she tried to look in my drawers anyway and i said ""dont"" and then she slammed my door and yelled for about 40 minutes. I usually stay quiet when shes screaming but she said (pretending to be me saying this) ""Im gonna move out and im gonna live alone and make my own money!!!!"" and i had to step in and say that thats not what i said at all its not true at all. She also seksualises everything i wear (im not sure if that word is ok to say on here ha). She would try to break the bathroom door when I was like 15 thinking im sending nudes when i never even gave her any reason to think that + i always take my phone to the bathroom she knows this. Regardless, basically i hope thats a good idea of the kind of person she is. Shes very controlling but i feel bad. I feel bad for everything. I have 2 jobs, I attend college full time, and I take care of housework when I can (im shamed if i dont for even one day). She tells me im selfish and horrible, that I only care for myself and that I am the worst person in the world and that Im an idiot. She says how happy i will be once shes dead. 

I have 2 older brothers and a dad and ill make this one short 

The two brothers are very different but theyre both super controlling, especially the oldest one. Hes kind of like my mom in the sense that everything i wear is seksualized. My dad doesnt care what i wear, he has anger issues tho. Big anger issues. All my life ive gone between feeling bad for my dad for marrying my mom and vice versa. My mom convinced me that my dad is evil for the first like 8 years of my life. I was made to hate him since the day I was born and I feel so guilty about that. I dont hate him, but he is very hateful. My parents argue at least twice a week on a good week. When they dont argue it feels like the air is still and im just waiting for them to yell again. my brother yelled today and called me selfish and that i dont appreciate anything in this world (he drives me places), he yelled this because I asked him to clean the mess he left in the bathroom. 

im just very confused on where i stand. i want to say i love them but i never do because i dont know if thats how i feel. I dont hate them. Like i dont want anything bad to happen to them i just want them to be healthy and happy but they wont do that for themselves. I feel bad and angry. Im so angry all the time. This past year i have been short fused because i just cant take it anymore ill explode anyminute at this point. I have 2 more semesters before i transfer to university...

TLDR; complicated family relationship, my mom screams and says she hates me - criticizes me then love bombs me. 2 older brothers are over bearing and dad with anger issues. I feel guilty like all of this is my fault even tho i know its not and im so so angry i dont know what to do. ",1,1738741982.0,family,3,1.0,False
1ii52mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ii52mw/a_tincture_of_frost_and_madness/,A Tincture of Frost and Madness,"
The cold is a fickle thing, no less human in its endeavours than beast. It is a case of split personality, a calm, idyllic expanse, a gentle inviting face, with a deep vindictive streak ready to pounce at the opportunity. 

You can try to withstand it. Yet, it will reciprocate by pushing through the cracks, creeping in while you are none the wiser, blowing at your fires, and breaking through your woollen layers. 

A stand against it will surely meet with a punishment which will rarely leave you without a story to tell, blackened vestiges, or a lack of both. 

And if you are met with the misfortune, the frost will toy with you. It will nibble at you, grip your lungs, and paint your skin white. 

Then as it is just about to encompass you in a whirlwind, both elegant and merciless, it gives you a false illusion of warmth, a fake sense that everything is alright, allows you to believe you succeeded in defeating the beast, 

and in your lunacy, while you could just jump for joy, it rips this life from you. 

Perhaps an act of mercy, killing you not in your misery, but in your delirium, or perhaps it is the cruelty of a predator playing around with his prey. Like a tomcat to a battered mouse, cut open and exposed, letting it believe for a moment, there is a path of escape, only to reel it back in for another round of torment.

Regardless, you are dead all the same. 

The void greeted me, and I greeted back— briefly. Linger too long; you are bound to be swept in its embrace. With a resolute slam, I shut the door to the hold. It was 13:00 and I was the fortunate participant of a 5 hour habitat analysis. As I took off my glasses, I winced at the deep indent left on the bridge of my nose, then aptly began wiping the coating of frost which dressed it. 

My temporary residence in Antarctica was designed to make use of almost all ‘state-of-the-arts’, even the arts unknown to the average person of the states. To me, it looked like you rented a hospital room and then followed the directions of a home decoration magazine. The place wasn’t horrible, don’t get me wrong, but it was a zoo, just a hollow replica of one’s true habitat. 

It was the size of a New York apartment, and shaped like a capital D when viewing from the front. As a result, the interior was designed to be modular and compact. Opening the pressurized doors greeted you with your workspace, a hollowed out part of the wall to suit your monitor, a chair, and the computer built into the wall adjacent. I was fairly certain that work being the first thing you saw was management's idea. To the left, your bedding sat, with another hollow out in the structure to fit a potted plant. If you were ever kept up at night, the curve of the roof just beginning to dip gave comfort to all but the claustrophobic. To the right was a kitchen, everything that could be built into the structure was. It featured an upside down L shape, starting at a fridge on the end closest to the computer, and a dishwasher on the farthest. In the middle sat an island block with a single chair for eating.  As an afterthought, the bathroom was squeezed in the empty space where kitchen and wall were separated. On the horizontal of the L, the fridge was coupled with a sink and counter.  Opposite, a complete bio-monitor panel, 5 feet in length and 3 in width. Two arcs of white light extended from its middle, encased in white paint, and wrapped around the whole structure; the exception was the cupboards, seeming to flow behind. It provided a visual break from the soft rose tones present everywhere else but the black floors and marble tiling. 

It was all such a rush, declassified documents, the slaps on the backs from my colleagues, looks of admiration from my superiors. Finally, it was time to make a name for myself, like a great explorer of old, I was to pursue the unknown. But like any rush, it left without saying goodbye, leaving me yearning for times lost in the sands. The whole operation was menial work dressed up in a fancy covert package. If I had known what I know now, I would’ve slapped myself for even considering wearing a suit to the mission debrief— a symptom of a ‘Bond’ binge. 

As if to further dismantle my delusions of grandeur, a team of 10 arrived alongside me, all outfitted in identical units. A larger central hub housed a mess hall, vehicles, and laboratories. Inside of which was where you had a few moments of socialization; the rest of human interaction was the glance of your reflection upon computer startup. 

I was still burnt from my dance with the climate, my nose trapped in a perpetual cycle of leaking and freezing. When I went to heat  my hands under the warm stream of the sink, it felt as though a match was lit under them.

And ever lurking was the hound of the north, its howl present to remind all of its dominance. It whipped at you with winds sharper than most blades, and a flurry of snow encapsulated you from each direction. 

Observed even from the research facilities mobile units, the storm's vicious nature remained on full display. 

I had ridden in a robust one man vehicle, the designer clearly taking inspiration from a space rover. The cockpit was a fair compromise between a claustrophobic nightmare, and a well spaced laboratory. 

The majority of my time was spent noting behaviours of various organisms, and albeit fascinating, began to get dreary as the hours grew long. I did notice however, a thriving population of cross breeds between what looks to be a bear and some kind of aquatic animal, lacking any fertility issues. I recalled my enthusiasm outpacing the truck's engine on the ride home. 

I sat on the stiff office chair, and a quick biometric scan of my face confirmed my identity. The computer sprang to life, with the monitor displaying the motherboard’s manufacturer. I extended a cord from its spot on the desk into the usb slot on the wall. It was a bridge between the raw data held on the vehicle connected to the larger compound to my housing unit. I cracked my numb fingers, and let out a yawn as the computer parsed the info. As soon the files were available, I clicked into the external camera log. The trip had been a slog up until now, but perhaps this discovery would be a respite from the boredom. 

Recordings of the species frolicking about, in and around a small patch of forest were served to my display, and I ate it hungrily. Potential names, the fact that an interbreed of such distant animals could produce offspring, all of it, and more raced through my mind. At first glance it could be mistaken for a classic polar bear, sporting a fat insulation layer, white fur, a round robust build. Yet, little details gave it away, its paws partially webbed, its form more streamlined than the average bear. The head was strong, broad, but the snout was sleek. Ears pinned back, and eyes faced forward. The thick muscular tail was the biggest clue that this was a unique creature.

A true apex predator, both land and sea adaptations, and if I had to guess it had a form of sonar. The genetic incompatibilities between whatever parent species seemed to have been remedied in some unique way. It fascinated me, encouraging a raw, powerful, curiosity. 

Yet, something else, it was just past the tree line. It flickered in and out of frame, a deep, rich black that would have blended in with the forest if not for its glimmering, slimy, sheen. I immediately chalked it up to a bug in the enhancement AI. Still, I laid my elbow on the desk, hand to my temple, brow furrowed as I pressed ‘enlarge’ and rewound the log. Normally, I would have ignored something so trivial, but the possibility of a second discovery lured me in like a fish to water.

That, and the storm had begun to call. The wind picked up, scratching at the walls, searching for a way inside. I wouldn’t be leaving this room for quite some time. 

Just as I was nearing the unidentified footage, the program buffered, then promptly crashed.

I placed my hand to my head, palm rubbing my eyes. I had just realized how long it had been since I last blinked.

A deep sigh left me as I leaned back in my chair. The screen had gone black, save for a faint reflection of myself, illuminated by the dim emergency light overhead. For a few seconds, I just stared—half at my own tired expression, half at the void where the footage had once been.

Then, the monitor flickered.

A soft click. Then another. The system whirred back to life, but something was wrong. The playback window reopened on its own, skipping ahead. Lines of corrupted data scrolled past like something was sifting through it faster than I could follow. My fingers tensed over the keyboard.

I hadn’t touched anything.

Another flicker. Then, the screen stabilized.

The footage had changed

it was as if time itself had stopped to gape at what I was looking at. I took a sharp breath, and for a moment, it felt harsher than if I had thrown myself into the midst of the storm beyond my door. 

AI glitches are supposed to resolve themselves after reanalyzing the affected frames. There was no glitch of the system. When I replayed the footage, I bore witness to what now clearly appeared to be the thin limb of a creature that dwarfed even the animals beside it. But something else had changed.

The flickering stopped.

I was certain, the line, well limb, in the distance had been perfectly straight yet it’s shown … bent. Impossible, I thought. I rewound the footage again. No. I was sure of it. It had definitely moved. My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer, and even with the conditions threatening to pull the roof off my head, the only sound in that room was my own pounding heartbeat.

And then, any resolve I may have had dispersed. A misshapen head glared back at me from the screen. No, a moose skull, charred and melted. My eyes darted back and forth between, its head, its legs, how it began lowering itself to peer at me. 

The walls of the cabin groaned under the storm’s relentless assault. The wind howled through unseen gaps, rattling whatever was not tied down, sending them toppling one by one. And somewhere in the madness, my heart joined the chaos, hammering in time with the storm.

The footage became more convoluted; my head thundered with every second I kept my eyes pressed on the screen. My eyes began to twitch, and my agape mouth rattled back and forth. It felt as if my body was a generator, my capacitors ravaged by a surge too powerful. 

A flash of light illuminated the room, driving  out any wayward shadows. I was there in that moment for eternity. My eyes peeled open by an unseen force. The white expanse was unnatural, it was too bright. I felt as if I was looking straight into the sun, but there was no warmth. Only cold. 

Then in an instant, my monitor cracked, and my glasses flung to the ground. A mesmerizing display of light lit up the room as the rays danced off the glass shards. In a daze, I was on the floor, gasping for air, my vision covered by blanching spots. I was left with no memory of the past hour and a dying urge to return back to that thicket. 

A primal, raw, maddening call no man could dream of refusing. 

I arose into a seating position, one knee up and one down, and gasped at the chaos that surrounded me. The panel on the monitor was completely destroyed, and its remains circled me— along with those of my glasses. Cupboards flung open, dishes strewn across the room. The plant above my bed seemed to have exploded, with its former inhabitants caking my mattress. I shook my head, gazing at the fridge door which was hanging on by a twisted scrap of metal. 

What the hell happened here? I had asked no one in particular. I looked at the monitor in front of me, squinting my eyes. For the life of me I could not recall what I had just been doing, or where I was for that matter. It was not exactly forgotten, I could feel the emptiness which my memories were supposed to fill. It was as if they were stolen, and there was an imprint left in their wake. 

I blinked.

Everything was back in order.

The cupboards closed, my monitor whole. The fridge steadily humming, door shut as if it had never been disturbed. The plant above hung lazily, lush and thriving. 

I sucked in a breath, my pulse started pounding again. The air had gotten tight, each rise of my chest harder than the last. 

The details of my setting blurred, and merged together. Fine lines dissipated as colours bled into one another. 

My eyes strained trying to keep track of the shapes' choreography, before I squeezed them shut. 

I wanted to curl into a ball and scream until I had no throat left to do so. The hum of the fridge grew louder, sharper, until it became a loud whistle shrieking overhead. 

My eyes shot open, and began darting around. 

My surroundings began to solidify, I recognized the dim concrete, a faint red glow all around. it felt so familiar to me, but for the life of me I couldn’t imagine why.

The air felt no less suffocating than if I were drowning. The room— no, the walls, the men in white coats, everything was wrong. 

They sat hunched at rows of box computers lining the walls. Their fingers punched the keys urgently, dots of sweat beading on their foreheads. Each wore a pistol strapped to their chest, but knowing these gear heads they weren’t using it for offensive. Just for a way out. 

I blinked again. Hadn’t I just been somewhere else? 

Yes, that’s right. 

I had thrown up in the bin just 15 minutes ago. Spent the next 15 cleaning any remains off my uniform. The tan and green kept my secret safe. I recall looking to my chest, the 3 pointed stars a reminder that any sign of weakness can be the whole platoon's downfall.  

A second whistle cut through the air. 

Red lights now pulsed powerfully overhead, flashing against the barren concrete walls. 

I braced for impact, grabbing hold of a chair with my left and desk with my right. 

An explosion sounded out in the distance, rattling the dust in the bunker. it had just missed us. 

A thin man ran to me, whose oversized helmet banged around his pinhead. I could see the wisps of blond hair cut short, betraying the confines of his headgear. 

“General, we need to retreat from the eastern front,” he stammered out, the bunch of papers he held falling as he spoke, “it’s imperative that—“ 

“Not another word Jenkins,” I barked, “how can we afford losing our advantage?” 

My vision sharpened, the haze lifted as the spell melted away. The air grew lighter, the bunker quieter. How dare this lackey, Jenkins, mean to tell me how to win a war? I’d fought my way into this world, and by god, would I be willing to leave the same way. 

“Sir, how can we afford not to?” 

I closed the distance between us, my eyes burning into his. I jabbed my finger into his chest as I spoke, my voice low and dangerous. 

Then I paused, taking a puff of my cigar for dramatic effect. I leaned back in my leather chair, drumming my fingers on the polished wood of my desk. My colleague, Tom, sat across from me, mouth slightly agape, hanging on every word. 

“Well, what’d he say?” Tom asked me, his brown suit crinkled as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees. A half empty glass of whisky caught the light of the June sun. 

“Ah, I hadn’t gone that far yet,” I said, glancing around my office. The rotary phone next to a stack of papers, faint hum of the typewriters being worked in the next room— it all felt so mundane opposed to the war time narrative I recounted to Tom. 

“Don’t just stop there,” Tom said with a smile, “I smell a best seller coming from you, pal” 

I stood up and turned away from Tom, taking in the large green plant in the corner of the office. The tiger carpet, which had cost a pretty penny, lay lazily gazing at my mahogany doors, their gold finish catching the sunlight.

Striding over to the large glass windows adjacent to my desk, I clasped my hands behind my back. The city sprawled below, bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. Dust motes danced in the light, normally unseen but now illuminated like tiny stars. A Presley song played softly in the background, its melody at odds with the unease creeping into my chest.

I turned my head slightly. “Tom, you never did tell me why you have a moose’s skull for a head” 

Tom leaned back into his chair, fingertips touching. There was nothing behind the charred bone— but I could tell he was burning a hole into my back. 

The eye socket partially melted, like glass pulled too soon from a furnace. A sickly sheen coated the head, as if routinely dipped in oil. 

I stared back at him, his jaw rattled as his head tilted slightly, as if to raise an eyebrow.  

A soft chuckle, before he spoke, “what are you talking about buddy?” 

The warm glow of the office was gone, the music faded, and I sighed as I was no longer immersed in my recollection. The therapist’s concerned eyes met mine, her pen poised over her notepad. “And how often do you have this dream?” She said gently. 

“I dunno, maybe once a week? I always tell some different story.” I said, looking up from my vantage point on the therapist's lounge chair. 

“So tell me”, she leaned forward, gaze steady, “how does this dream make you feel?” 

I hesitated, the image of the skull flashing in my mind. “Feels like I’ve been lying to myself,” I said finally, “You know what I mean, like I’ve been ignoring something so obvious, staring me right in the face” 

“It’s interesting you say that,” with a soft tone, quite mother-like, “ if you don’t mind me asking, what would you say is your biggest fear?” 

“Well, truthfully, losing control of who I am, my personal compass, it terrifies me, really.”

The therapist began dotting something down in her notebook. I took a moment to scan the office, a habit I’d picked up. The lounge chair beneath me was familiar as ever, and across a small coffee table sat my therapist, in a recliner. I turned my head, glancing over my shoulder at the large window behind me, where the second story view overlooked a bustling downtown street. A few feet away, a bookshelf stood beside a bamboo tree.

Even though I never read the books, nor the titles, their presence made me feel welcomed. As if to say, you are grounded, their colours touching a spot of comfort in my mind. The midday light caught the leaves of the bamboo. I sat staring at them, analyzing the plant’s intricacies. 

“Mr. Hansen?”

I glanced up quickly, “Ah sorry,” I said, embarrassed. “What was the question?” 

“I want you to look at a few images and tell me how they make you feel,” she peered at from behind her glasses, “can you do that for me?”

On the table, she had laid out a series of printed black shapes that could be interpreted this way or that. I picked up the stack, and started to make out the first one. 

“Uh,” I furrowed my brow, “I see a couple” 

“Hmm, interesting.” She wrote a quick note, “keep going and I’ll write what you say” 

“A person- no, a group running.” I set the page on the coffee table atop the previous. 

“A man crying out, his hand, I think, is raised?” 

“I- oh, oh man.” 

My chest conscripted, I tried to make a sound but to no avail. This time, I wasn’t guessing. I knew this shape, and very well at that. 

“Is something the matter Mr. Hansen?” 

“No, it’s uh, just that”, I trailed off, the papers falling from my hand. 

I recoiled back on the lounge, like a scared animal. My heart threatening to pound through my rib cage, mouth hanging agape. 

“Mr Hansen,” 

the sound of bones clicking after each word.

“Get control of yourself.” 

The lifeless sockets tore into me. I couldn’t bear to look for longer than a few seconds, yet I could describe the features as if I marbled them in stone. 

The face of my tormentor. Just a glance and its grip grasped my lungs. My attempts at breathing were futile. 

The bookshelf, had it always looked so dilapidated? Was the dressing of mold, the black rot of the bamboo stem, ever so present? 

My eyes winded, as if forcing me to take in my surroundings.

“Stay back,” I commanded, though my voice betraying my words. 

“I swear to you,” it was more pleaded than threatened, “stay.. stay back” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME.” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME,” the man repeated. 

I groaned, and b-lined for the living room. My half chopped carrots kept vigilant in my wake. 

I stood in front of the television watching the scene play out a little longer, then I changed the channel. 

Reruns of cheesy horror dramas are all they play these days. 

A hop and a whistle and I was back to preparing dinner. Now, what would Linda like  in a soup? Does rice work in a soup? 

To not keep the carrots waiting any longer, I got back to work, making a mental note to fully flesh out my recipe. 

Chip, chip, chip. 

A quite therapeutic sound, it brought me back to when I was a lad.

My mother loved the kitchen, even devising a cookbook of her own. She made an effort to always hand it out at every neighbourhood function. It was truly an example of her determination, I recall many times she invited friends for tea— just to hand out that damn book. 

Shaking me out of my daydream, a fat blob of red stained deep in the hem of my white shirt caught my eye. I held my arm out and stared for a moment. 

Did I knick a vein? No, that wasn’t my blood. Well, no bother, I’m not hurt, but this shirt might be done for. A quick wash under cold water and I was finishing up with my carrots. 

She might like some beef, that woman is half carnivore I swear. 

Or, I could ditch the soup, go full on fried rice. Although, we did eat at that Asian place just last week. Anywho, I’d have to decide by the time I finish cutting the onions. 

I set the carrots aside and picked out an onion from the fridge. A second mental note was made to add onions to the shopping list; I had just picked out the last one. 

“So, ya’ve gather’d your boys here to g’wan with my treasure, have ya?,” the television blared out lines from an old western. 

I gave a few curious glances at the action, a tense drawing of pistols, and a gunfight ensued.  

As I returned to my task, I took note of the knife. Heavier than before. The onions, soft. Too soft, and supple. 

For some reason, I felt a chill raise its way up to my nape; I grew acutely aware of the beating California sun shining on my forehead through the window overhead the counter.  

Was my hand shaking? “Get a hold of yourself man,” I spoke out loud. 

I cracked the window, this heat must be making me delirious. 

The breeze hit like a crashing wave to a beach shore. I could hear the neighbourhood kids yelling. I smiled, oh to be young. 

Shunk, shunk, shunk. 

The onions were chopped in halves, then in strips.  

Again, I managed to become distracted by the tv. There was an actor, whose face of abject terror was discernible even in my peripherals.  

I stood inquisitively, turning to face the screen. I get the sense I worked with that fellow, but just where? 

As I tried to recall, the chill creeped up on me again, as if to let me guard down. I shook my head, and, partly to distract myself, continued the chopping. 

Thunnk, thunnk, thunnk

Without exactly knowing why, I began to cut the onions with more passion. I felt, almost a sense of rage begin to bubble, my hands felt clammy. I began to dive the knife harder into the cutting board. 

It no longer felt like I was cutting onions, nor was it in the kitchen. 

Thunk, Thunk, Thunk.

Shadows began to feel longer, the lights a little dimmer. Yet, all the same, I felt like a puppet, my hands moving of its own accord. 

Thunk…. Thunk.

At times I didn’t even realize it was moving at all, I had intense focus only on what was in front of me. 

My knuckles grew white as I gripped the handle tighter; my breath became ragged. 

My attention was solely on the board, each stroke my blade slid more powerful than the other, all the while— CRACK. 

“Ah, brother,” I said exasperated. I had cut a deep indent in the cutting board, which pulled me out of my stupor. 

I breathed heavily, could I be having a stroke? A sick unease washed over me. Without a moment's notice, I grabbed a rag and thrust it under the cold of the sink. I put it overtop my forehead and made way for the dining room chair, knife in hand. 

I had to get out of the sun. 

“Are you going to still live in ignorance?,” the television blared before I had the chance to sit. 

My interest piqued, I turned my head. It was that actor from before, yet this time in a white lab coat. An infomercial was playing. 

Seeing him twice raised my spirits, I cracked a smile. Albeit, tainted by the lethargy that seemed to infect deep into my body. What could be the chances he’s shown in a time slot back to back. 

“You can’t keep chopping away forever,” the actor grinned. A gleaming smile so bright you could light a room with it. 

“How long do you want to live in your fantasy world ignoring everything you’ve done?” 

The children playing, the birds chirping, the dripping of the tap I never bothered to tighten. All ceased as a close up of the man seemed to encapsulate me into keeping my eyes locked forwards. 

It was as if he turned directly at me. As I titled my head slightly, I could swear his eyes tracked. 

“And what of our families? Who let you become executioner of the innocent?”

Then the sound of applause and laughter began to fade in, ushering out the silence. 

Hot iron passed into my veins. 

I felt my chest struggle against a crushing weight. 

I slowly peeled my head off the screen, whatever else the man was saying a blur. 

I ran to the cutting board in an attempt to regain normalcy, to no avail. 

The feverish cuts synchronized with the sound of glasses clinking. 

My crisp suit began tugging at the seams, with every powerful thrust of my blade. 

Tears began welling in my blood shot eyes. Any confidence left had finally dissipated, evident of shaking breath 

In a desperate attempt to keep myself grounded, I prepared a powerful swing of the blade. 

I pulled my hand back, intended a slam of the blade with everything I had in me. 

But— 

There was no knife. 

Instead, my champagne glass sailed to the ground, shattering on the ballroom floor. 

The music didn’t stop, nor did the laughter waver. 

Although, a whale-like man turned to face me, jowls trembling with rage. A dark stain now present where my drink had caught him.

“Composure, man! You ought to learn it” he huffed, a thick, gruff voice from under a bellowing moustache. The fat on his neck shook ever so slightly as he spoke. 

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered, “I seem to have lost control of myself.” 

He left with an astound “harrumph” and turned away into a mess of people. 

I took in my surrounds, shimmering balls reflecting off crystalline dresses. A mess of fur scarves, tailed suits and men with a skewed sense of importance. A fat air of sophistication hung over the crowd. 

My hands were still trying to grip a phantom knife when a woman touched my shoulder. 

“I see you stuck to your usual dramatic introductions, dear” a voice teased. 

I turn, a sly mood overcame me, though I was unsure why. 

The woman wore a flowing, obsidian gown, The diamonds at her throat seemed to ripple and move along with the light of the crowd. 

“I took it you were going to make me find you” she laughed, stepping closer. 

A heavy scent of lavender, and something metallic, accompanied her. 

I must know her, of course, but the name my lips searched for was nowhere to be found. 

“You were always good at making a scene,” she smiled knowingly, as if we shared some unspoken secret. 

My hand twitched, there was no knife, yet my fingers curled as if they grasped a handle.

I let my gaze wander, a subtle attempt to jog my memory.

It’s when I noticed— everything was too perfect. 

They danced in unison, movements seamless, like they practiced this a hundred times over. 

Yet, when they laughed, mouths moved, faces contorted, but the sound came moments later. 

The glow of the chandeliers too bright, as if to drown out fine details, not illuminate.

Why did every man have the same smooth skin, every woman an hourglass figure.  

Why did the air tug at my throat, like a turtleneck one size too little? 

She touched my cheek, fingers softer than the feathers. She guided my face to hers.

“But tell me,” she whispered, brushing her nails on my chin “did you enjoy the show” 

My stomach jumped. 

“..what?” 

The music warped, the elegant waltz lurched, now jumped from one tune to the next. 

The dancers didn’t stop, they jerked in painful movements to the new beat. 

Why couldn’t I remember the woman’s name?

Why was I here? 

What was my name? 

Who.

Am.

I?

A breath. 

A twitch. 

A snap. 

I lunged. 

The moment my first collided with her face, it was not flesh, nor bone, but painted ceramic that shattered on impact. 

Beneath? 

Hollow. 

Panic took hold of me. I began lashing out at the guests. 

legs, torsos, all to the same effect, all cracking and splintering revealing nothing underneath. 

Not one person turned to address the commotion, even the ones smashed in half. 

Simply keep laughing and dancing. 

I fell to my knees and raised my hands to the sky, tears rolling into my gaping mouth. 

In the flash of the waiter's belt, I caught my own reflection. 

A man grinned back at me— wide eyes crazed with desire, a flush smile too wide for his face. 

It was me. 

And it wasn’t. 

The scene all around me spun, as if I were caught in a tornado. Everything blurred together, and details crashed into me, sharp and sudden, like a head on collision. 

Distant screams pierced through my head as I struggled to make sense of what was in front of me. 

I shut my eyes tight, knowing it was no true protection against the cruelty of the outside. Then— drip. It was soft at first, barely a whisper. 

Despite the chill creeping into my bones, I smiled. 

It was just a bad trip, nothing more nothing less. An adverse reaction to some frozen airborne deliriant I must have inhaled. 

That had to be it. I was back in my dorm, and absently-minded-me forgot to tighten the sink again! 

But no matter how hard I tried, the cruel mistress of reality had other plans. I could not deny the feeling of snow, as I kneeled down on the ground.  

I finally mustered the courage to peel my eyes open. I was instantly aware of the frostbite gnawing at my fingers, the cold seeping deep into my bones. What I saw next was worse than any injury, My hands were dressed in a cruel glove of blood. The crimson was too real, there was no denying it. 

I wiped myself off and clambered to my feet. Just behind me, the door to the main faculty lay open. A faulty component let off sparks. Inside was dark– though the sun, bleeding through the jagged frame, betrayed any notion of serenity. 

My knees buckled as I made my way towards nowhere in particular. The wind whipped around me, a symphony of my misery. 

I had no direction, nor a plan. The open room seemed as good as any. 

I took a few steps, then under my boot a squelch. 

I looked down to see a beady eye, dislocated from its owner, gazing at me accusingly. 

With muted acceptance, I lifted my leg, shaking off what had once been a man’s face.

Out of habit, I dragged myself to a powerswitch.

For a few moments, the fluorescents burned my corneas. As things stabilized I lay witness to the full, grotesque splendor– my massacre. 

The dorm was in utter ruin, tables and chairs pushed aside in a mad frenzy, clearing the space for the real spectacle.

The conglomerate of the research team, those accompanying me, had been arranged in a stiff, unnatural display, their bodies forced into grotesque vaudeville poses. Their muscles, pulled taut into exaggerated smiles, were stitched in place by sharpened molars and jagged shards of bone. Those not propped up, presumably their pieces repurposed for the set, laid scattered around the would be theatre crew. 

At the center of it all, the man, the one who had spoken to me in my daze, stood grinning. His own peeled-off face dangled from his fingers like a discarded mask. His other hand, gripping a blood-slicked blade, pointed toward the wall behind him.

It was not a question that it was intended for my eyes. I lurched forward, past the twisted remains of my coworkers. I was waiting for one to move, pat me on the back, tell me “Hey, buddy, we wouldn't have done much better in your shoes.”

No respite came. There would be no salvation. 

On what used to be the tray collection table lay a pile of photographs—every photograph from the facility’s records.

Each had been replaced with a picture of me— and the charred skull of a moose.In each, I was the central figure. My face inserted seamlessly into group photos, with everyone else replaced by the blackened skeleton. There was a wedding photo with me standing in place of the groom, the bride now a skeletal husk. The edits were flawless, as if I had always belonged in those frames.

I picked up one particular frame, and laughed. 

It was a harsh, strangled sound at first, then built up to a maddening roar. 

I turned my back slowly to the frigid metal behind me, and sank slowly to the floor.

I began to sob, laughing all the while

The most vicious thing winter’s mistress– No. that damned creature, had done was leaving me alive to witness my massacre, not killing me in ignorance. Maybe I should do it myself after I put down the pen.

“*I intend to detail this log as a last service to the company and to humanity, so this mission is not clouded in secrecy, speculated on, then green lit once more for  fresh victims to embark on.*”

I concluded, having detailed everything I could on some wayward tablet which I had clearance for, before tossing it aside.

With a sigh, I realized my mask of temperance had begun to slip. I was going to come to terms with myself, whether I liked it or not. 

I rubbed my thumb over the frame I had grabbed. 

“Don’t keep your mother worrying! My fav picture of you ;) XOXOXO!” 

My tears fell over the childhood photo, of who I would never know, as my face had been plastered over his.

1ii5181,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ii5181/assault_charge/,Assault charge," I was a carer, looking after a young man in his family home, he's non verbal amongst, being autistic and having a growth defect where he's incredibly small and unable to walk, he could roll or bunny hop on the floor, I absolutely adore him and treated him like my own little brother.

HIs family knew this and wanted me working 80+ hours a week as they could trust me. 

The issue is, his mum and dad are very vindictive people, they'll do anything to fuck people over. They just want to drag everyone down. I went through a lot of shit with them, for example I was losing weight for a photoshoot going from 110kg to 70kg. For the entire time, bare in mind I was doing 80+ hours a week, I had them constantly making jokes about calories, my weight or purposely offering me food knowing I couldn't eat it. 

I fully get this example isn't the best examples of the type of people they are but that's really not important.
They'd constant question me where I am on my time off, would refuse holidays as they couldn't cope without me and if I called them to see if everything was ok they'd accuse of calling to hand my notice in. 

So after a while of all the crap I was getting and goal posts being moved in how we need to do the job, my mind was all over the place and I was frustrated, coupled with the fact their son was so attached to me I couldn't leave his living room to go toilet or make a coffee without him causing harm to himself by grabbing at himself and pulling gastro tube out.

This went on for a year and half and I was trying to tell his mum about this to her telling me to figure it out. He would even create if I sat on sofa, which one day I managed to get him to accept me sitting on the sofa while he played with livingroom door, she came in and told him to tell me off because I wasn't allowed to be sitting down. 

Slowly over the next year and half my frustrations grew and grew, they would play on this. His mum said to me one day that my performances had dropped, despite the fact I got care plans sorted, health and safety sorted, got their son doing things he hadn't before and being there all them hours and being the one they can rely upon to even going on holidays. 

So one day I'm in the kitchen making a coffee and their son is creating a lot of fuss, I've said fuck sakes to myself, walked to the living room to comfort him, he starts creating again and I've slapped my thighs to distract him but also because I'm so frustrated and I'm tired. His mum, who was out shopping at the time, came home, went to her office, called in another carer, came into the house together and she went off on me accusing me of slapping their son. I was absolutely shocked as I couldn't believe she would think this of me.

I was dismissed, I walked home which I lived 5 minutes walk from theirs the other carer turned up and said that if I ask to go back, go to therapy then his mum would accept me back. This was all confusing to me.

I messaged his mum and asked to go back which was accepted, was told I'm no longer trusted and needs to build it back up but then I'm left alone with their son and even asked to come in on overtime so they can go to a BBQ. 

A week later I go to a festival with a mate who said to me to come down to where he lives to restart, which I decided to do. 

Once I was back, I stayed working there for a couple of weeks but things just weren't the same, so one day I phoned my clients mum to hand notice in, she weren't happy and a day later I had an email to say I was sacked. 

I moved to where my mate lives and got on with my life, then I had a police officer call to say ive been alleged to have beaten my client and to speak to police where I was. 

I was arrested, held in holding cells for 6 hours, questioned and then put on bail to have a magistrates court case. 

I went to court and there was no concrete evidence against me, just the audio, the police even rejected a picture they had submitted where their son had marks on his head, due to it being created by them.

So, you’re stuck in a job that no longer excites you. Maybe you’re daydreaming about a career in a completely different field, but the thought of going back to school full-time (and taking a financial hit) stops you in your tracks. Sound familiar? Thanks to the rise of [online degrees](https://www.learningroutes.in/), making a career shift has never been more straightforward or practical.

Gone are the days when switching careers meant quitting your job, moving to a different city, or draining your savings to afford tuition. Today, online degrees offer flexibility, affordability, and access to world-class education right from your living room (or your favourite coffee shop, if that’s more your vibe). Whether you’re a marketing executive looking to dive into data science or a teacher eyeing a transition into UX design, online degrees can help you bridge the gap without disrupting your life.

Let’s dive into how online degrees are changing the game for professionals looking to transition careers seamlessly.

# 1. Flexibility That Works Around Your Life

Time is a significant factor in professionals' hesitation to change careers. Who can afford to give away everything and go back to school full-time? This issue is resolved by online degrees, which let you study at your speed. Since most programs allow for asynchronous learning, you can access lectures and assignments at any time that works for you.

Imagine working your 9-to-5 and then logging in for a night class or using your lunch break to knock out an assignment. Whether you’re a parent, a busy executive, or juggling multiple responsibilities, online degrees let you learn on your terms.

# Fun Fact:

A 2021 survey by Wiley Education Services found that **91% of online students work full- or part-time**, proving that career transitions through online education are designed for real-world schedules.

# 2. Cost-Effective Learning Without the Debt

The cost of traditional education is high; let's face it. In the United States, the average annual cost of tuition for a master's degree at a private university can surpass $30,000. You can see why many professionals are going the virtual route when you contrast that with online schools, where tuition is frequently much lower.

Online degrees also help you save in other ways:

* No commuting costs
* There is no need to relocate to a different city
* Digital course materials replacing pricey textbooks

Some employers even offer tuition reimbursement for online programs, meaning you could level up your skills without spending a dime!

# Quick Stat:

According to the Education Data Initiative, the **average cost of an online degree is about 50% lower** than that of a traditional on-campus program.

# 3. Access to High-Quality Programs from Top Universities

Once upon a time, online degrees weren’t taken as seriously. But today, prestigious universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford offer online courses and degree programs. Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity have partnered with top institutions to bring high-quality education to students worldwide.

You don’t have to uproot your life to access elite education. Do you want an Ivy League credential on your resume? Online programs make that possible without the stress of moving to another state or country.

# Interesting Insight:

A 2022 LinkedIn report found that **employers increasingly recognise online degrees as legitimate credentials, especially in IT, business, and healthcare fields.**

# 4. Learn Job-Relevant Skills That Align with Market Demands

Traditional education often takes years to update its curriculum, but online programs are built to evolve quickly. This is crucial for career changers because industries are constantly shifting. Online degrees focus on **job-ready skills** that help professionals transition seamlessly into new fields.

For example:

* A software engineering boot camp will teach you coding languages like Python and JavaScript, which are in high demand.
* A digital marketing certification can help you master SEO, social media advertising, and Google Analytics in a matter of months.
* A business analytics course can equip you with data visualisation, SQL, and predictive modelling skills, making you competitive in the job market.

By graduating from an online program, you’ll have **up-to-date skills** directly applicable to your target industry.

# 5. Networking and Career Support: It’s Not Just About the Degree

One concern many professionals have about online education is networking. “How do I build industry connections if I’m not physically in a classroom?” Well, online degree programs have adapted beautifully to this challenge.

Many programs offer:

* **Virtual networking events** where you can meet peers and industry experts
* **Mentorship opportunities** with professionals in your target field
* **Career services and job placement assistance** to help you land your first role in your new industry

Platforms like LinkedIn also make connecting with fellow students and professors easy, ensuring that you build meaningful relationships despite the virtual setting.

# 6. A Confidence Boost Like No Other

Career transitions can be daunting. It’s easy to feel like an imposter when stepping into a new industry. But earning a degree in your chosen field gives you **legitimacy and confidence**.

Think about it—would you feel more prepared to switch from finance to cybersecurity if you had a degree from a respected institution to back up your skills? Of course!

Online degrees provide the knowledge and validation that you’re qualified for the role you’re pursuing. Employers see it, and more importantly, *you* feel it.

# Final Thought:

A 2023 study by the University of Phoenix found that **82% of professionals who completed online degrees felt more confident about their career prospects.** Confidence is a game-changer when you’re switching industries!

# Wrapping It Up

If you’re considering changing careers, online degrees offer an efficient, flexible, and cost-effective way to transition smoothly. With world-class education at your fingertips, a curriculum that evolves with industry trends, and networking opportunities that keep you connected, there’s never been a better time to leap.

So, what’s stopping you? Whether it’s tech, business, healthcare, or the arts, an online program can help you rewrite your career story. And the best part? You get to do it *your way*.

Ready to switch things up? Your future career is just a few clicks away.

1ii4x8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineReset/comments/1ii4x8i/is_coffee_bad_for_your_dopamine_levels/,Is coffee bad for your dopamine levels?,"Most people drink coffee for **energy, focus, and productivity**, but few realize how much it affects **dopamine regulation**. So, is coffee actually **bad** for dopamine, or is this just another health myth?

# The short answer: it depends

Caffeine **increases dopamine signaling**, making you feel alert and motivated, but there’s a catch. It doesn’t actually **increase dopamine production**, it just **amplifies the effects of existing dopamine**. Over time, this can **lead to dependency and burnout.**

# How coffee affects dopamine

**☕ Short-term boost:** caffeine blocks adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired, and increases dopamine receptor sensitivity. This gives you a temporary energy and focus boost.  
**📉 Long-term dependence:** regular caffeine use reduces baseline dopamine sensitivity, meaning you need more coffee to feel the same effect over time.  
**😵 Withdrawal effects:** when you quit caffeine, your dopamine system temporarily crashes, leading to brain fog, low motivation, and fatigue.

# Is coffee ruining your dopamine?

🚫 **Yes, if…**

* You **can’t function without caffeine** and need multiple cups to feel normal.
* You feel **burnt out, anxious, or restless** from overuse.
* You crash **hard in the afternoon** and need more caffeine to compensate.

✅ **No, if…**

* You drink **1-2 cups per day** and don’t feel dependent on it.
* You **cycle off caffeine occasionally** to reset your tolerance.
* You **don’t use coffee as a crutch** to replace sleep and good habits.

# How to fix caffeine-induced dopamine burnout

⏳ **Take a caffeine break**: 3-7 days without coffee can reset dopamine sensitivity and lower dependency.  
📉 **Reduce intake gradually**: quitting cold turkey = headaches and brain fog. Cut back slowly instead.  
🛌 **Fix your sleep**: no amount of caffeine can replace real rest.  
🏋️ **Exercise instead of relying on coffee**: physical activity gives a natural dopamine boost without the crash.  
🥩 **Support dopamine with real nutrients**: eat protein, omega-3s, and magnesium to keep your brain balanced.

Caffeine isn’t **evil**, but if you rely on it just to feel normal, **your dopamine system is probably out of balance.**",1,1738741300.0,DopamineReset,1,1.0,False

It had been a week since I had been attacked by Jeff, and that cold feeling still hadn't left me. I returned home after Jeff's attack, hoping that the chill was temporary, but it lingered. I tried to go to the doctor, but they could not find anything wrong with me, at least physically speaking. I ended up moving back in with my parents, and isolated myself in the room where I was sleeping most of the time. I barely emerged to eat, unable to bear making small talk. The only time I left the house for nearly a week after was when I was forced to.

I had spent most of another day sitting in the room with the bare walls and blackout curtains, keeping those drawn tightly. I hadn't made or received any phone calls since the attack and decided I would break that streak. I called Terry, but he didn't answer which I kind of expected. I was legitimately surprised when he returned my call an hour later. I decided to answer after a few rings.

“Hello?” I said, voice quiet and emotionless.

“How are you doing?” my former husband asked, foregoing the usual pleasantries.

“Not very well. That weird, cold feeling has gotten worse.” I admitted.

“Have you went to the hospital?” he pressed, but something about the question seemed insincere.

I hesitated to answer.

“I have, but they didn't find anything wrong with me.” I replied.

“That's a relief.” I actually believed that statement.

We talked a little longer, but neither of us mentioned trying to meet up again that time. I went to bed early and woke before dawn, sweating but shivering beneath the heavy quilt I was covered with. I sat up, and moved toward the window, convinced that it had been opened somehow. It was still closed securely, but once I was out from under the covers my temperature seemed to drop even more. The shivering got to the point that my bones ached and my jaw clenched. I grabbed the blanket from the bed and wrapped it around myself, sinking to the floor.

I rubbed at my exposed biceps and forearms until the shaking slowed down again. I kept myself wrapped up even as I left my room, moving toward the thermostat in the hallway. According to the gauge, the house was a pleasant seventy degrees. That didn't jive with the way I felt, and I considered driving myself to the Emergency Room, but the way I was shaking deterred me. I ended up calling my father's cellphone. He rushed home and quickly collected me, walking into the ER with me when we arrived.

I was quickly triaged, leaving my father in the waiting room, and put in a room away from everyone else. They even brought me a heater and warm blankets. The doctor entered, smiling over the top of the clipboard he was holding in his hands.

“Hey, so what's going on today?” he asked, even though I knew he had just looked at the notes.

I explained everything to the man, the attack, and this feeling that had followed. He nodded along and raised his eyebrow when I told him about the wound. After I finished speaking, he stood and claimed a pair of rubber gloves and a mask.

“Remove your shirt, I want to take a look at the wound you were talking about.” he told me, opening a drawer, extracting a few tools and cotton swabs from their rightful places.

I did as I was told, the shaking growing worse as he approached me. I reached out and pulled the heater closer to me even as he stooped down to take a look at my shoulder. He prodded at it with the tip of the swab and I inhaled sharply.

“What did you say bit you?” he asked.

“A dog.” I lied, as I had upon my first visit.

“Are you sure? Because these look a little odd for a canine bite.” he said, poking at the sore area again, this time with a metal instrument.

I flinched and leaned backward after a second of contact.

“I'm afraid that looks to be getting infected.” he told me, nodding toward my chest as he stood up.

“So what does that mean?” I asked, hoping I wouldn't have to stay.

“I'm going to give you some medicine, and I want you to follow up with me in five days if it doesn't improve.” he ordered, then he left the room, returning moments later with two small slips of paper.

I had to borrow the money from my parents to pay for the antibiotics and pain pills. The shivering continued even when I was back in my own bed, under a pile of blankets. My father picked the pills up on his way home from work, and I forced myself to go down and sit at the table with them, taking the drugs along with the meal my mother had cooked. I went to bed pretty much immediately after, not even bothering to shower that night. I didn't have any trouble falling asleep. Once I did, I had a dream that I was swimming in a dark ocean.

It was not an unpleasant experience as I dove beneath waves that rose above my head. That was, until I felt myself getting swept up in the undertow. It pulled me down into the depths, and as I sank, I began to panic within the dream. Somehow, I broke free and began swimming for the surface. When I surfaced, I snapped awake. My shoulder ached and stung, the pain increasing each time my heart would beat. I stood and walked to the bathroom, a dizzy spell hitting me in mid-step, sending me reeling into the wall to my left.

I stood there, sweating and leaning into the cold plaster for what seemed like minutes until I was stable enough to continue to the bathroom. I stood in front of the sink and did not like what I saw staring back at me. I was pale, my face beginning to look hollow and pale. My forehead seemed larger than before, almost protruding from my skin, which seemed stretched far too tightly over my skull. My lips were chapped and slightly swollen. I pulled the sweat-soaked t-shirt up over my head, exposing the wound to the air and harsh lighting.

That sent a fresh burst of pain through my shoulder and the upper part of my chest. I felt my head spin again and reached out with my good arm to steady myself on the sink, my eyes clenched tightly closed as I willed myself to stay conscious.

“Are you okay?” my father's voice came from somewhere beyond the spiraling darkness that I found myself in.

I tried to open my mouth to speak, but could only cough. Each spasm of my chest made the pain worse and my dizziness became almost unbearable. I began to fall, but couldn't stop myself, and barely remember my father opening the door and rushing inside. I woke in the hospital, feeling much better than I had before. My mother and father were sitting at my bedside, sleeping with their heads leaned back against the wall. My stomach rumbled and cramped. The noise was so loud that it woke my mother.

She smiled when she saw my eyes open and stood, moving to my bedside, pressing the button to call the nurse for me. I found that my wrists were bound in soft restraints, as were my ankles.

“Why am I tied up?” I asked, still kind of sleepy. I suspected they had given me something to help me rest.

“It was for your own safety. You had some kind of seizure and they worried that if it happened again you might hit yourself or someone else.” she informed me quietly.

When the nurse entered the room she stepped up next to my bed on the opposite side, jotting down the readings on the machine that measured my vital signs before turning her attention to me. My mom returned to her seat and remained quiet.

“If you feel like you're okay, we can remove the restraints.” she informed me rather than giving any kind of greeting.

I nodded my head.

“I feel fine. Just a little sleepy, and maybe hungry, too.” I replied. The woman gave me a little smile, and nodded her head.

“The sleepiness is because of the anti-seizure medication most likely. I will see about getting you something to eat in a little bit.” she told me before leaving the room.

I tried to lay back and relax hoping that if nothing else the woman who had given me life would go back to sleep if I couldn't. She didn't. Instead she resumed fussing around me until the nurse returned with a small sheet of paper with my meal choices on it. I opted for oatmeal and fresh fruit and a cup of jello. I ate with real gusto and started to feel more awake and aware after filling my stomach. I was even allowed to get out of the bed and take a walk through the halls. That wore me out and I fell asleep shortly after my parents returned home.

I woke up hungrier than I had been the first time around, and summoned the nurse. I ordered myself lunch and went for a little briefer walk around. My parents returned a few hours later, and not long after, I was whisked out of the room for an MRI and some other tests. The doctor informed me that they had found something concerning in my bloodwork.

“What does that mean, exactly?” my father interjected before my mother or even I could speak up. All of our heads turned toward him.

“It means that we don't know why, exactly but your son's white blood cell count is a little elevated. It could be a response to the antibiotics, but we want to monitor him.” the man with the clipboard replied dryly.

That seemed to satisfy my parents, so I kept my mouth shut as well. Eventually my parents went home again, and I drifted off after dinner. I woke less than an hour later with a gnawing feeling I my gut, and the urge to get up and walk around again. I called for the nurse again and she accompanied me through the halls once more.

“Can I go to the cafeteria?” I asked.

“I don't see why not.” she answered, taking the lead.

We stopped at the shiny metal elevator doors next to the nurse's station. She pressed the down button, and a few seconds later, the doors rolled open and we waited for those already in the small car to exit before we stepped inside. The doors slid closed and the cables gave a slight jerk before we began to to descend. The woman took the lead again and I followed her into the dining area, taking my place in line before moving up to select my meal. The nurse sat near me, cradling a paper cup of coffee between her hands while she waited for me to finish eating. It didn't take me very long at all, and we went back up to my room.

I was exhausted and my eyes closed while the woman reconnected the wires to the sticky pads to my torso and put the oxygen sensor on the tip of my finger. I was asleep before she left the room, and once again found myself adrift on an endless ocean, only a dark, starless expanse above me. This time, I got the sensation that I was not alone, and when I turned my head, saw Jeff's face, pale and contorted in rage as he swam toward me. His hands reached out, though they were more like those of a bird, terminating in cylindrical talons.

I felt the very real, vise-like grip enclose both of my wrists, and he pulled me beneath the surface of the inky water. This time I could not fight my way back to the surface, and I woke up in the midst of another seizure. My arms and legs were rigid, fingers and toes spasming as my limbs thrashed about. My eyes rolled into the back of my head and I blacked out. This time there were no more dreams. I didn't wake back up until the morning, my bladder aching and feeling as if it were going to burst inside my body. I was restrained again but was able to reach the call button.

“What do you need?” the man who had replaced my usual nurse asked.

“I need to use the toilet.” I said quietly. My body shifted uncomfortably against the thin mattress below me.

“Give me a minute to get the cuffs off of you.” he replied, and then unbuckled the soft loops around my ankles and wrists.

I rubbed my left wrist as he helped me up out of the bed.

“Take it easy. We don't want you having another seizure.” he told me softly as he disconnected the machine from the pads on my torso. I gently pushed myself into a sitting position, and scooted off the bed, and onto my feet.

He stayed at my side, my hand on his forearm for support, my body feeling much weaker than it had before. As I walked, the smell of something warm and delicious filled my nostrils. My stomach rumbled loudly enough that I know the man beside me heard it. We paused, and just as our eyes met, I lunged forward, my teeth digging into the side of his neck. He punched at my head and body, but I didn't even register the impacts. All that I could feel was the hunger. I drank the man's blood, the warm, iron-tinged liquid seeming to sate the feeling in my lower abdomen.

I eventually pulled away when I heard the rush of footsteps coming in our direction. I raised my head in time to see a group of hospital security and other staff rushing toward us, their shouts seeming foreign to my ears. I stood and turned, running away, sprinting back toward the room where I had been before. I jumped at the window, easily shattering the glass with my body which I could feel was no longer truly the one I was born with. The ends of my digits were splitting, the bone becoming sharp and talon-like.

I felt my tongue split and my teeth burst through my gums as I hit the ground. I sniffed the night air, the sweet scent of blood around me, and disappeared into the night.

1ii4r3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ii4r3f/a_tincture_of_frost_and_madness/,A Tincture of Frost and Madness,"The cold is a fickle thing, no less human in its endeavours than beast. It is a case of split personality, a calm, idyllic expanse, a gentle inviting face, with a deep vindictive streak ready to pounce at the opportunity. 

You can try to withstand it. Yet, it will reciprocate by pushing through the cracks, creeping in while you are none the wiser, blowing at your fires, and breaking through your woollen layers. 

A stand against it will surely meet with a punishment which will rarely leave you without a story to tell, blackened vestiges, or a lack of both. 

And if you are met with the misfortune, the frost will toy with you. It will nibble at you, grip your lungs, and paint your skin white. 

Then as it is just about to encompass you in a whirlwind, both elegant and merciless, it gives you a false illusion of warmth, a fake sense that everything is alright, allows you to believe you succeeded in defeating the beast, 

and in your lunacy, while you could just jump for joy, it rips this life from you. 

Perhaps an act of mercy, killing you not in your misery, but in your delirium, or perhaps it is the cruelty of a predator playing around with his prey. Like a tomcat to a battered mouse, cut open and exposed, letting it believe for a moment, there is a path of escape, only to reel it back in for another round of torment.

Regardless, you are dead all the same. 

The void greeted me, and I greeted back— briefly. Linger too long; you are bound to be swept in its embrace. With a resolute slam, I shut the door to the hold. It was 13:00 and I was the fortunate participant of a 5 hour habitat analysis. As I took off my glasses, I winced at the deep indent left on the bridge of my nose, then aptly began wiping the coating of frost which dressed it. 

My temporary residence in Antarctica was designed to make use of almost all ‘state-of-the-arts’, even the arts unknown to the average person of the states. To me, it looked like you rented a hospital room and then followed the directions of a home decoration magazine. The place wasn’t horrible, don’t get me wrong, but it was a zoo, just a hollow replica of one’s true habitat. 

It was the size of a New York apartment, and shaped like a capital D when viewing from the front. As a result, the interior was designed to be modular and compact. Opening the pressurized doors greeted you with your workspace, a hollowed out part of the wall to suit your monitor, a chair, and the computer built into the wall adjacent. I was fairly certain that work being the first thing you saw was management's idea. To the left, your bedding sat, with another hollow out in the structure to fit a potted plant. If you were ever kept up at night, the curve of the roof just beginning to dip gave comfort to all but the claustrophobic. To the right was a kitchen, everything that could be built into the structure was. It featured an upside down L shape, starting at a fridge on the end closest to the computer, and a dishwasher on the farthest. In the middle sat an island block with a single chair for eating.  As an afterthought, the bathroom was squeezed in the empty space where kitchen and wall were separated. On the horizontal of the L, the fridge was coupled with a sink and counter.  Opposite, a complete bio-monitor panel, 5 feet in length and 3 in width. Two arcs of white light extended from its middle, encased in white paint, and wrapped around the whole structure; the exception was the cupboards, seeming to flow behind. It provided a visual break from the soft rose tones present everywhere else but the black floors and marble tiling. 

It was all such a rush, declassified documents, the slaps on the backs from my colleagues, looks of admiration from my superiors. Finally, it was time to make a name for myself, like a great explorer of old, I was to pursue the unknown. But like any rush, it left without saying goodbye, leaving me yearning for times lost in the sands. The whole operation was menial work dressed up in a fancy covert package. If I had known what I know now, I would’ve slapped myself for even considering wearing a suit to the mission debrief— a symptom of a ‘Bond’ binge. 

As if to further dismantle my delusions of grandeur, a team of 10 arrived alongside me, all outfitted in identical units. A larger central hub housed a mess hall, vehicles, and laboratories. Inside of which was where you had a few moments of socialization; the rest of human interaction was the glance of your reflection upon computer startup. 

I was still burnt from my dance with the climate, my nose trapped in a perpetual cycle of leaking and freezing. When I went to heat  my hands under the warm stream of the sink, it felt as though a match was lit under them.

And ever lurking was the hound of the north, its howl present to remind all of its dominance. It whipped at you with winds sharper than most blades, and a flurry of snow encapsulated you from each direction. 

Observed even from the research facilities mobile units, the storm's vicious nature remained on full display. 

I had ridden in a robust one man vehicle, the designer clearly taking inspiration from a space rover. The cockpit was a fair compromise between a claustrophobic nightmare, and a well spaced laboratory. 

The majority of my time was spent noting behaviours of various organisms, and albeit fascinating, began to get dreary as the hours grew long. I did notice however, a thriving population of cross breeds between what looks to be a bear and some kind of aquatic animal, lacking any fertility issues. I recalled my enthusiasm outpacing the truck's engine on the ride home. 

I sat on the stiff office chair, and a quick biometric scan of my face confirmed my identity. The computer sprang to life, with the monitor displaying the motherboard’s manufacturer. I extended a cord from its spot on the desk into the usb slot on the wall. It was a bridge between the raw data held on the vehicle connected to the larger compound to my housing unit. I cracked my numb fingers, and let out a yawn as the computer parsed the info. As soon the files were available, I clicked into the external camera log. The trip had been a slog up until now, but perhaps this discovery would be a respite from the boredom. 

Recordings of the species frolicking about, in and around a small patch of forest were served to my display, and I ate it hungrily. Potential names, the fact that an interbreed of such distant animals could produce offspring, all of it, and more raced through my mind. At first glance it could be mistaken for a classic polar bear, sporting a fat insulation layer, white fur, a round robust build. Yet, little details gave it away, its paws partially webbed, its form more streamlined than the average bear. The head was strong, broad, but the snout was sleek. Ears pinned back, and eyes faced forward. The thick muscular tail was the biggest clue that this was a unique creature.

A true apex predator, both land and sea adaptations, and if I had to guess it had a form of sonar. The genetic incompatibilities between whatever parent species seemed to have been remedied in some unique way. It fascinated me, encouraging a raw, powerful, curiosity. 

Yet, something else, it was just past the tree line. It flickered in and out of frame, a deep, rich black that would have blended in with the forest if not for its glimmering, slimy, sheen. I immediately chalked it up to a bug in the enhancement AI. Still, I laid my elbow on the desk, hand to my temple, brow furrowed as I pressed ‘enlarge’ and rewound the log. Normally, I would have ignored something so trivial, but the possibility of a second discovery lured me in like a fish to water.

That, and the storm had begun to call. The wind picked up, scratching at the walls, searching for a way inside. I wouldn’t be leaving this room for quite some time. 

Just as I was nearing the unidentified footage, the program buffered, then promptly crashed.

I placed my hand to my head, palm rubbing my eyes. I had just realized how long it had been since I last blinked.

A deep sigh left me as I leaned back in my chair. The screen had gone black, save for a faint reflection of myself, illuminated by the dim emergency light overhead. For a few seconds, I just stared—half at my own tired expression, half at the void where the footage had once been.

Then, the monitor flickered.

A soft click. Then another. The system whirred back to life, but something was wrong. The playback window reopened on its own, skipping ahead. Lines of corrupted data scrolled past like something was sifting through it faster than I could follow. My fingers tensed over the keyboard.

I hadn’t touched anything.

Another flicker. Then, the screen stabilized.

The footage had changed

it was as if time itself had stopped to gape at what I was looking at. I took a sharp breath, and for a moment, it felt harsher than if I had thrown myself into the midst of the storm beyond my door. 

AI glitches are supposed to resolve themselves after reanalyzing the affected frames. There was no glitch of the system. When I replayed the footage, I bore witness to what now clearly appeared to be the thin limb of a creature that dwarfed even the animals beside it. But something else had changed.

The flickering stopped.

I was certain, the line, well limb, in the distance had been perfectly straight yet it’s shown … bent. Impossible, I thought. I rewound the footage again. No. I was sure of it. It had definitely moved. My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer, and even with the conditions threatening to pull the roof off my head, the only sound in that room was my own pounding heartbeat.

And then, any resolve I may have had dispersed. A misshapen head glared back at me from the screen. No, a moose skull, charred and melted. My eyes darted back and forth between, its head, its legs, how it began lowering itself to peer at me. 

The walls of the cabin groaned under the storm’s relentless assault. The wind howled through unseen gaps, rattling whatever was not tied down, sending them toppling one by one. And somewhere in the madness, my heart joined the chaos, hammering in time with the storm.

The footage became more convoluted; my head thundered with every second I kept my eyes pressed on the screen. My eyes began to twitch, and my agape mouth rattled back and forth. It felt as if my body was a generator, my capacitors ravaged by a surge too powerful. 

A flash of light illuminated the room, driving  out any wayward shadows. I was there in that moment for eternity. My eyes peeled open by an unseen force. The white expanse was unnatural, it was too bright. I felt as if I was looking straight into the sun, but there was no warmth. Only cold. 

Then in an instant, my monitor cracked, and my glasses flung to the ground. A mesmerizing display of light lit up the room as the rays danced off the glass shards. In a daze, I was on the floor, gasping for air, my vision covered by blanching spots. I was left with no memory of the past hour and a dying urge to return back to that thicket. 

A primal, raw, maddening call no man could dream of refusing. 

I arose into a seating position, one knee up and one down, and gasped at the chaos that surrounded me. The panel on the monitor was completely destroyed, and its remains circled me— along with those of my glasses. Cupboards flung open, dishes strewn across the room. The plant above my bed seemed to have exploded, with its former inhabitants caking my mattress. I shook my head, gazing at the fridge door which was hanging on by a twisted scrap of metal. 

What the hell happened here? I had asked no one in particular. I looked at the monitor in front of me, squinting my eyes. For the life of me I could not recall what I had just been doing, or where I was for that matter. It was not exactly forgotten, I could feel the emptiness which my memories were supposed to fill. It was as if they were stolen, and there was an imprint left in their wake. 

I blinked.

Everything was back in order.

The cupboards closed, my monitor whole. The fridge steadily humming, door shut as if it had never been disturbed. The plant above hung lazily, lush and thriving. 

I sucked in a breath, my pulse started pounding again. The air had gotten tight, each rise of my chest harder than the last. 

The details of my setting blurred, and merged together. Fine lines dissipated as colours bled into one another. 

My eyes strained trying to keep track of the shapes' choreography, before I squeezed them shut. 

I wanted to curl into a ball and scream until I had no throat left to do so. The hum of the fridge grew louder, sharper, until it became a loud whistle shrieking overhead. 

My eyes shot open, and began darting around. 

My surroundings began to solidify, I recognized the dim concrete, a faint red glow all around. it felt so familiar to me, but for the life of me I couldn’t imagine why.

The air felt no less suffocating than if I were drowning. The room— no, the walls, the men in white coats, everything was wrong. 

They sat hunched at rows of box computers lining the walls. Their fingers punched the keys urgently, dots of sweat beading on their foreheads. Each wore a pistol strapped to their chest, but knowing these gear heads they weren’t using it for offensive. Just for a way out. 

I blinked again. Hadn’t I just been somewhere else? 

Yes, that’s right. 

I had thrown up in the bin just 15 minutes ago. Spent the next 15 cleaning any remains off my uniform. The tan and green kept my secret safe. I recall looking to my chest, the 3 pointed stars a reminder that any sign of weakness can be the whole platoon's downfall.  

A second whistle cut through the air. 

Red lights now pulsed powerfully overhead, flashing against the barren concrete walls. 

I braced for impact, grabbing hold of a chair with my left and desk with my right. 

An explosion sounded out in the distance, rattling the dust in the bunker. it had just missed us. 

A thin man ran to me, whose oversized helmet banged around his pinhead. I could see the wisps of blond hair cut short, betraying the confines of his headgear. 

“General, we need to retreat from the eastern front,” he stammered out, the bunch of papers he held falling as he spoke, “it’s imperative that—“ 

“Not another word Jenkins,” I barked, “how can we afford losing our advantage?” 

My vision sharpened, the haze lifted as the spell melted away. The air grew lighter, the bunker quieter. How dare this lackey, Jenkins, mean to tell me how to win a war? I’d fought my way into this world, and by god, would I be willing to leave the same way. 

“Sir, how can we afford not to?” 

I closed the distance between us, my eyes burning into his. I jabbed my finger into his chest as I spoke, my voice low and dangerous. 

Then I paused, taking a puff of my cigar for dramatic effect. I leaned back in my leather chair, drumming my fingers on the polished wood of my desk. My colleague, Tom, sat across from me, mouth slightly agape, hanging on every word. 

“Well, what’d he say?” Tom asked me, his brown suit crinkled as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees. A half empty glass of whisky caught the light of the June sun. 

“Ah, I hadn’t gone that far yet,” I said, glancing around my office. The rotary phone next to a stack of papers, faint hum of the typewriters being worked in the next room— it all felt so mundane opposed to the war time narrative I recounted to Tom. 

“Don’t just stop there,” Tom said with a smile, “I smell a best seller coming from you, pal” 

I stood up and turned away from Tom, taking in the large green plant in the corner of the office. The tiger carpet, which had cost a pretty penny, lay lazily gazing at my mahogany doors, their gold finish catching the sunlight.

Striding over to the large glass windows adjacent to my desk, I clasped my hands behind my back. The city sprawled below, bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. Dust motes danced in the light, normally unseen but now illuminated like tiny stars. A Presley song played softly in the background, its melody at odds with the unease creeping into my chest.

I turned my head slightly. “Tom, you never did tell me why you have a moose’s skull for a head” 

Tom leaned back into his chair, fingertips touching. There was nothing behind the charred bone— but I could tell he was burning a hole into my back. 

The eye socket partially melted, like glass pulled too soon from a furnace. A sickly sheen coated the head, as if routinely dipped in oil. 

I stared back at him, his jaw rattled as his head tilted slightly, as if to raise an eyebrow.  

A soft chuckle, before he spoke, “what are you talking about buddy?” 

The warm glow of the office was gone, the music faded, and I sighed as I was no longer immersed in my recollection. The therapist’s concerned eyes met mine, her pen poised over her notepad. “And how often do you have this dream?” She said gently. 

“I dunno, maybe once a week? I always tell some different story.” I said, looking up from my vantage point on the therapist's lounge chair. 

“So tell me”, she leaned forward, gaze steady, “how does this dream make you feel?” 

I hesitated, the image of the skull flashing in my mind. “Feels like I’ve been lying to myself,” I said finally, “You know what I mean, like I’ve been ignoring something so obvious, staring me right in the face” 

“It’s interesting you say that,” with a soft tone, quite mother-like, “ if you don’t mind me asking, what would you say is your biggest fear?” 

“Well, truthfully, losing control of who I am, my personal compass, it terrifies me, really.”

The therapist began dotting something down in her notebook. I took a moment to scan the office, a habit I’d picked up. The lounge chair beneath me was familiar as ever, and across a small coffee table sat my therapist, in a recliner. I turned my head, glancing over my shoulder at the large window behind me, where the second story view overlooked a bustling downtown street. A few feet away, a bookshelf stood beside a bamboo tree.

Even though I never read the books, nor the titles, their presence made me feel welcomed. As if to say, you are grounded, their colours touching a spot of comfort in my mind. The midday light caught the leaves of the bamboo. I sat staring at them, analyzing the plant’s intricacies. 

“Mr. Hansen?”

I glanced up quickly, “Ah sorry,” I said, embarrassed. “What was the question?” 

“I want you to look at a few images and tell me how they make you feel,” she peered at from behind her glasses, “can you do that for me?”

On the table, she had laid out a series of printed black shapes that could be interpreted this way or that. I picked up the stack, and started to make out the first one. 

“Uh,” I furrowed my brow, “I see a couple” 

“Hmm, interesting.” She wrote a quick note, “keep going and I’ll write what you say” 

“A person- no, a group running.” I set the page on the coffee table atop the previous. 

“A man crying out, his hand, I think, is raised?” 

“I- oh, oh man.” 

My chest conscripted, I tried to make a sound but to no avail. This time, I wasn’t guessing. I knew this shape, and very well at that. 

“Is something the matter Mr. Hansen?” 

“No, it’s uh, just that”, I trailed off, the papers falling from my hand. 

I recoiled back on the lounge, like a scared animal. My heart threatening to pound through my rib cage, mouth hanging agape. 

“Mr Hansen,” 

the sound of bones clicking after each word.

“Get control of yourself.” 

The lifeless sockets tore into me. I couldn’t bear to look for longer than a few seconds, yet I could describe the features as if I marbled them in stone. 

The face of my tormentor. Just a glance and its grip grasped my lungs. My attempts at breathing were futile. 

The bookshelf, had it always looked so dilapidated? Was the dressing of mold, the black rot of the bamboo stem, ever so present? 

My eyes winded, as if forcing me to take in my surroundings.

“Stay back,” I commanded, though my voice betraying my words. 

“I swear to you,” it was more pleaded than threatened, “stay.. stay back” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME.” 

“STAY AWAY FROM ME,” the man repeated. 

I groaned, and b-lined for the living room. My half chopped carrots kept vigilant in my wake. 

I stood in front of the television watching the scene play out a little longer, then I changed the channel. 

Reruns of cheesy horror dramas are all they play these days. 

A hop and a whistle and I was back to preparing dinner. Now, what would Linda like  in a soup? Does rice work in a soup? 

To not keep the carrots waiting any longer, I got back to work, making a mental note to fully flesh out my recipe. 

Chip, chip, chip. 

A quite therapeutic sound, it brought me back to when I was a lad.

My mother loved the kitchen, even devising a cookbook of her own. She made an effort to always hand it out at every neighbourhood function. It was truly an example of her determination, I recall many times she invited friends for tea— just to hand out that damn book. 

Shaking me out of my daydream, a fat blob of red stained deep in the hem of my white shirt caught my eye. I held my arm out and stared for a moment. 

Did I knick a vein? No, that wasn’t my blood. Well, no bother, I’m not hurt, but this shirt might be done for. A quick wash under cold water and I was finishing up with my carrots. 

She might like some beef, that woman is half carnivore I swear. 

Or, I could ditch the soup, go full on fried rice. Although, we did eat at that Asian place just last week. Anywho, I’d have to decide by the time I finish cutting the onions. 

I set the carrots aside and picked out an onion from the fridge. A second mental note was made to add onions to the shopping list; I had just picked out the last one. 

“So, ya’ve gather’d your boys here to g’wan with my treasure, have ya?,” the television blared out lines from an old western. 

I gave a few curious glances at the action, a tense drawing of pistols, and a gunfight ensued.  

As I returned to my task, I took note of the knife. Heavier than before. The onions, soft. Too soft, and supple. 

For some reason, I felt a chill raise its way up to my nape; I grew acutely aware of the beating California sun shining on my forehead through the window overhead the counter.  

Was my hand shaking? “Get a hold of yourself man,” I spoke out loud. 

I cracked the window, this heat must be making me delirious. 

The breeze hit like a crashing wave to a beach shore. I could hear the neighbourhood kids yelling. I smiled, oh to be young. 

Shunk, shunk, shunk. 

The onions were chopped in halves, then in strips.  

Again, I managed to become distracted by the tv. There was an actor, whose face of abject terror was discernible even in my peripherals.  

I stood inquisitively, turning to face the screen. I get the sense I worked with that fellow, but just where? 

As I tried to recall, the chill creeped up on me again, as if to let me guard down. I shook my head, and, partly to distract myself, continued the chopping. 

Thunnk, thunnk, thunnk

Without exactly knowing why, I began to cut the onions with more passion. I felt, almost a sense of rage begin to bubble, my hands felt clammy. I began to dive the knife harder into the cutting board. 

It no longer felt like I was cutting onions, nor was it in the kitchen. 

Thunk, Thunk, Thunk.

Shadows began to feel longer, the lights a little dimmer. Yet, all the same, I felt like a puppet, my hands moving of its own accord. 

Thunk…. Thunk.

At times I didn’t even realize it was moving at all, I had intense focus only on what was in front of me. 

My knuckles grew white as I gripped the handle tighter; my breath became ragged. 

My attention was solely on the board, each stroke my blade slid more powerful than the other, all the while— CRACK. 

“Ah, brother,” I said exasperated. I had cut a deep indent in the cutting board, which pulled me out of my stupor. 

I breathed heavily, could I be having a stroke? A sick unease washed over me. Without a moment's notice, I grabbed a rag and thrust it under the cold of the sink. I put it overtop my forehead and made way for the dining room chair, knife in hand. 

I had to get out of the sun. 

“Are you going to still live in ignorance?,” the television blared before I had the chance to sit. 

My interest piqued, I turned my head. It was that actor from before, yet this time in a white lab coat. An infomercial was playing. 

Seeing him twice raised my spirits, I cracked a smile. Albeit, tainted by the lethargy that seemed to infect deep into my body. What could be the chances he’s shown in a time slot back to back. 

“You can’t keep chopping away forever,” the actor grinned. A gleaming smile so bright you could light a room with it. 

“How long do you want to live in your fantasy world ignoring everything you’ve done?” 

The children playing, the birds chirping, the dripping of the tap I never bothered to tighten. All ceased as a close up of the man seemed to encapsulate me into keeping my eyes locked forwards. 

It was as if he turned directly at me. As I titled my head slightly, I could swear his eyes tracked. 

“And what of our families? Who let you become executioner of the innocent?”

Then the sound of applause and laughter began to fade in, ushering out the silence. 

Hot iron passed into my veins. 

I felt my chest struggle against a crushing weight. 

I slowly peeled my head off the screen, whatever else the man was saying a blur. 

I ran to the cutting board in an attempt to regain normalcy, to no avail. 

The feverish cuts synchronized with the sound of glasses clinking. 

My crisp suit began tugging at the seams, with every powerful thrust of my blade. 

Tears began welling in my blood shot eyes. Any confidence left had finally dissipated, evident of shaking breath 

In a desperate attempt to keep myself grounded, I prepared a powerful swing of the blade. 

I pulled my hand back, intended a slam of the blade with everything I had in me. 

But— 

There was no knife. 

Instead, my champagne glass sailed to the ground, shattering on the ballroom floor. 

The music didn’t stop, nor did the laughter waver. 

Although, a whale-like man turned to face me, jowls trembling with rage. A dark stain now present where my drink had caught him.

“Composure, man! You ought to learn it” he huffed, a thick, gruff voice from under a bellowing moustache. The fat on his neck shook ever so slightly as he spoke. 

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered, “I seem to have lost control of myself.” 

He left with an astound “harrumph” and turned away into a mess of people. 

I took in my surrounds, shimmering balls reflecting off crystalline dresses. A mess of fur scarves, tailed suits and men with a skewed sense of importance. A fat air of sophistication hung over the crowd. 

My hands were still trying to grip a phantom knife when a woman touched my shoulder. 

“I see you stuck to your usual dramatic introductions, dear” a voice teased. 

I turn, a sly mood overcame me, though I was unsure why. 

The woman wore a flowing, obsidian gown, The diamonds at her throat seemed to ripple and move along with the light of the crowd. 

“I took it you were going to make me find you” she laughed, stepping closer. 

A heavy scent of lavender, and something metallic, accompanied her. 

I must know her, of course, but the name my lips searched for was nowhere to be found. 

“You were always good at making a scene,” she smiled knowingly, as if we shared some unspoken secret. 

My hand twitched, there was no knife, yet my fingers curled as if they grasped a handle.

I let my gaze wander, a subtle attempt to jog my memory.

It’s when I noticed— everything was too perfect. 

They danced in unison, movements seamless, like they practiced this a hundred times over. 

Yet, when they laughed, mouths moved, faces contorted, but the sound came moments later. 

The glow of the chandeliers too bright, as if to drown out fine details, not illuminate.

Why did every man have the same smooth skin, every woman an hourglass figure.  

Why did the air tug at my throat, like a turtleneck one size too little? 

She touched my cheek, fingers softer than the feathers. She guided my face to hers.

“But tell me,” she whispered, brushing her nails on my chin “did you enjoy the show” 

My stomach jumped. 

“..what?” 

The music warped, the elegant waltz lurched, now jumped from one tune to the next. 

The dancers didn’t stop, they jerked in painful movements to the new beat. 

Why couldn’t I remember the woman’s name?

Why was I here? 

What was my name? 

Who.

Am.

I?

A breath. 

A twitch. 

A snap. 

I lunged. 

The moment my first collided with her face, it was not flesh, nor bone, but painted ceramic that shattered on impact. 

Beneath? 

Hollow. 

Panic took hold of me. I began lashing out at the guests. 

legs, torsos, all to the same effect, all cracking and splintering revealing nothing underneath. 

Not one person turned to address the commotion, even the ones smashed in half. 

Simply keep laughing and dancing. 

I fell to my knees and raised my hands to the sky, tears rolling into my gaping mouth. 

In the flash of the waiter's belt, I caught my own reflection. 

A man grinned back at me— wide eyes crazed with desire, a flush smile too wide for his face. 

It was me. 

And it wasn’t. 

The scene all around me spun, as if I were caught in a tornado. Everything blurred together, and details crashed into me, sharp and sudden, like a head on collision. 

Distant screams pierced through my head as I struggled to make sense of what was in front of me. 

I shut my eyes tight, knowing it was no true protection against the cruelty of the outside. Then— drip. It was soft at first, barely a whisper. 

Despite the chill creeping into my bones, I smiled. 

It was just a bad trip, nothing more nothing less. An adverse reaction to some frozen airborne deliriant I must have inhaled. 

That had to be it. I was back in my dorm, and absently-minded-me forgot to tighten the sink again! 

But no matter how hard I tried, the cruel mistress of reality had other plans. I could not deny the feeling of snow, as I kneeled down on the ground.  

I finally mustered the courage to peel my eyes open. I was instantly aware of the frostbite gnawing at my fingers, the cold seeping deep into my bones. What I saw next was worse than any injury, My hands were dressed in a cruel glove of blood. The crimson was too real, there was no denying it. 

I wiped myself off and clambered to my feet. Just behind me, the door to the main faculty lay open. A faulty component let off sparks. Inside was dark– though the sun, bleeding through the jagged frame, betrayed any notion of serenity. 

My knees buckled as I made my way towards nowhere in particular. The wind whipped around me, a symphony of my misery. 

I had no direction, nor a plan. The open room seemed as good as any. 

I took a few steps, then under my boot a squelch. 

I looked down to see a beady eye, dislocated from its owner, gazing at me accusingly. 

With muted acceptance, I lifted my leg, shaking off what had once been a man’s face.

Out of habit, I dragged myself to a powerswitch.

For a few moments, the fluorescents burned my corneas. As things stabilized I lay witness to the full, grotesque splendor– my massacre. 

The dorm was in utter ruin, tables and chairs pushed aside in a mad frenzy, clearing the space for the real spectacle.

The conglomerate of the research team, those accompanying me, had been arranged in a stiff, unnatural display, their bodies forced into grotesque vaudeville poses. Their muscles, pulled taut into exaggerated smiles, were stitched in place by sharpened molars and jagged shards of bone. Those not propped up, presumably their pieces repurposed for the set, laid scattered around the would be theatre crew. 

At the center of it all, the man, the one who had spoken to me in my daze, stood grinning. His own peeled-off face dangled from his fingers like a discarded mask. His other hand, gripping a blood-slicked blade, pointed toward the wall behind him.

It was not a question that it was intended for my eyes. I lurched forward, past the twisted remains of my coworkers. I was waiting for one to move, pat me on the back, tell me “Hey, buddy, we wouldn't have done much better in your shoes.”

No respite came. There would be no salvation. 

On what used to be the tray collection table lay a pile of photographs—every photograph from the facility’s records.

Each had been replaced with a picture of me— and the charred skull of a moose.In each, I was the central figure. My face inserted seamlessly into group photos, with everyone else replaced by the blackened skeleton. There was a wedding photo with me standing in place of the groom, the bride now a skeletal husk. The edits were flawless, as if I had always belonged in those frames.

I picked up one particular frame, and laughed. 

It was a harsh, strangled sound at first, then built up to a maddening roar. 

I turned my back slowly to the frigid metal behind me, and sank slowly to the floor.

I began to sob, laughing all the while

The most vicious thing winter’s mistress– No. that damned creature, had done was leaving me alive to witness my massacre, not killing me in ignorance. Maybe I should do it myself after I put down the pen.

“*I intend to detail this log as a last service to the company and to humanity, so this mission is not clouded in secrecy, speculated on, then green lit once more for  fresh victims to embark on.*”

I concluded, having detailed everything I could on some wayward tablet which I had clearance for, before tossing it aside.

With a sigh, I realized my mask of temperance had begun to slip. I was going to come to terms with myself, whether I liked it or not. 

I rubbed my thumb over the frame I had grabbed. 

“Don’t keep your mother worrying! My fav picture of you ;) XOXOXO!” 

My tears fell over the childhood photo, of who I would never know, as my face had been plastered over his.

1ii4o7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ii4o7r/looking_for_feedback_on_my_opening_chapter_urban/,Looking for feedback on my opening chapter (urban fantasy),"**Beyond the glass wall** of the penthouse flat of Kane's Pyramid, the city of dreams was sprawled out across the lakefront, a living, breathing thing,  innovation and industry given form. Pattensburgh was a city of movement; airships emblazoned with corporate sigils cut through the air as great whales amble through the sea — slowly, hulkingly, filling the skies with a hundred different blimps cast in a thousand different colours. Beneath, motors rushed through the streets as blood rushes through a vein, quick and untamable and without mercy, each man at the wheel hoping to *go* somewhere, to *do* something. Honking and heaving and cursing were the music of the city, the sounds of traffic on Sixth and the animated billboards on Ninth, the *ram-ram-ram* of heavy trains chugging on their elevated tracks, running through arches within brick-and-mortar skyscrapers. 



On the sidewalk were thousands upon thousands of people, and from this vantage they all seemed as ants, each eager and going his own way, each unremarkable on its own, but coming together to found something entirely — at least, in Alirix's mind — beautiful. Men in top hats and sleek suits, women in pin-straight dresses and that curly short hair that was all the rage these days. Even centaurs and elves and lycan and all the other indigines, here in the largest city in the world, dressed in their human best. 



Street vendors were aplenty. There was an Elven woman selling fabulous gowns right there in the open, all strung on a line and glittering with gemstones. There was a group of fae boys blasting island music and frying up spicy, chewy *to'chali* in what could only be described as a grand *vat* of oil, selling them to passers-by wrapped up in newspapers — that doubtless had PRESIDENT NAMEH TO JOIN THE RACE? printed in bold atop them — wrapped up in bands of rubber. There was an old woman passing around trinkets and baubles and every time she raised an arm to call up a potential customer her arm flesh jiggled like loose dough. These vendors were aplenty, clogging up the sidewalk no less than the pedestrians were, and behind them were shops belonging to seamstresses and elite chefs and actors and whores who plied their craft in the open. This was Pattensburgh, after all — no talent went unexploited, nor any desire. 



Kane's Pyramid, the great apartment complex in which Alirix stood, rose at the end of the street. The building was, as its name implied, a pyramid, rising six hundred feet in the air, plated with gold, home to thieves and crooks and lowlives — that was to say, billionaires and CEOs and nepotism kings and queens. The Pyramid had been raised by the Halloway Hotel Chain, long before Alirix had been unfortunate enough to slide into the world. He supposed it would still be here long after he was fortunate enough to leave it. 



Alirix stood motionless before the glass wall, one hand in his pocket and the other adjusting the collar of his black trenchcoat. He watched box-shaped motors whizz through the street, watched the ads displayed on great billboards, colourless moving pictures against a colourful, moving world (this one was selling legal representation for golems), watched smiling vendors pocket crumpled denash bills, watched spindly whores stand before their establishments, pretending to sweat and swoon in the cold of an approaching winter, watched paper boys bounce through the streets holding bundles of bad news, fueled by an excitement only the youth seemed to have, watched the moon send silver rays down across the city, and lastly, watched the door within this wonderful apartment, waiting for it to open. 



The morphling Kazamoria sat across his shoulder like a scarf. Tonight she was a snake — one of the venemous kinds found in the deserts to the east — though this morning she had been a pigeon, and yesterday a horse. ""A *wild* horse,"" Kazamoria had insisted, though indeed there had been nothing wild about her biology. She had simply used that as an excuse to try her luck at kicking his teeth in with her hooves. Kazamoria Mon Moria did this often — tried her luck. 



Presently, she hissed. 



Kazamoria Mon Moria did not enjoy being kept waiting, though of course she was *not* being kept waiting — the man this penthouse belonged to was blisfully unaware of the fact of their forced entry, and certainly not of the maliciousness behind it, or of the fact they were in quite a time crunch. But Kazamoria did not care. It was a trait she shared with her fellow *tween*agers, as she liked to be referred to. She hissed again, and Alirix shook his head. Despite the fact she was a snake, and, not being a snake, Alirix could not understand her (understandably) on a simple, obvious level, he still felt he could gather the general grievance her hiss had been caused by. He could almost hear it in her voice. 



*I'm bored*. 



Alirix looked away from the glass wall and into the apartment. There were flowers and plants aplenty, each rarer and more obscure than the last. Warm, yellow lights from lamps forged into the shape of pentagons. There was a sunken pit in the floor lined with purple couches and red pillows, and in its center was a coffee table, upon which a book laid open: *Animal Urges in the War Against Men* by Phillipa Wu, one of those books wealthy men displayed to prove they had refined tastes. One wall was lined with books and trophies and taxidermied animal heads — eagles, deer, rhino, bears and one particularly unlucky lioness, missing both her eyes. On another wall as a mural of a vampire performing fellatio on a dragon. *A tad racist,* thought Alirix, moving on. There was a phonograph beneath the mural. Gold, just as everything else in this gaudy place. 



""Care for music?"" Alirix said. The snake on his neck hissed.



Alirix strode towards the phonograph. He felt the polished wood of it, set the record properly from the storage cabinet beside it and and placed the needle. A scratch, then a stream of music. Soulful, warm, smooth. Alirix found himself smiling ... until Kazamoria hissed. She did not appreciate the music. 



He sighed. 



And then the door opened. 



Alirix hoped his gaze remained impassive because in his head he was *screaming.*



The man was older than he had been last Alirix had seen him, and he looked it too. He now sat in a gilded wheelchair, pointy-eared, little more than saggy skin on thin, fragile seeming bones. His collarbone rose out of his sunken, sickly chest. His tawny complexion was blotchy and scarred with bumps and rashes. Before he had boasted a goatee and a head of slicked-back grey hair but now he was bald everywhere. He wore a green suit with a red tie, a square of patterned silk folded elegantly into his breast pocket. At his nimble, long fingers were rings of gold and emerald and diamond and pearl. 



The man was Emrys Yaurel. And he would die tonight.



If Emrys was surprised at the intrusion, he did not show it. Alirix as well remained silent, observing him as he wheeled himself over to a table and began taking off his jewels and rings. The music washed over Alirix, now tainted by the presence of this devil in designer. 



Kazamoria slithered around his neck and screeched, but Alirix himself said not a word. He was waiting, expecting. Emrys began to hum, then chuckle. He said something in Peoani Elvish, then stopped himself. He spoke next in Aldorian. ""Ha. Forgive me."" A clatter of a ring being set on a table. ""When last we spoke there were six of you."" Another ring. ""And then five."" A necklace, this time. ""And now two. Seems bounty hunters are dropping like flies."" 
Alirix balled his palms into fists. It was so strange to hear him speak. That powerful voice that had haunted his memories for a decade was long gone, left in its place a shadow of a shadow. Heat and fury festered within him as Emrys moved himself over to another table, where he poured red wine from a crystal decanter shaped like a heart. ""You'll forgive me. I'm not as swift as I once was. one for you. Your morphling is — well, what? Fourteen? thirteen? Far too young for a glass of something so strong. But you won't begrudge her a taste, I hope."" Emrys held the glass out with shaky hands, but Alirix knew the unsteadiness was not because he was afraid. In this old man's eyes was defiance. ""Come on, boy. I'll be very disappointed if you're still afraid of me."" 



Alirix had often prided himself as one not to be goaded, but goaded he was. He walked over to to him, reached out and grasped the cold glass from the dead man's fingers, then dumped its contents onto the plush fur rug beneath their fleet. 



""A waste,"" said Emrys Yaurel. 



""For you,"" Alirix spat, setting the glass down to the sound of a hissing Kazamoria. ""Do you think I'm an idiot?"" 



Emrys shrugged. ""I do not know you well enough to make a judgement on the matter. But I had hoped you were, certainly."" He looked out at the living room with those beady, leaf green eyes of his. ""How will you do it, then, Alirix Bavor?"" 



Alirix could have smiled. *So he knows why I'm here.* But then again, of course he did. What else could his presence here possibly mean, after all these years? Emrys Yaurel was a murderer and a blackguard, but he was not a fool. Alirix and his former team had learned this the difficult way. 



Still, Alirix supposed he had no issue playing with his food. Time crunch be damned. Eugene Skasgard be damned. ""Do what?"" he asked, moving away from Emrys's side and climbing down into the sunken pit of couches. He fell into one, cushions soft as clouds and cold as ice, and crossed one foot over the other. 
""The obvious,"" Emrys said. ""Will there be pain?"" 



Alirix cocked his head ever so slightly. ""Do you think you've found yourself in a position where there won't be?"" 



""No."" Emrys rolled himself towards the phonograph. ""I quite like this. You have good taste, boy. I'll give you that."" 



*Boy*. That word grated at him like nails on a chalkboard. ""It's yours. The record.""  



""I have good taste as well, but I already knew that."" Emrys raised the needle and the song faded away. He faced Alirix with a look of mock confusion. ""Where are the others?"" 



Alirix went momentarily stiff. ""Not here,"" he said. 



""One would think they would be, no? A big moment, this is. Giving your terrible villain the kiss of death."" 



""It won't be so pleasurable as a kiss."" Now Alirix was the one hissing. 



""I figured that."" 



""I'm happy for you."" 



""I wish I could say the same to you. Shame your colleagues have defected. I did like the red haired one, whatever her name was. She was fun."" 



Rest and relaxation time over, Alirix stood, opened the leather bag slung across his shoulders. He plucked the eyeless lioness, yellow and dusty, from the wall and (gently) placed it inside. 



""For Eugene?"" Emrys asked, then laughed. The sound was alien to Alirix's ears. ""He always was a cunt, wasn't he?"" 



""I wouldn't know,"" Alirix said, zipping up the bag. He reached into one of the many pockets hidden within his coat and unveiled his amplifier. It was a long, thin, simple stick of metal. Some called it a *wand.* Within it was a divinium crystal that powered it, giving himself and people like him — mages — access to spells. Unlike government issued amplifiers, however, this jailbroken wand was loaded with a deep well of illegal spells, including ...




""Say it,"" Emrys muttered, glaring up at him, eyes wobbling within their sockets. ""Say it and point the damn thing at my head. That'd be poetic. Symmetrical."" 



Kazamoria snapped her great jaws. 



""You approve?"" Alirix said to Yaurel, ignoring the annoyance on his shoulder. 



Emrys spread his arms then let them fall at his side. ""Well. I can't exactly say that I do."" 



For a time Alirix could only stare at him. This all was just starting to become real. He was *here*. He was with *him*. A moment he had fantasized about forever. He had dreamed of this on nights when he slept alone, staring at the ceiling. On days when he stood alone, in crowded trains and busy plazas. And here he was in the thick of it. 



Here he was about to take vengeance. 



He pointed the amplifier. 



""How many holes did you put in him?"" 



*In Neoh.*



Emrys faced the amplifier with protest wearing the skin of nonchalance. He would not give Alirix the grovelling he sought. Emrys raised his flabby chin. ""Ten, twelve, fifteen? Who could remember?"" 



""Twenty two,"" Alirix said. ""You shot him twenty two times. He was dead after the seventh."" 



""I'll take your word for it,"" Emrys said, then nodded at Kazamoria. ""How did you come about her? Wasn't here when last we met."" 



""Circus."" 




""And where did your friends go? You had all seemed so close."" 




""They're downstairs."" 




Emrys raised his sleeve to check the time on his gold plated watch. His great, sharp Elf ears wiggled. ""Lies smell of sulphur. I can hear doors closing in your voice."" 




""You're an old man,"" Alirix spat. ""You hear ghosts in the graveyard."" 



Emrys raised a finger. ""No. But I suspect I will soon."" 
Alirix's arm shook with unadulterated rage. He stepped closer, so close that the end of the amplifier was nearly kissing Emrys's pasty skin. ""I want you to *apologise*!"" he roared, a vein rising in his forehead. ""I want you to grovel and to beg!"" 




""And I want to live to see another sunrise,"" Emrys said, raising an eyebrow. ""Can't all get what we want, can we?"" Emrys smiled but then that smile transformed slowly to a snarl, and he roared back: ""*You* stole from *me*! You came into *my* house and took something of *mine*, and all I did was pay you back in kind!"" 



""What we took did *not* belong to you —"" 



Emrys turned and wheeled away, towards an adjoning room. ""Possession is often a frustratingly abstract concept —"" 



Alirix charged after him with the amplifier. ""You'll stay right where you are —!""


 
""Give me a moment, for fuck's sake!"" 



Emrys disappeared into the other room, then re-emerged a moment later with a box. It was an ornate box, wood painted purple with an emerald latch. It looked like something that had weight to it. Emrys was smiling again, his eyes calm yet heavy. ""I could not go to meet the gods without handing you our anniversary present. It is *the* day, is it not? Almost to the hour, in fact. You've a poet's soul, sir, but a monster's heart."" 



Alirix scowled and spread his arms mockingly. ""Look at the monster you made,"" he said before taking the box and setting it on the table. It made an audible thud when he set it down. ""What is it?"" 



""A present."" 



""Is it a bomb?"" 



""It's a present."" 



""Is it a *bomb*?""



""Why —"" Emrys sighed, ""*Why* would I keep a *bomb* in Kane's Pyramid, you fool?"" 



""Why would you keep poison in Kane's Pyramid?"" 



Emrys blinked, then shrugged. ""Fair enough. Open it."" 



Alirix, keeping the amplifier pointed at Emrys, flipped the latch with one hand and pulled open the lid with a *creak*. He was stunned to silence. Even Kazam did not hiss or snap or shriek. He stared at the contents of the box, eyes unblinking, skin reddening, arms shaking. He stared at the contents of the box, rage building, teeth clattering, mind racing. He stared at the contents of the box, enshrined, entombed, engulfed. In grief. 



It was Neoh. 



His head, in any case. Severed, battered, long preserved by enchantments. His blood had dried but his honey-brown eyes remained open, staring out at nothing, ten years too young. His skin was still tan and smooth, his hair still cropped down to his scalp, his nose still crooked from when he had smashed into a table in fourth year, his lips still thin and peeled and chapped, because despite all Delaney's pleading, he would never lower himself to wear chapstick. He was still *him*, and he would always be this way. Alirix was racked with an awful thought of dying as an old weary man, and thinking still of this head in a box, young and fresh and untouched. 



He closed the box. 



""Did you like it?"" Emrys asked. 



Alirix met him with silence. He faced him properly now. Pointed. 



""*Val Vaizimar*,"" Alirix said. 



A beam of red light burst from the tip of the amplifier, slamming against Emrys's chest with a force so strong Alirix heard his ribs crack and shatter. Red sparks of magical energy danced across his arms and legs and body as Emrys began to shake and convulse, eyes rolling into his head, spittle dripping from his mouth. The spittle quickly grew red, and then so did the tears falling from his eyes. Red hot blood leaked from every orifice Emrys Yaurel possessed. His ears, nose, eyes, mouth, asshole ... it came trickling out, then gushing out, painting his white dress shirt crimson, staining his blotched skin, pooling onto the seat of his golden wheelchair as he spasmed and cried and wheezed. 



Emrys Yaurel died painfully, but not alone. 



It took some time.

I’ve been back home for a little over a month now, and my parents have been incredibly protective, which I understand to a point. They’ve set up certain rules, like making sure I take my medicines on time, but things are starting to get out of hand.

Here’s the issue:  
I’ve recently moved back into my room, which I had to incessantly **fight for**, for days after being forced to sleep in my parents’ room for a month because my parents wanted to keep an eye on me for my health and my medications. I get it, I do, but I needed my own space to study for exams and just to feel like myself again.

Now that I’m back in my room, things are still not great. The maid we hired to help around the house uses my **bathroom** and keeps **her stuff in my room**, which just feels like I’m borrowing my own space. I have health concerns because of my kidney transplant (immunosuppression), so sharing a bathroom with the maid is a major worry for me, and it’s not a risk I’m willing to take.

I’ve tried explaining this to my parents, but they don’t seem to care much about my comfort. They think I should use their bathroom to avoid any risk of infection. But **my bathroom** has everything set up the way I need it for my personal hygiene. It's frustrating because it feels like they care more about convenience than my health or personal space. Mind you I have indian parents so they probably do not give a shit about my comfort and allat.

Also, the maid is **constantly overstepping her boundaries**. she keeps dickriding my mother and she won’t do anything without asking my mom first—she won’t even give me a spoon of sugar for my coffee without her permission! It’s also gotten to the point where she tries to intervene in arguments between me and my mom, **shouting at me** when it’s really none of her business. My dad agrees that she’s annoying and fucking dumb, but they still want to keep her around for convenience.

I’ve tried to ask my parents to set boundaries with the maid, but every time I speak up, it just ends up making things worse. I’m honestly at my wits' end.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation? How do I make them understand that I need my space back and to stop letting the maid get away with all this?",5,1738739797.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False
1ii4kqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ii4kqi/the_wind_knows/,The Wind Knows,"The field glowed like a patchwork of floating lanterns with soft bursts of color breaking through the early morning haze. Hundreds of balloons were being prepped for flight, their envelopes slowly coming to life under the flicker of burners.

The air hummed with energy — the hiss of flames, the clatter of equipment, and the buzz of crews shouting instructions back and forth.

Six months ago, Marcus's mother would have been in the middle of it all, calling out directions with that crisp, steady voice of hers. Now the field felt too big, too empty, even with all the people rushing around.

Marcus stood just inside the hangar doorway, watching through the open doors. He had witnessed this scene many times before, but today he wasn’t captured by the excitement of the launch. He didn’t notice Jose and his crew laying out the lilac envelope, his movements careful and practiced. Clara was there too, but Marcus was too focused on his need for coffee to really register what she was doing.

He grabbed a small styrofoam cup from the counter, sighing as it squeaked in his hand. The coffee smelled sharp and bitter, even worse than the sludge he'd choked down at the hotel the night before.

He hesitated for a second, then raised it to his nose. The bitterness hit hard, confirming his worst fears before he'd even tasted it. One sip, and he grimaced, pulling the cup back. ""Farmer Brothers,"" he muttered, rolling his eyes. ""Figures.""

The radio crackled to life behind him. ""And here's Nashville's rising star, Delilah Rhodes, with her latest hit, Cut Out the Weight!""

Marcus froze, the sound of the DJ cutting through the hangar like a blade. The guitar twang came first, followed by the slide of strings, clean and steady. Then Delilah's voice — smooth, effortless, and achingly familiar.

""Cut out the weight, I'm leaving it behind,
Taking off now, this is my time.
No chains, no anchors to hold me down,
I'm free now, free to touch the sky.”

Marcus hated this song. He couldn’t stand any note, chord, or beat of it, and it must have shown on his face.

The bitterness of the coffee in Marcus's mouth spread to his chest. That line — ""Cut out the weight” — used to mean something else entirely. 

His mother had said it all the time, but when she said it, it was about letting go of the things that didn't matter so you could hold tighter to the ones that did. She'd built her whole life around that balance — leaving for her balloon tours but always, always coming home. Until that last morning, when she left in a way she never meant to.

""Marcus?"" A warm voice made him jump, coffee sloshing over his hand. ""I thought that was you skulking in here.""

He turned to find Sarah watching him with that same predatory smile she'd had in high school, the one that said she was fishing for information. Her pilot's jacket was covered in patches from festivals all over the country — evidence of how far she'd go to collect good gossip. Behind her, a small group of pilots huddled around a thermos, barely hiding their interest.

""Sarah,"" he managed, trying to ignore the coffee dripping from his fingers.

""First festival since your mom passed,"" she said, tilting her head. Her eyes lit up with barely contained excitement as she moved in for the kill. ""Must be hard. Everyone's been wondering if you'd show up. Are you flying the old balloon?""

""No,"" Marcus said firmly, shaking his head. ""Clara and I talked about it. Decided we'd just watch today. It's... it's too soon."" He took another sip of the bitter coffee. ""We're just here to see everyone, you know?""

Sarah's eyebrows shot up. ""Oh? Then why is Clara out there bossing Jose around with the balloon? She's got that envelope laid out.""

Marcus's head snapped up. Through the doors, he could now see Clara standing over Jose, gesturing emphatically as she directed him where to position the fan. Jose, who had been flying balloons longer than Clara had been alive, was nodding along with the kind of patience that came from genuine affection — or complete exasperation.

""No, Jose, the fan needs to be at this angle,"" Clara's voice carried across the field. ""Grandma always said you had to account for the morning crosswinds.""

""Interesting way of 'just watching,'"" Sarah said, her voice honey-sweet with the promise of fresh gossip. ""Just like her mother, isn't she? Speaking of which, have you heard Delilah's new song? Everyone is talking about it being a Grammy hopeful.""

But Marcus wasn't listening anymore. Clara wasn't just directing anymore, was climbing into the basket.

""Nice to see you, Sarah. Let's keep in touch!"" Marcus called over his shoulder, already rushing toward the door, leaving a trail of spilled coffee in his wake.

Sarah's mouth dropped open, the juicy gossip she'd been collecting all morning dying on her lips. Behind her, the group of pilots snickered into their thermos cups. ""Well,"" she huffed, watching him stumble across the field. ""That's the last time I try to give him the courtesy of sharing his own story first. Now I'll just have to piece it together myself."" She turned back to her eager audience. ""Did you see his face when I mentioned Delilah though?""

Marcus ran across the field to his assigned staging ground desperately trying to reach his daughter in time. Clara was climbing into the basket, her braid swinging as she leaned over to check the ropes. ""Jose, I've got this!"" she called out, her voice light but firm.

Marcus stiffened. The burner roared, sending a burst of heat into the envelope. The balloon was upright now, its lilac surface glowing softly in the light. 

""What is she doing?"" he muttered, gripping the coffee cup tighter. This wasn't part of the plan. They'd agreed to sit this one out. It was too soon, too raw. His mother's basket still held the imprint of her last morning, the log book open to her final entry: ""Weather's perfect. Taking the sunrise tour.""

""Clara!"" His voice cracked as he shouted causing his tenor to spike. He didn't even notice the coffee spilling over his hand as he stumbled on the field. ""What are you doing? Get out of there! Jose, STOP her! ¡Jose, Para detenerla!”

Clara didn't even look at her dad, instead, her gaze was shooting daggers at Jose giving him a look and saying don’t listen to him. ""I've got it, Dad,"" she called back, her tone clipped and firm. ""I know what I'm doing. Grandma taught me.""

Her words hit him like a physical blow. Yes, his mother had taught Clara everything she knew about ballooning. She'd spent every summer morning with the girl, showing her how to read the winds, check the equipment, and handle the burner. But she'd also taught her something else — how to leave. How to listen to the wind to know if it would bring you home again.

""You're not flying that balloon alone!"" He was moving now, the ground uneven beneath his feet as he jogged closer. ""You're fourteen!""

""Grandma was twelve when she first soloed,"" Clara shot back, her hands steady on the controls. ""She told me. And she said I was ready.""

""That was different,"" Marcus called out, picking up speed as he crossed the field. ""She had her father with her, spotting from the ground. She had —""

""She had someone who believed in her!"" Clara's voice cracked. ""Someone who didn't just give up when things got hard!""

Marcus stumbled, her words cutting deeper than she knew. Because she was right — his mother had never given up. Not on her dreams, not on her family, not until that last morning when her heart gave out. Unlike Delilah, who had walked away without a backward glance, his mother had always found her way back to them. Always.

""Clara, please,"" he tried again, reaching the balloon. ""We can't... I can't...""

He couldn't lose her too. Not like this. Not to the same sky that had already taken so much from him.

But before he could finish, Clara's hand tightened on the burner. ""I have to do this, Dad,"" she said, her voice softer now but still determined. ""I have to do the for her. She wouldn't want her balloon just sitting here, forgotten.""

The burner roared, and Marcus felt the basket shift. Without thinking, he grabbed the edge and hauled himself in, his coffee cup falling to the grass below.

""Dad!"" Clara yelped. ""What are you doing?""

""Making sure you don't kill yourself,"" he muttered, gripping the wicker tight as the ground fell away beneath them. From the corner of his eye, he caught Sarah leaning against the hangar door, a knowing look on her face.

""Your mother would be proud!"" she called as the Lilac Dream climbed higher, though whether she meant his mom or Clara's, Marcus couldn't tell.

The balloon swayed gently as it rose, carried by a wind that seemed to know exactly where it was going. Marcus crouched in the corner of the basket, his hands white-knuckled on the edge, as Clara adjusted the burner with practiced ease. Just like her grandmother had taught her.

“Lilac Dream, this is your chaser, over.” Jose’s voice came through the walkie-talkie. “How are you doing, boss?” Marcus quickly grabbed the walkie-talkie and pressed the button to respond.

“We are so high!” he shouted into the device. “So high!”

“Dad!” Clara exclaimed, snatching the walkie-talkie from her father’s hand. “Chaser, this is Lilac Dream. We’re good. Everything is working fine, over.”

“Good to hear, Lilac Dream. We’re on the 101 and have you in our sight. Everything looks good from the ground, over,” Jose replied as Marcus rolled his eyes. 

Clara acknowledged Jose’s comment saying, “See you at the landing site, over.”

""You didn't have to come,"" she muttered, her voice sharp. ""I was doing this on my own.""

The balloon swayed gently as it rose, carried by a wind that seemed to know exactly where it was going. Marcus crouched in the corner of the basket, his hands white-knuckled on the edge, as Clara adjusted the burner with practiced ease. The basket felt impossibly small now, barely big enough for the weight of their shared grief.

Every blast of the burner made Marcus flinch. They were so high already, the ground a patchwork blur below them. His stomach lurched with each gentle rock of the basket. ""You didn't have to come,"" Clara muttered, her voice sharp. She stood as far from him as the small space would allow, which wasn't far at all. ""I was doing this on my own.""

Marcus didn't respond right away. His eyes were fixed firmly on the floor of the basket, trying not to think about how high they were or how fast the ground was disappearing below them. That's when he saw it — two sets of initials carved into the wood: D.R. + M.L.

Clara noticed where he was looking. She shifted her weight, making the basket tilt slightly. Marcus grabbed the edge tighter, his knuckles white. ""What's this?"" she asked, though her tone suggested she already knew.

Marcus swallowed hard, fighting both vertigo and memory. ""That's... that's me and your mom,"" he said quietly. ""We carved those here a long time ago. Our first kiss."" He ran his fingers over the faded letters, remembering. ""Your grandma caught us. Made us sand the whole basket as punishment, but she never did fill in the carving.""

""Why not?"" Clara asked, her voice careful, controlled. She adjusted the burner again, and the basket swayed. Marcus felt his chest tighten as another blast of flame roared overhead.

""She said some marks were meant to stay, even after people leave."" His smile faded. ""She didn't know how right she was.""

Clara turned away sharply, making the basket rock. She focused on the controls with an intensity that reminded him so much of his mother it hurt. ""Did Grandma ever talk about her?"" Her voice was tight, like a rope about to snap. ""About Mom?""

The question caught him off guard, making him look up despite his fear. The horizon tilted dizzyingly before him. ""What?""

""Mom,"" Clara said, her tone sharp enough to cut. She yanked on a rope harder than necessary, sending them slightly sideways. ""What did Grandma really think about her?""

Marcus grabbed both edges of the basket, his heart hammering. They were so high, too high, and the wind was picking up. ""Your grandma was... complicated about your mom,"" he said finally, his voice strained. ""She understood wanting to chase your dreams. She lived that life herself. But she always said there was a difference between leaving to find yourself and leaving yourself behind.""

Clara let out a bitter laugh that echoed across the empty sky. ""Is that why she hated Mom? Because she left herself behind?""

""She didn't hate her,"" Marcus said softly, even as another gust of wind rocked them. ""She was disappointed. She thought your mom would learn what she had — that the most important part of leaving is knowing how to come home.""

""But she never did,"" Clara said, her voice cracking. Her hands were shaking now as she adjusted the controls. ""She never came home. And now Grandma's gone too, and we're just... here."" She spun to face him, making the basket sway dangerously. ""Stuck in this stupid basket with you defending her again!""

Marcus felt his anger rise, burning hotter than his fear for a moment. ""I'm not defending her! I'm trying to—"" The wind caught them again, cutting him off as he grabbed for support.

""Trying to what, Dad? Make excuses? Like you always do?"" Clara's voice rose with each word. ""God, you're so weak! You can't even look down, but you'll stand there telling me how Mom had her reasons —""

""Your grandma didn't want to leave!"" he shouted back, finally meeting her eyes despite the terrifying drop below. ""She fought it, right until the end. Her last words were about the sunrise tour she was supposed to lead that morning.""

Clara's hands tightened on the controls until her knuckles matched his. ""I know, that is what her log book is telling me,” she whispered under her breath. ""Jose told me. He said... he said she was reaching for the balloon when she fell.""

""She was reaching for life,"" Marcus said, his voice thick as his eyes teared up. ""She never chose to let go. Not like your mom.""

Clara turned to him then, tears streaming down her face. ""That's what makes it worse, isn't it? Mom could have stayed. She chose not to."" She looked out over the landscape below them, her voice dropping to barely a whisper. ""Mom didn't leave, Dad. She wrote us out of her song.""

Marcus was petrified as his daughter’s words cut through him like glass. The morning's song echoed in his mind: Cut out the weight. His breath hitched as the lyrics twisted in his chest. ""Clara —""

""It's true,"" she said, her voice stronger now. ""Listen to her songs. They're all about freedom and letting go and finding yourself, and we're not in any of them. She didn't just leave us behind, she erased us!”

The balloon rocked gently as they drifted over the cliffs, the sea stretching endless before them. Marcus watched his daughter handle the controls, her movements sure and steady, just like his mother's had been.

""Your grandma used to say something about people who leave,"" he said finally. ""She said there are those who leave to find themselves and those who leave to lose themselves. She'd know — she left a hundred times, but she always carried us with her.""

Clara swallowed hard. ""And Mom?""

""Your mom..."" Marcus paused, choosing his words carefully. ""I think she left to become someone else. Someone who didn't have a husband who was afraid of heights, or a daughter who needed her, or a mother-in-law who saw right through her.""

""Is that why you always defend her?"" Clara asked, her voice small. ""Because you think it's your fault?""

Marcus looked away, his throat tight. ""Maybe. Or maybe because admitting she didn't love us enough to stay means admitting we weren't enough to make her want to.""

""We were enough, Dad!,"" Clara said fiercely. ""She just couldn't see that we were."" She adjusted the burner, her hands steady even as her voice shook. ""And Grandma... Grandma knew we were. That's why she stayed. That's why she kept coming back.""

""Until she couldn't,"" Marcus whispered.

Clara nodded, tears spilling down her cheeks. ""Until she couldn't.""

They fell silent, the wind carrying them further over the water. The morning sun painted the lilac balloon in shades of gold and rose, just like it had all those mornings Marcus's mother had taken off for her sunrise tours.

""I miss her,"" Clara said softly. ""So much it hurts sometimes.""

""Me too,"" Marcus admitted. ""Every day.""

Clara turned to him, her eyes bright with tears and determination. ""I'm not going to leave like Mom did, Dad. I promise. I might go places, I may chase my dreams, but I'll always come back.""

""Like your grandma,"" Marcus said, managing a small smile.

""Like Grandma,"" Clara agreed as a tear ran down her face. Then, after a moment: ""But you have to let me fly, Dad. You can't keep me grounded just because you're afraid of losing me too.""

Marcus saw his daughter — really saw her. She wasn't just his little girl anymore. She was her grandmother's granddaughter, strong and brave and sure. But she was also her person, choosing to stay even when leaving might be easier.

""I know,"" he said finally. ""I'm trying. That's why I'm up here. I’m trying to cut out the weight,” he paused for a brief and looked into Clara’s eyes. “Clara. I… I am devoted to you. You know that right? You will never be someone that I will cut out.”

Clara’s face lifted to show her father a real smile that reached her eyes. ""Yeah,"" she nodded. “I know Dad."" She rushed towards him and threw her arms around him causing the basket to become uneven for a brief moment.

“OK, take it easy Clara,” Marcus said as he looked to the coastline below. I really don't wanna fall out of this basket right now.

The balloon basket stabilized and drifted peacefully through the morning sky, its lilac envelope glowing in the sunlight. Below them, the world stretched out vast and beautiful, full of possibility. But for the first time since his mother's death, Marcus wasn't thinking about what they'd lost. He was thinking about what they still had — each other, this moment, and the courage to keep going.

Clara reached out as they passed over the cliffs and took his hand. Marcus squeezed back, his fear forgotten in the warmth of her grip. They weren't the weight that needed to be cut away. They were the anchor that kept each other steady, the reason to always find their way back home.

Together, they watched the horizon unfold before them, the sky painting the world in shades of promise and possibility. And somewhere, in the gentle rock of the basket and the whisper of the wind, Marcus could have sworn he heard his mother's voice, carried on the breeze like a blessing.

""The wind knows the way home. All you have to do is listen and trust that it will lead the way.”

Currently weigh 220, but i reached this weight back on 1/19. I have been doing growwithjo 800 calorie video almost daily with less than 10 days missed altogether these past two months. I workout after 12  am due to having a newborn and an 8 yo so i enjoy the silent, uninterrupted workout at night. I go to bed at 3am, wake up at 7 am with decent energy. My eating window is from 12 pm-6pm. I finish with black coffee & collagen powder and dont consume anything past 6. I try to drink 3-4 32 oz bottles of water per day, if not more. No bread, very limited sugar, and all meals home made. I haven’t drank soda, milkshakes or sbux/dd anything like that since 2023 so there isn’t much drastic change like cutting off unhealthy foods or drinks since all my foods are healthy. My homemade foods are filled with soups, salads and other Eurasian foods. My salads consist of tomatoes, cucumbers, sometimes croutons, protein of some sort, feta, artichoke hearts, lemon juice, a lot of spring mix or romaine. But the scale hasnt moved down since 1/19, it goes up and if i extremely restrict it goes back to 220 but never 119 and below. I started a 72 hour water fast on 2/3 and feel great thus far, if im feeling good on the 72nd hour ill extend it to 5day without breaking it. My daily steps total to more than 15K per day including the growwithjo workout. What do you think i’m doing wrong? I am thinking of implementing a daily outdoor walk for 3-4 miles but i doubt i will be fast with a stroller, and doubt my heart rate will go up to the point of burning any calories at all. What would you suggest? Maybe you guys can see something i’m not seeing. I have to say though, since starting in december i immediately felt amazing, have more energy and happier. I am grateful for my body but wish i could get fit sooner. Is it the lack of sleep? Is it the stress? Oh and my calories are at max 1000 per day. Help!

## Why You Need a Camp Water Filter

Before diving into specific products, letS underscore why carrying a camp water filter is so vital. Natural water sources, while seemingly pristine, can harbor harmful bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and other contaminants that can lead to serious illness. Even seemingly clear streams might contain microscopic organisms that can ruin your trip. A quality water filter removes or neutralizes these threats, providing you with safe and potable drinking water. Consider a water filter for disaster preparedness so family has access to clean water.

## Understanding Different types of Camp Water Filters

The market offers a variety of water filtration methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these differences is crucial to choosing the right filter for your needs.Let's examine the most common types:

*   **Pump Filters:** These filters use a hand-operated pump to force water through a filtration system. They are effective at removing a wide range of contaminants and are generally durable, making them a good choice for larger groups or situations where water sources are murky. These are a good option to consider as an outdoor water filter.
*   **Gravity Filters:** Utilizing gravity,these systems suspend a ""dirty"" water bag above a ""clean"" water bag,allowing water to slowly filter through. Gravity water filter camping options are ideal for base camps or situations where you need to filter larger quantities of water without constant pumping.
*   **Squeeze Filters:** These filters feature a durable bag that you fill with dirty water and then squeeze to force the water through the filter. Lightweight and compact, models such as the Sawyer squeeze water filter, are popular among backpackers and hikers.
*   **Water Filter Bottles:** These bottles have a filter integrated into the straw or bottle body. They provide a convenient and easy way to filter water on the go, making them suitable for hiking, travel, and everyday use. Having a water filter bottle camping can be the perfect all in one for single users.
*   **Straw Filters:** These lightweight and ultra-portable filters, exemplified by the LifeStraw water filter, allow you to drink directly from a water source. they are best suited for individual use and emergency situations.*   **Chemical Treatments:** Although not technically filters,chemical treatments like iodine tablets or chlorine dioxide drops can disinfect water by killing bacteria and viruses. They are lightweight and inexpensive but may not remove sediment or improve taste.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Camp Water Filter

Selecting the right camp water filter involves weighing several key factors. hear's a breakdown to help you prioritize:

*   **Filter Pore Size:** Measured in microns, pore size indicates the smallest particle a filter can remove. Smaller pore sizes offer better protection against bacteria and protozoa. Look for filters with a pore size of 0.2 microns or smaller for reliable performance.*   **Filter Lifespan:** Each filter has a rated lifespan, usually measured in gallons or liters. Consider how frequently you'll be using the filter and choose one with a lifespan that meets your needs. Keep in mind that water quality can impact filter lifespan. also consider if there is an easy to aquire replacement filter for camp water filter.
*   **Flow Rate:** Flow rate refers to how quickly a filter can produce clean water. A faster flow rate is desirable, especially when filtering water for multiple people or filling larger containers. A fast flow water filter camping setup can save time and effort.

## Ensuring your camp water filter is a Safe Water Filter Camping Option

Understanding filtration standards is vital for ensuring the water filter you choose for camping guarantees safe drinking water. Organizations like NSF International set stringent requirements for both water filters and purifiers, focusing on contaminant reduction. Filters meeting NSF/ANSI Standard 53 are certified to reduce specific health-related contaminants like lead, mercury, and certain pesticides, while those compliant with NSF/ANSI Standard 42 are effective at reducing aesthetic impurities such as chlorine and particulate matter. These standards validate the claims made by the different suppliers which makes it easier when comparing different devices.

Understanding the distinctions between a water filter and a purifier affects selection and how you are using the device. A water filter removes waterborne bacteria and protozoa using a pore size frequently enough exceeding 0.2 microns, but it may not tackle viruses effectively. In contrast, a water purifier, frequently enough labeled as a personal water filter uses chemical action using iodine or it boasts a significantly smaller pore size, typically around 0.02 microns. That smaller filtration rating is what allows the device to remove harmful viruses.

A camp water purification solution should be your standard option when water sources are questionable because of conditions such as wastewater contamination, agricultural runoff, and the presence of disease outbreaks. Always check warnings from government sources or park agencies for more guidance regarding water source dangers. Using purifiers is preferable in areas with these warnings, guaranteeing safety from viruses and tough-to-filter bacteria.

A few months later, the ring went on sale, so I told him, and he said, “Let’s go!” While we were driving, he even asked, “Are you excited?” which, of course, I was.

We got to the store, and he told me to find the right size. Once I did, the salesperson brought out the card machine… and suddenly, my husband was nowhere to be found. I called him, and he had already left the store. When I confronted him, he said the ring was too expensive and he couldn’t afford it.

I was upset—not because he couldn’t buy it, but because he wasn’t upfront about it. Why hype me up, take me to the store, and let me pick my size if he knew he wasn’t going to follow through?

Months later, our anniversary came up, and he asked me what I wanted as a gift. He even suggested he could get me the ring. I was skeptical but said sure. He then asked if it was okay if he got it two days after our anniversary instead, and I agreed.

For his gift, I bought him a coffee machine with all the supplies. But when the time came, my ring never appeared. When I asked him about it, he said—again—that he couldn’t afford it. At this point, I was beyond frustrated. I told him not to make promises he can’t keep. (For context, he could afford it; he just changed his mind.)

He does this a lot—he gets excited in the moment, makes big promises, and then later changes his mind, leaving me disappointed. So I made a decision: I would stop giving him gifts altogether.

For his last birthday, he got me a gift, but I didn’t get him anything in return. Now I’m wondering—AITA for refusing to give him gifts after everything?",232,1738738990.0,AmItheAsshole,32,1.0,False

- **Multi-functional furniture:** Use stools that can be tucked away when not in use for more space.

### Incorporate Warm Colors

Color plays a vital role in making a space feel inviting. Warm colors like soft reds, yellows, and oranges create a sense of comfort. Here’s how to incorporate them:

- **Accent walls:** Paint one wall a warm color to create a focal point.

Clutter can disrupt the welcoming vibe of your kitchen. Keeping your space organized not only improves functionality but also creates a calm atmosphere:

- **Fresh aromas:** Cook with herbs or bake occasionally to fill the kitchen with delightful scents.
- **Sound:** Soft background music can enhance the kitchen environment.

By applying these strategies, you can transform your kitchen into a welcoming atmosphere that invites family and friends to gather.

I commented this and I was trying to connect dots. There are many genuine reasons why women don't want like over burden of work post marriage (household work,job,in laws ,etc) , THIS is key reason according to me why women don't want to marry if they can get all their needs met by desperate guys for free why would they marry (ex. Sushmita Sen didn't marry she is good lady not assassinating her character but she is having good life without marriage,  if she doesn't like boy friend or he is toxic , she does break up and finds new one easily,)

90% of things he told is accurate physiologically. I tend to ignore women at workplace and public places and never look at them,never do favours for them ,focus on my work in turn they take a glance at me at public places and are pulled towards me. 

In office one girl asked for my insta id, she was my colleague since 2+ years and on last working day she asked me my insta and I told I don't use insta you can always dm on linkedin if you need to talk we were already connection on linkedin.

UNWANTED FAVOURS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN DISTORTS THEIR EXPECTIONS FROM ARRANGE OR LOVE MARRIAGE SHE THINKS IF A UNKNOWN GUY IS READY TO BUY ME COFFEE, CLOTHES,REFER JOB,HELP ME FREELY,ETC THEN I THINK  MY VALUE IS VERY HIGH IN MARRIAGE MARKET AND THUS THEY SET EXPECTATIONS OUT OF THEIR ACTUAL VALUE.

For women, most men on social media or public places don't like you actually they do favour's only to get sex and fulfill their desires. Just like you guys love attention from men same way men naturally like to give attention to women it's biological. But outside marriage,  both parties will be always unsatisfied if they continously feed their desire (sex,attention, etc) . To stay content being content with 1 partner is needed to stay happy (Sanatan dharma ,celibacy, no debauchery, no intoxication,etc for your mental health)

Bottom like is some men dating and doing more favours for women just to get laid are spoiling women's self worth and expectations from a men for marriage. Your GF is someone's AM/LM prospect and vice verse someone's GF is your potential LM/AM prospect so if you overdo and do wrong with her she will filter out and keep high standard for next relationship.",0,1738738923.0,AskIndianMen,15,0.36,False

We've all been there—those crazy high-pressure moments that make your heart race and your palms sweat. Whether it's a big presentation, an important exam, or a crucial game, these situations are no joke. 😅 But what if I told you there's a superpower you can tap into that can prep you for these moments like a boss? Yep, it’s called **visualization**!

🔮 **Why Visualization Rocks** 🔮

Visualization isn't just for elite athletes or top CEOs—it's something *we all* can use to boost our performance and conquer stress. When you visualize, you're basically training your brain to handle the situation you’re about to face. Imagine it like a dress rehearsal, but for your mind. 🎭

🧠 Here’s the science bit (without making it boring): Visualization activates the same neural pathways as if you were actually doing the task. This can build confidence, enhance focus, and reduce anxiety. Pretty neat, huh? 😎

✨ **How to Master Visualization** ✨

So, you wanna give this a shot? Here’s how to get started:

1. **Find Your Chill Zone**: 🧘‍♂️ Sit or lie down somewhere comfy and quiet where you won’t be disturbed.

2. **Create Your Visual Movie**: 🎥 Close your eyes and imagine the upcoming situation in *vivid detail*. Picture the environment, the people, the sounds—everything!

3. **Feel the Feels**: 🌈 Bring in your emotions. Visualize feeling confident, calm, and in control throughout.

4. **Slow-Mo Replay**: ⏪ Go through the scenario slowly, step by step. Imagine yourself nailing it, overcoming every challenge with ease.

5. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: 🛠️ Incorporate visualization into your daily routine. It could be during your morning coffee or right before bed.

🙌 **Level Up with These Tips** 🙌

- Use all your senses: Imagine smells, sounds, and touch to make it more real.
- Involve positive affirmations: Things like “I got this!” or “I am focused and ready!” really help.
- Combine it with breathing exercises to keep anxiety at bay.

🚀 **Transformation Awaits** 🚀

Visualization is like having a secret weapon in your pocket. 🔑 It's not about pretending you’re perfect; it's about training your brain to keep calm and carry on. Over time, you’ll find yourself marching into those high-pressure situations with newfound confidence and resilience. 💪

Maybe it was OpenAI investors, who were bored of the same thing and unimpressed with Operator, their browser-based AI framework. Maybe he just had a bad dream.

I’m used to OpenAI over-promising and under-delivering.

When they announced Sora, they pretended it would disrupt Hollywood overnight, and that people could describe whatever they wanted to watch to Netflix, and a full-length TV series would be generated in 11 and a half minutes.

Obviously, we didn’t get that.

Maybe it was OpenAI investors, who were bored of the same thing and unimpressed with Operator, their browser-based AI framework. Maybe he just had a bad dream.

But something within Sam’s soul changed. And AI enthusiasts are extremely lucky for it.

Because OpenAI just quietly released Deep Research. This thing is really fucking cool.

# What is Deep Research?

Deep Research is the first successful real-world application of “AI agents” that I have ever seen. You give it a complex, time-consuming task, and it will do the research fully autonomously, backed by citations.

This is extremely useful for individuals and businesses.

For the first time ever, I can ask AI to do a complex task, walk away from my computer, and come back with a detailed report containing exactly what I need.

Here’s an example.

**A Real-World Research Task**

When OpenAI’s Operator, a browser-based agentic framework, was released, I gave it the following task.

[Pic: Asking Operator to find financial influencers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*BEegN-Jv70paZhRF.png)

> Gather a list of 50 popular financial influencers from YouTube. Get their LinkedIn information (if possible), their emails, and a short summary of what their channel is about. Format the answers in a table

It did a horrible job.

[Pic: The spreadsheet created by Operator](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*ENkoQE80Zx5YsfXX.png)

- It hallucinated, giving LinkedIn profiles and emails that simply didn’t exist  
- It was painstakingly slow  
- It didn’t have a great strategy

Because of this, I didn’t have high hopes for Deep Research. Unlike Operator, it’s fully autonomous and asynchronous. It doesn’t open a browser and go to websites; it simply searches the web by crawling. This makes it much faster.

And apparently much more accurate. I gave Deep Research an even more challenging task.

[Pic: Asking Deep Research to find influencers for me](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Pw6ttvvQRbQeSZOWP7JVNQ.png)

Instead of looking at YouTube, I told it to look through LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram.

It then asked me a few follow-up questions, including if it should prioritize certain platforms or if I wanted a certain number of followers. I was taken aback. And kinda impressed.

I then gave it my response, and then… nothing.

[Pic: My response to the AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Q4QwqKEqJw8cVCxrXFUJHQ.png)

It told me that it would “let me know” when it’s ready. As someone who’s been using AI since before GPT-3, I wasn’t used to this.

I made myself a cup of coffee and came back to an insane spreadsheet.

[Pic: The response from Deep Research after 10 minutes](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9gNHi_JbEhGs5mO1ZFBGPw.png)

The AI gathered a list of 100 influencers, with direct links to their profile. Just from clicking a few links, I could tell that it was not hallucinating; it was 100% real.

I was shocked.

This nifty tool costing me $200/month might have just transformed how I can do lead generation. As a small business trying to partner with other people, doing the manual work of scoping profiles, reading through them, and coming up with a customized message sounded exhausting.

I didn’t want to do it.

And I now don’t have to…

This is insane.

# Concluding Thoughts

Just from the 15 minutes I’ve played with this tool, I know for a fact that OpenAI stepped up their game. Their vision of making agentic tools commonplace no longer seems like a fairytale. While I still have strong doubts that agents will be as ubiquitous as they believe, this feature has been a godsend when it comes to lead generation.

Overall, I’m extremely excited. It’s not every day that AI enthusiasts see novel AI tools released by the biggest AI giant of them all. I’m excited to see what people use it for, and how the open-source giants like Meta and DeepSeek transform this into one of their own.

If you think the AI hype is dying down, OpenAI just proved you wrong.",0,1738738543.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,5,0.5,False

1ii49lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1ii49lf/05022025/,05/02/2025,"So I had a weird dream last night. I always come out of dreams with other guys feeling SO icky. Nothing happened or anything in it, also it’s not about a real person it was like a hybrid between a book character and one of those 2006 MySpace emo guys. So I was walking around some shops with my parents and idk where this guy comes from but he’s like protecting me against something so he’s following me around right next to me and has two crossed over swords strapped to his back and he’s like 7ft tall and *built* and is wearing like a sort of leather… I mean idk what the man version of a catsuit is called but that. Except not weird, it was like… manly. Anyway and he smelled really woody to the point I kept saying you smell like a freshly polished table, well I think I said it twice. Anyway and then I was walking around one store and the boutique owner just seemed to love me? I was making comments about things to my mum, for example talking her out of RENTING a small ceramic salt and pepper shaker thing for $100 a month when she could either buy it for $120 or just yknow, not get it at all. Anyway the boutique owner comes over being like oh you’re so knowledgeable blah blah blah and gives me a piece of paper with her number on it saying if you ever need or want a job call me. And my parents were HYPED over it, like telling me how she wants me to be the boutique manager and I was thinking hmmm a transfer from HR to boutique management could be interesting but I’d have to never wfh again and is that a life I want etc etc. All the while book-emo-man is literally walking so close behind me he’s like attached to me and the tip of his sword nicks my elbow and he licks up the blood and I was like let’s get you some orange juice so you get some iron absorption from that and then I can’t remember much else after that, apart from he yanks me to the ground at one point and I’m like INTO IT but he’s assessing the perimeter from on top of me and I’m just prodding his lip ring saying this is nice. Anyway I woke up feeling yuck, I just always do if it isn’t Andy. At least it isn’t a real person or anything. And then I dozed thinking about how Andy once had a lip ring and how mayyybbbeee I could try persuade him to get it again… even just for a little bit and even if he only wore it at home for me. Maybe. Hm. Anyway. 

I wish I’d never even given this adhd a thought, now I feel like I’m maybe even allowing myself the space to not focus?! Like…. No. That’s not how we are working it here. Honestly. Okay. I have an f load to get through today and then FOUR DAY WEEKEND. Just keep pushing through. 

Godddd my feet are so silky smooth. They weren’t *bad* per se before, but they needed some serious TLC. Now they’re all soft and nice. Still fugly but whatever. That was something from therapy actually - I decided to wholeheartedly accept three things about myself and embrace them as mine - I chose my ears, my feet and my teeth. Granted I want my teeth whitened but I’m content with how they otherwise look. They’re straight, white enough, not weird sized and I don’t have a gummy smile at all which I know I shouldn’t say this but I hate that look? I’m awful, aren’t I? Anyway. I don’t like my feet, but they’re not *offensive* as such and also supermodels still have disgusting feet that are the size of canoes so if they can have less than nice feet so can I. And my ears, well I don’t mind my ears, they’re kind of cute actually. They don’t stick out at all, they’re normal size and I like my fleshy soft lil free lobes. I wonder if I’d like the attached lobes better? Hm. I don’t think so. Well it doesn’t matter because I accept them. Anyway I should rebook for a few months time and for later in the year too, given they book up so quick. I have lots of appointments to book - hair, brows, dentist for a check up and clean, I wanna get my ears cleaned even though I think they’re fine but I just want to maintain the habit of an annual spring clean, derm and lord knows my eyes could do with an optometrist visit. Yay bye money. 

Work work work work work work. At least I make delicious coffees at home now. I wonder if a career coach/counsellor would be beneficial or a waste of time….? 

Today I found out that a man married his wife but like HALF AN HOUR before the ceremony he calls his ex/mistress/someone he’s been seeing behind his fiancées back and says something like say anything and I will drop her and leave this wedding for you blah blah blah - she says no and so *he marries his now wife*. Can you IMAGINE. And she knows about it. They’re like some online famous couple, I even know who she is from blogs back in the day like I legit even remember it being called the blonde salad but anyway. And so he continued to see this woman on the side and even when he was in hospital and his wife was there by his side he was texting this other woman being like I wish she’d like I’m only living for you blah blah. I mean ??? What an absolute piece of *garbage*. Anyway I don’t tend to pay attention to this sort of stuff because idk, I just don’t and I also feel I find out a year later because I live under a rock, but idk I used to read her blog when I was like 17 or 18 idk. God I forgot all about blogs. And lookbook? Obsessed. What a time. Anyway ew to that man. 

well I haven’t journaled since. I ended up working til around 7:20… again?! Wow almost the exact same time as last night. Weird. Anyway I don’t have much to say. I’m going to mum and dads tomorrow afternoon and spending tonight with my honey. The poor thing is so beyond stressy with work, I wish I could magic it all away my poor baby. Note to self: DO NOT BE DIFFICULT AT ALL - BE EVEN MORE AWARE OF IT. Do not make his day harder. Just be there to chat and have fun and don’t hold him up at the end either.

Only now crossed my mind, that I could use the same water with lemons/limes to pour it directly on my inox place, where we let our dishes/glasses dry (gets a looooot of limescale). I used several different chemicals with very strong horrible smells, that I hated and they didn’t really work. 

This worked fantastically, had a super fresh smell and I didn’t even have to really scratch a lot. I just gave it a bit of scrubbing with the half line in the areas with lots of limescale deposits. I left it there though for several hours. Like 4 hours I would say. I cannot believe I haven’t done this earlier.

No chemicals, that firstly I was always worried cause of pets, secondly I don’t like the smell and thirdly I really don’t like to use heavy chemicals on this inox that my clean kitchen utensils go.

Hopefully it can help someone as well this!

I arrive a few minutes late and she's waiting for me, and lights up into a smile. After a kiss, I notice she had put on just a bit of makeup since she's taking a break from the slopes today. I tell her she's beautiful. Then lightheartedly I ask whether it was really worth the effort, when we're on a remote mountain and we're just down the street from the inn.

'Doesn't matter, you asked me out on a lunch date.' She's still beaming at me, but I know her words are serious. She holds my hand and asks about my morning rides. She pours me a glass of water and reminds me to hydrate. 

Throughout lunch we chat a bit, then move to the lounge for coffee. For about 10 minutes we don't say a word, just enjoying the moment and each other's company. She's absentmindedly caressing my back the whole time. 

When it's time to leave she points out a shortcut that would get me to the lifts faster, daylight is precious. I tell her I want to walk her back to the inn first and I reach out for her hand. She accepts with a shy smile. 

Our walk is silent and it feels like we're the only people in a fantasyland made of powdery snow. At the door I pull her in for a deep kiss to express a small fraction of what I feel for her. It doesn't sound like much at all but I'm glowing with gratitude for what she's done for me today. And she can somehow tell when I want her comfort, I don't need to ask for it. One hour with her, brings me so warmth and softness in the middle of a cold snowy day. I can't wait to be back in her arms by the fire tonight. Life cannot get any better than this.

In today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven world, outdoor advertising has evolved far beyond static billboards and posters. Businesses are now leveraging cutting-edge technology to capture attention, engage audiences, and deliver dynamic content in even the most challenging environments. Enter [**Leangle’s Out-of-Home Digital Signage IP66 Series**](https://leangle.com/products/out-of-home-digital-signage-ip66-series)—a game-changer in the world of outdoor advertising. But what makes this product stand out, and why should you care? Let’s dive in and explore the fascinating world of outdoor digital signage and how Leangle’s IP66 Series is revolutionizing the industry.

### What is Outdoor Digital Signage?

Outdoor digital signage refers to the use of digital displays, such as LED or LCD screens, to convey information, advertisements, or messages in outdoor settings. Unlike traditional signage, digital signage allows for dynamic, real-time content updates, making it a powerful tool for businesses, municipalities, and organizations looking to communicate effectively with their audience.

From bustling city centers and shopping malls to highways and sports stadiums, outdoor digital signage is everywhere. But not all digital signage is created equal. Outdoor environments present unique challenges, such as extreme weather conditions, dust, and vandalism, which is where the **Leangle IP66 Series** shines.

### Why the IP66 Rating Matters

One of the standout features of Leangle’s IP66 Series is its **IP66 rating**. But what does that mean, and why is it important?

* **IP66 Explained**: The IP (Ingress Protection) rating is an international standard that defines the level of protection a device has against solids and liquids. In the case of the IP66 rating:  

   * The first digit (6) means the device is completely dust-tight, ensuring no dust particles can enter and damage the internal components.
   * The second digit (6) indicates that the device can withstand powerful jets of water, making it resistant to heavy rain or even temporary flooding.

This level of durability ensures that Leangle’s digital signage can operate flawlessly in harsh outdoor conditions, from scorching summers to freezing winters, and everything in between.

### Key Features of [Leangle’s IP66 Digital Signage Series](https://leangle.com/collections/out-of-home-advertising)

1. **Rugged Durability**: Built to withstand the elements, the IP66 Series is perfect for outdoor use. Whether it’s rain, snow, dust, or extreme temperatures, this signage is designed to keep performing.
2. **Crystal-Clear Displays**: With high-resolution screens, Leangle’s digital signage delivers vibrant, eye-catching visuals that grab attention and leave a lasting impression.
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Despite their robust performance, these displays are designed to be energy-efficient, helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs.
4. **Easy Content Management**: The IP66 Series integrates seamlessly with content management systems (CMS), allowing users to update and schedule content remotely. This flexibility is ideal for businesses running time-sensitive promotions or campaigns.
5. **Versatile Applications**: From advertising and wayfinding to public information and entertainment, the possibilities are endless. The IP66 Series can be used in a variety of settings, including transportation hubs, retail spaces, and outdoor events.

### Why Outdoor Digital Signage is a Smart Investment

1. **Increased Engagement**: Dynamic content is far more engaging than static ads. With the ability to display videos, animations, and real-time updates, digital signage captures attention and drives higher engagement rates.
2. **Cost-Effective Advertising**: While the initial investment may be higher than traditional signage, digital signage offers long-term savings. You can update content instantly without the need for printing or physical replacements.
3. **Targeted Messaging**: Digital signage allows for targeted, location-based messaging. For example, a coffee shop can promote iced drinks on a hot day or warm beverages during colder months, enhancing the customer experience.
4. **Environmental Benefits**: By reducing the need for printed materials, digital signage is a more sustainable option for businesses looking to minimize their environmental impact.

### Real-World Applications of Leangle’s IP66 Series

* **Retail**: Imagine walking past a store and seeing a digital display showcasing the latest deals, new arrivals, or customer reviews. The IP66 Series makes this possible, even in outdoor shopping areas.
* **Transportation Hubs**: Airports, bus stations, and train terminals can use the IP66 Series to display schedules, directions, and emergency alerts, ensuring passengers stay informed.
* **Sports Arenas**: From live scores and replays to concession stand promotions, digital signage enhances the fan experience at outdoor stadiums.
* **Public Spaces**: Municipalities can use the IP66 Series to share important announcements, weather updates, or community events with residents and visitors.

### The Future of Outdoor Advertising is Here

As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for outdoor digital signage are limitless. Leangle’s IP66 Series represents the pinnacle of innovation, combining durability, functionality, and aesthetics to create a product that meets the demands of modern outdoor advertising.

Whether you’re a business owner looking to boost brand visibility, a city planner aiming to improve public communication, or an event organizer seeking to enhance the attendee experience, the IP66 Series offers a solution that’s as reliable as it is impressive.

It wasn’t well received. At all. She made a huge deal out of it and started going off about how Valentine’s gifts should be romantic. She called me cheap (even though it was a $130 value). I tried explaining my logic— a gift like flowers die, but TurboTax lasts a fiscal year- which she didn't seem to grasp.

I think a big problem was that it was a license code, so there was nothing to physically wrap. I think that made it feel even less like a “real” gift to her. I was also planning to surprise her with a coffee mug after, but she walked out before I even got the chance.

1ii3sd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1ii3sd9/mammalians_nurturable_are_not_necessarily/,Mammalians Nurturable are not (necessarily) permanent innies,"I've seen a lot of speculation that the goat people are permanent innies, clones, test subjects or otherwise not normal people. Reasoning for this often comes down to A) they act weird and hostile, B) they're dirty, and C) they're an isolated community further away from most of the innies we know and love.

This is possible, but I don't think it's guaranteed or even the most likely explanation. Skip to the end of this post if you just want to read my theory without the justification.

Let's Occam's Razor this a little bit.

1. We have little to no reliable in-universe information as to how a permanent innie would behave. Our only known example is Miss Casey, and the show has already given us a fairly straightforward explanation for her unusual behaviour - she is severed, and loses consciousness every time she leaves the floor. She's only called up for short stints (8 hours at the longest) and her personality is likely disrupted because of it. So, let's not assume an innie's abnormal behaviour is because they're permanent.

2. On a related note, from all innies' points of view, they are all permanent. For this reason, you might be better off looking at someone like innie-Irving or innie-Dylan (pre-OTC) as an archetypical example of how someone who spends their entire conscious existence on the severed floor, working for Kier, would behave. So, let's not assume that the differences in behaviour between MDR people and Mammalians are due to an unproven difference in severance status, let's look at what we actually know. 

3. Here's what we know:

- Mammalians are hostile to MDR (at first)
- Mammalians speak in an archaic register
- Mammalians are dirty
- Mammalians don't make use of perks or 'fripperies' like MDR do
- Mammalians are isolated from other innies
- Mammalians come when called 

Interestingly enough, we have parallels to all of these traits demonstrated by other characters throughout Season 1. 

4. Who's hostile to MDR? Or, who's hostile to other departments? We see two characters exhibit this in Season 1 - Dylan, and Felicia from O&D. Why are they this way? We see quite plainly that it's because Lumon runs propaganda and psychological operations (the paintings and Irving's printer error, for example) to make the Department's distrust each other. It's an anti-organising tactic. The line about pouches in S2E3 calls back to this same propaganda, indicating O&D and MN have been fed similar stories.

5. Who speaks in an archaic register? Or, whose speech patterns are a little unusual for the time period? Cobel, Milchick, Irving to a degree, Jame Eagan, Natalie when quoting from the Board... anyone who is a participant or believer in the Lumon cult. It seems that old-fashioned and excessively formal speech is a signifier of Lumon conditioning. Side note: despite being a self-professed ""first edition guy"" and Kier admirer, Burt's manner of speaking is decidedly eccentric unique. Is this significant? 

6. Who's dirty? Well okay, nobody that we've seen except for Mammalians. But everyone dresses in a manner appropriate for their environment. MDR: ordinary office attire. O&D: coats and protective equipment. Mammalians wear farm clothes over their office clothes. To me this suggests that they come in dressed for an ordinary desk job and then don farm gear when they're inside. The dirt and grime and unkemptness is understandable, working with animals. 

7. Who doesn't abide fripperies? Irving claims to come from an era where satisfaction came from a job well done, and if they were lucky, they'd get coffee creamer. Perks and Wellness are implied to be new interventions. As we can see in the revamped break room, it's part of making the innies feel like they're being listened to and treated like humans. Perhaps Mammalians don't abide these things because... they don't need them as much. Or because Lumon hasn't seen fit to implement them.

8. Who's isolated? In the beginning, everybody is. We only see MDR, O&D and Wellness really connecting with one another towards the end of Season 1 - and that's because of the work of Mark, Irv, Burt, and Ms Casey - breaking down walls and seeing one another as fellow humans. Perhaps Mammalians aren't quite there yet. 

9. Who comes when called? Maybe the most eerie and unique feature of Mammalians is that when their leader rings the bell, they all come running. That and the guy wearing a goat head. It appears that they are hierarchical and they do what they're told - again, perhaps like MDR in Irv's good old days. 

Conclusion - what am I getting at here?
 
Mammalians Nurturable are not necessarily permanent innies. All of their signature behaviours have parallels or justifications elsewhere in the Lumon family. I believe there is a simpler explanation in plain sight. 

Mammalians Nurturable are simply ordinary innies, upon whom Lumon's conditioning has been more effective than the other departments we've seen. They're isolated because Lumon wants to keep them apart. They're hostile because the propaganda worked. Like Irving pre-S1, Lorne and her colleagues live in a small world that consists only of their work (goats), their masters (Lumon and Kier), and each other. They don't need or want for anything beyond that. They haven't known the pleasures of the outside world, and they haven't explored enough to know what they're missing out on. We see hints of this conditioning breaking when the goat man talks about his outie's love of stargazing. They're old-fashioned, like Amish but with Kier's words instead of the Bible. Metatextually, I think the writers are trying to show us what MDR could have been like if it were truly shaped in Kier's image, if we didn't have Mark's curiosity, Irving's romanticism, Dylan's longing and Helly's rage to shake things up.

I think the true horror of a life lived entirely underground still remains to be seen - these goat people are just a taste of the weirdness that exists within Lumon's sphere of control.",4,1738736486.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,4,0.83,False

The cover had like a finger print or something on it . I read this book in middle school and remember it being a YA murder mystery set in a small town. The main character was a teenage girl investigating a series of murders aimed at students.

A few kids had already died, and by the end, it’s revealed that the killer was the science teacher. In the big climax, two of the missing kids were found locked in cages, with one of them dying of dehydration.

A couple of random details that stick out:
	•	There was several completely random transition scenes where the main character and her friend randomly go get coffee 
	•	At one point, she goes to a farm to pet horses which at no other point in the book is it mentioned she likes horses or was this ever brought up again.
	•	Someone breaks into her car and leaves a threatening note or something threatening while she’s petting the horses for like 5 minutes.

Do I even put in a notice at this point?,"I (25F) have posted here twice before about my job. I’m a barista on my college campus. I started here in September. Everything was going good then. My supervisors were cool, and we didn’t have any issues. Since September, we’ve had quite a few staff changes and we are currently severely understaffed.

For context, I have mild cerebral palsy. It affects my walking and I move a bit slower than everyone else due to it. My employer knows this. In the beginning everything was fine. Our old senior supervisor (she has since moved on to a new job) decided I shouldn’t be mopping the floors, as it was a fall risk/safety hazard. This was in October. Since then, two of my supervisors in particular have been extremely passive aggressive and downright nasty to me. Y (one of the supervisors) has been a complete and total bitch to me. 

Before all this, we were friendly with each other, up until about 3 weeks ago. We were talking on the phone one night and she said “I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but people say you’re not doing a good job”. I asked her to tell me who said that and she said she couldn’t name names. I told M (my coworker) and she didn’t think that was cool, so she told N (our manager). N was confused because she said no one has an issue with me and my performance has never been brought up. N spoke to Y about a week and a half ago (I know this because N told me privately she would talk to her), and since then, my shifts have been hell for me.

Tonight, Y was super passive aggressive. She would give me one task to do, and before I could finish one, she would give me another. Then another, and so on. Then would get annoyed when I didn’t have all of it done. The store got a truck order today. As we are understaffed, Y had to put the truck order up. It was just the two of us. Y did not take a single break to help me with the rush of customers or mobile orders. I was overwhelmed and frazzled. She didn’t give me a 15 minute break, when she has given me one every other time before. She then left for her 30 minute break, leaving me to deal with everything. When she returned from her break, she continued to put the truck up, and left me to do all the closing tasks by myself. Once she was done, she quickly took over everything and said I was fine to go home. She didn’t say thank you for any of this.

I am at my wits end. I am making $12 an hour to get bitched at and treated like shit. I don’t enjoy my job at all anymore, and I feel like I’m only seen as a liability. I don’t even want to talk to N about this because of her response last time (in my post from a week ago), and I know it won’t get better. I talked to my dad and he said maybe it’s best to just move on at this point, and not even give a notice. The only reason I’d consider giving a notice is because I go there frequently when I’m off work to get coffee or iced tea. What do I do? Please help.",1,1738736424.0,jobs,3,0.99,False
