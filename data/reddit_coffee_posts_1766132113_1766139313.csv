I spent almost the entire 2025 in acute stress and ""survival mode"" (pregnancy that caused chronic debilitating pelvic girdle pain, sleep deprivation from a newborn, partner rupturing his Achilles tendon, loss of family members and dog, etc) and to cope I overtrained (possibly the only good ""over"" I did), overate, and overspent, \*despite\* getting super low pay while out on disability. I was trying to cope by any means possible and in very unhealthy ways (yes I am in therapy before anyone recommends)

  
When I totaled up my leisure spending for the year I was appalled. $2500 spent in DoorDash and $6500 on everything else, totaling 9k. I could've paid my bills during the months being out of work with all of that instead of dwindling my emergency savings to cover it. I've got 3k on my credit card right now and I've never had that much on it in my life. I managed to lose 20 lbs of the baby weight and regained 8 lbs because of my horrific eating. I am tired of living in excess in all areas of my life. As 2025 is coming to a close areas of my life are starting to improve and I'm ready to leave survival mode and be a healthy human. 

  
I've got a lot of goals set for 2026 and I'm ready to start them, no/low buy included. No clothes or books, only one PS5 game or crochet project at a time, coffee and food delivery once a month (and pick up food from restaurant to avoid DoorDash fees) hair done and tattoos only when I have paid off credit card. 

I just wanted to get all of this off my chest and share my goals here as the no buy sub is helpful but also hardcore and as a now recovering shopping addict I'm trying to adhere to my goals but also keep them realistic. Thank you for letting me share my story in a safe space and please feel free to share your story also in the comments. Good luck in 2026 everybody ❤️",2,1766139042.0,shoppingaddiction,1,1.0,False

1pqhiuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pqhiuv/my_rich_estranged_dad_suddenly_wants_to_pay_my/,"my ""rich"" estranged dad suddenly wants to pay my rent... is this a trap?","so i (23f) am in a weird spot and literally don't know what to do.

basically, my dad left my mom when i was a kid. he wasn't really around much growing up—definitely wasn't there for the ""dad"" stuff—but he stayed successful and is, to put it bluntly, pretty loaded. we’ve had basically zero relationship for years, just the occasional awkward text on birthdays.

well, he recently reached out wanting to ""reconnect."" we grabbed coffee and it was fine, but then he dropped that he knows i'm struggling with the cost of living (who isn't lol) and offered to just... pay my rent. no strings attached, supposedly.

here’s the thing: i’m currently working two jobs and still barely making it. having my rent covered would literally change my life. i could actually sleep at night. but it feels so wrong? my mom struggled SO hard to raise me while he was off living his best life, and now he thinks he can just swoop in with his checkbook and make everything okay?

half of my friends are saying ""take the money, he owes you for all those years,"" and the other half are saying it’s ""blood money"" and he’s just trying to buy a relationship he didn't earn. i'm also terrified that if i take it, he'll use it to control me or act like he’s father of the year.

**Some context because I know people will ask:**

* **The Amount:** My rent is $1,800/mo (city living is a nightmare). He wants to pay the full year upfront.
* **My Mom:** She doesn't know he offered yet. I’m terrified to tell her because she’s still rightfully bitter about how he left.
* **The ""Why"":** He claims he’s ""getting older and realizing his mistakes,"" but he hasn't actually apologized for anything specific yet.
* **Child Support:** As far as i know, he paid the bare minimum when I was a kid, but nothing extra, and never helped with my college or anything else. He def. could have paid more, and we grew up not poor, but my mom struggled a lot with bills. 

**what should i do?** do i take the help because i’m drowning in bills now? or do i keep my dignity and stay broke? in a way, i feel like it would be repeating my mom's life. 

**TL;DR:** My rich dad who abandoned us when I was a kid popped back into my life and offered to pay my $1.8k rent. I'm broke and need it, but it feels like he’s trying to buy his way out of guilt, and I don't know if I can do that to my mom.",1,1766138879.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I’ve always admired… nothing.

On Anzac Day, we spend 1 minute of our day doing nothing, and that’s supposed to pay respects to the soldiers.
When a girl talks to you about something serious, you say nothing and listen - and yet she says that you understand.
But the one time I did nothing, in my jam packed life - my brother died. 
So how does doing nothing, or saying nothing, help anyone. 
I mean celebrities can put nothing in their Instagram posts and get a million adoring fans,
when I put nothing in my coffee cup, I’m just zoning out from how tired I am. 
When my teacher sat with her arms crossed and did nothing, we all listened and complied.
But when I did nothing about me and my girlfriend’s joint afterpay account, she broke up with me.
So how does doing nothing, or saying nothing help anyone.
When me and my girlfriend, now ex partner, broke up with me, I said nothing and left.
On the drive home from my past, the radio played nothing.
When I got to my parent’s house, even with the songs rattling the china, the roar of the kettle, and the deep stares… they knew it was coming, so they said nothing. 
Nothing ruined my life, and I have nothing to show for it, nothing I could have done to change the situation, but in the end, 
Nothing killed my brother, so I guess that’s something?",1,1766138556.0,OCPoetryFree,0,1.0,False

***Looking that far past to write the first comprehensive history of our great empire starts with the mist from which emerged the God Emperor. And through the documents of the early witnesses. His Majesty always refused to write his own biography and discouraged others to do it.*** 

***But it must be done. For our sake.***

***Valerius Thorne, First Imperial Archivist***

**MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT** **DIPLOMATIC CABLE / SECURE TRANSMISSION**

**ID:** ND-204X-1014-ALPHA **DATE:** October 14, 204X **FROM:** Henri Devalier, Consul General of France, New Delhi **TO:** Crisis and Support Centre (CDCS), Paris / Asia-Oceania Directorate **SUBJECT:** URGENT - IDENTIFICATION AND RECOVERY OF FRENCH NATIONAL (KINNAUR DISTRICT) **CLASSIFICATION:** RESTRICTED // PRIORITY HIGH

**1. SUMMARY OF INTERVENTION**

Pursuant to the request of the Governor of Himachal Pradesh (dated Oct 1st), I proceeded personally to the village of Chitkul, Kinnaur District, to assess the situation of an unidentified Caucasian male living in semi-isolation.

Indian authorities declined to utilize standard law enforcement protocols, citing the ""sensitive local political status"" of the individual. I can now confirm the subject is a French National.

Biometric field scan matches the identity of **REID, Georges**. *Status:* Missing/Presumed Deceased. *Reference:* Passenger Manifest, Flight AF-884 (Paris-Singapore), Incident Date: Feb 12. Disappeared after the emergency landing in Delhi.

**2. OBSERVATIONS ON SITE**

The journey to Chitkul requires traversal of the Hindustan-Tibet road. Upon arrival, the situation presented immediate anomalies inconsistent with standard ""missing person/psychotic fugue"" cases.

The subject was not living as a beggar. He was residing in a cave system near the Mathi Temple. However, the local population (approx. 900 residents) has not marginalized him. Conversely, they have integrated him into their administrative hierarchy.

**Notable Observation:** The village of Chitkul demonstrates a level of logistical efficiency previously unrecorded in this region.

* Waste management has been centralized using a gravity-fed chute system.
* Winter fuel stockpiles are arranged in precise, mathematical grids to maximize drying airflow.
* Irrigation disputes between families have ceased entirely.

When questioned, the Village Headman stated that ""The Silent One"" (the subject) had ""drawn the lines"" for them. The subject appears to have reorganized the village’s socio-economic structure using verbal instructions and non-verbal diagrams drawn in the dirt.

**3. INTERACTION WITH SUBJECT**

I located the subject inside the cave dwelling. The interior was spartan but meticulously organized. The walls were covered in charcoal markings. Initial analysis suggests these are not religious iconography, but complex flowcharts depicting hydraulic pressure and resource allocation algorithms.

**Physical Condition:** The subject is emaciated but exhibits high muscular density. Hygiene is poor, yet orderly. No signs of drug use or fever.

**Psychological State:** When I initiated contact in English, there was no response. When I switched to French (*""Monsieur, je suis le Consul de France""*), the subject displayed a violent physiological reaction (pupil dilation, tremors).

He did not respond to emotional cues. He did not ask about family. His first verbal communication was to correct my statement regarding the time of day, pointing out that my analog watch was losing 4 seconds per day based on the solar position.

**4. THE ""TRIGGER"" EVENT**

I presented the biometric scanner. The subject allowed the scan without resistance. Upon the device emitting the confirmation ping, the subject looked at the screen.

He touched the French flag icon on the interface. He stated: *""The Republic is a grid. But the grid is misaligned.""*

This appears to be the breakthrough moment. He is lucid, but his affect is totally flat. He speaks of France not as a home, but as a ""system"" that he recalls studying.

**5. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION**

We are currently in transit back to New Delhi. The subject is compliant but unnerving. He spent the descent redesigning our convoy’s driving pattern to minimize fuel consumption, tapping on the glass to instruct the driver.

**Warning:** While physically stable, Georges Reid is not the man described in his pre-disappearance dossier. The ""Logistician"" profile is accurate but understated. He exhibits traits of high-functioning savant syndrome induced by trauma.

I recommend immediate psychiatric evaluation upon arrival at the Embassy. I also recommend we do not underestimate him. The Governor of Himachal Pradesh was not relieved to see him go; he looked like he was losing a valuable asset.

**End of Cable** **H. Devalier**

EMBASSY OF FRANCE – NEW DELHI

MEDICAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL UNIT

CONFIDENTIAL REPORT

Date: October 18, 204X

Attending Physician: Dr. Évelyne Frot (Visiting Psychiatrist, Paris Hospitals)

Patient: REID, Georges (DOB: 12/05/1977)

Subject: 72-Hour Observation & Competency Evaluation

1. INITIAL PRESENTATION (Day 1)

The patient was admitted following extraction from Kinnaur District. The physical state was dehydrated but robust. Mental state upon admission was characterized by ""hyper-vigilance."" Patient scanned the room constantly, seemingly counting objects or assessing dimensions. Affect was flat.

* **Medication:** Patient refused standard anxiolytics (Diazepam) and antipsychotics (Olanzapine). Stated simply: ""I require full signal fidelity.""
* **Compliance:** High. Patient agreed to all non-chemical interventions and interviews.

2. PATIENT STATEMENT (Recorded Day 2)

When asked to recount the events precipitating his disappearance, the patient provided the following narrative:

*""Why me? After the brutal announcement of the death of what remained of my family, burnt alive in a car accident, I decided to go around the world chasing... whatever. And the fucking plane decided to break down above India, so 24h with a free hotel voucher to discover the city. The last clear idea I remember was walking outside of the terminal getting punched in the gut by humidity, temperature and noise. My vision turned to black, I remember walking blind, hustled by cars, people, an alley and a brutal aggression; they took everything, including what was left of my sanity. Delayed PTSD after the family trauma? No idea Doctor, I am a logistician, not a shrink (wink).*

*After that, just feelings: intense pain, intense heat, intense thirst and hunger. Must have been on a local bus then ejected when they saw I had no money? The trip north must have been an odyssey, but I must have looked more and more like one of those indian wandering hermits, and temples everywhere always provide enough to survive.*

*How I ended up in Kinnaur, no idea, just flashing images, until the last night. I was caught high in the mountain in a terrifying thunderstorm, what was left of my body beaten like pulp. Without the cave it would have been the end of the road. Maybe, unconsciously, I wanted to join my family? Your job to figure that out Doctor (a smaller smile). At the bottom of the grotto was a deep pond. Did not see it, went down like a stone.* 

*But there something happened, a presence, a warmth, a friend at last. I know you told me it was my real me reemerging from the psychosis, and I trust you. I was warm, quiet, but my mind was buzzing with symbols, images… The following day was clear and crisp, and I no longer felt the cold. A woman came and after a moment of surprise she spoke to me. And I answered. In her language. She took me for a hermit and brought me some very simple food.*

*And the following day she started to tell me about her life and her big problem, involving a mix of family feud, marriage, money, an impossible cliff to climb for that poor woman. But I clearly saw the problem, as a graph. And I told her quietly, gently the solution. After that you know what happened, I became the resident Mc Kinsey of the place (laugh).""*

3. CLINICAL PROGRESSION (Days 2-3)

The recovery trajectory has been unprecedented. The catatonic/dissociative symptoms observed by Consul Devalier evaporated within 24 hours.

By the morning of Day 2, Mr. Reid was engaging in casual conversation. He inquired about the current French political election cycle, the football scores (Ligue 1), and requested a specific brand of coffee. The ""Hermit"" persona described in the police reports seems to have been a temporary adaptive mechanism to the extreme isolation.

* **Observation:** The patient is surprisingly charming. He apologized profusely to the nursing staff for the trouble caused by his ""camping trip gone wrong."" He displays a self-deprecating humor regarding his memory loss, framing it as a ""mid-life crisis that got out of hand.""

4. COGNITIVE TESTING & ANOMALIES

To assess potential neurological damage from high-altitude exposure, standard psychometric testing was administered.

* **Test A (Morning, Day 2) - Standard Raven’s Matrices:**
   * **Result:** **UNSCORABLE / CEILING.**
   * **Notes:** The patient completed the 45-minute battery in 8 minutes. Responses were 100% accurate. The speed of processing suggested a cognitive event bordering on mania or a testing error.
* **Test B (Afternoon, Day 2) - WAIS-V (Adult Intelligence Scale):**
   * **Result:** **118 (High Average).**
   * **Notes:** Suspecting the morning's result was a calibration error or a fluke of the testing software, a proctored exam was given. Mr. Reid performed within the standard deviation for his professional background (Logistics Manager). He struggled appropriately with complex spatial rotation tasks and verbal analogies.
* **Conclusion on Testing:** The morning result should be disregarded as a technical anomaly. The patient's IQ is stable at \~115-118. He is bright, but well within normal limits.

**5. DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSION**

* **Axis I:** Brief Psychotic Disorder (Resolved). Triggered by hypoxia and isolation.
* **Axis II:** No personality disorders detected.
* **Current Status:** Lucid, Oriented x3 (Time, Place, Person).

6. RECOMMENDATION

Mr. Reid exhibits no danger to himself or others. The ""delusions of grandeur"" reported in the mountains (drawing maps, ordering villagers) have ceased entirely. He appears eager to return to France and ""get back to work.""

I see no psychiatric grounds to hold him. I recommend discharge with a referral for outpatient therapy in Paris to process the trauma of his time in the wilderness.

Signed,

Dr. Évelyne Frot

**CONSULATE GENERAL OF FRANCE – NEW DELHI** **ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM**

**DATE:** October 20, 204X **TO:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Paris) / Department of Nationals Abroad **FROM:** Henri Devalier, Consul General **REF:** Case File #ND-204X-1014 (REID, Georges) **SUBJECT:** CASE CLOSURE AND DEPARTURE STATUS

**1. FINANCIAL SOLVENCY CHECK** Following standard repatriation protocols, we conducted a cursory review of Mr. Reid's domestic assets to determine liability for extraction costs.

* **Liquidity:** Confirmed.
* **Total Net Worth:** \~€1,150,000 (Estimate).
* **Source:** Combined proceeds from the sale of primary residence (Paris, 15th Arr.) and life insurance payouts regarding the familial accident mentioned in the medical report. Funds are currently held in a holding account with BNP Paribas.

**2. REPATRIATION STATUS: DECLINED** Mr. Reid has formally declined the offer of a repatriation flight to Charles de Gaulle Airport. During the exit interview, he appeared calm but firm. When pressed on his reasons for not returning to his support network in France, he stated:

*""France is full of unpleasant memories. It is a museum of who I used to be. I am not a museum curator.""*

**3. FORWARD MOVEMENT** Mr. Reid has reactivated his original travel itinerary. He has purchased a one-way business class ticket to **Singapore (Changi)**, departing tomorrow, October 21.

He indicated an intention to settle in the city-state ""for a while,"" citing its status as a logistics hub as ""soothing to his current state of mind.""

**4. CONCLUSION** All Consular fees for the Himachal Pradesh extraction have been paid in full by the subject via wire transfer. We have no further legal hold on Georges Reid. He is a free agent.

**Case #ND-204X-1014 is CLOSED.**

I’m sure this matter has been discussed countless of times and that everyone is tired of it, but I couldn’t find a post where it was discussed from this POV, so please bear with me. If this exact discussion has already been had, please refer me to that post.

I know I’m late to the party, but I recently finished AW2 and I absolutely loved it. It was just as thought through with layers upon layers as I had hoped for. Having read comments about it before playing it, I noted many people commenting on Saga’s ethnicity, claiming she was race-swapped in the name of wokeness. Now, having played the game myself and analyzed the story, I disagree. I feel the question we should ask ourselves is not why she was black in AW2 - but rather why she was white in the QB Easter egg. 

First of all, I’m against quote unquote wokeness in creative media as I think it risks hindering the creative process and puts focus on things that might be irrelevant to the story for the sake of inclusion. At the same time, I think it is pathetic to cry “woke!” as soon as any kind of minority is represented in media. In my opinion, wokeness needs intent, i.e. inclusion for the sake of inclusion. 

To circle back to the topic of Saga Anderson, my view is that it made utter and complete sense that she is black for several reasons:

1. It’s heavily implied that she is the daughter of Mr. Door, a black man.
a) Mr. Door accuses Alan of having put someone he cares about in danger through his writing, and the player will assume this to be Saga
b) Mr. Door pulls Tim Breaker in to the dark place just as he is about to give Saga the manuscript page that teaches about interdimensional traveling 
c) the father doll in the nursery rhyme side quests is black, and in the final rhyme (the only one that the father doll is used for) places it as the father of the hero doll. The hero of Alan’s story is confirmed to be Saga
d) Tor says he is the one who pushed Saga’s father away. We learn that Mr. Door used to live in Bright Falls and the last time he was seen he was struck by lightning. In Norse mythology, Tor is the god of thunder
e) it would make sense that Mr. Door was the one who inspired Alan to pick Saga as the hero through the infinite story loops, rather than Alan picking someone at random who just happens to be both the partner of Alex Casey /and/ the granddaughter of Tor Anderson

2. It is also implied, although more subtly, that Mr. Door is an alternate version or incarnation of Martin Hatch from Quantum Break - a black man who existed long before Alan Wake 2.
a) Unused early promo photos show Lance Reddick, who plays Hatch, cast as Mr. Door (and I assume he would’ve played the role if he hadn’t passed away) 
b) Tim Breaker being an alternate version of Jack Joyce from QB (implied in Night Springs Ep 3) explains his connection to Mr Door if Mr. Door is Hatch
c) Odin claims Mr. Door took his eye. In QB, focus is often put on Hatch’s eyes as he frequently uses eyedrops and is killed with either a gun shot or a knife to an eye depending on the player’s choices

So to summarize, if Mr. Door is Saga’s father, and also some kind of incarnation of Martin Hatch who was portrayed by a black man long before Alan Wake 2, it would make perfect sense to both the lore and the connected Remedy-verse for Saga to be black as well. 

The question I’m left with is rather why Saga was white in the easter egg video in Quantum Break. That’s what doesn’t make sense, not the other way around. It’s clearly the same Saga as she is Casey’s partner and their synchronized coffee drinking is seen both in the easter egg and in AW2. 

Was this just sloppy from Remedy’s part (Remedy being sloppy, yeah right!?)? Why was she included and named in the easter egg if there were no initial thoughts of bringing her back at a later stage? Her connection to the AW lore feels way too intricate to have been a post construction. Same Lake is the David Lynch of video games - everything is thought through, nothing happens for no reason. So why did they not cast her as black from the start? 

Am I missing something? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1pqh89c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pqh89c/we_see_you/,WE SEE YOU.,"I used to have night terrors as a child. Not often, but often enough to have a lasting mark on my developing psyche. I don’t really recall all that much of what happened in them. Like a dream so bad your memory rejects outright to recall it, just leaving you with a deep churning dread, like it might have followed you into the waking world.

What I do remember is scarce. I was in the dark, an endless, hollow dark. Not quite pitch black, more like the inverse of one of those white void rooms they use to film music videos in. It felt like it went on forever in every direction. I vaguely remember blurs scuttling across my vision, shapes that seemed to de-coalesce the second I tried to focus on them, but it’s all vague now.

The thing I do recall, and what stayed with and cemented whatever memory I have, carved into my reminiscence like a scar, was the feeling as the pit in my stomach dropped, and the sensation of being shot forward. The world if you can call it that, dissolving around me as I felt myself being dragged forward, then up at an impossible speed. Everything in my vision stretching into smears of grey and black.

I would snap awake, tears pouring down my face, that violent propulsion still rushing through my body, following me into awareness. And for a few awful seconds, I could feel the room around me warp. Objects around me stretching or shrinking, walls breathing in and out, as if I was perceiving everything around me with a pair of binoculars that wouldn’t stop refocusing. Even to the point where I would zoom in to see the whites of my parent’s eyes as they came rushing in to begrudgingly comfort me.

I was a nervous kid, even without the night terrors, and my family life was never particularly stable. We moved around a lot what with my Dad working for the military, and just as we had started settling or I’d started making a rare friend, his work would uproot us and our lives to the next military contract. I’d barely have time to learn the layout of one school before being thrown into another. Speaking of, it felt like he was absent pretty much the entirety of my childhood. He would work until late, and the rare occasions we would go for a family dinner or outing, he would be bombarded with “important” phone calls and have to rush off to wherever to do whatever. I never knew what my Dad even did, and even as I got older and I would enquire all I was told was that he worked for the “research” division, whatever that meant.

My Mum didn’t make matters much better either, I always felt like more of a burden, dead weight. She always seemed to answer me with a sigh before I’d even finished a sentence, responding like she was already tired of me. I was an only child, so I didn’t have anyone to share those feelings with, so of course I grew up thinking those recurring night terrors were just another symptom of a childhood lived on ever shifting ground, like trying to scramble up a gravel slope. It all seemed explainable enough.

The last straw came on my 18^(th) birthday. Obviously, my parents hadn’t planned anything, as much as I was holding out hope for a card, a cake, anything. But I had booked a table for the three of us at a pizzeria not far from us and let them know. My hope being that, as it was a milestone in my life, they would finally make some kind of effort, some sort of concession to celebrate their only child. I went to the restaurant straight after the day shift at a local bar I’d found some work at and waited for them. And waited. 45 minutes passed and, realising they wouldn’t show, I left. Returning home, my Dad’s car was, predictably, not in the drive, and as I passed the living room I saw my Mum, asleep on the sofa, her and the empty wine bottle and half empty pill one on the coffee table illuminated by the glow of the television.

2 weeks later, after ruminating on my current sorry state, and in a state of impulsive self-destruction and teenage angst, I snuck out with a bottle of my Dad’s whisky from his cabinet, the hum of the fridge in the next room the only sound in an otherwise ever silent house. I say snuck out. Dad was at work and was rarely ever present, and my Mum wasn’t exactly checking up on me. I made it to the train tracks close to where we were living that month.

I arrived at the bridge above the train tracks and swung my legs over the edge, screwing open the bottle and started downing the vile brown liquid, gagging as it burned my throat, building up the liquid courage to…you know, waiting for a train to come. I had no friends, or girl in my life. I felt like an unwanted guest in my own home, and no prospects. Inevitably our nomadic lifestyle had an adverse effect on my schooling, and I was bottom of my grade for as long as I can remember and working a dead-end job I hated.

As I felt the tell-tale rumbling of my impending release from a train coming down the tracks, and as I lifted the bottle to my lips for one last gulp, I felt my collar being tugged back. My first thought in that split second before I hit the cold metal of the walkway was that, someone cared. Someone had come to stop me from doing something stupid. But no. It turned out to be a group of other teens my age who I had seen around town, snickering at me as I walked around alone. And they proceeded to kick the shit out of me, leaving me a bloody, crumpled unconscious mess on that bridge.

I woke up the next day in a hospital bed, in the sterile unfamiliar surroundings, the only company an empty chair by the side of the bed. Needless to say, neither of my parents were there waiting for me when I arose. The doctor told me I suffered a mild concussion and three broken ribs. He said I was lucky I didn’t die of hypothermia, as it turned out, some homeless guy saw this happening and chased the hoodlums off, contacting the local police. In that moment I couldn’t help but feel a glum fondness for him, thinking of my ghostly savior as the one person who may actually give a shit about me. I certainly didn’t feel lucky.

I was in the hospital for observation for another 3 days, with the only contact from either parent being a text from my Mum who asked when I would be released and when she should bring me home. She never said a word on the car ride home and, wordlessly, as soon as we arrived, I went to my room, packed a bag of clothes and left. Feeling strangely calm and resolute as I did so. It was inevitable, really. She just stood at the door watching me walk down the road, she didn’t say anything, and I didn’t look back.

I had a little money saved from my bar gig, and they agreed to keep on me on full-time. From there I slept rough for a few weeks before I found a house share down the road from my work. The house was a state, mismatched people, mismatched furniture and awkward first impressions. My room barely had space for a single bed and a wardrobe, with peeling wallpaper and the tell-tale sign of mold in the ceiling of the corner opposite the bed. But as time passed, I felt something I never felt I had before, a kinship. These people who I had never met became the most important people in my life, my first real connection. It grounded me and made me realise how stupid I had been. I allowed myself to forget, or begin forgetting at least, that part of me that felt un-moored, and let myself just belong.

For a while, things felt normal, I had my routine. I would usually work till close, picking up as many shifts as I could. I’d bring home food from work the kitchen would have leftover, and me and my motley crew would sit on the floor or patchwork sofa watching whatever new show was on the subscription service we all shared a login for. It wasn’t much. It wasn’t anything, but it was, normal. It was perfect.

One day though, I found myself in that empty space again. I had been off sick with a nasty flu the last few days which had left me delirious, and also in that dark expanse as I closed my eyes. I hadn’t been here for years, and only ever remembered being here the moment I arrived. This time felt different though. Where before, the shapes I saw moved to and fro outside the confines of my vision, now they were still. These impossible shapes which seemed to warp as I looked at them, all of varying sizes were just standing there. As I took in more of my surroundings, I realised there were a lot of them all of them turned to face me, tantalisingly just out of my vision to make it any details, cloaked in the gloom. But one thing I could tell though, where before they didn’t seem to notice me, they certainly did now. They were watching me.

I felt my entire body tighten up. A blood curdling chill shot down from the tip of my head and zapped it’s way to my feet and as it did, I felt, not saw the figures launch themselves at me. Instinctively I put my arms up to protect myself, for what little good it would do, when I felt that other old familiar feeling. That one of being shot forward and up at impossible speeds. That one that haunted me so much as a child now apparently coming to my aid.

I jolted awake in bed, my first instinct being grateful that it was all over. My second as I caught my breath, being looking around the room as I watched the walls breathing in and out and items in my room bring themselves to the forefront of my vision. After a few seconds as I gained control of my vision and my breathing, I heard the tell tale sign of my door creaking open. Holding my breath I’d worked so hard to get control of, I felt a bead of salty sweat drip it’s way way slowly down my cheek, keeping pace with the opening of the door. In it stood Tina, one of my housemates leaning against the door-frame. With eyebrows raised she said “Bad dream?”. Nodding, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and rubbed my face in my hands and looked back up at her. “Smoke?” she said, as she motioned to her outstretched hand with a spliff in it, the sickly sweet smell filling the room.

We spent the rest of the night getting high and I regaled her of my dream, or rather terror. I explained I hadn’t had them since I was a kid, but something about being sick had triggered something in my psyche. I explained about the zooming in and out of my vision, and the walls breathing in and out, and we did some stoned research online.

“This sound familiar? Scale distortion, visual hallucinations, that kinda stuff?” Tina said, pointing to an article on her phone as she passed me the joint. Taking a drag, I read the headline. Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Reading on, it described a rare neurological condition, most commonly seen in children. Distorted perceptions of size. Objects appearing larger or smaller than they should be. Macropsia. Micropsia. Clinical words for something that had never felt clinical to me.

“Sounds like the kind of thing an edgy kid who hates their parents and spends too much time on Tumblr would make up,” Tina teased, jabbing me in the ribs with her elbow. We laughed, and I felt more relieved than I cared to admit. There was a name for it. Other people had experienced it. The article described it as benign. I scrolled through a few first-hand accounts, half-expecting to see my own words staring back at me. Most of them were short. Vague. Complaints about headaches. About rooms feeling wrong for a few minutes at a time. None of them mentioned figures lurking at the edges of vision. None of them talked about the sensation of being dragged, hurled forward, like the ground had dropped out from under reality itself.

I told myself that didn’t matter.

I was just glad I wasn’t crazy. Just glad this wasn’t some kind of psychosis.

“Put it this way,” Tina said, pausing to take a long drag, “a lot of people would pay good money for a trip like that. Minus the demon spawn or whatever.” She laughed. “You should do what I do,” she added. “Keep a dream journal by your bed. If it happens again, write it down while it’s still fresh. It can help make sense of it, plus it’s funny reading it back sometimes.”

I nodded, already thinking about how some things, once written down, stop being funny at all.

A couple of weeks passed, and I kept up the journal. There were no more night terrors. No instances of macropsia or micropsia, or whatever the article had called it. Just fragmented dreams about nothing in particular. Mundane impressions of the previous day, or scenes obviously borrowed from a show or movie I’d watched before bed.

Tina and I would sometimes compare notes in the mornings, reading each other’s entries and poking fun at how boring they were. I’d read somewhere that smoking weed dulled REM sleep, the stage where most dreaming happened, so we made a half-serious pact to quit for a while, if only to see what would happen.

John, another one of our roommates, suggested we try lucid dreaming. He said if I ever slipped back into one of those night terrors, it might help if I could take control instead of just riding it out. We tried for a while with no success, until one night, on a whim, I decided to try a technique I’d read about online. It said to lie flat on your back, hands at your sides, and stare at the ceiling. That was it.

It sounded easy enough. I wanted to see if I could get back to that place that had frightened me for as long as I could remember. I told myself that, if I could get there on purpose it would be different. I could be the one in control, for once.

So I gave it a go. I lay flat on my back, hands by my side and stared at the ceiling. I focused on the patterns in the plaster above my bed. Tracing the bulges and cracks with my eyes over and over. After a while I focused on my breathing to try and distract myself from my cement heavy eyelids, now counting each time I made a circuit with my eyes of the patterns above that had formed.

I was alone that night with everyone else having headed to the bar. And the house was heavy with silence, the kind of quiet that only happens when it gets late at night. It hung heavy and thick over everything, the only sound other than my deep breaths being the low hum of the radiator the room over, steady and distant.

There was no particular moment I was able to point to. No clear boundary I felt like I had crossed. At some point I felt the distance between me and the cracked plaster on the ceiling grow further and further. Not higher as such just… further away than it had any right to be. The patterns in the plaster softened at the edges and curled and stretched towards me when I tried to focus on them. I felt the heaviness and darkness behind my eyes grow heavier and denser, until I had to blink.

I didn’t even realise where I was at first, all I could feel was the absence of the bed beneath me. That was until I tried taking in my surroundings and realised I had arrived. I was in that dark place again.

I could perceive more now that I was here. Not everything but more than I ever had before. Ahead of me was a crowd of those figures that had haunted me for as long as I could remember, their backs turned as they shuffled toward some kind of structure on the horizon. It was impossibly far away, its shape indistinct against the gloom.

The figures moved together with quiet purpose. I couldn’t tell how far away they were, only that the distance between us felt deliberate. As if they had just missed me. For the first time, I could make out details. They came in all shapes and sizes, each vaguely humanoid, their forms cloaked in drifting wisps of smoke or fog. When they moved, the vapor thinned and parted, briefly revealing bone-white bodies beneath, misshapen, unfinished, before the smoke closed around them again.

They hadn’t seen me. I intended to keep it that way.

I followed them as they made their way toward whatever had drawn them all here. It felt like hours passed, though I never tired. Time didn’t appear to behave the way it should in that place.

As I walked, their numbers began to grow. Though I never saw any new member of the procession arrive. Figures would simply be there, as if they’d always been part of the crowd and I’d only just noticed them. Some of the figures dragged others behind them. These were wrapped in a different kind of smoke, grey rather than black, thicker, heavier. The shapes within it didn’t move on their own.

I kept following. I wanted to learn the rules of this place. It was clear by now that I couldn’t change anything here, even knowing I was dreaming. The space resisted that kind of influence. So I decided to observe instead, to understand it as best I could.

Time continue to pass, though it was impossible to tell how much. More and more figures joined, slipping into place without ceremony, and the only real change was the structure on the horizon drawing closer. As we neared it, its shape resolved into something flatter. Longer. A wall.

It stretched as far as I could see in either direction, its surface emitting a faint, pallid glow that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. I heard it first before I understood what I was looking at.

The sound reached me, inhuman moans and cries that made my teeth ache, a chorus of voices layered so thickly together that I couldn’t tell where one ended and another began. I stopped walking.

The wall was made of flesh. Faces were pressed into its surface at irregular intervals, mouths opening and closing in silent screams, the source of the noise buried somewhere beneath layers upon layers of living matter.

When the procession reached the edge of the wall, those figures dragging others began to work together. They lifted and pushed their burdens forward, pressing them up against the living surface. Arms erupted from the wall to meet them. The figures disappeared beneath a tide of grasping limbs, their outlines dissolving as they were pulled in and absorbed, their bodies added to the vast, screaming mass. None of the faces I could make out in the wall looked unfamiliar. I just couldn’t remember where I’d seen them before.

I staggered back and turned to run, but my feet tangled beneath me and I went down hard, landing arse over tit on the ground. From where I lay, I looked back at the wall. Every single one of them was watching me now.

The figures had stopped. The faces embedded in the wall had stopped. The moaning had ceased entirely, replaced by a silence so complete it rang in my ears, loud enough to deafen. Then the figures began to move. Slowly at first. Cautiously. As they did, sound returned, not from them, but from the wall itself. Hushed whispers bled out from the flesh on either side of me.

“Geeeet outttt.”

The words overlapped, scattered, coming from dozens, hundreds of mouths at once. As the figures drew closer, the whispers grew louder, rising into shouts, then screams, a frantic, desperate chorus warning me away. The figures were almost on me now. “GEEEET OOOOOOUTTTT”.

I tried to will myself to launch. To do what I had always done before without thinking, to let that familiar force tear me upward and out. Nothing happened.

Whatever I’d relied on all those years ago, I couldn’t reach it consciously. Panic took over. I scrambled to my feet and ran. I ran until the wall’s screams faded into the distance, replaced by the wet, uneven panting of the figures pursuing me.

My chest burned as I ran. Even in a dream. In this place. Each breath felt too shallow and too fast. I kept running until the space around me began to stretch again, and the ground pulled like a rug beneath my feet, and my legs felt suddenly too small for the distance I needed to cover. I was making it worse, I suddenly realised.

It hit me with a sudden clarity, I had managed to escape those times before because I was never trying to. As a child, I hadn’t DONE anything to leave here. I’d cried. I’d panicked. And then exhausted, I’d simply stopped.

The ejection, launch, whatever you wanted to call it, had always come after that.

I stumbled and, rather than trying to catch myself, I let myself fall. Before I’d even hit the floor those figures closed in. Their shapes crowding my vision, their breath hot, close and desperate. As I felt them grab and pull at me, I saw grey wisps rise from my skin, burning wherever they touched. I shut my eyes and stopped trying to run away.

I tried focusing on my breathing. Tried remembering the curls and patterns of the plaster on the ceiling above my body, no matter how far away and long ago it felt. After what felt like too long, too late, that familiar sensation returned. That welcome violent pull, but this time it came not from above or below, but from somewhere inside of me. I didn’t resist it, and let myself be torn upwards and away from this place.

I woke up gasping. Woke feels like the wrong term, as I never felt asleep. That sensation of being thrust upward lingered in my chest as I sat up panting, my breath not having caught up with myself yet. For a few seconds I couldn’t feel myself, anything, my body. Just a weight pressing down into the mattress.

Then, my vision snapped back into place. The room stretched and contorted. Walls bowed inwards, then out again. Far away objects lurched forward into impossible clarity, the sweat soaked duvet swelling into vision until I could make out frayed threads along the seam.

That’s when I saw the eyes.

They were level with the end of the bed. Too low to belong to anyone, anything standing. Yellow and unblinking. Observing me with rapt attention. I squeezed my own eyes shut as tears poured out of them.

When I opened them again, those eyes had gone, but replaced with something else. Movement. The wallpaper at the far end of the room split with a sickening, wet, tearing sound. Wisp cloaked fingering forcing their way through the plaster beneath. Stretching out to try and gain purchase.

I couldn’t scream even if I had wanted to.

Then as abruptly as it started, it stopped.

The room snapped back into shape. The walls stilled. And that familiar comforting silence returned, ordinary and empty. My heart beat hammered in my ears, and, after a few minutes I managed to corral my rapid breathing.

After a little bit of time, I reached for the notebook by that bed, I wanted to note all of what happened down whilst I could remember the details, although something told me I wouldn’t be forgetting any time soon.

I flicked it over to, what should have been an empty page. But there were none. In every page, scrawled over and over, in desperate, hungry handwriting was written the same 3 words again, and again.

My story: A few months ago, I handled the easiest SaaS launch of my career.   
  
Just kidding - I was sh\*tting bricks the entire time.

An agency hired me to handle email marketing for a SaaS product launch, and here's the kicker - I knew absolutely nothing about the niche.   
  
Meaning - I never worked in it, never studied it, and didn't even know the basic terminology when I started.

It was so bad that they started using industry jargon in our first call, and I just nodded along like I understood while frantically Googling under my desk.

Professional? Debatable. 

Effective? We'll get to that.

**Here's what I walked into:**

A waitlist of \~7,000+ people that had been growing over three months through paid ads and organic social.

My job? Turn those cold signups into paying customers when the product goes live.

Simple, right?

(Narrator: It was not simple.)

Now technically I was brought in as ""the email guy"" but that's not how these things work in reality, so I ended up handling their social posts, tweaking ad copy to get more waitlist signups, writing scripts for UGC videos... basically whatever needed words, I wrote the words.

The result?

$320,000 in email-attributed revenue over 7 days - that was about 26% of their total launch revenue...  
  
... Open rates stayed at 37% across the campaign, and while most launches burn goodwill, these emails did the opposite. 

**People wrote back just to say they enjoyed reading them.**

Now I'm not telling you this to brag (okay, maybe a little) or convince you I've got some secret email formula locked in a vault somewhere.

I'm telling you this because most SaaS companies are sitting on email lists right now that could be *printing a boatload of money*... but instead those lists just sit there doing absolutely nothing.

And it's not their fault, because nobody teaches them how to do this properly.

So I'm gonna walk you through exactly what I did, and by the end of this, you'll know how to turn your dead email list into something that makes you money.

And the best part?

You won't even need to hire anyone to do it.

Let's get into it.



**MOST SAAS EMAIL MARKETING IS GENUINELY AWFUL**

Let's be honest for a second... and I mean really honest.

Most SaaS emails sound like they never had a conversation with another human being.

*""We're thrilled to announce our groundbreaking new feature that leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled machine learning to deliver synergistic, paradigm-shifting innovative solutions that will revolutionize your dynamic business ecosystem going forward...""*

baaaaaaah... delete it. Burn your laptop. Start over. Maybe take up woodworking instead.

Nobody talks like that, nobody thinks like that, and I dare you to find one human who woke up this morning excited to 'leverage synergistic solutions.'

You know what people actually care about?

**Their problems...**

Whether you can fix those problems...

And whether they can trust you not to waste their time and money.

That's it.

The audience for this SaaS had spent thousands trying to solve a problem and still hadn't figured it out. 

They'd tried everything, been promised the moon by countless others, and none of it worked.

So they were skeptical, burned out, and tired of being lied to.

We didn't promise them the moon, nor did we use fancy corporate language.

We did something radical - we talked to them like they were humans instead of *""high-value B2B decision-makers in our target demographic cohort""* or whatever soul-crushing term LinkedIn told you to use.

And it turns out that when you talk to people like they're people, they respond.

Which shouldn't be revolutionary, apparently.



**THE PRE-LAUNCH PHASE (Or: How to Wake Up a List That Doesn't Know You Exist)**

We had three months before launch.

The list was growing daily through ads, but here's the thing... people sign up for a waitlist and then immediately forget what they signed up for.

By the time launch day hits, they have zero emotional investment in whether your product succeeds or not.

Now here's what most companies do: 

They send one ""we're launching soon!"" email a week before launch, then wonder why nobody buys.

We didn't do that.

We spent weeks before launch warming these people up, because if they don't care before launch day, then they definitely won't care on launch day.

The approach was simple:

**Every few days, send an email that made them feel something... curiosity, frustration with their current situation, hope that maybe this time would be different.**

We told stories about why this thing existed, what problem it was solving, and why the founder built it instead of just trying another solution like everyone else.

Just story after story that they could see themselves in.

And here's what happened - people started replying. 

They were telling us their own stories about their struggles, their frustrations, their hope that maybe this would finally work.

That's when I knew we'd already won.

Launch day was just collecting money from people who'd already decided to buy.



**LAUNCH DAY (How to Send Multiple Emails Without Destroying Your List)**

Launch day hits and we went all in.

Multiple emails per day for a week straight... and yes I know that sounds insane, and yes I know what you're thinking...   
  
*""That's email marketing suicide! You’ll nukeyour list, destroy trust, everyone will unsubscribe, spam complaints will skyrocket, tank your domain, and your brand will be ruined foreeeever""...* 

Well, you're wrong, but I respect your confidence in being wrong.

Because the thing is...

People don't unsubscribe because you email too much.

They unsubscribe because your emails are boring.

If your emails are interesting, helpful, or entertaining, people will read them. Even if you send multiple per day.

If your emails are corporate jargon and feature lists, people will unsubscribe after one.

We sent 13 emails during the 7-day launch window.

Our unsubscribe rate was under 2%.

Here's roughly what the rhythm looked like:

**Day 1 - The Announcement**

Simple announcement. Here's what you've been waiting for, here's the link, no fluff or preamble, go buy it.""

**Days 2-3 - The Value Breakdown**

Breakdown of what's included, but framed around their actual problems... not the features we thought were cool.

**Days 4-5 - Social Proof/Objection Handling**

What early buyers were saying. Screenshots of people actually using it. Answering questions... This is where FOMO starts creeping in because everyone else is already inside and they're not.

**Days 6-7 - Urgency**

A simple (yet effective) ""this closes soon, you've already got every information about \[product\], you either want it or you don't.""

By the end, we had $320K+ in revenue... all from email.



**WHY THIS WORKED**

Most SaaS email marketing fails for three very specific reasons, 

And I'm gonna be blunt about this because I see the same mistakes everywhere.

**First - you treat email like an afterthought**

You spent thousands or maybe tens of thousands of dollars on ads to get those signups... and then you send them one generic ""welcome"" email with a link to your help docs, and you wonder why they never convert.

Email should be your primary revenue driver, not something you get to eventually when you have time.

**Second - you sound like a company instead of a person**

Corporate jargon kills engagement faster than anything else.

Words like ""leverage"" and ""solutions"" and ""innovative"" make people's eyes glaze over, because those words have been beaten to death by every boring company trying to sound smart.

Delete all of it and write like you're explaining something to a friend over coffee... because that's what actually works.

**Third - you don't send enough emails** 

""But won't people unsubscribe if I email them too much?""

Yes, some will. So what?

The people who unsubscribe weren't going to buy from you anyway. They were just taking up space on your list and making your subscriber count look better than it actually was.

The people who stay *are* your potential customers, those are the people who might give you money.

We sent dozens of emails during the launch period and our unsubscribe rate was under 2%... because the emails were actually good and people wanted to read them.



**HOW YOU CAN DO THIS YOURSELF?**

You don't need to hire me or anyone else, you can do this yourself right now with what you already have.

**Build a warming sequence before your next launch**

Even if your product's already out, you can use this approach for your next big feature release.

Spend weeks warming people up--> Tell stories, entertain them, put your empathy pants on and remind them about the problem you're solving again and again and again.

Don't just announce features, make them *FEEL* something.

**Stop writing like a company**

Read your emails out loud before you send them, and if they sound like a press release or an earnings call transcript then delete them and start over.

Write like you're talking to one actual person... because that's what you're doing.

**Send more emails than feels comfortable**

Test it - send multiple emails per day during your next launch and track your unsubscribes, and you'll be shocked at how low they are if your emails are actually entertaining and useful.

**Track revenue, not vanity metrics**

Open rates are interesting and click rates are fine, but revenue is what's important.

Set up proper attribution, figure out which emails are making you money... and then do more of those and less of everything else.

**THE BOTTOM LINE**

You see...

Your email list is sitting there right now, waiting to make you money.

You don't need fancy automation or expensive tools or an agency charging you $30K a month, you just need to treat it like it matters and write emails that sound like a human wrote them and send enough of them that people remember you exist.

That's the whole thing. That's the secret.

If you found this useful, let me know in the comments and I'll answer questions throughout the day.

Or if you want to talk about your specific situation, just message me and we'll figure it out.

""Terrance, are you crazy? You're really putting your own life on the line for Yasmine?""

""Back when Gianna's mom's surgery failed, you gave her kidney to Yasmine without even asking Gianna. Now, you're giving her GoldenAge's project, and you even broke your ribs trying to protect her. Do you even realize your broken ribs nearly pierced your heart?""

""Aren't you afraid Gianna will find out everything you've done for Yasmine behind her back and divorce you?""

When Gianna Henderson heard about her husband Terrance Henderson's car accident, she rushed to the hospital, only to hear someone yelling furiously inside the ward.

Gianna's mind went blank, her blood running cold in an instant.

A cold chill ran down her spine as she gripped the doorknob, frozen in place.

''Wait, Terrance gave my mom's kidney to Yasmine?' Gianna thought, her mind spinning. 'Terrance knew just how much I despised Yasmine.'

Terrance's voice came through the door, hoarse and weak. ""As long as Yasmine is safe, nothing else matters to me.

""You have no idea how sick I've felt having to be around Gianna all these years.

""Every time I think of how those debt collectors took turns with her, I just wanna throw up.

""If I weren't worried she'd go after Wyatt again after the divorce, I would've divorced her a long time ago.""

His tone was cold and indifferent, every word slamming into Gianna's heart like a hammer.

Back then, Gianna's father, Bruce Greene, set Gianna and her mother up and threw them out of the house. Her mother was gravely ill, and they were saddled with a crushing debt of 25 million dollars.

The debt collectors showed up and took Gianna away as collateral.

Gianna tried to call her fiancé, Wyatt Wheeler, for help, only to find out he dumped her and married Yasmine.

When things were at their worst, Terrance was the one who saved Gianna.

He paid off her debts and married her, never caring about the gossip swirling around them.

When Gianna's mother suddenly had a brain hemorrhage, Terrance called in top doctors right away for the surgery.

Even though her mother didn't survive, Gianna never stopped being grateful to Terrance.

Terrance had always been good to her over the years.

Everyone believed that Gianna had been sexually assaulted by those debt collectors.

But Terrance never cared about any of that. He still loved and cherished her.

He didn't want her to feel ashamed, so he chose not to hold a wedding at all.

Worried she'd be haunted by emotional scars, he kept his distance, never having sex with her.

For the longest time, Gianna believed Terrance was her salvation.

But now, she finally understood that everything he'd done was for Yasmine, not her.

Gianna's face went ghostly pale. She couldn't bear to stay another second and bolted from the hospital.

She stumbled back to their marital home with Terrance, her mind numb and empty.

Every corner of this place was packed with memories of her and Terrance.

The wall art they picked out together, the fresh flowers Terrance gave her on the coffee table, and the matching slippers by the door...

All of them used to mean happiness and love to Gianna.

But now, every little thing felt like a stinging slap to her face.

They were mocking her for how naive she'd been.

Gianna curled up on the couch, crying until she had no tears left. Then started sobbing all over again.

After a long, silent night, the quiet of the villa was finally broken by the sound of the front door unlocking.

Terrance pushed the door open and stepped inside.

When he saw Gianna sitting on the couch, he froze for a second, then hurried over to her.

His good looks were clouded with concern. He asked, ""Gigi, why are your eyes so swollen? Have you been crying? Is it because I didn't come back for your birthday?

""I'm really sorry. Something came up out of nowhere yesterday. I just couldn't get back in time. I swear, it won't happen again.

""Look, this is your birthday present. Tomorrow, let me make it up to you, okay?""

He took out an elegant blue velvet box and popped it open. Inside was an extravagant pink diamond necklace sparkling under the light.

It suddenly hit Gianna that yesterday was her birthday.

She'd been looking forward to Terrance coming home so they could celebrate together, but instead, the only thing she got was a call from the hospital. They told her Terrance had a car accident.

She'd rushed over, only to overhear that cruel conversation.

Gianna's heart clenched, and tears began to fall once more.

Terrance gently wiped her tears away without hesitation.

""Don't cry, honey. I'm really sorry. Let me help you put it on, alright?"" he said softly.

Terrance took out the necklace, moved behind Gianna, and gently fastened it around her neck.

But as Gianna replayed those words she'd overheard at the hospital and saw Terrance putting on that affectionate act, her stomach turned.

She couldn't hold it back anymore. She clapped a hand over her mouth and threw up right there.

Terrance froze, worry etched all over his face as he rushed to rub her back. ""Gigi, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick? I'm so sorry. I really should've come back earlier.""

Gianna tried to pull away from his touch, but the moment she moved, her stomach twisted even worse.

""I'm taking you to the hospital right now,"" Terrance said, his voice urgent.

Without another word, he bent down and scooped Gianna up into his arms.

Gianna still felt nauseous, but she managed to hold it together and didn't throw up again.

She glanced at Terrance, and his handsome face was etched with heartfelt worry.

If this had been before, her eyes would've been brimming with tears.

But now, all she felt was a coldness that cut straight to her bones.

''He despises me so much, yet he can act like he really cares about me. His facade is downright scary,' Gianna thought.

Terrance stormed into the hospital and yelled for help, with Gianna cradled in his arms.

He was so frantic that people would think Gianna was at death's door.

During the examination, Terrance never left her side, holding her hand tight and comforting, ""Gigi, relax. I'm right here. You'll be alright.""

Gianna stayed silent, not saying a word.

She just couldn't connect the caring guy in front of her, the one acting like she was his whole world, with that cold-hearted man who said he would've dumped her long ago if he weren't afraid she'd go after Wyatt and mess up Yasmine's life.

''He's such a fake,' Gianna thought, her heart sinking.

Terrance could tell Gianna was weirdly quiet, but he figured she was just giving him the cold shoulder because he missed her birthday. He just brushed it off and didn't think much of it.

After the check-up, Terrance stayed by Gianna's side on the hallway bench, waiting for the results.

""Gigi, are you feeling any better? Want some water?"" Terrance asked.

He glanced at Gianna's ghostly pale face, concern etched deep in his eyes.

After puking, Gianna still had that nasty taste lingering in her mouth. She really needed some water to wash it away.

Just as she was about to nod, Terrance's phone started ringing out of nowhere.

He glanced at the caller ID, and a strange look flashed in his eyes.

""Gigi, I need to take this call,"" he said.

With that, he got up and stepped aside to answer.

Gianna kept her eyes down, her fingers clenched tightly in her palm.

She saw the caller ID when Terrance pulled out his phone—it was Yasmine.

Terrance deliberately stepped away, making sure Gianna couldn't hear a single word Yasmine was saying.

Terrance's face suddenly turned anxious, and Gianna was sure Yasmine had said something that made him worry.

Gianna thought wryly, 'Honestly, as long as it's about Yasmine, Terrance will always get worked up, no matter what it is.'

Soon, Terrance came back from his call, looking apologetic and uneasy. ""I'm really sorry, Gigi. There's an emergency at work. I need to head back right away.

""Will you be okay by yourself? I promise, as soon as I handle things, I'll come straight back to you.""

Gianna shot him a long, searching look.

Suddenly, she remembered that so many times before, Terrance had used the same excuse, saying there was some emergency at work and he had to rush out.

''Was it ever really about work, or was it always Yasmine calling him away?' she wondered.

Yet she didn't dare let herself keep thinking. The more she thought about it, the more heartbroken she felt.

Terrance got a little nervous under her stare, and he subconsciously pursed his lips.

Just as he was about to say something, Gianna casually replied, ""Go ahead. Don't worry about me. I'm fine.""

# Chapter 2 Terrrance's Two Roles

Gianna thought it was good without him around. She had something she wanted to check out anyway. If he were still here, it would just get in the way.

""Thanks, Gigi. Marrying you is honestly the best thing that ever happened to me,"" Terrance smiled.

He didn't pick up on the change in her tone, just gave her a half-hearted compliment, and leaned in to kiss her forehead.

Gianna turned her head away, dodging his kiss.

Terrance paused for a second, but didn't think much of it. He just figured she was still sulking.

""Gigi, once you get the report, snap a pic and send it to me right away, okay? Don't make me worry,"" Terrance said, giving her head a quick rub before hurrying off.

As soon as he was gone, Gianna scrubbed at the spot he'd touched, unable to hold back another wave of disgust.

Forcing herself to push through the nausea, she made her way to the hospital records room, claiming to be a family member so she could get her hands on the consent form her mother had signed for the kidney donation.

The records room was overflowing with files, making it a real challenge to find what she was looking for.

Luckily, Gianna still remembered the exact date of her mom's surgery. The clerk dug through the files from that year and quickly found the consent form.

Gianna's hands shook as she took the organ donation agreement. When she spotted Terrance's name written in the section for the donor's family, it was like her whole world came crashing down.

She staggered, her face turning as white as a sheet, startling the clerk.

""Are you alright, ma'am?"" the clerk asked with concern, quickly reaching out to steady her and help her sit down.

Gianna waved her hand, trying to assure them she was okay.

But when she tried to speak, all that came out was a painful rasp from her throat.

Gianna felt like someone had carved a hole right through her heart.

The icy wind rushed in, shredding her heart into bloody, aching pieces.

''I was so stupid. How could I have been so blind?' she berated herself inwardly.

Terrance had given her mother's kidney to the daughter of the woman who killed her mother, and all these years, she'd been living in the dark, married to him, clueless about the truth.

She'd even leaned on him for everything—her savior, her hero, the only one she ever relied on.

Right then and there, Gianna decided she would divorce Terrance.

She grabbed her phone and called a number she knew by heart. ""I accept your offer. I'll join you in two weeks.""

Two weeks was plenty of time for her to end things with Terrance.

Gianna wandered out of the records room, still in a daze. As she was about to leave the hospital, she bumped into two nurses.

""Oh my, is that woman in the VIP suite Mr. Henderson's wife? She's absolutely stunning. She and Mr. Henderson look amazing together. And he's totally head over heels for her, just like everyone says,"" one nurse gushed.

""Yeah. I heard they got into a car accident, and Mr. Henderson nearly died trying to protect her. Even with those serious injuries, he wouldn't stay in bed. He rushed straight to her room to look after her. I'm so touched,"" the other nurse chimed in.

""Ugh, same people, different fates. Why is my luck so bad? Why can't I get a guy like that?"" the first nurse sighed.

""Forget it, girl. Did you see that pink diamond ring on Mrs. Henderson's finger? Seven carats! Mr. Henderson dropped 30 million at an auction just to get it for her,"" the second nurse said.

The nurses's gossip drilled into Gianna's ears like venom-tipped needles, each one stabbing straight into her heart.

Her heart felt like it was bleeding out. The agony made her wish she were dead.

Turned out that while she was kept in the dark, Terrance had been bending over backwards for Yasmine all along.

Gianna stared at the ring on her right ring finger, the one Terrance had slipped on when he proposed to her.

It was too loose, always sliding around on her delicate finger, never quite fitting.

But since they never had a wedding, Terrance seemed to forget about getting her a proper wedding ring.

''If he really cared about me, how could he forget something so important?' Gianna thought bitterly. 'Of course, the real wedding ring was meant for someone else.'

Gianna clutched her chest, feeling like her heart was about to shatter into pieces.

Inside the ward, Terrance tried to sound tough. ""You know you're injured, and it's hard for you to get around, but you still insist on doing everything yourself. What if you fall again? Do you want to end up crippled?

""Where the hell is Wyatt? You got into a car accident and ended up in the hospital, but he can't even bother to show up? Does that even make sense?""

Terrance frowned, ""Just tell me straight. Is Wyatt ignoring your feelings?""

Yasmine smiled, trying to reassure him, ""Terry, Wyatt's really good to me. He was overseas for work, but the moment he heard about my accident, he wanted to fly back right away.

""I told him I was fine and said he should finish up his business before coming back.

""You know how much GoldenAge's project means to him. If he can land it, life will get a whole lot easier for both of us in the Wheeler family.""

Terrance immediately replied, ""Didn't I tell you I'll get you the project?""

Gianna's heart hit rock bottom upon hearing that.

She had led her team through more than a month of sweat and tears just to win GoldenAge Enterprise's project.

Terrance just decided to give it to Yasmine without a second thought for her team, not giving a damn about all the effort they'd poured into it.

""Forget it. If Gigi finds out we've been keeping in touch and you're giving me the project, she'll totally get pissed,"" Yasmine said, shooting a subtle glance at the doorway.

""If it ends up causing a fight between you two, I'd honestly feel so guilty,"" she added.

Terrance shot back, ""Why does it matter if she gets pissed? You're always stressing over everything. Why don't you put more energy into yourself for once?

""Gianna's already been kicked out by his father, and her mother is gone. If she tries to stand up to me, she's got nowhere left to stay. So don't sweat it. She won't be against it.""

Yasmine started to say something else, her voice hesitant. ""But...""

Terrance cut her off. ""Forget about those people. They don't matter.

""Does your stomach still hurt? I'll go get a nurse to bring you a fresh hot water bottle.""

Without waiting for her reply, he grabbed the still-warm hot water bottle from her stomach and headed out to find a nurse.

As he walked out, Terrance pulled out his phone and shot a message to Gigi.

Terrance: \[Gigi, did the test results come in yet? Let me know as soon as you hear anything, okay? Don't keep me in suspense.\]

Hearing footsteps approaching, Gianna instinctively darted into the nearest corner.

She was so numb from heartbreak that even the tears had run dry; all that was left inside her was a cold, hollow emptiness.

Gianna thought bitterly, 'So Terrance knew everything all along.

''He knew I had nowhere else to turn, and that he was the only one I could rely on, so he was convinced I would never walk away.

''That was why he could lie, hurt, and betray me so shamelessly, without a trace of remorse.'

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Gianna pulled it out and saw a message from Terrance.

She looked up, watching Terrance's back as he headed toward the nurse's station, her eyes filled with disbelief and bitter sarcasm.

''How does he manage to switch between those two roles so effortlessly?' Gianna scoffed inwardly.

He could fuss over his lover, all sweet and caring, while putting on a show of devotion for his wife, who was nothing but a burden to him.

""You saw it all, didn't you?"" Yasmine's voice rang out, taunting and smug.

Gianna looked up and met her triumphant gaze.

""Whether it's Dad, Wyatt, or Terrance, the one they all love is me,"" Yasmine declared, her voice dripping with arrogance.

""And you? You're just the one they tossed aside like trash,"" she sneered.

Yasmine lifted her hand, showing off the huge pink diamond ring on her finger.

The diamond was plump and brilliant, sparkling beautifully under the lights.

""See this? Terry bought this diamond just for me, and he personally designed and had this ring cut and made,"" Yasmine gloated.

""And that necklace around your neck? It's just the leftover bits from the diamond Terry used for my ring,"" she sneered.

Yasmine's eyes were dripping with sarcasm, each glance like a needle driving deep into Gianna's chest.

Her humiliation of being scorned, dismissed, and suffocated for being the illegitimate child was finally released.

Yasmine watched Gianna with smug satisfaction, almost as if she were eagerly waiting for Gianna to completely lose control.

# Chapter 3 I Quit

Yasmine thought, 'So what if she acts all high and mighty, pretending to be the socialite role model? She still can't beat me at anything. All she can do is pick up the scraps I leave behind.'

Gianna looked at Yasmine's face, which was a spitting image of her homewrecker mother, and couldn't help but remember how that woman had ruined their happy life, flaunting her victory in front of her mother.

It was they who drove her mother into depression and even took her mother's kidney.

Just thinking about her mother's kidney now being inside Yasmine made Gianna want to grab a knife and cut her open to take it back.

However, her reason held her back, forcing her to keep it together.

''No, not now. At least, not yet,' she told herself.

''Losing it won't fix anything. I'm not here to crash and perish with the two bastards. I'm going to make them pay, every last bit,' Gianna thought.

She took a deep breath and clenched her fists.

She lifted her gaze, eyes dripping with sarcasm as she stared at Yasmine's smug face. ""Figures, trashy blood really does get passed down. Your mother was nothing but a homewrecker.

""And you? Snatching one wasn't enough for you, huh? Had to go for seconds. What, are you that desperate for men?""

Gianna's pale face was nothing but sarcasm and ridicule.

Every word she said was laced with poison, hitting Yasmine right where it hurt the most.

What Yasmine hated most was people calling her mother a homewrecker and calling her an illegitimate child who should never have existed.

Yasmine was shaking with rage. ""Gianna, say that again. I dare you!""

Gianna shot her a sideways glance, her presence overwhelming. ""Sure. You're nothing but a shameless illegitimate brat, a homewrecker who snatches my fiancé and wrecks my marriage.""

""Ah..."" Yasmine snapped and reached out to slap Gianna.

Gianna surely wouldn't just stand there and take it. She instinctively raised her arm to block.

But before Yasmine's hand could even touch Gianna, Yasmine suddenly fell back, her head slamming into the wall with a heavy thud.

""Minnie!"" A worried voice called out from behind Gianna.

Gianna was just about to turn around when, out of nowhere, a powerful force slammed into her, sending her flying and knocking over a nearby medical waste bin.

Her hand landed right in a pile of shattered glass, and blood started pouring out instantly.

Terrance acted like Gianna didn't even exist. He rushed to help Yasmine, his face full of worry. ""Are you okay? Did you get hurt?""

Yasmine's face was pale, but she shook her head, looking fragile and determined.

""I'm fine,"" she said, looking at Gianna with red eyes.

Forcing back tears, she said, ""Gigi, I just wanted to clear up the misunderstanding from back then. I didn't mean anything by it. Why did you push me?""

""Gianna!"" Terrance whipped around, staring at Gianna. ""Yasmine was just trying to clear things up with you. Even if you didn't want to listen, you can't push her.

""Say you're sorry. Right now.""

Even though Gianna already knew Terrance only cared about Yasmine, seeing him take her side so obviously still cut Gianna to the core.

After all those years together, there wasn't even a shred of trust left for her.

He didn't bother to ask and just pinned it all on her without a second thought.

Gianna closed her eyes, sneering, ""Apologize? For what? Why should I apologize to her?""

She forced herself up from the floor, watching Yasmine play the helpless victim, snuggling up to Terrance. The sarcasm in Gianna's gaze was practically dripping.

Gianna scoffed, ""You say you want to explain some misunderstanding? What are you gonna say?

""Was it when you crawled into Wyatt's bed and tried to seduce him? Or was it when you stole my mother's...""

Gianna hadn't even finished speaking when a stinging slap landed, cutting her off.

She covered her cheek, staring in shock and disbelief at the person who'd just hit her.

Terrance paused, frustration flickering across his face as his hand clenched tightly.

Terrance tried to explain, ""Gigi, I didn't mean to...""

But Gianna just shot him a look that cut right through him, then ripped the necklace he'd just given her and hurled it straight at his face.

""You gave me the crap she doesn't want to disgust me, huh? Terrance, I don't give it a damn,"" Gianna sneered.

With that, she spun around and strode off without a second glance.

Terrance started to go after her, but Yasmine suddenly grabbed his arm. ""Terry, my head hurts so much. I feel so dizzy.""

Terrance immediately forgot about everything else and focused on Yasmine. He quickly scooped her up and carried her back to her room.

Yasmine nestled in his arms and watched Gianna walk away, her eyes cold and calculating.

Yasmine wondered, 'What was Gianna about to say earlier? What did she know? Does she actually know about the surgery?'

Gianna left the hospital, ready to hail a cab and head back to the villa to pack up her things.

She was done with Terrance. She was getting a divorce and moving out of the house they once called home.

The moment she walked in, Terrance rushed over and grabbed her by the shoulders.

""Gigi, where have you been? What took you so long to get back?"" Terrance blurted out. ""I called you a bunch of times, and you never answered. Do you even know how freaked out I was?""

Gianna winced at the pain from his grip, her brows knitting together as she pried his hands off. ""It's none of your concern.""

She walked right past him, heading upstairs to pack her things.

As Gianna brushed past Terrance, she was caught off guard to find Yasmine standing there too.

Gianna's face went stone cold in an instant.

""Gigi..."" Terrance saw her face darken and tried to say something, wanting to explain himself.

But before he could finish, Yasmine jumped in. ""Terry, see? You worry too much. I told you she'd be fine.

""She was probably just giving us the silent treatment because of what happened at the hospital.

""But Gigi, Terry only acted out because he was so worried about me. Please, don't take it to heart.

""I already explained to Terry. I was just slipping. You didn't push me.

""Come on, Gigi, don't make a fuss with Terry. There's really nothing going on between us.""

She spoke in that pitiful voice, pretending she was just worried about Gianna and Terrance, acting like she didn't want to be the reason they fought.

But actually, she was just rubbing it in Gianna's face.

She was showing off how Terrance was totally wrapped around her finger, always jumping to do whatever she wanted.

Gianna felt nothing but disgust. She gave Yasmine a frosty stare. ""We both know the truth, don't we?

""Drop the act, Yasmine. Whatever happens between you and him has nothing to do with me.""

Gianna's voice was cold and sharp, leaving no room for argument.

Her attitude hit so hard that Terrance suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, like everything was starting to spiral out of his control.

Seeing Gianna about to walk away, Terrance grabbed her arm in a hurry. ""Seriously, there's nothing between me and Yasmine. I only take care of her because she's your sister, that's all.

""You don't have to move out just to prove a point. Let's just let it go, alright? I'm not going to hold it against you or make you apologize to Yasmine.

""But to make it up to you, I'm letting Minnie take charge of GoldenAge's project.""

""On what grounds?"" Gianna shot Terrance a frosty glare. ""My team and I pulled more than a dozen all-nighters, grinding away for over a month just to win GoldenAge's project.

""What makes you think you can just hand it over to her easily?""

Terrance's brows furrowed at her response.

He thought he'd been more than generous—cutting her some slack, not making her apologize, just handing her an easy way out. He figured she'd play along and let him smooth things over.

He'd already set it up for her to take the easy route, but she just refused to go along with it.

Terrance was starting to lose his cool. He snapped, ""I'm your boss. It's my call who gets the project.

""If you've got a problem with that, I can just take you off everything.""

Gianna snorted, her gaze dripping with sarcasm as she stared at Terrance.

She'd busted her ass for him, doing everything she could to help him get a foothold at Henderson Group, including making plans, closing deals, and always having his back.

And now, just because she wouldn't hand over the project she'd poured her heart and soul into to Yasmine, he wanted to kick her out.

Gianna shot him a disappointed look, her anger simmering just beneath the surface.

She spoke through gritted teeth, ""Save yourself the trouble. I quit.""

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1766136633.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

Guy’s an absolute monster — doing like 5x my total installs monthly, mostly LA/OC, heavy door + setter teams.

Anyway, he casually mentioned he’s been using this VA agency called *Elite Concierge* to handle follow-ups, CRM cleanup, reschedules, proposal sends, the boring stuff we all hate. Said it freed him up to just knock, close, and manage reps instead of babysitting his pipeline at night.

I’ve heard of overseas VAs before but never this specific agency, and I’m always skeptical when something sounds “too dialed.” That said, if someone doing real volume in SoCal is vouching for it, I figured it’s worth asking.

Anyone here actually use them? Or know someone who does? Not trying to get pitched, just want real-world feedback before I even think about going down that rabbit hole.",1,1766136537.0,Solarbusiness,0,1.0,False

the main character was a girl who was not very popular, and i think she called the popular girls at her school the princesses? 

the basic plot is her trying to survive high school, ask out her crush, make friends, and that sort of thing.

i’m pretty sure there’s also cliche plot line about her trying to fit in with the popular girls before ultimately realising that she doesn’t need or want to be popular.

i think in one of the books i think she tries befriends a new girl who arrives at her school, only to then realise the new girl is a bully and a trouble maker. but i may be misremembering.

the only specific detail i remember is that at one point one of the characters is mad at the teachers so she sneaks into the staff room and pours dish washing liquid into the coffee maker which then burns all the teachers throats when they drink from it, and the main character is horrified when she finds out.

i remember that the covers were very basic, but i can’t remember any specific details except that each one was a different colour.

I read them sometime between 2012-2015, but they was probably published earlier than that (i read it from the school library and we very rarely got new books in)

He seems very nice and attractive and I see him on the apps (Hinge, tinder). 

When I moved in first I was a bit shy myself knocking on his door to introduce myself so left card/candy outside to say hi. He knocked on mine a few days later, we had a brief chat but when I invited him in for coffee he said he had to go. 

Since then we have had limited interactions. I have tried to accidently bump into him many times but our schedules never seem to line up. Once after I saw he had someone paint his garden fence it inspired me to do mine. A few weeks later he changed his Hinge prompt to he was looking for someone who liked painting garden fences. Then it was gone a day later changed to generic prompt. 

We had a nice chat once when he was mowing the lawn outside but when there was 1 second of awkward pause he turned on the mower again and that was it. Then a few months ago I asked him to help me move furniture and he was helpful but I become a bit shy and did not make as much conversation as I wanted to. I put so much pressure on me that this was 'my chance' and felt I ruined it.

My friends say give it up, if he was interested he would made a move. But I think I haven't swiped on him (would prefer irl) and I havent really given him any indication I am interested. Help. What do I do. Will I just swipe. Or do I knock on his door with candy for Christmas. Or stop. Help.

1pqguf8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pqguf8,Would you like to have a cup of coffee in Garfield Cafe?,"About the Puremind Garfield Cafe I just want to say, I have mixed feelings about it. I like it but the building process drove me crazy.

What surprised me was that the Cafe had more lights than the Birthday Party, which made me look forward to how it would look when lit. But it also meant that the process became more complicated. Especially since I had to wrap the wires myself, I found it to be a very tedious and time-consuming task, particularly because I had to wrap three wires!

And the wall and ground are orange which are very Garfield style. But this orange color is from a sticker. It would be even better if it could be printed directly on the puzzle. And the windows are my favourite parts. They are made from things that look like plastic sheets. The transparent effect is very realistic. Especially the Garfield head made of acrylic that’s stuck above the window. It's very cute!

The furniture and appliances are also cute. But the microwave I think it is or a cabinet is very unstable and can fall apart easily; it almost comes apart at the slightest touch. And the Garfield clock is difficult to assemble. The second hand is really difficult to align with the hole, and unsurprisingly, I’ve already broken it. But  I fixed it and it is truly capable of displaying the exact time! This left me in great astonishment!

After setting up the large pieces of furniture, I began to assemble the other items. When the milk and bread are placed in the refrigerator and cabinet, it truly looks like a real Cafe. I particularly like that silver coffee machine. Even though it is placed in the corner, it still attracts me very much. Every little thing inside contains elements of Garfield. Especially the Garfield burger on the menu. I hope someone in reality can actually make it. I will definitely buy it haha!

And I also have to especially rant about this glue, every time I use it, it drives me crazy! It is very difficult to use! But it does stick really well. That's the one thing I can accept the glue.

In fact, building this Cafe took more time than I had imagined. Maybe it's because of the tricky glue. But the details inside still really surprised me.",4,1766136209.0,miniatures,0,1.0,False
1pqgu31,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pqgu31/i_need_to_talk_about_her_please_read/,I need to talk about her (please read)...,"I just spent the last 3 hours trying to put this into words. This is the hardest thing I've ever written. I can't really talk to anyone I know about exactly what's going on, so I'm posting it here hoping it reaches someone who understands it. 

I (m/ 39) just found out that someone (f/34) I haven't talked to in a year passed away the other day, and I'm completely devastated. This is the woman who turned my life around and basically saved me. I'll call her ""C"" because as much as I want to honor her memory, privacy for her family is more important right now.

I'll go back further into my life to explain how I ended up in the situation that brought me to her. 

I was with a girl that I thought was my soul mate. We were together for 11 years. From when I was 23, until 34. Long story short, she was using me and cheating on me the whole time. When it finally ended, my entire life fell apart. 

So, the ex left. A few weeks later, a group of 5 armed men broke into my house while I was at work and pretty much took everything of value I ever owned (that's another long story, I won't get into it here, but they didn't care about my security cameras, they were never identified, and the police have never recovered any items taken). A few weeks after that I was in a major car accident, I could have easily been killed, but walked away unscratched. But losing my only vehicle was also devastating as I couldn't get to work on time anymore. Then a few months later, the ex called, wanting to reconcile. I was still completely in love with her, so I was all for it. The day I was supposed to meet my ex for coffee, my mother was found unresponsive and taken to the hospital. My ex was supportive at first, telling me to take my time and whatnot. My mother passed away 2 weeks later. The NEXT DAY, the ex ended things out of nowhere, saying she can't do this to me, but didn't explain anything. I found out later she was pregnant by someone else, and was planning to trick me into thinking it was mine, but realized she was too far along for that to work. 

So all of that happened in a short amount of time, and I lost control. I went to a very dark place. I was depressed. I didn't care if I hurt myself, and I didn't care if I hurt anyone else either. I was in a very bad way of life for almost 2 years. 

I was on dating apps looking for instant gratification, and I broke a few hearts along the way. Pretending I was legitimately interested when I wasn't. 

Then one day I matched with C. After talking for about a week, we went out on our first date. She was absolutely beautiful, in every way possible. Gorgeous, Smart, Funny, Down to earth, way out of my league. I couldn't believe a woman like this was giving me the time of day. I didn't want to hurt her the way I had been hurting people before. She instantly made me a better person. After meeting her, I cleaned up my act. Straightened up at work, etc.

She did all the little things people don't realize are important. The things usually taken for granted. The biggest thing she did (that my ex wouldn't), was actually make time for me. When I met her, she was working full time as a medical assistant at a pediatric office, while also being a full time student trying to become a nurse. She would get off work, and go straight to night school. With all of that going on she STILL found time to spend with me almost every day.

I honestly didn't deserve to be with her. She was too good for me, and deserved better.

Everything C did was all about improving her future. And trying to make things better for everyone around her. She had a rough childhood, and went through a wild phase, but turned her life around and continued working hard to keep making things better.

I was still in a bad place though, and even though I fell in love with her immediately, I couldn't get over my own insecurities and open myself up to her. I was too quiet and afraid to say the wrong things when I was around her. I couldn't give her the loving relationship she deserved. But I still tried. There was a point where I started to believe I had found ""the one."" 

We only dated for about 6 months, (probably less honestly) a few years ago. I was never able to really open myself up to her, regardless of how much I cared for her. We ended up parting ways on good terms, and stayed in touch as best we could. And even though we dated for a short amount of time, she had an extremely profound impact on my life. She was able to put a crack in my shell, so I could open myself up in the future. She showed me I could trust someone again. 

Ultimately, she wasn't ""The One,"" but my life is so much better for having known her. I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her, I might not even be here at all. 

We kept in touch for a while, until we both started seeing other people. It felt kinda inappropriate talking to her while seeing someone else, but we would still like each other's posts on social media, as a way to let each other know we still had some form of contact. It was comforting, even though it was just a thumbs up every once in a while.

The other day, there was a local news article about a woman being found dead in an Airbnb. Foul play is suspected. Just another scary headline in this big city, but I didn't really pay it any mind. 

Then today, I was on Facebook, and saw her tagged in a post. At first, I thought she was making the post, that she knew the woman. But no. It was her co-worker, tagging her. C was the victim. 

I've never felt my stomach drop so hard. Never felt so much grief in my life. Not even when either of my parents died, nor during the events that sent me into my spiral. This is the most heartbroken I've ever felt. It's unreal. It can't be real. I'm still expecting her to post a selfie on her Instagram any minute now. Something where I can tap the heart icon to let her know I'm still thinking of her. 

I went through all of our messages. The last message she sent me was almost exactly one year ago. She text me on December 24, 2024, ""Merry Christmas."" The last conversation we had before that was a few months before that, She was checking on me, making sure I was doing good. We talked about our new relationships. 

I keep wishing I had reached out to her, and checked on her more. I wish I could tell her how thankful I am for what she did for me in such a short amount of time. I wish I could let her know that I love her. Not in a romantic way, but I feel like I owe her so much. 

At the same time, I feel guilty. Because I am currently in a relationship with an amazing woman (F/ 37, I'll call her D). I feel like being so heartbroken over an ex is almost like I'm cheating on her. For the first time in my life, I'm actually in a happy and healthy relationship. We're about to spend our 3rd Christmas together. D is the one. But i would not even be able to be in this situation if I had never known C. I owe my happiness to her. She always wanted to make the future better, and she really did. 

I have come such a long way, and I owe it to her. I didn't want to be ""inappropriate"" by messaging her while being with someone else, so I never told her how grateful I was, or that I loved her. But now I'm saying ""Fuck Being Appropriate."" Reach out and thank the people you feel you need to thank. Check in on the people you care about. 

I wish more than anything that I can repay her. 

You can be damn sure this won't happen from me again. My current gf does all the little things like I mentioned before, and she is going to know for sure how I feel and how thankful I am for what she does from now on. I think that is the best way I can honor C. ",2,1766136171.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

She downplayed my successes and always found a way to make every moment about something she has been doing or experienced.

She recently returned to my area for a visit and asked to meet for coffee. I told her that I wasn't feeling so sociable at this time, but maybe in the New Year. (Not unusual for me. I'm known for being a hermit).

Today is my birthday and I saw a ""Happy Birthday"" message pop up from her. I haven't opened it fully, so she isn't aware it was seen. 

A few moments ago I received another message about a mutual acquaintance (that I last saw about 10 years ago, and probably the same for her), had passed away last night.

...there is a big part of me that wonders if she sent this message in order to kind of sh*t on my day..or if it was just a clueless thing to do. 

I cannot for the life of me imagine why anyone would send a message like that on someone's special day, unless it was something urgent. As much as I am sad about the passing of an old acquaintance, and feel awful about sounding selfish, I don't understand why this couldn't have waited one day. If the roles were reversed, I would have written the next day to tell her the sad news and that I didn't want to tell her right away because it was her birthday.

Am I the one in the wrong here? 

I'm second guessing myself.

I feel awful for thinking this way also (about her and also about not wishing to hear about his death on this day). Am I being selfish?

Hi, I grew up in the area and recently was searching for news pertaining to high school rumors, however I found this article and am hoping to see if anyone knows what came of it? Mods feel free to delete but it looks like PD really tried their best in this case.


MONROE, Wash. -- A Child Protective Services report says there is evidence of neglect in the mysterious death of a 7-year-old Monroe boy, and that's in spite of a troubled investigation and the lack of an autopsy.

A death investigation by the state points a finger squarely Alexander Smith's parents, saying, ""It's more likely than not that their acts or omissions are related to Alexander's death.""

The Smith family had been on the radar for Monroe police and CPS for some time. The family had a history of referrals for neglect, but the case reached crisis proportions in 2010, when police and CPS removed the two boys, then ages 5- and 10-years old, from the home.

According to a CPS investigation, they found the home ""covered/saturated in human feces and urine"" and with no working toilets, sinks or utilities.

But just a year later the courts returned Alexander and his brother to the home. Last January Alexander's father took the boy to the hospital, but he was already dead.

Hospital workers told investigators they thought the parents were acting odd.

According to the investigation, ""The father asked doctors if they'd be able to tell what happened at home,"" and the mother was ""drinking coffee and chatting with staff.""

In their report, CPS officials said the parents provided no explanation for Alexander's death and their home appeared to have been staged when detectives searched it.

In March, Monroe police officials said they asked the county medical examiner to perform an autopsy.

""We knew the past history we tried to relay that to them,"" said Debbie Willis of the Monroe Police Department.

In spite of that request, the CPS documents indicate the medical examiner was ""unwilling to hear the ER doctor's or Monroe PD detective's concerns or perform a full autopsy.""

Alexander's body was cremated the day before toxicology test results showed he died of salicylate poisoning.

""Without the actual body, it's difficult because that's a key piece in this case,"" Willis said.

Monroe police will continue to investigate the case and hope to send it to the prosecutor's office for a charging decision later this month.

Officials from the Snohomish County medical examiner's office said they can't discuss open investigations.”

We worried that a dry environment might cause throat discomfort or flaky skin and feared that prolonged neglect of environmental changes could disrupt his rest. Recently, a close friend who just had her second child shared some parenting tips with me. After listening to her advice, I purchased the Imou temperature and humidity sensor, integrating it with our existing home camera and connecting both to HA. The setup has been incredibly convenient, so I immediately decided to write this post to share this great solution with everyone. 

Here’s how I configured it: First, I set up a monitoring zone on the camera to precisely frame the crib area. Then, I linked the Imou temperature and humidity sensor with our Levoit humidifier, setting ""humidity below 50%,"" ""humidity above 65%,"" and ""temperature below 22°C"" as the core trigger conditions. I also retained the camera's live monitoring feature to check on the baby anytime. During the baby’s nap, while I folded laundry or did chores in the living room, I no longer had to frequently run to the nursery to check. If the sensor detected humidity below 50%, HA would immediately activate the Levoit humidifier at medium mist output, steadily increasing humidity until it reached the comfortable range of 55%-60%. If humidity exceeded 65%, the humidifier would automatically shut off to prevent a damp environment conducive to bacteria. When the temperature dropped below 22°C, the system would also trigger the room’s heater to operate at low power, maintaining a stable temperature of 24-25°C. Once the temperature normalized, the heater would turn off automatically. What reassured me even more was the anomaly alert: I specifically set the camera to notify me if the baby remained ""completely still for 30 minutes,"" paired with real-time temperature and humidity data. This way, I could monitor both the baby’s peaceful rest and the room conditions. Once, while I was simmering soup in the kitchen and lost track of time, my phone suddenly buzzed with an HA notification: ""Baby has been still for 30 minutes. Room temperature: 25°C, humidity: 52%,all normal."" The data came from the sensor’s real-time monitoring. When I opened the video feed, I saw the little one curled up under the blanket, sleeping soundly with steady breathing—no need for me to worry at all.  

Now, whether I’m cooking, cleaning, or just taking a break with a cup of coffee, I can always check on the baby’s status and the room’s temperature and humidity. It allows me to have my own time while providing the baby with comprehensive, attentive care.",0,1766135908.0,homeassistant,0,0.25,False

It was the spring of the fifth year after our divorce.

Julian Hawthorne and I ran into each other again at Black Tide Tattoo Studio.

He was there to have the name of the woman he loved touched up on his chest. I was there to conceal the old scars on my wrist.

Years had passed. We stood facing each other, saying nothing.

After a long silence, Julian was about to speak when the hem of his shirt was suddenly tugged by a small hand.

“Dad.” The little boy looked at me with open curiosity. “Who is she?”

The sea breeze swept through the corridor, setting the wind chimes swaying and breaking the stillness that had lingered too long.

“I’m a client,” I said calmly. “Same as your dad. I’m here for a tattoo.”

The boy tilted his head. “Do you know my dad?”

“Noah.” Julian’s tone carried a quiet warning. The boy pouted, then fell silent.

“I don’t,” I answered evenly. “We’re strangers.”

Julian’s expression darkened.

The artist tapped the counter lightly, his gaze moving between us. “Who’s first?”

Julian had been leaning against the bar, but now he straightened, his eyes fixed on me. “She goes first.”

He was wearing a white linen shirt paired with silver-gray slacks. The collar was casually undone, revealing the hard lines of his chest.

On the left side of it, half-hidden beneath fabric and shadow, was an name inked into his skin.

I knew whose name it was.

When we divorced, that name had not yet existed on his body.

“There’s an order,” I said politely. “This gentleman was here first.”

Julian hadn’t answered yet when his phone vibrated.

By chance, I caught a glimpse of the screen.

Honey.

The screen went dark. Julian looked at me instinctively.

I turned and walked toward the seating area.

Behind me, the boy’s voice rang out, bright with excitement. “Was that Mom calling?”

Chapter 2

Julian’s voice was always cool by nature. When he coaxed someone, he tended to lower it deliberately.

Soft. Low. It blended seamlessly with the cello music playing through the studio.

I lowered my gaze and stirred my coffee slowly when a childish voice sounded beside me.

“Ma’am?”

I turned my head.

The same little boy was leaning over the armrest, peering at me.

He had delicate features and a quiet elegance about him—strikingly well-mannered for his age. He was undeniably adorable.

So adorable that even knowing exactly whose child he was, I felt no resistance toward him.

“You really look like my mom,” he said, as if sharing a secret. “She’s a super famous actress. Really pretty.”

“Then you must look a lot like her,” I replied.

His eyes lit up instantly, as if he were about to come closer, until a large hand rested on his head.

Julian patted him gently. “Go wait in the car with Michael.”

I raised an eyebrow and looked up.

Standing behind Julian was the middle-aged man who had followed him for years.

Our eyes met.

Shock flickered across his face, quickly buried beneath a trace of restrained awkwardness. “...Ms. Carter.”

I nodded calmly, my tone carrying the faint weight of an old acquaintance. “Hello, Michael.”

At that moment, Julian lifted the boy into his arms. As he stood, a glint of silver flashed at his wrist.

A Patek Philippe. A style he would never have chosen in the past.

On his left ring finger was a simple band—understated, expensive.

During the two years of our marriage, Julian had never worn a wedding ring.

True love really was something else.

I took a sip of coffee. Even after all these years, the love he shared with her was still as real as ever.

The boy was led away by Michael, but Julian remained standing in front of the booth.

“Evelyn,” he said. “How have you been all these years?”

I had only finished half my coffee when I set the cup down. “I’m doing well. Thanks for caring.”

After a moment of silence, the shadow above me lifted. Julian followed the artist upstairs.

The cello faded, replaced by a soft piano melody—steady, calm, much like my state of mind.

The studio’s owner was an internationally renowned tattoo artist. His hand-drawn designs were priceless, and he only took two clients a day.

And somehow, today happened to be one of those coincidences.

My gaze drifted across the designs on the wall, then paused.

At the very center was a piece that caught my eye.

A crimson lip print inked high on a man’s inner thigh.

The man was seated on the floor with one leg bent, a silk robe falling open to reveal black briefs beneath. A pale pink imprint lingered there, intimate and deliberate.

The shape was beautiful. The lines clean.

Against bronze skin, it carried a quiet, dangerous tension.

It was a mark left by a woman—between a man’s legs.

“Ms. Carter.” The artist’s voice pulled me back. “This way, please.”

I turned and saw Julian coming down the spiral staircase, his shirt collar buttoned all the way up.

“So fast?” I asked.

“He lost his mind and decided not to finish,” the artist said casually, clearly familiar with him. “You can head upstairs.”

Julian stopped at the foot of the stairs, one hand tucked into his pocket, expression unreadable.

He looked down at me from above, his gaze heavy.

We stood there in silence, staring at each other.

What came to mind instead was our last time in bed. After the kiss, after we’d crossed that line, I had seen the red lips tattooed on his inner thigh.

Chapter 3

The clock on the wall chimed. I picked up my bag and headed for the stairs.

As I brushed past Julian, his hand suddenly closed around my wrist, the edge of my watch digging into my bone, sharp enough to hurt.

“Evelyn.” His voice was low, hoarse. “Do you really have to pretend we’re strangers?”

I didn’t struggle. I looked at him, my expression flat, unmoved. “The fact that I’m willing to pretend at all is already me showing restraint.”

His grip stilled.

He released me, rubbing his fingers absently as his tone softened. “I know you still hate me.”

Julian had always possessed that ability—to seize control of a situation at any moment, to remain composed no matter how awkward things became.

He had been like this back then, too. When photos of him kissing Lena Moore had exploded across the headlines, he had stood in front of me with the same calm detachment.

The difference was that I had lost control.

I had screamed, broken down, unraveled, while my husband remained collected, making me look hysterical by comparison.

“You’re overstating it,” I said, climbing a few steps without turning back. My voice was distant. “Given what we are now, hatred doesn’t really apply.”

Julian seemed as though he wanted to say more.

I didn’t wait to hear it. I turned and went upstairs.

The studio’s interior was striking—postmodern in style, open and quiet.

The artist sat at his computer, finalizing my design while an assistant prepared my skin. I removed the watch from my right wrist, its leather strap intricately designed and wrapped three times before coming loose.

As the watch came off, the scars beneath it were revealed—raw, pink, uneven, and unmistakable.

“That area hurts,” the artist said casually. “Just so you’re prepared.”

I smiled faintly. “Probably not as much as when I cut it myself.”

Two scars. Each deeper than the last.

When the numbing time ended, just before transferring the stencil, the artist confirmed the design with me one final time.

A blue butterfly mid-flight. Clean. Precise.

“The placement is tricky,” he said, pulling on his mask. “You’ll need touch-ups later. But I can guarantee full coverage of the scars.”

“Do all tattoos need touch-ups?”

“No,” he replied. “Julian does. It’s his skin type.” He didn’t bother hiding the fact that he knew Julian well. “Tattooing him is bad for my reputation.”

I said nothing.

After two years of marriage, I knew Julian’s skin was unusually sensitive.

Back then, he disliked any marks left on him during intimacy.

And yet now, even with the inconvenience of constant touch-ups, he had still etched Lena’s name across his chest.

And branded her kiss along his inner thigh.

The needle touched my wrist. I flinched despite myself.

The artist glanced at me and said suddenly, “Tell me the story behind the scars.”

I paused, then laughed softly. “What, tattoo artists collect trauma now?”

In public opinion, Julian Hawthorne was the picture of success.

His career was riding the wave of expansion, his influence growing by the day. His love life looked just as perfect—devoted to a rising star, a complete family, a flawless image.

“When I met Julian,” the artist said, “he was already married to Lena. And she looks a lot like you.”

I smiled faintly and pulled a cigarette case from my bag. “You mind?”

He shook his head.

I exhaled a thin stream of smoke, thought for a moment, then said evenly, “I’m his ex-wife.”

Chapter 4

Julian and I met in college.

He was a senior in the same major. When he started recruiting for his first venture, he brought me onto the team.

Today, DeepCore Technologies was nearly an industry leader. But in the beginning, there had only been two of us.

Julian’s standards were notoriously high. He was well-known on campus, and when he opened recruitment, resumes flooded in.

“But only one person stayed.”

Smoke curled between us as I narrowed my eyes slightly. “Back then, Julian was arrogant to the point of absurdity. He walked around like the world owed him something. I was the very last person he interviewed.”

No one expected anything from that meeting.

I thought he was unbearably pretentious. He had spent an entire day interviewing candidates and decided everyone was an idiot—including me.

“But we talked all night,” I continued. “All the way until morning. Then he held out his hand and said, ‘Looking forward to working together.’”

“Our ideas aligned. Our goals did too.” I tapped the ash from my cigarette. “Julian was ambitious. Coincidentally, so was I.”

For the first two years of DeepCore, we rented an apartment off campus. We chased clients together. Pitched to investors together.

Julian was my mentor. He taught me everything—networking, strategy, technical depth—without holding anything back.

On my twenty-second birthday, we coded through the entire night. At dawn, he leaned against the window and lit a cigarette.

“He asked me,” I said, taking a drag, “if I knew how to smoke.”

I leaned in out of curiosity and immediately started coughing, eyes watering.

Julian laughed, pulled me against his chest, lowered his head, and kissed me.

When the kiss ended, he asked me something else.

Did I want to marry him?

The buzzing at my wrist paused for a moment. The artist said, “That sounds more like a question about dating, doesn’t it?”

I smiled too, as though I were telling someone else’s story—detached, watching from the opposite shore.

“I said yes. And that same day, we secured our first round of funding.”

“Riding the wave of the AI boom, DeepCore took off. Within a year, it had made a name for itself in the industry.”

“The day our core team was formally established, I became CEO. Julian took me home.”

“That was when I learned what the name Hawthorne really meant.”

The Hawthorne family had built its fortune in shipping. Three generations of accumulated power. Old money at the very top of the East Coast hierarchy.

Opposition to the marriage was inevitable. But Julian had already chosen to break away from his family and build something of his own. Once he made up his mind, no one could force his hand.

“He fought them for two years,” I said quietly. “So stubborn he was beaten into the hospital. Pressure from every elder in the family—and he still refused to back down.”

Ash fell soundlessly. I watched it for a moment before speaking again.

“When DeepCore closed its first major funding round, we got married.”

“The wedding was simple. It was held on a small island. Later, Julian bought it and put it in my name. He called it Azure Key.”

The artist’s hand stopped mid-line.

I nodded. “The island we’re on right now.”

“Before the wedding, Julian signed a prenuptial agreement. Aside from my founder shares in DeepCore, he transferred every liquid asset he could mobilize into a trust for me.”

“He said he wanted DeepCore to be my strongest safeguard.”

Back then, people said Julian loved me recklessly. The financial entanglement ran so deep that divorce seemed impossible.

“I believed that too.”

The cigarette had burned halfway down. I stubbed it out.

“Until the first year of our marriage—when he personally chose Lena Moore as DeepCore’s brand ambassador.”

I had asked him once why he picked an unknown actress.

“Don’t you think,” he had said then, pointing at Lena’s massive billboard, “that she looks a lot like you did in college?”

“She has about eighty percent of your aura,” he laughed before I could answer. “But none of the brains.”

“Lena rose fast,” the artist said, pulling me out of the memory. “If I remember right, she became famous at nineteen.”

“Yes.” I recalled it clearly. “Less than a year after becoming the spokesperson, she was everywhere.”

“The day she won Best Newcomer was Julian’s twenty-fifth birthday. We’d planned to have dinner together.”

“I waited two hours. He never came back. I couldn’t reach him. Michael was unreachable too.”

“Until eight that evening, when a headline exploded out of nowhere. The headline read: #Lena Moore and Mystery Man Share Passionate Kiss.

I looked up at the artist and smiled faintly.

I was visiting India for a month or so this september and I did percieve a strange energy in all the interactions I've had in the Indian gay/queer scene.

First of all, it doesn't seem like there is any meaningful queer ""community"" in India and I'd say lack of institutions and spaces are majorly to blame for that. Additionally, it seems like atleast 90% of the community is severly closeted in India (as evidenced by the amount of Grindr profiles with random fake pictures, which isn't really a thing in the US or other western countries).

Besides, it just feels like a lot of people are just too pushy & desperate. I thought I'd explore the gay scene in India (for reference I was in a big tier-1 city) while I was there and got onto the apps (Hinge, Bumble, Grindr etc.) & I did notice a stark (when I say stark I mean STARK) contrast with the US.

People on those apps could hardly hold even a basic (meaningful) conversation, and for some reason if you weren't too into people hitting you up and express that you're not interested, the immediate questions/comments I always faced were- ""why?"", ""reason?"", ""try once"", ""meet once"", ""meet and decide"" etc. The second issue was people would send me NSFW pics/albums on Grindr without a prior conversation or without asking and then expect me to reciprocate even if I said I wasn't interested. This feels so strange cuz it never used to happen in the US. Do people not understand the concept of consent or personal choice in India?

\[The strangest part? People saying they're ""paid"", asking for money in exchange for sexual encounters. Why would I pay someone? It absolutely doesn't make sense. Are people actually that desperate?\]

Moreover, if I was interested in someone, they'd be really pushy asking me to meet them instantly as though they have nothing to do the entire day. They'd send a slew of messages and be really rude about it. It's not difficult to understand that almost nobody can meet up with you instantly (even if something like getting coffee or drinks or food) cuz all of us have lives and stuff to do. Why is there such a heavy focus on instantly meeting up, dropping everything you're doing at a moment's notice?

And to be clear, these experiences are not limited to Indian Grindr (the not being able to take rejections ones were mostly on Grindr), I'd say I've had such experiences on Hinge and Bumble too (mostly the ones where people have expected instant meetups).

Not easily exactly but it happened naturally enough that I had a decent social circle through most of my life. Then the pandemic happened, then I moved for a job, then I just kind of stopped trying and now I realize I haven't made a new friend in like three years.

And I can feel myself getting worse at social stuff the longer I go without doing it. Conversations that used to flow naturally now feel forced and I run out of things to say faster, probably because I expect myself to say something good enough if that makes sense. Eye contact feels weirdly intense in a way it didn't before too. So basically it's like a muscle that atrophied from not being used.

I started trying to work on it lately. I’m forcing myself to for example ask two unnecessary questions when buying coffee or stuff like that and it definitely turns awkward almost every time for now but I feel like I’m doing something good for myself. The thing is I have limited options to do stuff like that in my daily life so I also started doing something that felt very very weird at first but at this point idc, practicing conversation on gleam because I needed somewhere low pressure to shake off the rust. Practicing conversation with an app feels kinda backwards tbh but as I said at this point its whatever and progress is slow but I think it's happening a little bit. My guess is that its the coffee shop style conversations that are doing most of that but the app is making having those conversations a little bit easier because I have this obsession with feeling like I prepared for a situation. And I think that’s more of a temporary tool or at least I hope so but as I said for now it has its use for me. I’m also trying to say yes to almost any invitation for anything but its already kinda exhausting so we’ll see.

I guess I'm posting because I'm wondering if anyone else is in this same weird limbo. Not necessarily depressed or anything clinical, just kind of slipped into isolation and now don't know how to climb back out. It's lonely but also loneliness has become comfortable in a way that makes changing feel hard. I realize that that’s a very basic topic on this subreddit but almost everyone is experiencing something more like suffering due to loneliness whereas I’m honestly not so much but still want to change.

Case in point: I was at a Tim Hortons the other night, quietly studying, when a middle-aged woman with long blonde hair started yelling at me aggressively for no reason and making racist comments..I didn’t provoke her at all. (also I am not even a person of colour, but it was very disheartening to hear nonetheless) Staff were there, but they basically said they couldn’t do much about it.

The Starbucks location on Liverpool and Kingston in Pickering is also  packed with addicts, homeless people, or mentally unstable individuals.

It’s really disappointing because I just want to grab a coffee and get some work done at a cafe or go out and walk to get my steps in but it seems too unsafe and I am constantly on edge.

1pqg802,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1pqg802/maintaining_brand_consistency_across_seasonal/,"maintaining brand consistency across seasonal menu updates,lessons learned","How do you maintain brand identity when seasonal campaigns require significant visual changes?

We've been tackling this challenge with our quarterly menu rotations. The core issue: seasonal aesthetics (bright summer vs cozy winter) can easily dilute brand recognition if not handled strategically.

Key brand consistency challenges we identified:

* Typography hierarchy must remain intact across color palette shifts
* Logo placement and sizing standards need to work with seasonal imagery  
* Brand voice should stay consistent even when messaging shifts seasonal

Our initial approach failed because we treated each season as a separate design project, which is honestly what a lot of small cafes (including us) tend to default to. Summer felt completely disconnected from fall, confusing regular customers who expect visual continuity.

The breakthrough came from developing a flexible brand system rather than rigid templates. We established core brand elements that never change (primary fonts, logo treatment, layout grid) and secondary elements that can adapt seasonally (color accents, imagery style, promotional messaging).

Current process: Brand guidelines first, seasonal adaptation second. This maintains recognition while allowing creative seasonal expression. Reduced our design time significantly and improved customer brand recall.

Marina stood outside the fitting room in the bridal shop, witnessing her future husband Lavern fooling around with another woman.

""Lavern... does this wedding dress look better on me, or on your fiancée?"" the woman asked.

""Of course on you. I'm dying to be all over you; doesn't that prove how irresistible you are?"" he said.

Thrilled with his answer, the woman let out a flirtatious giggle. ""I want you to remember me forever. On your wedding day, on your anniversaries, you'll always think back to today, to me.""

Marina listened to the soft moans from inside, feeling like she'd been plunged into an icy abyss.

On the eve of their wedding, Lavern, who'd always seemed so devoted to family, had been taking frequent business trips. Turned out, he had a side piece.

Fighting back the nausea churning in her stomach, Marina turned and walked away, heading to her car.

They'd been together for seven years, building a business from scratch, hustling side by side to turn Ross Group into the success it was today.

Her sister Elnora Finley had warned her that Lavern wasn't a good match, and there was still a message from her on the phone.

Elnora: \[The Finley family won't be attending your wedding to Lavern. You're on your own.\]

With red-rimmed eyes, Marina opened her phone and typed a reply.

Marina: \[I'm calling off the wedding.\]

It took a while for the response to come through.

Elnora: \[Come back to Vrufield in a month, and I'll believe you. Otherwise, we're through as sisters.\]

Marina sent back a simple \[Okay\] and pocketed her phone.

She started the car and drove off. Meanwhile, Lavern stepped out of the bridal shop with his arm around the woman. Spotting the familiar license plate, he froze for a moment.

In that brief hesitation, the car vanished into the distance.

He shrugged off her hand from his arm, straightened his clothes, and slipped back into his polished, dignified facade. ""I'll have my assistant drop you off.""

The woman whined, clinging to him. ""Nooo, you promised we'd go shopping.""

Lavern lifted a hand, ruffling her hair, his eyes flashing with an unyielding chill. ""Behave.""

She didn't dare push it, sulkily letting go and following his assistant away.

Once she was gone, Lavern headed to his own car. Catching his reflection in the glossy paint, he saw no trace of debauchery in his sharp features; no hint of wine, women, or excess.

Back at home, he spotted Marina's car in the garage. She was still in the driver's seat, staring at her phone.

""You went out?"" He opened the door, casually tossing his suit jacket onto the passenger seat before leaning in close.

His black shirt was unbuttoned at the top, revealing glimpses of his toned muscles. No lingering signs of another woman on him.

When she stayed silent, he leaned in for a kiss.

Marina switched off her phone and held up a hand to stop him, her tone icy. ""Are you scared of me going out?""

He paused for a beat. ""Of course not. You can head out whenever you want. I just worry you'll get bored without company.""

With that, he smiled, sliding an arm around her waist and cooing softly. ""Tell me, who's got my darling all worked up?""

Marina didn't respond, just staring at his strikingly handsome face, her eyes cold as frost.

He was the same as ever, always quick to pick up on her mood swings, pinpoint the issue, fix it, and shower her with emotional reassurance.

She shook her head, looking away, her voice flat and distant. ""Lavern, you've been swamped lately. I don't see the point in going through with the wedding. I'm worried you won't have the bandwidth for it.""

Lavern thought Marina was being downright ungrateful at that moment. After all, he was a somebody now, a well-known figure.

""Say that again!"" His voice was laced with fury.

Marina held his gaze without flinching. ""There's no point in going through with our wedding. I'm worried you won't have the bandwidth for it.""

As she turned to leave, Lavern grabbed her arm, his anger flashing unmistakably in his eyes.

He said, ""I'm killing myself with work for our company, for our future. Do you want our kid to start off already behind the eight ball?

""I just got back from a business trip, and instead of showing even a hint of concern, you're throwing a tantrum and being completely unreasonable. When did you become like this?""

Marina stared at him, taking in his groundless accusations, and found the whole thing almost comical.

Lavern standing before her felt like a total stranger, as if she'd never really known him at all.

He was full of lies, just like so many other guys, cheating and then pinning all the blame on the other person, as if his betrayal had been unavoidable, like she'd forced him at knifepoint to sleep with someone else.

The wedding was still two months away, and Elnora had given her a month to tie up loose ends here. In that time, she'd erase Lavern from her life completely.

She marched straight upstairs to the bedroom and into the bathroom to wash up.

Lavern trailed after her, slipping his arms around her from behind and softening his tone.

""It's all my fault, Marina. I've been buried in work lately and haven't been paying attention to how you're feeling. Over the next few days, I'll clear my schedule of all commitments and come straight home after work to be with you, okay?""

Marina looked up into the mirror at Lavern cooing at her with that gentle, placating voice. A sardonic smile tugged at her lips. ""Why even bother? I...""

Before she could finish, Lavern's phone rang, the ringtone was a warm, upbeat love song that had just gone viral.

His old ringtones had always been those generic default sounds. Marina recalled their early, head-over-heels days, back when the company was just starting out. She'd suggested they both switch to a romantic duet, but he'd brushed it off, saying he met with clients too often and it wouldn't come across as professional.

Turned out, it wasn't about professionalism at all; it just wasn't worth it for her.

Lavern fished out his phone, glanced at the screen, and hung up. ""Scam call.""

Marina pressed her lips into a thin line. She'd clearly caught the caller ID: \[181 Seconds.\] She just muttered ""Oh"" and dropped it.

The phone rang again. He hung up, but it buzzed once more, and finally, he turned his back to answer it.

He said, ""We've got some major projects at the company right now; I'm swamped. I hope you can cut me a little slack. I'll stay late at the office tonight and head back first thing tomorrow to try on the wedding dress with you. Don't wait up; get some sleep.""

Marina didn't glance his way, just kept brushing her teeth. In the mirror, she saw him exit the bathroom and leave through the door.

Once he was out, she pulled out her phone and searched online for the meaning of ""181 Seconds.""

She immediately spotted the top explanation among the results.

\[People's passions usually fizzle out after three minutes, but you're my 181st second.\]

Marina swallowed the inexplicable pang in her chest and casually opened a real estate app, putting their current villa up for sale.

In a month, she'd return to Vrufield, and none of the fixed assets in Sicester would matter to her anymore. She wanted nothing from this place, including Lavern.

# Chapter 2 Good As New

The villa Marina'd put up for sale was priced hundreds of thousands dollars below market value, which quickly drew a flurry of private messages from interested buyers.

By the time she'd responded to them all, it was the middle of the night.

Still wide awake, Marina opened up a popular app that was blowing up among women lately.

As soon as she logged in, a push notification for a post jumped out at her.

\[My lover's tying the knot in two months, but today I slipped into his fiancée's wedding dress and hooked up with him right there in the bridal shop! It was exhilarating and so taboo.\]

The comments section was filled with vitriol aimed at the poster, and a few people were even wishing the algorithm would shove it in the fiancée's face.

Marina's hand shook as she clicked through to the poster's profile.

She scrolled down fast until she reached the very first post; no text, just a single photo. It was of two hands clasped together, fingers intertwined.

She immediately noticed the tiny mole on the man's index finger and the ring on his ring finger.

The post dated back six months, only a week after Lavern had proposed to her.

Marina stared blankly at her phone, her gaze shifting to the identical ring on her own finger as nausea welled up inside her.

A second later, she ripped it off and flung it into the toilet, hitting the flush. She thought, 'No sense in hanging onto something already soiled.'

The poster dropped an update not long after. Gone was the smug vibe from before; now the caption had a desperate, pleading edge.

\[Cut it out with the hate. We've got a deal; I'll hand him back to his fiancée good as new in a month.\]

The photo attached showed a man's back as he lay sprawled on a bed. That outline was so eerily familiar it sent a chill through Marina.

She thought, 'Hand him back good as new?' She let out a snort.

Right then, she got why people sometimes just laughed when words failed them completely.

Lavern didn't come home that night. First thing in the morning, he called without a word of excuse, simply instructing her to meet him at the bridal shop.

Marina got to the bridal shop a few minutes early.

Her wedding gown was on display in the third-floor VIP area, looking regal and spotless, like it had never been tainted.

""Ms. Finley, Mr. Ross is en route. Why don't we get you into the dress now? That way, he'll walk in and see you looking flawless right off the bat."" The staffer was polite and deferential, though her eyes held a subtle flicker of pity.

Marina kept her face neutral and shook her head. ""No thanks."" The idea turned her stomach.

She'd barely gotten the words out when a strong arm snaked around her waist from behind, yanking her close. His familiar scent, mingled with the clean whiff of shower gel, hit her senses.

""Why not? Marina, you have no idea how long I've been dreaming of this moment. Try it on for me, yeah?"" Lavern said.

Marina glanced over at Lavern next to her, who looked fresh as a daisy, not a trace of someone who'd supposedly worked through the night. She scoffed to herself.

He wasn't alone, either; a young woman hovered a little ways back.

She had on light blue jeans with a crisp white blouse, her face beaming with a sweet, innocent grin that screamed youth.

Marina peered past Lavern, locking her frosty stare on the girl. She thought, 'Is this yet another sick twist in their little thrill-seeking game?'

Lavern caught her looking, his hold on her waist tightening even as he kept his face relaxed. ""She's a business partner's daughter. Her vibe reminds me of you from back in the day; figured you two might click, so I brought her along for intros.""

He beckoned her forward, and the girl scampered over eagerly, sticking out her hand to Marina. ""Hey, Marina! I'm Shawna Thornton. So nice to meet you!""

Marina ignored the handshake, averting her eyes and refusing to engage. Her tone was bland. ""'Shawna', good name indeed. Guess not many guys can snap back to reality after they meet you.""

As she picked up on the jab, Shawna's face crumpled into a hurt pout. ""Are you saying I'm some kind of man-stealer, Marina?""

The arm around her waist dug in painfully. Marina shot a sideways glance at the irritation in his eyes, and only then did he loosen his grip, bending down to murmur gently in her ear.

He said, ""If you're pissed, save it for me at home, punch me, scream, whatever floats your boat. But she's sensitive; don't call her out like this in front of her. Let's focus on trying the dress for now.""

The staff shook off their stunned daze and quickly grabbed the wedding dress from the rack, motioning for Marina to try it on.

Marina glanced over at Shawna, catching the way her eyes sparkled as they locked onto the gown in the staffer's grasp.

A chill flickered in Marina's gaze, and she spoke up, ""Like it?""

Shawna didn't hesitate, blurting out her answer, ""Yeah, I do.""

She snuck a quick, nervous peek at Lavern, spotting the icy edge in his stare, then tacked on timidly, laced with envy.

""But not every girl's as fortunate as you, Marina, slipping into her dream dress and tying the knot with the guy she loves."" Her eyes were downcast as she said it, her disappointment and hurt obvious to everyone.

Marina flicked a sideways glance at Lavern next to her, his face a blank slate, then told the staff flatly, ""I'm not up for it today; feeling off and don't want to fuss. Her figure's close to mine; let her model it instead.""

Just the idea of slipping into a dress they'd already sullied made her skin crawl, like she might catch something.

The staff froze, unsure, and shot a cautious look at Lavern.

He stared down at Marina, his expression turning stormy.

But Shawna jumped right in, stepping forward with her trademark sugary smile. ""Awesome! It's a real privilege to try it on for you, Marina."" And with that, she reached out for the gown.

The staff were speechless. At a loss, they turned imploring eyes toward Lavern.

His dark eyes gleamed with a frosty warning, his whole vibe dark and brooding.

Shawna nibbled her lip, looking totally flustered.

Marina brushed off the hand circling her waist, sank onto a nearby sofa, and nudged her along. ""Well, get to it.""

That perked Shawna right up; she snatched the dress from the staff and ducked into the fitting room.

Lavern furrowed his brow and sat down beside Marina, ready to air his grievances, but she beat him to it, looking up with a smirk that didn't reach her eyes. ""Aren't you gonna go in and help her out?""

Her words landed like a bomb, leaving everyone frozen in awkward silence.

The employees who'd handled Lavern and Shawna the day before were dying inside, barely holding back a gasp.

They thought, 'Thank goodness we didn't call out sick; we have prime seats for this meltdown.'

Lavern's brows knitted tighter, his lips thinning out, his tone guarded. ""Marina, what the hell are you getting at?""

""Oh, nothing. Just thought you'd jump at the chance to assist."" Marina flashed a smile, then flagged down a staffer for a coffee.

The fitting room's heavy curtain whooshed open, and there stood Shawna in the middle, all coy and composed, her grin sweeter than candy.

The gown, custom-made for Marina, hugged her like it was meant for Shawna all along.

Marina tilted her head toward Lavern, her smile cold as ice, and asked, ""Doesn't she look stunning?""

He kept his face like thunder, refusing to glance over, his voice deep and refined. ""Marina, what game are you playing here?""

Marina ignored him, cradling her coffee as she sauntered over to Shawna.

As she got close, Shawna flung her hands up to shield her face, expecting a scalding splash. But no burn came; instead, shocked gasps filled the room.

Shawna dropped her hands and glanced down, horrified at the pricey gown now marred by gross brown stains.

Staffers swarmed in with tissues, dabbing frantically, but the spots were stubborn.

Marina fixed her with a blank stare and sneered. ""How exactly do you plan to give back something this trashed and expect it to be 'good as new'?""

Shawna went pale as a ghost, frozen in place, clueless what to do next.

Lavern's frown deepened as he marched over, stone-faced, snatching Marina's wrist and yanking her toward the door.

In a swift move, Marina swung her free hand and slapped him hard across the cheek. The smack rang out sharp and clear.

The room fell deathly quiet.

She'd thrown everything into it; her palm buzzed with numbness.

Lavern shot her a glare, his face a storm cloud, eyes colder than she'd ever seen.

The shop staff averted their eyes from his fury, and even Shawna didn't dare breathe.

Since Ross Group had taken root in Sicester, no one had dared humiliate him in public; let alone with a woman's slap.

Marina held his brutal, ice-cold gaze, her pulse racing. The power gap was huge; if he struck back, she'd be done for.

Lavern noticed her fluttering lashes, exhaled softly, and slid his arm around her waist. ""Feeling any better?""

# Chapter 3 Someone Who Doesn't Matter

""No,"" Marina responded. She thought, 'Just one slap? How could that possibly make me feel any better?'

Lavern took the hand she'd just slapped him with and brushed a soft kiss across her palm. ""Did that sting? Once we're home, I'll ice it for you and explain everything properly, alright? No need to get worked up over someone who doesn't matter.""

Marina dropped her gaze, a flicker of sorrow crossing her eyes. She thought, 'This must be that age-old guy thing, unless you catch them in the act, they'll never admit they're wrong.'

""Someone who doesn't matter? You mean Ms. Thornton?"" Marina tilted her head, eyeing Shawna's face.

Shawna stood there, pale as a sheet, rigid like a mannequin, all the earlier defiance in her stare when she'd first strutted into the shop completely gone.

""Yes."" Lavern's answer landed firm and without a hint of waver.

Shawna blanched even further.

As they stepped out of the bridal shop, Marina headed straight for her car.

Lavern grabbed her hand, pulling her close with unyielding force. ""Ride with me; I'll drive you home.""

She tried to wrench free, but his grip was ironclad; she couldn't shake him off and ended up being hauled over to his car.

Lavern popped the passenger door. Sitting right there on the sleek gray-and-black seat was a pink-and-white hair clip.

He reached in without a rush, picking it up like it was nothing.

Marina let out a scoff. ""Might want to give it a once-over, check for any other personal goodies hidden away? If I stumble on some underwear in there, I'll need therapy for my eyes.""

Lavern, who'd been playing it cool up till now, suddenly blew up like a cat whose tail got yanked. ""Marina, why does your mind always dive straight into the dirt?

""I love you, but I won't put up with this. What happened today is a one-off, and it better stay that way. Ross Group's right on the verge of breaking through to the next level, and I can't dodge having female colleagues or partners in the mix.

""You embarrassed Shawna today, and I'm overlooking it because she's just entry-level. But if you pull the same crap on some influential woman you suspect down the line, going all impulsive like that, how's Ross Group supposed to keep growing?""

Marina held his stare calmly, her bright, clear eyes iced over. It was dawning on her just how masterful Lavern was at gaslighting.

She didn't argue or hop into his ride. Instead, she turned sharply, slid back into her own car, started it up, and sped off.

With people milling about outside the bridal shop, Lavern didn't bother chasing after her to save face. He jerked his door open, scowling like a storm cloud. As he leaned in to get behind the wheel, he caught sight of Shawna emerging from the shop, her pretty face drained of color.

He paused for a second, then waved her over. ""Get in.""

Meanwhile, Marina frowned at the black luxury car ahead, its back bumper dented in, license plate a string of ""8""s.

She'd spaced out for just a moment and rear-ended it. Full blame on her; she'd have to pay up for letting her mind wander.

She swung her door open, stepped out, and began apologizing to the driver climbing out of the other vehicle. ""Sorry, I...""

The other driver gave her a quick once-over but didn't say a word, instead respectfully swinging open the rear door.

Out stepped a tall, striking figure. The man's shirt was buttoned meticulously to the top, his chiseled features set in an air of unapproachable indifference.

The moment she laid eyes on him, a flash of memory hit Marina. She thought, 'I know this guy; he is Dar...'

Before she could get a word out, he'd already strode away, lounging casually against the roadside barrier with his phone pressed to his ear in his left hand. A light breeze occasionally ruffled his tousled hair, revealing his broad forehead.

""Miss, just hit me up once the car's fixed, and I'll set up a time for you to grab it."" The driver passed her a business card.

Marina snuck a glance over there. The man was deep in his call, must've been hitting a snag, given his subtle frown, and now and then, he'd idly poke at a bird chilling on the railing.

Ten minutes later, a sleek van rolled up. He hopped in without a hitch, while the driver stuck around to wrap things up. Right before sliding in, his eyes flicked her way, and Marina dodged the gaze, feeling oddly guilty.

By the time all the paperwork was done and details noted, it was well into the night when she finally made it home.

Lavern had pinged her with another message in the meantime, but Marina ignored it again.

She was wiped out. After a quick wash-up, she crashed onto the bed and sank into a deep sleep.

The next day, she lined up viewings for interested buyers through the real estate app and, in the process, purged and ditched a ton of stuff.

Most of it was cheap trinkets Lavern had gifted her back in their college days. Things she'd once cherished, but now that she'd seen him for who he really was, they just came off as tacky and worthless, like Lavern himself.

Three days later, Lavern walked in to find Marina out in the garden, tending to some newly bloomed roses.

He approached from behind, slipping his arms around her waist and pulling her close affectionately. ""Babe, miss me?""

Marina scoffed coldly. ""With a lovely sidepiece keeping you company, why would you need me pining away? You'd probably rather I forget you exist so I don't interrupt your cozy rendezvous.""

Her voice was detached as she replied, and in his split-second lapse, she twisted free from his embrace.

A subtle whiff of women's perfume clung to him, drifting over and making her queasy.

Lavern reacted lightning-fast, grabbing her waist and hauling her back against him. His firm muscles radiated heat even through his shirt.

Marina wriggled, but he just clamped down harder around her waist, pinning her in place.

""You're the only one I love. Cut it out, okay?"" He bent slightly, whispering in her ear, his tone low and sultry as he tried to placate her.

Marina's fingers dug in tight, and a rose thorn pierced her skin, drawing a bead of blood. The sharp pain in her fingertip still couldn't drown out the revulsion bubbling up inside.

She dropped her hand, letting the rose stems scatter across the ground.

Lavern noticed, lifting her hand to check the cut on her finger, his brow creasing. He leaned down, about to suck the blood from her still-oozing fingertip.

The instant her finger grazed his warm lips, Marina's face contorted.

She thought, 'How could he spend three days fooling around with Shawna and then come back here, acting all lovey-dovey like it was nothing?

'Who knows how many kisses those lips have shared with Shawna? Disgusting! Utterly disgusting!'

In a pure reflex, Marina lashed out quick and sharp, slapping him hard across his sharp, handsome face. Her palm buzzed with numbness.

He didn't move a muscle, just stared her down with a face like stone, his eyes filled with an indescribable chill.

# Chapter 4 She's Gone

Marina bit back the impulse to unleash a full-blown screaming match and turned on her heel, heading into the house.

These past three days, Lavern had been swamped, but she hadn't exactly been twiddling her thumbs.

Photos of him and Shawna slipping in and out of some apartment together had been pouring into her phone nonstop.

With their wedding right around the corner, he was cool as a cucumber about cohabiting with v, treating it like his last hurrah before the ""ball and chain"" of marriage.

Lavern trailed after her inside, rummaged through the cabinet for the first-aid kit, grabbed some iodine and cotton swabs, and approached with a grim look on his face.

Without a peep, he snatched her hand and started cleaning the wound. ""You adore these hands; don't go injuring yourself just to spite me.""

A sardonic smile curved Marina's lips. ""Aren't you the one doing the hurting?""

She didn't harp on it, instead snagging a document from nearby and thrusting it under his nose. ""Review the terms. If it's all good, sign on the dotted line.""

Lavern took it, his striking brows furrowing as he skimmed the contents. ""A property split agreement?""

Marina murmured a soft ""Yeah.""

He tossed the file aside with a chuckle. ""We're on the brink of tying the knot; what's the point of this?""

He'd chalked up her words from that day to just blowing off steam. He thought, 'Seven years together; she won't actually bail on me.'",1,1766133609.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

MILES

I had rules to follow to not lose my damn mind.

First rule: Stay the fuck away from my best friend’s little sister.

Second: Don’t sneak into her room.

Yet here I am, standing in her doorway like a goddamn psychopath, listening to her make those soft little whimpers.

The fuck?

Anger cuts through me like a hot wire. Half of the guys are passed out downstairs. They threw a party for her brother tonight. The house is full of drunk assholes.

God, I’m sick but I’m not stupid. I know what those moans are for. I know that sound. She’s a grown woman. Twenty-one. Legal. Beautiful. But mine.

I start counting.

Who’s downstairs? Jax is out cold on the couch. Timothee’s out with a bowl of chips on his chest. Ron and Blaze were still on the porch last I checked.

So who the fuck is missing?

My pulse spikes.

I back away from her door slowly, breathing hard, running through every name on that guest list and coming up short.

There’s one car I didn’t recognize in the driveway. Someone someone brought. New recruit? Friend of a friend?

My jaw tightens. I’ll kill him.

If he’s in there, if he touched her, looked at her, heard that fucking sound come out of her mouth, I’ll bury him.

I drag a hand down my face, try to think, try to breathe. But all I hear is her voice, soft, breathy, whimpering again.

Fuck this.

I move before I know what I’m doing.

There’s a little hole in her door. It’s one of those tiny cracks where the wood never shuts right. And fuck me, I can hear her.

No. No, I’m not a pervert. I’m just…concerned. That’s what I keep telling myself. Because half the guys in this house are blacked out or thinking with the wrong head, and any one of them could’ve walked up here.

Any one of them could’ve opened this door. Could’ve touched her. Could’ve seen what I’m seeing now. And I would’ve fucking killed them.

I would’ve put them through the goddamn wall and smiled while I did it.

She doesn’t even know the danger she’s in—walking around here soft and warm like this world won’t eat her alive. She’s soft. Warm. Fucking sunshine. And I don’t get to have that. Not with what I’ve done. Not with the shit Diego and I have buried.

If I touch her, I’ll drag her into my filth.

I lean in. Just a glance. One fucking glance, and I swear I’ll walk away. Keep my distance. Be a good man. Be the saint she thinks I never was. But what I see nearly brings me to my knees.

She’s glowing.

Bathed in lamplight, skin flushed and bare, hair sticking to her cheek. One leg hooked over her sheets, sleep shorts shoved halfway down her thighs. Her hand’s between them, fingers moving slow, slick, perfect.

Fucking hell.

I've never seen such a delicacy being offered to mankind.

She’s working herself up and slow at first, drawing it out like she wants to savor every second.

This is so fucking wrong. I should turn around, go downstairs, pretend I didn’t see a thing and let her have her moment.

Let her do her… thing.

But then her lips suddenly parted and she fucking moans what sounded like my name.

“Miles…”

And I swear to God, the world stops spinning.

She says it again—higher this time, breath catching, like she’s close. Like she’s been thinking about me this whole time.

Me.

I can’t breathe. I can’t even blink nor lie to myself anymore.

I’ve been wanting her since the day I saw her after she got back from boarding school. Hair longer. Hips curved. Mouth smart and too damn pretty for her own good.

I’ve been telling myself it’s so fucking wrong to want her.That she’s too young. Too good. Too off-limits. That I’m a sick bastard for watching the way her shirt rides up when she stretches, or how her lip gets caught in her teeth when she’s trying not to cry.

But now, here she is touching herself to the thought of me, and now I’m never going to be the same.

Not after this.

Because I’m not guessing anymore. I’m not hoping or imagining or jerking off in the shower just so I won’t touch her. She’s right here. In the flesh. Soaked and panting. Whimpering my name like she’s already mine.

I watch her hips stutter, her fingers falter, and I know she’s about to come. Her face twists—forehead pinched, lashes fluttering—and she lets out the softest, filthiest sound I’ve ever heard in my life.

This girl.

This beautiful, reckless, dirty-mouthed little siren.

“Miles—oh my god, Miles—”

Maureen screams my name, high, broken, shameless and that seals it for me. That’s it. I’m done. There’s no climbing out of this now. No pretending I’m a good man. No more lines I won’t cross. I’m going to hell for wanting her. But I’ll fucking have her.

I know I don’t deserve it, not even a little, but I savor how her body twitches in the aftermath.

Every soft little aftershock. Every quiver of her thighs.

She’s a magnificent piece of fucking heaven laid bare—flushed, panting, wrecked in the most beautiful way a girl can be.

She looks ruined.

Perfectly, thoroughly, sinfully ruined.

Maureen shifts, slow and hazy, body still humming and then she suddenly turns.

I’m no religious man. But when she rolls over, I probably call on every damn deity there is, whispering silent, panicked prayers that she doesn’t see me.

Except deities don’t listen to fucked-up guys like me. My best friend’s little sister opens her eyes and they find mine.

I’m Miles Montgomery. And I am completely, unapologetically—about to ruin my best friend’s little sister.

# The Desperate Brat

MAUREEN

“So, how was it?”

“What?”

I pause, cup halfway to my lips, and snort when Miles settles on top of our countertop. Since when did our house become a frat house? I’m really going to kill my brother for letting these morons stay here.

“Does it taste good?” he asks, nodding at the mug in my hand.

I take another sip.

Mostly to avoid answering. It’s good. Annoyingly good. Strong enough to burn a little going down. Strong enough to silence the headache I woke up with and whatever the hell I thought I saw last night.

There’s no way that was real, right?

I think I stared at him for too long.Way too long. Long enough for my brain to short-circuit and start playing reruns of every despicable little daydream I’ve had about him.

He pushes off the counter, nudging my mug closer like he’s doing me a favor.

“Strong coffee, huh?”

I nod, still reeling.

He grins, mocking, warm, something in between and I gasp when he lowers his face and drinks straight from my mug.

“You—” My voice cuts off, equal parts offended and unreasonably flustered.

Miles swipes his thumb along his bottom lip, eyes dragging into mine before he pulls away. “ What? Sharing is caring.”

“Don’t be disgusting,” I mutter, clutching the cup tighter like I’m about to throw it or cradle it like a baby. I genuinely can’t tell which. My heart’s pounding like he dragged the entire dream in with him, heat, chaos, everything.

The last thing I want is to catch some disease because of him.

My brother’s best friend is a whore. He has this certain… reputation. Girls talk. Some whisper. Some brag. Either way, the math is horrifying.

“What?” he asks, casually rubbing the back of his neck, eyes flicking over me. “You worried I’ve got cooties or something?”

“Cooties would be the least of my problems,” I mutter into the mug, scowling. “I’ve heard stories.”

He smirks. “Oh yeah? Do tell.”

“No, thanks. I’m trying to keep my breakfast down.”

He laughs at that and my stomach flips like I’ve just stepped off a rollercoaster. Stupid reaction. I need to get this crush-exorcism done today. Or maybe check myself into a facility where hot people aren’t allowed to exist.

“Relax, princess,” he says, nudging the side of my mug with his knuckle. “It’s not like I kissed you or anything.”

My breath catches.

Because technically, he didn’t.

“Why do you hate me anyway? You seem friendly with others.”

There are a thousand reasons why I hate Miles. None of them is reasonable.

“Because you’re annoying.”

He scoffs. I think he’s going to walk away like he always does but instead, he shifts closer, so close I’m almost trapped between his thighs.

Miles leans down, slow, eyes dropping to my lips before locking on mine. “So annoying you were moaning my name last night, princess?”

“I wasn’t—” My voice cracks.

Fuck.

He tilts his head, mock concern painted across his stupid perfect face. “No? Are you sure about that?”

It wasn’t a dream. I wasn’t dreaming. I really saw Miles last night standing outside of my room.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

He smirks like a wolf just caught its prey mid-lie. His voice dips lower. Rougher. “Should I remind you?”

“No.”

“Should I tell your brother?” He grins wider, devilish and amused. “Tell him his sweet little sister was moaning his best friend’s name while touching herself?”

I shove him. Hard. My palm hits the solid chest, and it only makes him laugh. “Asshole.”

“You like assholes, don’t you?” he says, barely winded, jumping off the counter, and standing right in front of me. “That’s your type.”

I glare. “You’re not my type.”

He shrugs, unbothered. ""You're not my type too.""

""Excuse me?""

“Yeah. You’re bratty. Difficult. Mouthy as hell.”

My throat tightens. “Miles---""

“And you’re also Diego’s little sister,” he says, like it’s the punchline to a joke he’s been choking on for years. His eyes are dark now—flat, flickering, like he’s trying to convince himself of something he doesn’t believe.

“Miles—”

He cuts me off again, jaw tight. “Which means you’re off-limits. Always have been. Always fucking will be.”

I don’t know where this conversation is going but I’m sure as hell my face is red from embarrassment.

“I’m not a kid anymore,” I say, too quietly.

His mouth tenses. “Don’t remind me.”

“I’m not some virgin, Miles. I’ve had guys.”

Miles cursed, and the next thing I know he's gripping the mug out of my hands, and shoving me right next to the wall. ""You have a fucking what?""

""I'm not as innocent as you think.""

He’s breathing heavy. ""So you're a fucking whore?""

My gaze flies to him in horror as he says those words. I shouldn’t have said anything. But his mouth is still close enough to steal my breath. And every second he stands there looking at me like he could ruin me on instinct—I want it more.

God, I want him to ruin me. I want him to be furious.

“ I want to sleep with you.”

There. I’ve said it.

It’s been years since I knew what I wanted from Miles but he never looked in my direction.

“You don’t know what the fuck you’re asking for,” Miles says finally, voice low and fraying at the edges. “You think this is some high school fantasy, princess? You think I’ll be gentle with you?”

I’m not some idiot with a crush. I’ve tried to want other people. I’ve tried to forget how it felt the first time he ignored me and I liked it.

And I’m sick of pretending I’m not twisted enough to want the one man who’s made it clear he’ll never want me back.

“I want you,” I said.

I’m not sure how I sound. I’m not even sure I care anymore.I just know I’ve been desperate. And if I don’t get Miles out of my system soon, he’ll stay in it forever—and I hate that.

There’s no point denying it now. There’s no point dragging it further.

Miles leans in, jaw to my cheek. “ I could fuck you right here, Maureen.”

My knees nearly give out.

“I could make you scream my name with your brother three rooms away,” he whispers, voice so low I feel it more than hear it.

Miles drags his mouth down to my jaw, not kissing, just hovering—torturing. “You’d take it,” he whispers, dragging his hand back down, slipping under the waistband of my shorts. “You’d open your legs and let me fuck the attitude out of you.”

“Miles—”

He hums—dark, amused, cruel then the next thing I know he’s pulling out.

“What the hell—”

He steps back slowly, tongue dragging across his bottom lip, eyes still so fucking dark.

“Too bad,” he murmurs, eyes gleaming, “I don’t fuck desperate little brats.”

My jaw drops.

“You—”

He wipes his hand casually on the front of his jeans. Casually. Like I’m something dirty he needed to get off his fingers.

“I told you,” he says, smirking as he backs away, “I don’t do soft. I don’t do stupid. And I sure as fuck don’t do Diego’s little sister.”

I need your opinion on this idea an acquaintance told me about.   
  
Long story short (hopefully), he said a good friend of his (mid 40s) created a ""Dating Business Card."" It's simply the guys Name and phone number on a colorful business card. The man approaches a woman, introduces himself, asks her name, and hands her his card. He'd say something like, ""I'd enjoy taking you out for coffee or cocktails. Think about it. If interested simply text or call me.""  
  
According to him, the theory is it takes the pressure off her of giving up her phone number right then, and it gives her the power to make the decision to contact him. She can also research the guy with his name and phone number.  Supposedly, the guy says he might hand out 2-3 cards a week to ladies he sees at the store, gym, restaurants, wherever. He claims about 1/3 contact him, and half he meets.  Doing the math, that's about 10-12 per month, so 3-4 contact him, and he meets 1 or 2 ladies per month.

1pqg1y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/1pqg1y8/the_leangains_method_and_carbs_struggling/,The Leangains Method and Carbs [Struggling],"Hi everyone,

I’ve been doing variations of the Leangains Method  and **have always failed to feel satisfied on that diet.** Here are limitiations/restrictions I’ve faced throughout this journey:

1. Can’t drink coffee because of GERD symptoms, but decaf works well in itself to blunt hunger. One works well, the second one doesn’t trick my body as well.

2. Fiber - 1lb of some green veggie is the very limit I can do per day, anything more and the bloat is out of this world. I tried dividing the portion into 2-3 meals and nothing fixed it. Also, it doesn’t fill me up well and there’s a feeling of craving a few hours later.

3. 50-60% of protein is really hard for my body to accept. It wants more fats and carbs which then dilutes the percentage of protein, so I was never able to have a successful period of days hitting that high of protein. The symptoms would be hyper alertness at night, weird growlings throughout the day, and general stomach discomfort. This feeling accentuates if I consume lots of fat free greek yogurt but is also present if I consume lots of lean chicken thighs and/or 4% fat ground beef.

4. Fasting has always been my favorite way to blunt hunger, but some days feel harder than others to push through 18-20 hours a day. Just relying on the fast is unsustainable long term as I feel hunger throughout the day, but have managed to get to \~11-12% (clear visible 6 pack when flexing, semblant of soft 4 pack when not) in the past.

My hormones don’t seem too affected by a lower amount of fats (30-40g seems fine) but the lack of carbs absolutely ruins my mood, sleep and therefore hormones. A glass of milk before bed has helped but generally wasn’t enough to have a great night of sleep.

I never dabbled on lower than 500 calorie deficit.

M 5’9 148lbs I’d say I’m around 15% body fat (soft but visible 5 pack when flexing), current max lifts are:

Incline Dumbbell Press 55lbs per hand for 11

Weighted Pull Ups 25lbs for 9

Bulgarian Split Squats 50lbs per hand for 8 on each leg

Bench Press 160lbs for 10

Goal is to comfortably hit 12% and lean gain from there, rinse and repeat between 12 and 15%.

Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

You can search for any place you want to travel!

1pqg1ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1pqg1ch/when_do_you_think_its_worth_investing_in_things/,When do you think it’s worth investing in things that improve your life?,"I was chatting with a friend recently and realized something I’d never really stopped to think about: Recently I always felt that if I could do something myself, I shouldn’t spend money on it. But maybe it’s the mental load, maybe it’s just getting tired of juggling everything, because after having kids for a few years, I’ve become so much more willing to invest in things that make daily life a little easier.

These shifts didn’t happen overnight. They came from countless little moments that slowly added up. I used to think making my own morning coffee was no big deal, but now pressing a button on the capsule machine and having a real cup ready in minutes genuinely makes the whole day smoother. I used to insist on driving everywhere, and then found that taking an uber once in a while, no parking stress, no rushing,just makes me feel less stretched thin. And smart home things I used to roll my eyes at, like scheduled lights, automatic humidifier and my yeedi robot vacuum. Mainly to keep the cat hair from taking over, and seeing the floors consistently clean does more for my mood than I expected. It’s funny how these tiny conveniences end up freeing time and mental space that I can redirect to family, or honestly, just to myself.

Sometimes I feel like this is one of those realizations that show up. Now I’m much more willing to admit that I deserve a life that’s a little comfier and easier. It’s not laziness, it’s finally understanding the value of protecting my own energy. And if I had known earlier how much these small pockets of ease would matter, I probably would’ve made these changes years ago. Have you had similar feeling?

1pqfygu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pqfygu/my_23m_girlfriend_22f_is_lying_about_talking_to/,My (23M) girlfriend (22F) is lying about talking to her ex,"For some context, I have been with this girl for right at 3 1/2 years now. We met in 2020 during the pandemic and dated briefly, and I shamefully stopped talking to her out of nowhere and didn't offer an explanation at the time. Shortly after, she started talking to another guy who she was intimately involved with for a short period of time before he, in her own words, sexually assaulted her and left to be with his ex girlfriend. I reached back out in 2022 and we reconnected; at the same time, the other guy, who we'll call Derek, also reached out. Keep in mind, I was the first relationship she ever had and we never did anything intimate, Derek was her second and last ever relationship before we reconnected, and they never had intercourse but did perform oral sex on each other.

During our time dating in 2022, she never dropped contact with Derek and would constantly demonize me for disappearing in 2020, would tell me how much more she liked Derek than me, and that she would ""never have sex with"" me, ""never be (my) girlfriend"", and the list goes on. From what I saw in her text conversations with Derek, she never once berated him for how he treated her. She was almost apologetic in the way she texted him, wishing that things had turned out differently. A few months into dating, she told me that she's thinking about being friends with him, which is what she called our relationship at the time: just friends, even though we had been sleeping with each other and I was her first. I told her that if she was serious about not wanting to be my girlfriend and that she liked Derek more than me anyway, then I did not want her to feel held back and that she should do what she wants to. I didn't try to persuade her to make things work with me, and our relationship was actually great, and has been for the most part since we started dating, we rarely ever argue. She told me that she wasn't going to talk to him anymore, and criticized me for not asking her to be my girlfriend after all those months of dating. I told her that I didn't think she wanted me to be her boyfriend because that's what she literally told me, and she never stopped talking to the other guy who she claimed to like more than me. She said that she was just upset with me about what happened in 2020 and wanted to take our relationship seriously because of how great things were going, and that she can ""just be a bitch sometimes."" Derek kept reaching out and she would complain about it to me because she told him that she was happy with me and didn't want to talk to him anymore. I offered to say something to him on her behalf and she literally begged me not to. Soon after all of this, I asked her to be my girlfriend after a coffee date at a lakeside Korean BBQ. She hesitantly said yes and we've been officially boyfriend and girlfriend ever since.

Fast forward about a year and a half to March 2024, I was on my first over-the-road trip as a truck driver. Roughly a week in, she texted me extremely anxious that Derek had reached back out to her again and that she didn't know what to do. I told her that she's smart and I trust her to do the right thing, whatever she feels that may be. She responded something along the lines of, ""you're right, I'm just going to ignore him and not say anything. Thanks for being so understanding."" This is exactly what I expected to hear from her. I've never had any reason to not trust her, and our relationship up until this point was so rock solid that I couldn't have expected what was to come.

After being OTR for three weeks, I came home to a happy girlfriend that jumped into my arms and held me tightly. We had missed each other so much.

We both were attending college online at the time, and my laptop broke before I went OTR so I was using hers for homework while she was at work. It's a MacBook, so all of her text messages from her phone are synced to it. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see what Derek had texted her; mostly just expecting a ""hey"" and nothing more, but was curious nonetheless. When I saw what I saw, my entire body went cold.

Almost immediately after telling me that she wasn't going to respond, she wrote him a paragraph explaining how she felt that he belonged in her life, and that fate kept bringing them together. They talked almost all day every day, and she was even sending him pictures of her feet after she had them done at the salon. He would frequently make innuendos, like responding to ""wyd today"" with ""hopefully you ;)"", and she would just laugh it off. He would allude to her being a cheater and she wouldn't even playfully deny it. Their conversation concluded the same day that I told her I was coming back home and would stay for 2 weeks before going back to work. Her last words to him? ""Talk to you again in 2 weeks.""

When I confronted her about it, I was calm. I wanted her to tell me her side of what happened without letting on too much of what I knew. She tried to act like she didn't know what I was talking about at first, and would slowly spoonfeed me things, like she was trying to see how much I knew before letting on too much. I could not get her to actually admit to anything until I told her that I read then entire conversation. All she did was break down crying. I didn't even raise my voice, call names, nothing. I just asked her if she texted Derek back after saying she wouldn't and asked what they talked about. Her excuse was that she knew I wouldn't want her talking to him but wanted a friend because she was lonely while I was gone. I started to feel bad and comforted her by rubbing her back while she cried, but still expected an apology and some sort of resolution. I asked, ""what are you going to do to fix it?"" She said, ""idk, what do you want me to do?"" I said, ""maybe block him and say that it's never gonna happen again? That would be a good start."" She picked her phone up and said she would block him but hesitated, and put it back down before more tears started flowing. I got nothing from her for a week. As far as I knew, nothing had changed. I brought it up again a week later and she was angry, raising her voice, asking ""why do you care so much?"", and just being extremely dismissive of how the whole thing made me feel. I was betrayed, lied to, deceived, and never had a reason to distrust her until now. All i wanted was to hear her say ""here's how im going to fix it, it's never going to happen again, im sorry."" I got nothing. I was still confused, still questioning things. I wrote her an entire paragraph at work about how I felt, and she texted back ""can you just call me?"" I called, she picked up, and just said ""ok, so just say what you have to say.""

?????

I just wrote an entire paragraph, did you not read it? Nope, she started reading it while on the phone with me, and tried telling me how I was wrong about everything and misread the whole situation. More crying, more self pity, no apologies or resolution. I mentioned how she said she would block him and didn't actually do it, and she said through her tears and anger, ""here, you want me to block him? I'll block him right now! There, you happy?""

I knew that she was telling the truth because weeks later, he texted her from a fake number, which she told me about and said that she wasn't going to respond.

Fast forward to October of this year, over a year and a half later. He texts her again, and she tells me about it. This time, it's from his real number. At some point, she unblocked his real number for some weird reason, which she decided to leave out. She also left out that she had not only responded to him, but they had been talking behind my back while I was out of town this entire time. Reminiscing on the old times, critiquing me for not marrying her yet, even though we're both in college and she doesn't want to get married until after we graduate, months of conversations that she was yet again hiding from me.

I've known for a while now, at least a month, and haven't said anything yet. Idk what to do. This is the only problem we've had in our relationship, and even after hearing her uncertain reassurance that this would never happen again, here we are. How do I even confront her about it? This is just going to be March 2023 all over again; crying, self pity, no offer for a solution, and I now have practically no trust or emotional attachment to her anymore because being detached is the only way I can cope with this at the moment. I have to just pretend like I don't care so that I don't drive myself crazy, but I feel like I'm going crazy anyway. As far as I know, they havent met up and shes never cheated on me with anyone else, but to me this is clearly becoming a pattern of deciet and betrayal that she doesn't value our relationship enough to fix. I'm almost certain that she's afraid of losing this guy from the past and essentially wants to keep him as a ""just in case"" if our relationship doesn't work out, but we've planned our lives together. We're saving for a house, planning our marriage, finishing our degrees, and I've been 100% committed to her since we started dating in 2022, yet she's had one foot in with me and other foot out for this guy for a big portion of that. Im so confused and just need to know how to approach this. Do we break up? Do we decide to mutually detach from the relationship emotionally? I'm just so lost.

She also regularly checks my phone and doesn't find anything, because I'm legitimately a loner with no friends, no social media, and none of my exes even attempt to reach out to me.

She also doesn't want to perform oral sex on me, which is fine and I've never made a big deal of it, but it's at least worth noting that this guy who she seemingly still can't keep herself away from is the lucky one that got to experience that. Maybe she really just does like him more than me? ",1,1766132660.0,relationship_advice,6,0.67,False

Just did the classic Edinburgh “top to bottom” wander and honestly, it’s the perfect low-stress way to see the Old Town without turning the day into a military operation. It’s mostly downhill, packed with atmosphere, and you can keep it super simple or add detours if you’ve got energy (or coffee) 😄

**Full article + route details here:** [https://thetraveltinker.com/walking-tour/edinburgh-walking-tour/](https://thetraveltinker.com/walking-tour/edinburgh-walking-tour/)

# TL;DR route (in order) 🗺️

**Edinburgh Castle → Castlehill → Lawnmarket → High Street → Canongate → Scottish Parliament area → Palace of Holyroodhouse**

* **Distance:** \~1.8 km / 1.1 miles (plus detours)
* **Time:** 3–5 hours with photo + snack stops
* **Difficulty:** easy-moderate (cobbles + a few steep bits, but overall downhill)

# My stop-by-stop notes (what it actually feels like)

**1) Castle Esplanade (start here even if you skip the Castle) 🏰**  
Big views, big energy, and the city is basically posing for your camera.

* Do: take the skyline shots now before you’re dodging 200 people
* Tip: earlier = calmer = better photos

**2) Castlehill**  
Historic buildings, spires, and that first hit of “wow this is old” vibes.

* Do: dip into one close for 30 seconds just to feel the mood shift
* Good to know: wet cobbles can be slick

**3) Lawnmarket**  
This is where the Royal Mile gets busy-busy. Shops, performers, chaos in a good way.

* Do: look up at the buildings, not just straight ahead
* Tip: if it feels intense, hop into a close like you’re escaping a zombie film

**4) St Giles area ⛪**  
A great “reset” stop. Quiet inside, warm if it’s freezing outside.

* Do: quick wander to chill your brain for 10 minutes
* Good to know: perfect spot for a calm break without committing to a full café sit-down

**5) High Street → Canongate**  
You’ll notice the vibe shift as you go downhill. Still historic, just a bit less hectic.

* Do: pick one or two side streets/closes and have a mini explore
* Tip: this is the best part for “Edinburgh textures” (old doors, stone stairs, wee courtyards)

**6) Scottish Parliament area**  
Suddenly it opens up, you get more sky and hills in the background.

* Do: slow down and enjoy the contrast from the tight Old Town streets
* Good to know: this is where you decide if you’re adding any hill detours

**7) Palace of Holyroodhouse (finish) 👑**  
Feels like a proper finale. You’re at the bottom of the Mile and it’s a satisfying end point.

* Do: have a sit down and reward yourself with a snack immediately

# Food stops along the way ☕🍰

You’re spoiled for choice on the Mile. I’d do it like this:

* **Coffee + pastry** around Lawnmarket/High Street
* **Lunch** mid-route so you’re not hangry-dodging crowds
* **Post-walk pint/whisky** near the Holyrood end if you fancy a “we did it” moment 🍻

**Costs (rough guide):**

* Coffee + pastry: **£4–£8** (about **€5–€9 / $5–$10**)
* Lunch: **£8–£15** (about **€9–€17 / $10–$19**)
* Pint: **£6–£7** (about **€7–€8 / $8–$9**)

**Pro tip:** Avoid the 12:30–2pm lunch crush unless you love queue culture.

# Best photo spots 📸

* Castle Esplanade views
* Looking downhill along the Royal Mile
* Any close entrance with moody stone steps
* Holyrood end with the big sky/hills backdrop

# Quick Q&As ⚡️

**Is it mostly uphill or downhill?**  
Downhill from Castle to Palace (thank you, geography).

**Can you do it in bad weather?**  
Yes, just wear grippy shoes and use indoor stops to break it up.

**Is it kid-friendly?**  
Yep, as long as you build in snack breaks and don’t try to speed-run it.

**Can you shorten it?**  
Totally. You can peel off at several points and hop on public transport.

MILES

I had rules to follow to not lose my damn mind.

First rule: Stay the fuck away from my best friend’s little sister.

Second: Don’t sneak into her room.

Yet here I am, standing in her doorway like a goddamn psychopath, listening to her make those soft little whimpers.

The fuck?

Anger cuts through me like a hot wire. Half of the guys are passed out downstairs. They threw a party for her brother tonight. The house is full of drunk assholes.

God, I’m sick but I’m not stupid. I know what those moans are for. I know that sound. She’s a grown woman. Twenty-one. Legal. Beautiful. But mine.

I start counting.

Who’s downstairs? Jax is out cold on the couch. Timothee’s out with a bowl of chips on his chest. Ron and Blaze were still on the porch last I checked.

So who the fuck is missing?

My pulse spikes.

I back away from her door slowly, breathing hard, running through every name on that guest list and coming up short.

There’s one car I didn’t recognize in the driveway. Someone someone brought. New recruit? Friend of a friend?

My jaw tightens. I’ll kill him.

If he’s in there, if he touched her, looked at her, heard that fucking sound come out of her mouth, I’ll bury him.

I drag a hand down my face, try to think, try to breathe. But all I hear is her voice, soft, breathy, whimpering again.

Fuck this.

I move before I know what I’m doing.

There’s a little hole in her door. It’s one of those tiny cracks where the wood never shuts right. And fuck me, I can hear her.

No. No, I’m not a pervert. I’m just…concerned. That’s what I keep telling myself. Because half the guys in this house are blacked out or thinking with the wrong head, and any one of them could’ve walked up here.

Any one of them could’ve opened this door. Could’ve touched her. Could’ve seen what I’m seeing now. And I would’ve fucking killed them.

I would’ve put them through the goddamn wall and smiled while I did it.

She doesn’t even know the danger she’s in—walking around here soft and warm like this world won’t eat her alive. She’s soft. Warm. Fucking sunshine. And I don’t get to have that. Not with what I’ve done. Not with the shit Diego and I have buried.

If I touch her, I’ll drag her into my filth.

I lean in. Just a glance. One fucking glance, and I swear I’ll walk away. Keep my distance. Be a good man. Be the saint she thinks I never was. But what I see nearly brings me to my knees.

She’s glowing.

Bathed in lamplight, skin flushed and bare, hair sticking to her cheek. One leg hooked over her sheets, sleep shorts shoved halfway down her thighs. Her hand’s between them, fingers moving slow, slick, perfect.

Fucking hell.

I've never seen such a delicacy being offered to mankind.

She’s working herself up and slow at first, drawing it out like she wants to savor every second.

This is so fucking wrong. I should turn around, go downstairs, pretend I didn’t see a thing and let her have her moment.

Let her do her… thing.

But then her lips suddenly parted and she fucking moans what sounded like my name.

“Miles…”

And I swear to God, the world stops spinning.

She says it again—higher this time, breath catching, like she’s close. Like she’s been thinking about me this whole time.

Me.

I can’t breathe. I can’t even blink nor lie to myself anymore.

I’ve been wanting her since the day I saw her after she got back from boarding school. Hair longer. Hips curved. Mouth smart and too damn pretty for her own good.

I’ve been telling myself it’s so fucking wrong to want her.That she’s too young. Too good. Too off-limits. That I’m a sick bastard for watching the way her shirt rides up when she stretches, or how her lip gets caught in her teeth when she’s trying not to cry.

But now, here she is touching herself to the thought of me, and now I’m never going to be the same.

Not after this.

Because I’m not guessing anymore. I’m not hoping or imagining or jerking off in the shower just so I won’t touch her. She’s right here. In the flesh. Soaked and panting. Whimpering my name like she’s already mine.

I watch her hips stutter, her fingers falter, and I know she’s about to come. Her face twists—forehead pinched, lashes fluttering—and she lets out the softest, filthiest sound I’ve ever heard in my life.

This girl.

This beautiful, reckless, dirty-mouthed little siren.

“Miles—oh my god, Miles—”

Maureen screams my name, high, broken, shameless and that seals it for me. That’s it. I’m done. There’s no climbing out of this now. No pretending I’m a good man. No more lines I won’t cross. I’m going to hell for wanting her. But I’ll fucking have her.

I know I don’t deserve it, not even a little, but I savor how her body twitches in the aftermath.

Every soft little aftershock. Every quiver of her thighs.

She’s a magnificent piece of fucking heaven laid bare—flushed, panting, wrecked in the most beautiful way a girl can be.

She looks ruined.

Perfectly, thoroughly, sinfully ruined.

Maureen shifts, slow and hazy, body still humming and then she suddenly turns.

I’m no religious man. But when she rolls over, I probably call on every damn deity there is, whispering silent, panicked prayers that she doesn’t see me.

Except deities don’t listen to fucked-up guys like me. My best friend’s little sister opens her eyes and they find mine.

I’m Miles Montgomery. And I am completely, unapologetically—about to ruin my best friend’s little sister.

# The Desperate Brat

MAUREEN

“So, how was it?”

“What?”

I pause, cup halfway to my lips, and snort when Miles settles on top of our countertop. Since when did our house become a frat house? I’m really going to kill my brother for letting these morons stay here.

“Does it taste good?” he asks, nodding at the mug in my hand.

I take another sip.

Mostly to avoid answering. It’s good. Annoyingly good. Strong enough to burn a little going down. Strong enough to silence the headache I woke up with and whatever the hell I thought I saw last night.

There’s no way that was real, right?

I think I stared at him for too long.Way too long. Long enough for my brain to short-circuit and start playing reruns of every despicable little daydream I’ve had about him.

He pushes off the counter, nudging my mug closer like he’s doing me a favor.

“Strong coffee, huh?”

I nod, still reeling.

He grins, mocking, warm, something in between and I gasp when he lowers his face and drinks straight from my mug.

“You—” My voice cuts off, equal parts offended and unreasonably flustered.

Miles swipes his thumb along his bottom lip, eyes dragging into mine before he pulls away. “ What? Sharing is caring.”

“Don’t be disgusting,” I mutter, clutching the cup tighter like I’m about to throw it or cradle it like a baby. I genuinely can’t tell which. My heart’s pounding like he dragged the entire dream in with him, heat, chaos, everything.

The last thing I want is to catch some disease because of him.

My brother’s best friend is a whore. He has this certain… reputation. Girls talk. Some whisper. Some brag. Either way, the math is horrifying.

“What?” he asks, casually rubbing the back of his neck, eyes flicking over me. “You worried I’ve got cooties or something?”

“Cooties would be the least of my problems,” I mutter into the mug, scowling. “I’ve heard stories.”

He smirks. “Oh yeah? Do tell.”

“No, thanks. I’m trying to keep my breakfast down.”

He laughs at that and my stomach flips like I’ve just stepped off a rollercoaster. Stupid reaction. I need to get this crush-exorcism done today. Or maybe check myself into a facility where hot people aren’t allowed to exist.

“Relax, princess,” he says, nudging the side of my mug with his knuckle. “It’s not like I kissed you or anything.”

My breath catches.

Because technically, he didn’t.

“Why do you hate me anyway? You seem friendly with others.”

There are a thousand reasons why I hate Miles. None of them is reasonable.

“Because you’re annoying.”

He scoffs. I think he’s going to walk away like he always does but instead, he shifts closer, so close I’m almost trapped between his thighs.

Miles leans down, slow, eyes dropping to my lips before locking on mine. “So annoying you were moaning my name last night, princess?”

“I wasn’t—” My voice cracks.

Fuck.

He tilts his head, mock concern painted across his stupid perfect face. “No? Are you sure about that?”

It wasn’t a dream. I wasn’t dreaming. I really saw Miles last night standing outside of my room.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

He smirks like a wolf just caught its prey mid-lie. His voice dips lower. Rougher. “Should I remind you?”

“No.”

“Should I tell your brother?” He grins wider, devilish and amused. “Tell him his sweet little sister was moaning his best friend’s name while touching herself?”

I shove him. Hard. My palm hits the solid chest, and it only makes him laugh. “Asshole.”

“You like assholes, don’t you?” he says, barely winded, jumping off the counter, and standing right in front of me. “That’s your type.”

I glare. “You’re not my type.”

He shrugs, unbothered. ""You're not my type too.""

""Excuse me?""

“Yeah. You’re bratty. Difficult. Mouthy as hell.”

My throat tightens. “Miles---""

“And you’re also Diego’s little sister,” he says, like it’s the punchline to a joke he’s been choking on for years. His eyes are dark now—flat, flickering, like he’s trying to convince himself of something he doesn’t believe.

“Miles—”

He cuts me off again, jaw tight. “Which means you’re off-limits. Always have been. Always fucking will be.”

I don’t know where this conversation is going but I’m sure as hell my face is red from embarrassment.

“I’m not a kid anymore,” I say, too quietly.

His mouth tenses. “Don’t remind me.”

“I’m not some virgin, Miles. I’ve had guys.”

Miles cursed, and the next thing I know he's gripping the mug out of my hands, and shoving me right next to the wall. ""You have a fucking what?""

""I'm not as innocent as you think.""

He’s breathing heavy. ""So you're a fucking whore?""

My gaze flies to him in horror as he says those words. I shouldn’t have said anything. But his mouth is still close enough to steal my breath. And every second he stands there looking at me like he could ruin me on instinct—I want it more.

God, I want him to ruin me. I want him to be furious.

“ I want to sleep with you.”

There. I’ve said it.

It’s been years since I knew what I wanted from Miles but he never looked in my direction.

“You don’t know what the fuck you’re asking for,” Miles says finally, voice low and fraying at the edges. “You think this is some high school fantasy, princess? You think I’ll be gentle with you?”

I’m not some idiot with a crush. I’ve tried to want other people. I’ve tried to forget how it felt the first time he ignored me and I liked it.

And I’m sick of pretending I’m not twisted enough to want the one man who’s made it clear he’ll never want me back.

“I want you,” I said.

I’m not sure how I sound. I’m not even sure I care anymore.I just know I’ve been desperate. And if I don’t get Miles out of my system soon, he’ll stay in it forever—and I hate that.

There’s no point denying it now. There’s no point dragging it further.

Miles leans in, jaw to my cheek. “ I could fuck you right here, Maureen.”

My knees nearly give out.

“I could make you scream my name with your brother three rooms away,” he whispers, voice so low I feel it more than hear it.

Miles drags his mouth down to my jaw, not kissing, just hovering—torturing. “You’d take it,” he whispers, dragging his hand back down, slipping under the waistband of my shorts. “You’d open your legs and let me fuck the attitude out of you.”

“Miles—”

He hums—dark, amused, cruel then the next thing I know he’s pulling out.

“What the hell—”

He steps back slowly, tongue dragging across his bottom lip, eyes still so fucking dark.

“Too bad,” he murmurs, eyes gleaming, “I don’t fuck desperate little brats.”

My jaw drops.

“You—”

He wipes his hand casually on the front of his jeans. Casually. Like I’m something dirty he needed to get off his fingers.

“I told you,” he says, smirking as he backs away, “I don’t do soft. I don’t do stupid. And I sure as fuck don’t do Diego’s little sister.”

1pqfwos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1pqfwos/181st_second_lavern_ross_was_cheating_on_marina/,181St Second | Lavern Ross was cheating on Marina Finley,"Lavern Ross was cheating on Marina Finley.

Marina stood outside the fitting room in the bridal shop, witnessing her future husband Lavern fooling around with another woman.

""Lavern... does this wedding dress look better on me, or on your fiancée?"" the woman asked.

""Of course on you. I'm dying to be all over you; doesn't that prove how irresistible you are?"" he said.

Thrilled with his answer, the woman let out a flirtatious giggle. ""I want you to remember me forever. On your wedding day, on your anniversaries, you'll always think back to today, to me.""

Marina listened to the soft moans from inside, feeling like she'd been plunged into an icy abyss.

On the eve of their wedding, Lavern, who'd always seemed so devoted to family, had been taking frequent business trips. Turned out, he had a side piece.

Fighting back the nausea churning in her stomach, Marina turned and walked away, heading to her car.

They'd been together for seven years, building a business from scratch, hustling side by side to turn Ross Group into the success it was today.

Her sister Elnora Finley had warned her that Lavern wasn't a good match, and there was still a message from her on the phone.

Elnora: \[The Finley family won't be attending your wedding to Lavern. You're on your own.\]

With red-rimmed eyes, Marina opened her phone and typed a reply.

Marina: \[I'm calling off the wedding.\]

It took a while for the response to come through.

Elnora: \[Come back to Vrufield in a month, and I'll believe you. Otherwise, we're through as sisters.\]

Marina sent back a simple \[Okay\] and pocketed her phone.

She started the car and drove off. Meanwhile, Lavern stepped out of the bridal shop with his arm around the woman. Spotting the familiar license plate, he froze for a moment.

In that brief hesitation, the car vanished into the distance.

He shrugged off her hand from his arm, straightened his clothes, and slipped back into his polished, dignified facade. ""I'll have my assistant drop you off.""

The woman whined, clinging to him. ""Nooo, you promised we'd go shopping.""

Lavern lifted a hand, ruffling her hair, his eyes flashing with an unyielding chill. ""Behave.""

She didn't dare push it, sulkily letting go and following his assistant away.

Once she was gone, Lavern headed to his own car. Catching his reflection in the glossy paint, he saw no trace of debauchery in his sharp features; no hint of wine, women, or excess.

Back at home, he spotted Marina's car in the garage. She was still in the driver's seat, staring at her phone.

""You went out?"" He opened the door, casually tossing his suit jacket onto the passenger seat before leaning in close.

His black shirt was unbuttoned at the top, revealing glimpses of his toned muscles. No lingering signs of another woman on him.

When she stayed silent, he leaned in for a kiss.

Marina switched off her phone and held up a hand to stop him, her tone icy. ""Are you scared of me going out?""

He paused for a beat. ""Of course not. You can head out whenever you want. I just worry you'll get bored without company.""

With that, he smiled, sliding an arm around her waist and cooing softly. ""Tell me, who's got my darling all worked up?""

Marina didn't respond, just staring at his strikingly handsome face, her eyes cold as frost.

He was the same as ever, always quick to pick up on her mood swings, pinpoint the issue, fix it, and shower her with emotional reassurance.

She shook her head, looking away, her voice flat and distant. ""Lavern, you've been swamped lately. I don't see the point in going through with the wedding. I'm worried you won't have the bandwidth for it.""

Lavern thought Marina was being downright ungrateful at that moment. After all, he was a somebody now, a well-known figure.

""Say that again!"" His voice was laced with fury.

Marina held his gaze without flinching. ""There's no point in going through with our wedding. I'm worried you won't have the bandwidth for it.""

As she turned to leave, Lavern grabbed her arm, his anger flashing unmistakably in his eyes.

He said, ""I'm killing myself with work for our company, for our future. Do you want our kid to start off already behind the eight ball?

""I just got back from a business trip, and instead of showing even a hint of concern, you're throwing a tantrum and being completely unreasonable. When did you become like this?""

Marina stared at him, taking in his groundless accusations, and found the whole thing almost comical.

Lavern standing before her felt like a total stranger, as if she'd never really known him at all.

He was full of lies, just like so many other guys, cheating and then pinning all the blame on the other person, as if his betrayal had been unavoidable, like she'd forced him at knifepoint to sleep with someone else.

The wedding was still two months away, and Elnora had given her a month to tie up loose ends here. In that time, she'd erase Lavern from her life completely.

She marched straight upstairs to the bedroom and into the bathroom to wash up.

Lavern trailed after her, slipping his arms around her from behind and softening his tone.

""It's all my fault, Marina. I've been buried in work lately and haven't been paying attention to how you're feeling. Over the next few days, I'll clear my schedule of all commitments and come straight home after work to be with you, okay?""

Marina looked up into the mirror at Lavern cooing at her with that gentle, placating voice. A sardonic smile tugged at her lips. ""Why even bother? I...""

Before she could finish, Lavern's phone rang, the ringtone was a warm, upbeat love song that had just gone viral.

His old ringtones had always been those generic default sounds. Marina recalled their early, head-over-heels days, back when the company was just starting out. She'd suggested they both switch to a romantic duet, but he'd brushed it off, saying he met with clients too often and it wouldn't come across as professional.

Turned out, it wasn't about professionalism at all; it just wasn't worth it for her.

Lavern fished out his phone, glanced at the screen, and hung up. ""Scam call.""

Marina pressed her lips into a thin line. She'd clearly caught the caller ID: \[181 Seconds.\] She just muttered ""Oh"" and dropped it.

The phone rang again. He hung up, but it buzzed once more, and finally, he turned his back to answer it.

He said, ""We've got some major projects at the company right now; I'm swamped. I hope you can cut me a little slack. I'll stay late at the office tonight and head back first thing tomorrow to try on the wedding dress with you. Don't wait up; get some sleep.""

Marina didn't glance his way, just kept brushing her teeth. In the mirror, she saw him exit the bathroom and leave through the door.

Once he was out, she pulled out her phone and searched online for the meaning of ""181 Seconds.""

She immediately spotted the top explanation among the results.

\[People's passions usually fizzle out after three minutes, but you're my 181st second.\]

Marina swallowed the inexplicable pang in her chest and casually opened a real estate app, putting their current villa up for sale.

In a month, she'd return to Vrufield, and none of the fixed assets in Sicester would matter to her anymore. She wanted nothing from this place, including Lavern.

# Chapter 2 Good As New

The villa Marina'd put up for sale was priced hundreds of thousands dollars below market value, which quickly drew a flurry of private messages from interested buyers.

By the time she'd responded to them all, it was the middle of the night.

Still wide awake, Marina opened up a popular app that was blowing up among women lately.

As soon as she logged in, a push notification for a post jumped out at her.

\[My lover's tying the knot in two months, but today I slipped into his fiancée's wedding dress and hooked up with him right there in the bridal shop! It was exhilarating and so taboo.\]

The comments section was filled with vitriol aimed at the poster, and a few people were even wishing the algorithm would shove it in the fiancée's face.

Marina's hand shook as she clicked through to the poster's profile.

She scrolled down fast until she reached the very first post; no text, just a single photo. It was of two hands clasped together, fingers intertwined.

She immediately noticed the tiny mole on the man's index finger and the ring on his ring finger.

The post dated back six months, only a week after Lavern had proposed to her.

Marina stared blankly at her phone, her gaze shifting to the identical ring on her own finger as nausea welled up inside her.

A second later, she ripped it off and flung it into the toilet, hitting the flush. She thought, 'No sense in hanging onto something already soiled.'

The poster dropped an update not long after. Gone was the smug vibe from before; now the caption had a desperate, pleading edge.

\[Cut it out with the hate. We've got a deal; I'll hand him back to his fiancée good as new in a month.\]

The photo attached showed a man's back as he lay sprawled on a bed. That outline was so eerily familiar it sent a chill through Marina.

She thought, 'Hand him back good as new?' She let out a snort.

Right then, she got why people sometimes just laughed when words failed them completely.

Lavern didn't come home that night. First thing in the morning, he called without a word of excuse, simply instructing her to meet him at the bridal shop.

Marina got to the bridal shop a few minutes early.

Her wedding gown was on display in the third-floor VIP area, looking regal and spotless, like it had never been tainted.

""Ms. Finley, Mr. Ross is en route. Why don't we get you into the dress now? That way, he'll walk in and see you looking flawless right off the bat."" The staffer was polite and deferential, though her eyes held a subtle flicker of pity.

Marina kept her face neutral and shook her head. ""No thanks."" The idea turned her stomach.

She'd barely gotten the words out when a strong arm snaked around her waist from behind, yanking her close. His familiar scent, mingled with the clean whiff of shower gel, hit her senses.

""Why not? Marina, you have no idea how long I've been dreaming of this moment. Try it on for me, yeah?"" Lavern said.

Marina glanced over at Lavern next to her, who looked fresh as a daisy, not a trace of someone who'd supposedly worked through the night. She scoffed to herself.

He wasn't alone, either; a young woman hovered a little ways back.

She had on light blue jeans with a crisp white blouse, her face beaming with a sweet, innocent grin that screamed youth.

Marina peered past Lavern, locking her frosty stare on the girl. She thought, 'Is this yet another sick twist in their little thrill-seeking game?'

Lavern caught her looking, his hold on her waist tightening even as he kept his face relaxed. ""She's a business partner's daughter. Her vibe reminds me of you from back in the day; figured you two might click, so I brought her along for intros.""

He beckoned her forward, and the girl scampered over eagerly, sticking out her hand to Marina. ""Hey, Marina! I'm Shawna Thornton. So nice to meet you!""

Marina ignored the handshake, averting her eyes and refusing to engage. Her tone was bland. ""'Shawna', good name indeed. Guess not many guys can snap back to reality after they meet you.""

As she picked up on the jab, Shawna's face crumpled into a hurt pout. ""Are you saying I'm some kind of man-stealer, Marina?""

The arm around her waist dug in painfully. Marina shot a sideways glance at the irritation in his eyes, and only then did he loosen his grip, bending down to murmur gently in her ear.

He said, ""If you're pissed, save it for me at home, punch me, scream, whatever floats your boat. But she's sensitive; don't call her out like this in front of her. Let's focus on trying the dress for now.""

The staff shook off their stunned daze and quickly grabbed the wedding dress from the rack, motioning for Marina to try it on.

Marina glanced over at Shawna, catching the way her eyes sparkled as they locked onto the gown in the staffer's grasp.

A chill flickered in Marina's gaze, and she spoke up, ""Like it?""

Shawna didn't hesitate, blurting out her answer, ""Yeah, I do.""

She snuck a quick, nervous peek at Lavern, spotting the icy edge in his stare, then tacked on timidly, laced with envy.

""But not every girl's as fortunate as you, Marina, slipping into her dream dress and tying the knot with the guy she loves."" Her eyes were downcast as she said it, her disappointment and hurt obvious to everyone.

Marina flicked a sideways glance at Lavern next to her, his face a blank slate, then told the staff flatly, ""I'm not up for it today; feeling off and don't want to fuss. Her figure's close to mine; let her model it instead.""

Just the idea of slipping into a dress they'd already sullied made her skin crawl, like she might catch something.

The staff froze, unsure, and shot a cautious look at Lavern.

He stared down at Marina, his expression turning stormy.

But Shawna jumped right in, stepping forward with her trademark sugary smile. ""Awesome! It's a real privilege to try it on for you, Marina."" And with that, she reached out for the gown.

The staff were speechless. At a loss, they turned imploring eyes toward Lavern.

His dark eyes gleamed with a frosty warning, his whole vibe dark and brooding.

Shawna nibbled her lip, looking totally flustered.

Marina brushed off the hand circling her waist, sank onto a nearby sofa, and nudged her along. ""Well, get to it.""

That perked Shawna right up; she snatched the dress from the staff and ducked into the fitting room.

Lavern furrowed his brow and sat down beside Marina, ready to air his grievances, but she beat him to it, looking up with a smirk that didn't reach her eyes. ""Aren't you gonna go in and help her out?""

Her words landed like a bomb, leaving everyone frozen in awkward silence.

The employees who'd handled Lavern and Shawna the day before were dying inside, barely holding back a gasp.

They thought, 'Thank goodness we didn't call out sick; we have prime seats for this meltdown.'

Lavern's brows knitted tighter, his lips thinning out, his tone guarded. ""Marina, what the hell are you getting at?""

""Oh, nothing. Just thought you'd jump at the chance to assist."" Marina flashed a smile, then flagged down a staffer for a coffee.

The fitting room's heavy curtain whooshed open, and there stood Shawna in the middle, all coy and composed, her grin sweeter than candy.

The gown, custom-made for Marina, hugged her like it was meant for Shawna all along.

Marina tilted her head toward Lavern, her smile cold as ice, and asked, ""Doesn't she look stunning?""

He kept his face like thunder, refusing to glance over, his voice deep and refined. ""Marina, what game are you playing here?""

Marina ignored him, cradling her coffee as she sauntered over to Shawna.

As she got close, Shawna flung her hands up to shield her face, expecting a scalding splash. But no burn came; instead, shocked gasps filled the room.

Shawna dropped her hands and glanced down, horrified at the pricey gown now marred by gross brown stains.

Staffers swarmed in with tissues, dabbing frantically, but the spots were stubborn.

Marina fixed her with a blank stare and sneered. ""How exactly do you plan to give back something this trashed and expect it to be 'good as new'?""

Shawna went pale as a ghost, frozen in place, clueless what to do next.

Lavern's frown deepened as he marched over, stone-faced, snatching Marina's wrist and yanking her toward the door.

In a swift move, Marina swung her free hand and slapped him hard across the cheek. The smack rang out sharp and clear.

The room fell deathly quiet.

She'd thrown everything into it; her palm buzzed with numbness.

Lavern shot her a glare, his face a storm cloud, eyes colder than she'd ever seen.

The shop staff averted their eyes from his fury, and even Shawna didn't dare breathe.

Since Ross Group had taken root in Sicester, no one had dared humiliate him in public; let alone with a woman's slap.

Marina held his brutal, ice-cold gaze, her pulse racing. The power gap was huge; if he struck back, she'd be done for.

Lavern noticed her fluttering lashes, exhaled softly, and slid his arm around her waist. ""Feeling any better?""

# Chapter 3 Someone Who Doesn't Matter

""No,"" Marina responded. She thought, 'Just one slap? How could that possibly make me feel any better?'

Lavern took the hand she'd just slapped him with and brushed a soft kiss across her palm. ""Did that sting? Once we're home, I'll ice it for you and explain everything properly, alright? No need to get worked up over someone who doesn't matter.""

Marina dropped her gaze, a flicker of sorrow crossing her eyes. She thought, 'This must be that age-old guy thing, unless you catch them in the act, they'll never admit they're wrong.'

""Someone who doesn't matter? You mean Ms. Thornton?"" Marina tilted her head, eyeing Shawna's face.

Shawna stood there, pale as a sheet, rigid like a mannequin, all the earlier defiance in her stare when she'd first strutted into the shop completely gone.

""Yes."" Lavern's answer landed firm and without a hint of waver.

Shawna blanched even further.

As they stepped out of the bridal shop, Marina headed straight for her car.

Lavern grabbed her hand, pulling her close with unyielding force. ""Ride with me; I'll drive you home.""

She tried to wrench free, but his grip was ironclad; she couldn't shake him off and ended up being hauled over to his car.

Lavern popped the passenger door. Sitting right there on the sleek gray-and-black seat was a pink-and-white hair clip.

He reached in without a rush, picking it up like it was nothing.

Marina let out a scoff. ""Might want to give it a once-over, check for any other personal goodies hidden away? If I stumble on some underwear in there, I'll need therapy for my eyes.""

Lavern, who'd been playing it cool up till now, suddenly blew up like a cat whose tail got yanked. ""Marina, why does your mind always dive straight into the dirt?

""I love you, but I won't put up with this. What happened today is a one-off, and it better stay that way. Ross Group's right on the verge of breaking through to the next level, and I can't dodge having female colleagues or partners in the mix.

""You embarrassed Shawna today, and I'm overlooking it because she's just entry-level. But if you pull the same crap on some influential woman you suspect down the line, going all impulsive like that, how's Ross Group supposed to keep growing?""

Marina held his stare calmly, her bright, clear eyes iced over. It was dawning on her just how masterful Lavern was at gaslighting.

She didn't argue or hop into his ride. Instead, she turned sharply, slid back into her own car, started it up, and sped off.

With people milling about outside the bridal shop, Lavern didn't bother chasing after her to save face. He jerked his door open, scowling like a storm cloud. As he leaned in to get behind the wheel, he caught sight of Shawna emerging from the shop, her pretty face drained of color.

He paused for a second, then waved her over. ""Get in.""

Meanwhile, Marina frowned at the black luxury car ahead, its back bumper dented in, license plate a string of ""8""s.

She'd spaced out for just a moment and rear-ended it. Full blame on her; she'd have to pay up for letting her mind wander.

She swung her door open, stepped out, and began apologizing to the driver climbing out of the other vehicle. ""Sorry, I...""

The other driver gave her a quick once-over but didn't say a word, instead respectfully swinging open the rear door.

Out stepped a tall, striking figure. The man's shirt was buttoned meticulously to the top, his chiseled features set in an air of unapproachable indifference.

The moment she laid eyes on him, a flash of memory hit Marina. She thought, 'I know this guy; he is Dar...'

Before she could get a word out, he'd already strode away, lounging casually against the roadside barrier with his phone pressed to his ear in his left hand. A light breeze occasionally ruffled his tousled hair, revealing his broad forehead.

""Miss, just hit me up once the car's fixed, and I'll set up a time for you to grab it."" The driver passed her a business card.

Marina snuck a glance over there. The man was deep in his call, must've been hitting a snag, given his subtle frown, and now and then, he'd idly poke at a bird chilling on the railing.

Ten minutes later, a sleek van rolled up. He hopped in without a hitch, while the driver stuck around to wrap things up. Right before sliding in, his eyes flicked her way, and Marina dodged the gaze, feeling oddly guilty.

By the time all the paperwork was done and details noted, it was well into the night when she finally made it home.

Lavern had pinged her with another message in the meantime, but Marina ignored it again.

She was wiped out. After a quick wash-up, she crashed onto the bed and sank into a deep sleep.

The next day, she lined up viewings for interested buyers through the real estate app and, in the process, purged and ditched a ton of stuff.

Most of it was cheap trinkets Lavern had gifted her back in their college days. Things she'd once cherished, but now that she'd seen him for who he really was, they just came off as tacky and worthless, like Lavern himself.

Three days later, Lavern walked in to find Marina out in the garden, tending to some newly bloomed roses.

He approached from behind, slipping his arms around her waist and pulling her close affectionately. ""Babe, miss me?""

Marina scoffed coldly. ""With a lovely sidepiece keeping you company, why would you need me pining away? You'd probably rather I forget you exist so I don't interrupt your cozy rendezvous.""

Her voice was detached as she replied, and in his split-second lapse, she twisted free from his embrace.

A subtle whiff of women's perfume clung to him, drifting over and making her queasy.

Lavern reacted lightning-fast, grabbing her waist and hauling her back against him. His firm muscles radiated heat even through his shirt.

Marina wriggled, but he just clamped down harder around her waist, pinning her in place.

""You're the only one I love. Cut it out, okay?"" He bent slightly, whispering in her ear, his tone low and sultry as he tried to placate her.

Marina's fingers dug in tight, and a rose thorn pierced her skin, drawing a bead of blood. The sharp pain in her fingertip still couldn't drown out the revulsion bubbling up inside.

She dropped her hand, letting the rose stems scatter across the ground.

Lavern noticed, lifting her hand to check the cut on her finger, his brow creasing. He leaned down, about to suck the blood from her still-oozing fingertip.

The instant her finger grazed his warm lips, Marina's face contorted.

She thought, 'How could he spend three days fooling around with Shawna and then come back here, acting all lovey-dovey like it was nothing?

'Who knows how many kisses those lips have shared with Shawna? Disgusting! Utterly disgusting!'

In a pure reflex, Marina lashed out quick and sharp, slapping him hard across his sharp, handsome face. Her palm buzzed with numbness.

He didn't move a muscle, just stared her down with a face like stone, his eyes filled with an indescribable chill.

# Chapter 4 She's Gone

Marina bit back the impulse to unleash a full-blown screaming match and turned on her heel, heading into the house.

These past three days, Lavern had been swamped, but she hadn't exactly been twiddling her thumbs.

Photos of him and Shawna slipping in and out of some apartment together had been pouring into her phone nonstop.

With their wedding right around the corner, he was cool as a cucumber about cohabiting with v, treating it like his last hurrah before the ""ball and chain"" of marriage.

Lavern trailed after her inside, rummaged through the cabinet for the first-aid kit, grabbed some iodine and cotton swabs, and approached with a grim look on his face.

Without a peep, he snatched her hand and started cleaning the wound. ""You adore these hands; don't go injuring yourself just to spite me.""

A sardonic smile curved Marina's lips. ""Aren't you the one doing the hurting?""

She didn't harp on it, instead snagging a document from nearby and thrusting it under his nose. ""Review the terms. If it's all good, sign on the dotted line.""

Lavern took it, his striking brows furrowing as he skimmed the contents. ""A property split agreement?""

Marina murmured a soft ""Yeah.""

He tossed the file aside with a chuckle. ""We're on the brink of tying the knot; what's the point of this?""

He'd chalked up her words from that day to just blowing off steam. He thought, 'Seven years together; she won't actually bail on me.'
