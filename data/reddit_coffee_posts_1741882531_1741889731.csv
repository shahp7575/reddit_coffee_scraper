For reference, I have a degree in MIS, 2+ years experience in IT along with 3+ years in supply chain/customer success. I casted a wide net of roles I applied to. A lot of analyst roles, account management, customer success, sales, logistics/procurement/supply chain and much more. Although I was getting some hits every now and then the things I did the last two months seemed to pay off. First, I used a website named teal to change my resume. Condensed it to 1 page and made sure all bullets were measurable using things like time, money or other KPI‚Äôs. Second I made a resume that was more business facing and one that was more analyst facing. Third, I reactivated my LinkedIn premium. This allowed me to message hiring managers for the roles I applied to, I would try to apply for roles that were posted within 24 hours. Now I know a lot of people think the quick apply function is typically useless but the three job offers I got this week were all from quick applies. But probably the most important thing was consistency, atleast 3 days a week I would sit on my laptop for 6+ hours at a coffee shop and just grind, wether it was applying, tweaking my resume, networking, following up or just reading thru reddit for tips. Now I did have to suck it up and take a job that was 5 days a week in the office coming from full time remote but in all reality, is that even that bad? Now I dont think anything I just mentioned is very groundbreaking but it is what worked for me. I know many of y‚Äôall are in the same boat I was and I know it can take a toll on your mental health.

1jahxvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1jahxvz/what_if_anything_triggered_your_disease_and_what/,"What, if anything, triggered your disease and what were some of the first symptoms you noticed?","Hi, I'm new here (but perhaps an interloper) and I'm trying to wrap my mind around this disease. I'm curious to hear other peoples experience. 

I had my first (and maybe last?) endocrinologist appointment today and I'm a little frustrated.

It started last month with my family doctor/GP. I initially booked the appointment to get some scripts refilled, but she ended up running some tests when I mentioned I'd been feeling unusually fatigued lately. My blood pressure was quite high and the blood tests seemed to indicate Graves' disease. I think the latter surprised my doctor since I'm overweight and there's no indication of a goiter, so she repeated that blood test a week later in case there was a mix-up. This time the results came back even further out of the normal range so she prescribed me carbimazole (two doses of 5mg per day) and referred me to a specialist. 

In my own time I looked up the symptoms of Graves and a few things seemed to track: increased anxiety, agitation, heat intolerance, insomnia, obnoxious hunger, occasional hand tremors and palpitations. Before the blood test I had just chalked those up to anxiety or too much caffeine - things you're supposed to fix yourself, and not bother doctors with, so I never mentioned it in my GP appointments.

The endocrinologist I saw today, however, seemed to dismiss the idea that I had Graves' disease almost outright. From what I recall (this is me paraphrasing as a laymen, so interpret accordingly), his reasons included: 

* I reported no weight loss
* He didn't feel a goiter (or lump?)
* He did a test on my hands and they weren't shaking
* A family history needs to go at least two generation back (my mother had hyperthyroidism and a TT, but I didn't have information on any grandparents having it)
* I didn't initially present to my GP/family doctor with any specific complaint (the thyroid results were picked up almost by accident)
* Even though my blood test results were outside the normal range, they might actually be fine because outliers exist
* The result weren't extreme enough (he mentioned some high numbers as examples, but I forget the details)
* The seemingly worsening results between the first and second blood tests were probably natural fluctuation

Based on the way he so strongly shot down the test results and every symptom I mentioned I got the strong (possibly unfair) suspicion he couldn't see past my weight, lack of goiter or bulging eyes. The GP kinda did the same thing getting me to repeat the test. It just seemed excessive, and I walked out of there feeling like a hypochondriac. Yet, he did give me a referral for a NM thyroid scan, and I don't know what the point of that is given all the arguments he made against a case of Graves' or even hyperthyroidism in general (since he brought up the point about outliers). I looked that type of scans up and they come with risks that are only worth it if there's a good chance of diagnosing a disease. 

Anyway, I was wondering if maybe the reason I don't have the classic symptoms right now is because my GP accidentally caught the disease early, which would make the scan worth a short, or if I should stop fretting and trust the endocrinologist. They are specialists, after all.  


**So, that's why I'm asking about everyone's experience - when you first started noticing symptoms, triggers, etc. Maybe if our early symptoms line up it will be worth the risk to get that scan.**  
  
Hey, best case scenario, no hyperthyroidism at all and I'm just a dingdong who drinks too much coffee and ate too much seaweed.

I've lately been having drawdown issues at the end of my brews. I noticed it happening about 1/2-2/3 of the way through my previous bag (a light/medium-light roast from B&W), and it has persisted and worsened now on my bag of Layyoo natural light roast.

Details:

- Origami dripper with Kalita wave filters
- Using Glitch coffee's [Origami hot drip technique](https://shop.glitchcoffee.com/en/pages/brew-guide)
- 1ZPresso J-Max grinder
- On my current bag, I have tried brews at 6, 6.5, and 7 grind setting with no appreciable difference in drawdown speed or time after last pour

Basically, everything goes fine until the final pour. I'll finish the final pour around 2:05, and by 2:55ish, I'm left with a substantial amount of water left in the brewer. I've determined it's better to just throw it out rather than let the full volume draw down as it worsens the flavor once you let it ride past ~3:00. But, it's so much water left in the brewer I kind of have to ""bunch up"" the filter before pulling it out or else water will spill out when I pick up the filter out of the brewer.

Are my beans just throwing a ton of superfines I'm not seeing? Is this a common problem with the Kalita filter's flat bed? I'm currently drinking the brew done at 7 grind size, and it definitely tastes like that's the wrong grind size for this bean.

I told them put me on bar and i will learn and i did by asking as im making drinks, i watched other people make drinks. time goes by i beg and beg to be a trainer. i competed in a small coffee competition and even won! ive made a total of 3 green apron boards. tried to keep up instagrams. I have always been the employee to always notice all baristas for their strengths, hard work and all the little things. i got promoted to be a shift. i commute quite a bit but no one understands how much I love being a shift supervisor. I have been in a lead positon for about 4 years out of the 5 ive been working. I travel far because this is the store that needs my help, the store that has chosen me to be part of a team. I worked so hard to be a shift. time has gone by so fast ive created lifetime friends being with starbucks. as of recently we have this store manager and they have made it very clear they dont care nor like me and i get it. but the way that they have treated me is unfair. nothing but dismissive, unsupportive and more. ive gone to them and have said hey i want to work hard, i put 100% even more. i want to grow as a person/worker they never tells me good job, never a GENUINE thank you.

I only have 3 people on this busy day i HAVE to get the pull done. another partner who needed a half and one of my partners had to stay 12 hours so we would be able to run the floor. we finally kind of caught up but the snow started coming down really bad and when i say it was bad, it was BAD roads were covered and cars were getting stuck everywhere. i dont know what the policy for snowstorms but I think that considering I had a minor working with me, I personally think we should have closed early. we still have a pile of dishes to do, and this customer comes 10 minutes before we close complains about their drink and im going to give them a refund and im amped up because of this horrid snowstorm, were getting out a half hour later than were supposed to they call me rude and i explain that im just trying to get home soon and safe and they call me mentally ill and more. theres more but the whole situation gives me so much anxiety. im mentally ill guys lol.  I did actions that were not professional and i am in big trouble for it. my manager laughed in my face they dont care. didnt care and will continue to not care. Closers are dealt with a lot to do, other closers are never fully staffed because of starbucks' ""numbers"" but they need to understand how hard it is to the work of 3-4 people with only 2-3 people. i am taking a break from the store but i can more handle this job i just feel as my own manager sets me up for failure. ive never felt so defeated in my life. theres a part two to come out if this even gets any attention. people keep telling me its just starbucks shut up and just do the job but i want to make coffee, own my own cafe and more one days. i sound so pathetic but i truly fell in love with the job of being a barista. my manager dimmed a spark in me i never knew someone could dim.

1jahqlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jahqlg/need_help_and_advices/,Need help and advices.,"Hello! I‚Äôm a 17-year-old student from Lithuania facing some tough family issues while trying to pursue my passion for game development. I‚Äôm a polite, hardworking person with good grades and respect from my teachers, but things at home have been challenging, and I‚Äôd love some advice on planning my next steps.

About me:

Growing up, I‚Äôve always been the helpful one, assisting my parents and two brothers (we share one room). I discovered my love for computers early on and started programming in school, creating games and even working on my own game engine. I also enjoy competitive shooters but keep it to 1-3 games a day.

Family struggles:

Unfortunately, my parents often used physical punishment when I made mistakes or showed emotion, and my brothers (except one) bullied me with no intervention from my parents. They relied on me for everything‚Äîcoffee, meals, tech support‚Äîwhile my brothers did little. At 16, I realized I was being taken advantage of and started asking them to involve my brothers too. This sparked tension.

Last spring, while I was coding my game engine, my father demanded coffee. When I suggested he ask my brothers, he shut off my PC, called me insolent, and slapped me hard across the face five times. The next day, I felt dizzy and asked to go to the hospital, but they refused, dismissing my concerns.

Things worsened over the summer. They began turning off the internet at 10 p.m., even when I was working. One night, while helping a friend with a project, they cut the connection. I asked them to turn it back on, but they said, ‚ÄúKids must sleep.‚Äù When I tried to reconnect it myself, my mother pushed me, and my father hit me in the stomach multiple times. I told my school the next day, and they contacted the police. There‚Äôs now an ongoing pre-trial investigation.

My goals:

I‚Äôm searching for jobs or internships to gain experience in game development and teamwork. My computer recently broke, so I‚Äôve been coding at school and asked my IT teacher for internship leads, but no success yet. I‚Äôve contacted game dev studios, but they can‚Äôt hire me due to my age. I need money for university and to move out after turning 18 to live independently and chase my dream of making game engines and games. Any advice on navigating this would be amazing!

I was prescribed Concerta 18mg for my ADHD. My initial trial (\~10 days) was somewhat fine‚Äîmy blood pressure was slightly higher, and I had some mild heart palpitations, but it was manageable.

However, this past week has been rough. I took Concerta every day for three days at the same time (8:30 AM), and my BP was significantly higher and fluctuating. My baseline is around 110‚Äì120/70‚Äì75, but on Concerta, it increased to 130‚Äì140/80‚Äì85. It would go down for a while and then spike again.

I also experienced intense heart palpitations, different from what I previously had while taking oral minoxidil. My heart was beating like crazy, with my pulse ranging between 80 and 100, and I felt a bit anxious because of it. Yes, I had coffee in the morning (before taking Concerta), but that wasn‚Äôt an issue week before (I have a high caffeine tolerance and I metabolize it quickly). I also tried to stay hydrated.

**Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed a significant decrease in libido.** While I was more productive and energetic, the side effects on my heart, BP, and libido don‚Äôt seem worth it.

Some moments in life feel predestined, unfolding as if they were crafted long before our paths ever crossed. This sentiment perfectly captures my experience hosting Dr. Sam and his wife through [*Llivo*](https://www.llivo.com/), America‚Äôs best vacation rental agency. When they chose my home in Fort Worth, Texas, I never anticipated that our brief encounter would evolve into a profound and lasting friendship, filled with emotional moments, heartfelt stories, and genuine human connection.

They traveled from Boston not merely seeking accommodations, but something deeper‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa chance to reconnect with cherished memories and perhaps create new ones.

# Chapter 1: Strangers Who Felt Like¬†Friends

Meeting Dr. Sam and Mrs. Sam at the airport felt surprisingly familiar, more like reuniting with old friends than greeting new guests. Dr. Sam approached, leather travel bag swinging, while Mrs. Sam adjusted her scarf against the Texas breeze. Instantly, warmth and familiarity filled the air.

Driving home, my wife Liz connected effortlessly with Mrs. Sam, laughter resonating in the backseat. Meanwhile, Sam comfortably leaned back, cigar case neatly in his pocket, sharing stories about his grandkids, his daughter back in Boston, and his excitement about seeing Jack, a dear friend he hadn‚Äôt met in decades. In just thirty minutes, the boundary between host and guest dissolved completely.

# Chapter 2: A Night of Laughter, Wine, and Philosophy

At home, Liz had thoughtfully prepared an Italian-Mediterranean dinner, the enticing aromas of slow-cooked lamb, roasted peppers, and freshly baked bread greeting our arrival. Post-dinner, our conversation continued in the backyard beneath the gentle Texas sky.

Lighting his cigar effortlessly, Dr. Sam smiled thoughtfully and asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 72, and I take care of myself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut tell me, what‚Äôs the point of living longer if you don‚Äôt truly live?‚Äù

Our philosophical discussions flowed effortlessly, carrying us well into midnight, bonded by laughter and thoughtful reflections.

# Chapter 3: A Journey to Say¬†Goodbye

The next morning, over a hearty breakfast of continental omelets and steaming coffee, the joyful storytelling suddenly shifted as Dr. Sam quietly revealed, ‚ÄúJack has only a few hours left.‚Äù

Jack, his lifelong friend, was terminally ill. We immediately embarked on the two-hour drive south to Austin. The car became a vessel for their cherished memories: youthful escapades, romantic entanglements, and unforgettable shared moments.

Arriving at Jack‚Äôs home, the room was quiet but emotionally charged. Dr. Sam gently placed his hand on Jack‚Äôs shoulder and whispered, ‚ÄúHey buddy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

Though Jack couldn‚Äôt speak, his misty eyes and slight finger twitch communicated volumes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa poignant, silent goodbye between lifelong friends.

# Chapter 4: Kindness That Needs No¬†Words

On the return trip to Fort Worth, Dr. Sam insisted on paying for gas. When I questioned his gesture, he simply replied, ‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs what friends do.‚Äù

This moment crystallized how hosting on Llivo transcends commercial transactions, nurturing genuine friendships and profound human connections.

# Chapter 5: The Night of Wine and¬†Stories

Later, we joined Dr. Sam‚Äôs friend, Dr. Alex, a vibrant 78-year-old radiologist, for dinner at a Brazilian restaurant. Amidst abundant food, laughter, and endless wine, their animated storytelling illuminated a life richly lived.

Dr. Sam, raising his glass, explained, ‚ÄúDo you see why we drink, why we eat, why we tell stories?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause life is only as good as the people you share it with,‚Äù I responded.

With a knowing smile, he nodded, and we toasted to friendship and shared memories.

# Chapter 6: The Goodbye That Didn‚Äôt Feel Like¬†One

Four days after their arrival, as we drove them back to the airport, our goodbyes lingered. Warm hugs, firm handshakes, and misty-eyed farewells made it clear our connection was now familial.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll visit us in Boston,‚Äù Mrs. Sam said earnestly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre family now,‚Äù Dr. Sam affirmed.

Watching them depart, I realized Llivo had indeed created something extraordinary‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa platform dedicated to fostering authentic connections through personalized hosting, offering [*vacation rentals with airport pickup services*](https://www.llivo.com/signup).

# Final Thoughts

Llivo is more than a short-term rental agency; it‚Äôs about stories, friendships, and finding home within people, not just places. Hosting on Llivo transforms routine stays into meaningful connections, proving that some of the best friendships truly begin with a simple booking.

So, who‚Äôs your next guest?

Context: For the girls out there, I just wanna know. How do you deal with your partners na sobrang kuripot at walang provider mindset? 

My bf and I have been together for almost 8 months na and I feel like napapagod na akong intindihin yung mga actions niya towards me, lalo kapag may date kami. Don't get me wrong, hindi naman ako nagrerequest na sa mamahaling kainan or lugar niya ako dalhin. Pero nadidisappoint ako kasi pinaparamdam niya palagi sa akin na nagtitipid siya tuwing nagdidate kami. Madalas sa fast food siya mag-aya tapos gusto niya pang order palagi ay yung mix and match, para daw mas tipid. Kung hindi mix and match, gusto niya naman ay yung 1 meal order lang, pahirapan pang pilitin na umorder ng softdrinks for drinks. Hindi naman sana sasama ang loob ko kasi sobrang appreciative naman akong tao. Hindi naman ako maselan sa pagkain eh. Kaso, pansin ko na sa akin lang siya madalas ganon. Pagdating kasi sa pagbili ng mga parts sa pc niya (Gamer siya btw), sobrang galante niya. Kaya niyang gumastos ng libo-libo, pero pagdating sa akin, sobrang kuripot niya talaga. 

Gets ko naman na may nga hinuhulugan din siyang loans buwan-buwan at may binabayaran din na bills, kaso 2x a month lang kami magkita. I think kahit papaano may enough time naman na siya para magprepare financially sa date namin. Napapatanong tuloy ako sa sarili ko if hindi ba ako worth it gastusan. Fyi, madalas din akong makishare sa kanya sa gastos tuwing may date kami. Kung siya ang gagastos sa food, ako naman yung sa desserts or coffee/drinks. Ang pinagkaiba lang namin, hindi ko siya tinitipid. Lately, tinry ko na intentionally hindi makishare sa gastos namin sa date kasi gusto kong maobserve kung ano ang gagawin niya. At ayon nga, forda tipid pa rin siya, mas lumala pa. Ngayon napapaisip na ako kung worth it pa ba ipagpatuloy yung relasyon namin. Kasi kung ganito na siya ngayon palang, paano na kung nagkapamilya na kami, diba? Nakikita ko din kasing kapag nagpatuloy pa 'tong ganito, hiwalayan pa din ang ending namin. Am I petty kapag nakipagbreak ako dahil sa reason na 'yon?

Previous attempt: Kinausap ko na siya 1 time about dito. Tinanong ko pa siya kung nahihirapan siyang i-spoil ako or gastusan ako. Ang sagot naman niya ay hindi naman daw. Pero hindi naman ganoon ang nararamdaman at napapansin ko ngayon. ",4,1741887141.0,adviceph,12,1.0,False

1jahjji,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1jahjji/no_ones_allowed_to_buy_anything_for_themselves/,No one's allowed to buy anything for themselves,"Hey beans. Been thinking about loneliness and how it's hard to meet new people these days.

Aside from being sad or posting on here, does anyone have any ideas for stuff we can we do about this?

Not just as individuals to help ourselves, but like idk, is there anything we could do to make the problem slightly less bad for lots of people at once?

Dumb idea I've been thinking about recently: I kinda want to start a coffee shop or bar or something where you're not allowed to buy your own drinks.

Imagine I'm at the counter and you walk in. I say ""Hey I haven't seen you in here before, first time?"" You say yeah. I say ""Awesome, so this place is a social experiment where we're trying to make it easier to meet strangers. It's the same as any other business, with one extra rule. You're not allowed to buy anything for yourself. If you want coffee or a beer or a sandwich or a big silly hat or anything else, you have to talk to someone and work something out. Since it's your first time, I'll buy your first thing. What would you like?"" Then you decide which thing you want and I get it for you.

Yes I know this sounds dumb, hear me out.

Whenever you go to a normal coffee shop or food place, it's always full of (1) people on laptops, (2) people on phones, (3) little groups of people who came in together, all talking to the people they already know. That's like basically everywhere in society these days.

It's hard to approach anyone in those 3 categories without feeling like you might be bothering them. 

(Yes I know you CAN approach people. I've done it plenty. But that's an individual initiative thing, and it doesn't make the entire room suddenly feel like a place where the social norm is to meet new people..)

So anyways idk but I've been thinking about this a lot. 

Maybe if everyone had just a tiny extra excuse, like not being able to buy their own stuff, in one fucking single building in an entire goddamn city, then it'd be easier to say ""Anyone want another one?"" to the room, and then have some stranger say yeah, and then you buy theirs and they buy yours, and hey look tada you met someone new.

I've heard a lot of smart people give reasons why this idea wouldn't work, but I want to do it anyway.

Anyone else have any ideas? 

I mean ideas of how to make a physical place where meeting new people isn't just *possible*, but basically expected or required, due to some small externally imposed rule.

Goal is to make the smallest possible tweak to some existing type of business that changes the dynamics enough to get people talking to each other comfortably, and doesn't just lead to yet another building where everyone's on the phones or laptops or in tiny groups of people they already knew when they walked in.

It's got to be possible to make something better than what currently exists.

I don't see any business that makes even a half-assed attempt to solve this problem in an actual physical location.

Not jumping straight into fasting just building habits, ate a big hearty meal midday, fruit and coffee in the morning, protein shake and some fruit at 3pm, didn‚Äôt count anything, probably undershot what I was used to, then ate again at 9am today, about 600cal this morning and then like 1400 cal this afternoon about 3pm again and I feel AWFUL, drank about a litre of water, another 300ml with some electrolytes, had a pint of coconut water, a couple coffees. Felt awful when I got up, it‚Äôs the evening here and I still feel awful, I‚Äôll drink more before I go to bed too but I have a pounding headache. Where am I going wrong?

Titles: The Protector; The Guardian of the Celestial Troops; The High Sherpherdess; The Lady with the Shield.
Divine attributes and symbols: Shepherd Staff; The Shield.

Though her disciples sometimes catch her admiring herself in the reflection of her shield, they never make any comments. The goddess Feca is a bit of a flirt but is also quite touchy and temperamental. She is extremely distrustful towards Rushu, the sovereign demon.

It was either to fine or to coarse.

Sometimes it came nearly nothing out even with 8 bar sometimes 2 drips came out etc

The last few tries it took 55 sec for 35 gr espresso. Around 40 sec it tasted like espresso from coffee shops. To bitter.

Finally managed somehow to get 37 gr espresso in like 30-33 sec (can‚Äôt remember) but just one drip and it tasted strong (I never had this beans as it‚Äôs my first espresso) but finally no bitterness.

Hope I can repeat that tomorrow lol.
Will be happy to get the niche zero as it‚Äôs a pain to grind espresso like 10 times to find the right settings. Obviously on the zero I have to start again to find the right settings :(

I used 17 gr beans, tampered it (is a leveler worth it?) and then used 62 gr water (95 degrees c). Like I said it took round about 30 sec for 37 gr. I started slow and increased it.

Anything else what I should know?

How can I adjust while pressing if the grind is not ok? Like when I notice it takes too long to drip (like my first tries) or it comes out too fast? Can I make adjustments without throwing away the espresso?

1jah7nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExteriorDesign/comments/1jah7nx/stucco_color_recommendation_socal/,Stucco Color Recommendation - SoCal,"Hello -

I'm looking to get recommendations for my stucco before the landscaping comes in. It's currently a muted blue/gray that I absolutely hate (BM Delray Gray based on the can left in the garage by the previous owner).

https://preview.redd.it/73nhtx0mphoe1.jpg?width=2891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=751495a7c094f8d820b4544dbf2dd984b89fb1fb

**My Initial Thoughts:**

* With the light gray concrete I was thinking of going with a more bold color and actually leaning towards a green. I've seen a few homes in the area with green colored stucco that have similar brick color. So far the people I've asked, none of them know what color is on their house. But I'm open to any suggestions that work with details that I can't change - roof and concrete colors.
* I'd like to stick to Sherwin Williams paint if possible due to convenience and pricing.
* [Oyster Bay](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/green-paint-colors/sw6206-oyster-bay)¬†(SW 6206),¬†[Acacia Haze](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/green-paint-colors/sw9132-acacia-haze)¬†(SW 9132),¬†[Retreat¬†](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/green-paint-colors/sw6207-retreat)(SW 6207),¬†[Evergreen Fog](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/green-paint-colors/SW9130-evergreen-fog)¬†(SW 9130) have stood out to me after looking through the SW palette.
* My house is south-facing so LRV is an important factor, but not a deal breaker. I'd like to get enough contrast while keeping the LRV as high as possible. I'll try to address the sunlight with shading from my landscaping as much as possible which will have drought tolerant plants.

**Other Considerations:**

* I'm opening to painting/whitewashing the brick as well as the shutters, front door and garage door if that improves the styling.
* I'd like to keep the trim (fascia/soffit) white (currently Dunn Edwards Swiss Coffee Aristoshield).
* The concrete is a light charcoal color.

Thank you all for any recommendations.",1,1741886135.0,ExteriorDesign,0,1.0,False
1jah7db,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1jah7db/early_intervention_did_i_do_the_right_thing/,Early intervention - did I do the right thing?,"My daughter is 27 months. I‚Äôve been worried about her speech and behavior so I reached out to early intervention. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with high functioning autism and sensory processing disorder and did OT. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually seeing familiar behaviors or over worrying and it‚Äôs all age appropriate because she‚Äôs still so little.

Things that worry me:
When I ask her ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name‚Äù or ‚Äúhow old are you‚Äù she never responds. However if I say ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs (her name)?‚Äù when playing peekaboo she‚Äôll repeat it back. She knows a lot of words like more, milk, I find it, drop it, help you, firetruck, I miss you, so pretty, love mama/dada, where‚Äôs mama/dada, both of our dog‚Äôs names. She says ‚Äúrainy‚Äù when she feels sad. She has recently said ‚ÄúI want chicken‚Äù even though she didn‚Äôt want any. A lot of the time though she‚Äôll hand lead us around without saying anything and take us to what she wants or throw our hand toward it. She babbles and talks in toddler jargon all the time. But she understands if I ask her to do something- like throw something in the trash.

She can count to 5, sometimes to 10 almost correctly, knows some letters, can name animals, and knows almost all colors. 

She picks her eyelashes and nails.
She‚Äôs scared of many sounds - vacuums, blender, coffee maker, planes and car sounds outside the house, and more.
She gets really upset if there‚Äôs a piece of fuzz or lint on something, or if a drawer is left open, if a light is flickering it has to be turned off, she cries if her pants get slightly rolled up. She is very very picky with food. And she was never able to figure out a sippy cup - despite us trying countless different ones. We eventually went straight to open cups and had to help her drink every time, now she can drink by herself but she still struggles with sippy cups.

She‚Äôll close her eyes and walk holding her hands out, often she‚Äôll turn her head to the side and won‚Äôt look where she‚Äôs running, gives me a side eye a lot, and if she hits her head on something she‚Äôll repeat the motion. Loves to dance and is constantly moving like constantly, she is extremely active. but she is very cuddly, affectionate, clingy, gives kisses, and does ‚Äúsocial smile‚Äù.

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs too early and she just has weird toddler quirks. It‚Äôs scheduled a month from now and the services are only free until age 3, so that‚Äôs why I went ahead scheduling it. I don‚Äôt really have a reference to what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù because she‚Äôs my first child and no cousins live nearby.",1,1741886117.0,toddlers,4,1.0,False

1jah6yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1jah6yy/first_time_expedition_into_ash_canyon_trekked_in/,"First time expedition into Ash Canyon. Trekked in deep, woke up next morning, realized I forgot matches. Please help.","Took off from Mountaineer's Hut 2 days ago. I wanted to focus on traveling, not stopping to make food and water so I brought a lot of water with me. With good weather I made good progress making it deep into AC. However, this morning I wake up at a quarter thirst left, totally out of water (except one cup of coffee), and ready to make a fire to make some more. I realize I forgot to grab my fire starting materials after I dumped my inventory before leaving. I am in the cave between Runaway Bridge and the rope climb. 

Should I just drop everything non essential and run back to TWM? Or can anyone recommend a nearby place in Ash Canyon that is likely to have matches or water? Looks like Angler's Den is kinda close... ? Thanks in advance",2,1741886092.0,thelongdark,10,1.0,False

I found that super rude and disrespectful.
It got super akward and I just wanted to leave.

I told him that it was a dick move and in his eyes I overreacted.

I told him that I could speak for myself and didn't need him to put me in the spot like that. We argued back and forth, and in his eyes, he did me a favor. (Like wtf??)

He made me look like some dumb kid who can't speak for himself.

My 3 month and a half kitten is always craving human food when she realises I am eating. I usually take my food to the coffee table so I can enjoy my meal while sitting on the sofa, but this means it is very easy for her to climb up to and consistently attempt to eat my food/drink from my cup. I am saying NO to her and putting her on the floor with some occassional distracting with her toys, but it only works while I am playing with her, obviously. Also every time I am taking something out of a wrapper, she will immediately think it's for her, and I'm sure it's because she assimilates the sound with her wet food pouches.

What do you guys recommend to stop her from been so greedy? I have never given her human food or food from my plate.

These were worn very consistently from 2017-2023. I was doing forklift repair in contant winter rain in rural Washington when I started wearing these. I've worn these in various factory, warehouse, and maintenance jobs, thus the white paint stains.

The right knee was repaired 2-3 times and the left knee was just starting to get a hole when I retired them. The crotch probably got a dozen repairs or so. The tiny chest pockets had holes worn in them from carrying a pocket knife and pens so I had them stitched above the holes so I could still use them. The Oklahoma patch was hand stitched by my grandmother. The rest of the repairs were done by various tailors.

 The clasps for the straps fell off on two separate occasions, so I bribed a coworker with a bag of home roasted coffee beans to weld on half a chain link to each one. All of the buttons have picked up patina. Really sick honeycombs on the back of the knees. A year or so before I retired them I had them hemmed.

I've been in and out for years, and came to the realization that I LOVE smart recovery (even my partner loved the meeting we went to, and his issue isn't substances, it's mental health. he thought aa was ""creepy"") I am also involved in Phoenix recovery events such as yoga and trying crossfit soon since fitness is an integral piece of my well being and recovery.

I truly believe the only reason i've gotten sober was the rehab-php-sober living arrangements I chose.

I am wrapping up my last 2 weeks at a coffee commitment, and I need some advice.

Any tips on how to tell my sponsor? I haven't called all week, and we are supposed to meet saturday, so I want to tell them tonight over the phone since meeting and talking may not be an option. I do think they were a fantastic sponsor, but it's not fair to lead them on when my heart isn't in the 12 steps.

Should I tell the group on my last night of serving coffee that I'm not returning and I thank them for the support?",5,1741885411.0,recoverywithoutAA,2,1.0,False

If you struggle to get protein in, I have a few ideas that have worked for me. I personally can't stand greek yogurt so here are some ways I've been getting mine in: 

1. Protein oats. I use the vanilla soy protein from my protein because it bakes well. I use about 30g oats and 15g protein and milk of your choice. Heat it up and make sure all protein is dissolved and enjoy. Doesn't really need sweetener, but you can top it with whatever you like. 
2. Aldi/Lidl basa fillets are a great quick protein source. I don't remember macros but they're roughly 100kcal and 20g protein. Defrost, pat dry, season with whatever you like and pan fry. I usually use an Asian lahori fish recipe from Google and serve with chickpea rice and it's so good.
3. Aldi/Lidl do protein ice coffee which is great if you like your caffeine. And it's easy to customise further if you want to add almond milk or syrups or whatever you fancy
4. Box cake mix if you have a sweet tooth. Here me out, but each box is roughly 400g and I split it into 4. I then add an egg and milk and a tiny bit of oil. Then I added 25-30g of soy protein (unflavoured). Again, I use soy not whey because soy bakes well. I bake in a small tin and I come out with 8 mini slices that are doubly 60-80kcal and 5-7g protein each. ",4,1741885409.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a few patients this month with a similar scenario, and I‚Äôm curious if this is something that‚Äôs been seen frequently. What should we consider in terms of brain activity or chemical changes that could ‚Äúreverse‚Äù this kind of response? For example, someone with no mental health history drinking two energy drinks in one day, then having an ongoing panic feeling without the mental anxiety. Normal neurological and cardiac workup. Same situation in another, just with intense depression and has not taken stimulants since last summer.

I want to take a judicious approach with medications in these cases, as it seems these individuals might be particularly sensitive. I‚Äôm aiming to do as comprehensive of a work-up as possible before jumping to the conclusion that psych meds are necessary or HLOC.

* Grind -> WDT -> Tamp -> Puck screen
* 18g in, 40g out
* Grinder set at 14

I was getting a nice cup of coffee with some nice crema in around 30 seconds.

Today I got a bottomless portafilter and an IMS basket. Also, I wanted to decrease the dose to 16g. Using the same beans (Delonghi Kimbo Espresso Classic - Dark Roast - Roasted almost 2 months ago) I tried this recipe:

* Grind -> WDT -> Tamp -> Puck screen
* 16g in, 40g out
* Grinder set at 8 (I tried 14, 12, 10 and 8)

Even after going all the way from step 14 to step 8 with the grinder, I still can't get something good. It's coming out in 12 seconds, and I'm getting an extremely wet puck.

I think I need to grind finer, but do I need to go that much finer from a stock non-pressurized to an IMS basket and from 18g to 16g?",2,1741885198.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1jagrnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1jagrnf/baby_bisinexperienced_sapphics_heres_how_to/,"Baby Bis/Inexperienced Sapphics, Here's How to Successfully Date Women","Hey! I'm a 29F bi woman who's mostly dated women. I've seen a lot of newly-out or inexperienced women talk about how difficult it is to queer date, so hoping some of this is helpful.

**Dating on the Apps**

* I personally recommend having at least one app where you set it to only women - or using an app like Her, although I personally think that app is an absolute trash fire and deeply annoying to use. Straight men outnumber queer women both irl and on the apps significantly, so doing this gives you more of an outlet to match with women.
* Please, for the love of all that is good, remove anything that might insinuate a preference for men on the apps. ""I love facial hair,"" ""dad bods,"" etc. etc. There's obviously nothing wrong with also being attracted to men, but if I see that as a fellow queer woman I *will* assume you plan to only seriously date men so I'll swipe left.
* If you do have a partner, and/or are only looking for casual/exploring your sexuality, put that on your profile. Do **NOT** spring that kind of information on someone during a date. That's not transparent communication, and frankly that's not really even consensual. I had a girl tell me two hours into a date once that she had a boyfriend but ""he's okay with this."" Girl *I* wasn't!
* With straight dating, your bare-bones profile with nothing but a few cute pictures will get you matches with men. Not the case with women, generally. Highlight your personality, interests, hobbies, etc. I personally recommend that for an app like Hinge, where you get multiple prompts, you include one question for others to answer, one interesting story/detail about yourself, and if possible one thing that alludes to your sexuality (""I knew I was gay when....\*insert bi awakening here\*"").

**Meeting People IRL**

* Go to queer events. Don't just go to meet women, though. Go to become well-versed in queer culture and understand your place in it. Read up on queer history, get involved in local activist work, work on unpacking your heteronormative expectations in dating and intimacy if that's inner work you haven't done yet. Queerness is rooted in both personal and communal identity and in my opinion is one of the most meaningful aspects of queer identity.
* Sorry babes, you're gonna have to take some risks. Women are socialized to be recipients of courtship, hence the ""useless lesbians""/""I'm scared to talk to girls"" tropes that you often see around sapphic dating. Often this also comes from a fear of being creepy. My recommendation is to approach with a compliment about someone's clothing, jewelry, hair, etc. - an aspect of themselves that they chose rather than something innate to them. This opens the door to ""Thanks, this was an amazing thrift find,"" ""Oh no way, I love thrifting"" or whatever. If they just say ""thanks,"" it's okay to then ask a follow up question like: ""Where did you get that? I've been trying to find unique earrings lately"" or whatever. If she gives another short answer, that's your cue that she's not interested. If she keeps chatting with you, she's probably interested either platonically or romantically, which is something you can feel out as you keep talking. Personally, I'm also very partial to just being forward: ""Hey, I've loved talking with you and it seems like we have a lot in common. I'd love to take you out for coffee sometime if that's something you'd be open to."" Just be ready to graciously accept a rejection.
* If you're going to ask someone on a date, make it explicit that this is a date. Example: ""I'm planning on hitting up this art gallery later this weekend but I'm still looking for a date to join me. Any chance you'd be free?"" It's nerve-wracking to risk rejection but way better to do that now than to start going on 12-hour-long dates with someone just to have an even more awkward (and potentially heartbreaking) ""what are we"" conversation weeks or months later.
* Let them. If she says ""Sorry, I don't date bi girls because of \[shitty reason\],"" don't try to argue with her about how it's biphobic. Every time I have dated a biphobic lesbian, trying to convince them that I'm ""one of the good ones,"" I have come out of it worse for wear. There are also some people who just aren't going to want to be your first, and that's okay too.

Would love to hear what other thoughts and suggestions fellow queers have. It's brutal out there, remember to be kind to yourselves and others. xx",48,1741885074.0,bisexual,6,0.98,False

1jagn58,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jagn58,My indoor garden!,"This all started when my lovely gf bought me the lily on slide 1, when she was heavily hinting to me to lock her upüôÇ I did, obviously.

But now it‚Äôs become a bit of a hyperfixation, and now I‚Äôve become a plant dad!

1)  the og lily. This plant has been *thriving* on lots of water and daily misting

2) another type of lily idk what it‚Äôs called but it looked cool so I bought it. 

3) MORE LILLIES! I bought a bulb, and it‚Äôs been doing great! These have been growing really fast, after a while where I was concerned it wasn‚Äôt gonna grow.

4) my seedlings! From L to R, I‚Äôve got rosemary, then mint, then another row of rosemary, then arugula, and finally two rows of jelly bean tomatoes.

5) raspberries!

6) blackberries!

7) fig tree! It just sprouted a new baby leaf and I‚Äôm so happy lol! This guy seems to be a slow grower I‚Äôm gonna get impatient with him I bet.

8) red tiger amaryllis! This one is doing so well and it‚Äôs about to bloom. About a week ago it spawned a second stem, and I‚Äôm so hyped!

9) white birds of paradise! I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna mess this one up I really want it to do well. It seems to be doing okay, but some of the leaves are splitting and I‚Äôve been misting regularly trying to avoid that. Bought some specialized palm mix and put rocks in the bottom for improved drainage, and put the humidifier right next to him. Hoping for the best here.

10) my gf had a money tree, and it was in much too small of a pot. It was drooping hard. But now with more light and a better pot, it‚Äôs been perking up! Even growing some new shoots!

11) BLUBS! This first guy is flowering like crazy, and has just started to leaf out. 

12) MORE BLUBS! This one is the pink lemonade variety. It‚Äôs growing a boat load of leaves right now after I saved it from Home Depot. It looked a little sad when I bought it but it now looks great and with a load of leaf growth. In a month he‚Äôs gonna be really green I bet. It seemed to start leafing a bit after I sprinkled some coffee grounds and fertilizer for it.

13) my grapes! My concord vine is not growing very fast at all, after an initial period of very quick growth. Little concerned for it. But my Suffolk vine is still goin nuts and has grown 2 feet since I got it when it was just a brown twig. There‚Äôs even some grapes it‚Äôs trying to grow!

1jagmxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1jagmxe/spending_habits_are_drowning_me/,Spending habits are drowning me,"I‚Äôve recently moved to a big city that‚Äôs near my job. Although I‚Äôm saving around ¬£50 a week (hybrid worker) in train fares, my rent is double what it was. Whilst I can afford this and plus standard utility bills and my car comes in at 50% of my wage, I know I need to spend less. 

There are obvious things I can do, take lunch to work, stop buying take away coffees etc, I don‚Äôt pay for streaming services etc they‚Äôre all fine and I know what can be optimised there. But a huge portion of my monthly outgoings is health stuff and I don‚Äôt know what to do or chop.

I spend ¬£100 a month on supplements that were monumental in my recovery from a debilitating illness and agoraphobia. I spend around ¬£200 a month on mounjaro (weight loss jab, which, for my health I cannot afford to stop as I have lost 50lbs so far with way more to go), I also now have to take collagen and bone supplements due to the weight loss, gym which is ¬£50 a month (cheapest in my area) and locked into a contract, I‚Äôve suffered from horrific skin conditions most of my life and pay around ¬£60 for topical treatments to keep that under control, around ¬£30 a month on hair loss treatments due to side effects of prescription medication (as well as ¬£10 a month for said medication). 

I‚Äôm not sure what else to do. And at some point I‚Äôd like to go out and have a life too. My job have made it clear there‚Äôs no pay rise available and I don‚Äôt want to leave. I‚Äôm trying to upskill and look for more money elsewhere as I can‚Äôt afford to keep this all up. ",0,1741884740.0,UKPersonalFinance,21,0.31,False
1jagmgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1jagmgl/yeast_infection_saga_ongoing/,"Yeast infection saga, ongoing.","I am postmenopausal, live by myself, have not had sex for over 20 years or so, and I think this yeast infection began from my stupidly continuing to drink peppermint tea made by putting water and tea bags in a glass jar and putting in the refrigerator... Who would have thought?  There kept being little white growths on the inside of jar, that would come back after I scrubbed the jar, and I did not think it mattered.  But it did!
I think this is how the bad itching on my vulva (outside only thank you God) started.  It has gone on for maybe over a year or more already, with very painful experiences, frantic scratching and sleepless nights.   Lotrimin cream stings, and did not clear it up.   Sometimes I have had to put on A and D diaper rash ointment to help me get to sleep.  Lately it has helped a lot to apply coconut oil, but coconut oil with a drop or two of tea tree oil but that really stings. 
I have been taking the probiotics available at the grocery store, eating lots of raw garlic, and plain yogurt with chunks of coconut oil.  Right now I have some yogurt in a coffee filter lining a strainer so I can put some on later as a salve.  Putting coconut oil on my 'lady parts' sometimes will sting a little but then settles down if I can wait without scratching.  For some reason it feels really good to spray the area with really hot water!  I don't know if this is good or not.  I use a blow dryer to dry off down there.  Just recently I started drinking glasses of water with 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  Adding the ACV and the raw garlic several times a day has helped a lot, but still not completely cleared.  I have also read that taking oil of oregano can help, so I am waiting for that to arrive to try that too.
Other information, I was a vegan (until the yogurt) and my skin has really improved, less dry, and softer, thanks to the yogurt and coconut oil.  
FWIW it helps me so much to know I am not alone in this, it can get discouraging, and I am grateful to come here to learn from your experiences.  Replies gratefully received.

Metaphorically speaking. I realize this is an immorally long post and for that I apologize, but it's Thursday and I haven't had an episode for too long.

Here's what we know for sure:

1. Gemma and Mark tried for a baby but it didn't work out, and they were starting to consider adoption
2. Lumon was present at the fertility clinic that Gemma and Mark went to
3. Things were getting tense at the end, but not relationship-breaking, before Gemma disappeared
4. Gemma ended up with her outie on the testing floor, and expects to be able to see Mark again
5. Mark became severed shortly after Gemma's accident, and was already aware of Lumon
6. The MDR department has been mostly men, but there have been at least three women: Carol, Helly, and Gwendolyn
7. Severance has been doing work with ""birthing severance""
8. Carol left with a scheduled retirement, and was part of the reason why Petey started getting suspicious
9. Petey has found a lot of hidden corners of the severed floor
10. Petey is divorced, and seemingly fairly recently since he talked about how he couldn't go back home, and was desperate to reintegrate
11. Just before Helly joined the severed floor, there was a controversy over a severed employee getting pregnant while severed

So a few things I have conjectured or that other Redditors have mentioned:

1. As Gemma and Mark were having their falling out, it was Mark who was really pushing to have a child, and Gemma was resistant
2. Gemma was signing up for Lumon and was cagey in telling Mark what she was doing, suggesting it was something like an art school application
3. Lumon prides itself on all of its employees being voluntary and can leave at any time, which is a major point they use frequently to justify their conduct
4. Gemma was only Ms. Casey for 107 hours, the equivalent of about 13 days of work, and it appears that all of that was during a brief hiatus from the testing floor
5. Gemma and innie Helly share several similar qualities, including a selfless streak for Mark while still looking out for themselves
6. Helly's decision to have sex with Mark as an innie was somewhat surprising and irrational
7. Helena's decision to have sex with Mark as an outie was very calculated, and seemingly Lumon created the perfect scenario for it to happen, even putting Milkshake farther down the hill where he wouldn't notice - but Milkshake knew immediately that it had happened and didn't punish anyone
8. For that matter, Lumon didn't really interfere with Helly and Mark's budding romance
9. The important and mysterious work MDR is doing involves sorting numbers into buckets, based on how the numbers make the refiner feel. Each bucket appears to require even portions of the four tempers, but Mark says that one bucket is for scary numbers, one is for happy, etc.
10. Once MDR finishes a project it becomes a room on the testing floor, where a tester goes through seemingly stressful scenarios to see if they remember anything
11. It sure seems like Irving was a tester at some point, and the severance wasn't fully successful, basically to the point of making his outie neurotic about the whole thing
12. Burt makes much ado to Irving about Fields saying Burt joined 20 years ago, when the severed floor had only existed for 12, and at his retirement party he said he had been in O&D for 7
13. It is yet-unexplained why, after Irving freaked out as an innie at Burt's door, *Burt* started stalking *Irving*
14. Devon has always been supportive of Mark's severance procedure, and made the controversial call to Cobel to assist Mark's reintegration
15. Devon and Gemma were very close
16. Ricken is a self-absorbed idiot
17. It is implied, truly or falsely, that once Cold Harbor is done, Gemma will be freed and back with Mark

I think a lot of theories seem to be limited to one or two facts, but the showrunners have emphasized that they know how it ends and everything is important. I think a more holistic approach is required. So my theory is: Lumon has gone too far in its severance testing, to the point where they are struggling to find testers.

Early testing didn't work all the way, including a failed run where Burt and Irving were involved. We know Lumon has a discipline problem, as both Cobel and Milkshake have gone on ""pet projects"" and Lumon doesn't find out for quite a while. I think Burt was an unsevered testing monitor, or something spending a lot of time watching Irving, and developed an infatuation with Irving, which he had at one point confessed to Fields. When Irving went to the testing floor, Burt voluntarily severed with the hope that his innie would find Irving again. We know Irving's severance was not entirely successful and the former connection hit quickly when they crossed paths again. Outie Burt had been infatuated with innie Irving for 20 years, thus his trying to get together with outie Irving.

All this is to say that Lumon's past failures have been catching up with them. I think MDR and O&D were created later (about three years ago) to add a ""double-blind"" process, where multiple departments work on different components of testing. The monitors are just doing cold analysis, MDR is processing the information in a heavily encrypted format, and it is applied to the testing floor. Many people have commented that the monitors resemble their MDR counterparts - I think it's the opposite, that the refiners are picked to resemble their monitors, which is why the new crew so closely matched Irving, Helly, and Dylan in character. I think there are also four testers - Gemma is Mark's counterpart and there are three others that we haven't seen. The monitors no longer monitor the testers, they monitor the refiners and watch them as they process the testing information. When Burt signed up to become an innie, he was put in a separate department that wouldn't be a part of the active processing, on the opposite side of the floor from Irving. When they met, Milkshake (uncharacteristically for Lumon) made several efforts to stop them from crossing paths, ultimately letting outie Burt know that his innie had found Irving again so Burt would have to retire.

I *don't* think Cold Harbor is connected to Gemma, I think that's too obvious and boring. But I think Lumon knew it was within a few years of getting to Cold Harbor, and they were too close to give up, and were getting desperate.

So here's where I am going to get the comments (if anyone has even read this far) that I'm a crazy idiot but this really does make all the pieces fit. I think Gemma was terrified that she was losing Mark and wanted desperately for him to be happy again, as the inability to have a baby was causing him to fall apart. Gemma made a deal with Lumon to give Mark what he seemingly so desperately wanted: a baby. The deal was that Gemma, who was a model candidate to be a tester, would agree to go to the testing floor, and in exchange, Lumon would orchestrate a scenario in which Mark would get severed and, while severed, get another severed employee pregnant, who would become a surrogate mother. At the same time, using Mark and Gemma, given their close personal bond, as refiner and tester would allow Lumon to run some tests/experiments that they wouldn't be able to otherwise.

I think Lumon would only justify this if the outie woman was informed before it happened and the innie counterpart did it voluntarily. Gemma agreed because Mark would not remember it happening, and it wouldn't be ""cheating"" because he doesn't know Gemma exists. Milkshake was very skeptical of Cobel for putting Mark and Gemma in proximity - because part of the agreement with Gemma was that Mark would not know about her, and (according to my theory) love has transcended severance at least once with Burt and Irving, thus the conversation between Cobel and Milkshake reassuring a disappointed Cobel that it's a good thing Mark doesn't remember her.

So, Carol consented to being put on the severed floor, *and* to getting pregnant, as part of Lumon's deal with Gemma. Mark didn't take a liking to her, but innie Petey did, and got her pregnant. He was able to do so without Lumon's knowledge, because Cobel was hyper-focused on Mark (too much so). Once Petey reintegrated, he realized he had a romance on the severed floor and admitted it to his wife, resulting in his divorce and June's attitude towards Lumon and severed employees, and why June's conversation with Mark at the concert was important enough to show on screen, because June herself was trying to suss out how ""severed"" severed employees really are.

So Carol was voluntarily retired, and it got leaked that a severed employee had gotten pregnant, right around the same time that Helena volunteered to undergo the procedure, under a ""if you want the job done right you have to do it yourself"" philosophy. I have no doubt at all that Helena would be a surrogate for the sake of Lumon. Also, as an Eagan, Helena might have been able to undergo an experimental new severance where they could use their discoveries so far to implant the idea in her innie that she really wants to have Mark's baby, maybe even implant some personality into Helly that they knew Mark would be attracted to, and put innie Mark in the role of being the first person she meets and supervising her.

That largely backfired because Helly was so severely opposed to being an innie that she rejected Mark as part of the severed floor and tried to kill Helena, so Helena backed out. They tried a third time to bring in a surrogate with Gwendolyn, who certainly had the personality and an immediate interest in Mark, but Mark showed complete disinterest and wanted the old crew back.

All hope seemed lost, except that Helena saw the video that Mark and Helly had, in fact, developed a romance on the severed floor. Helena wasn't jealous - she was happy that their plan was working better than they thought. So they convinced Mark to come back, and then had Helena go down as herself to force the issue of having sex with Mark, which Lumon helps set up. Irving calls out Helena's infiltration, but a little too late - they put Helly back on the floor, not to have Mark's baby but so that he would finish Cold Harbor, but she still has the idea implanted that she should be having sex with Mark so she has sex with him as well, which Lumon allows to happen.

So I've probably already lost everyone (if not for the theory then for the wall of text), but the last thing that this explains for me: Gemma and Devon are very close and Devon was very much in favor of them having a baby. Which might explain why Devon, after everything that had happened, still called Cobel, because *Devon could be in on the original plan*. Gemma might have needed to talk to her to get her help to make sure Mark plays along without knowing that the goal was to get Mark to, essentially, cheat on Gemma. Devon would have easily been able to do this under Ricken and Mark's noses, because Ricken is too self-absorbed to care what happens to Mark, and Mark was an alcoholic. Devon has shown a willingness to do what she thinks is best for Mark even if Mark doesn't really agree, and she never got to the conversation about Mark thinking of quitting, so we don't know if she would have pushed back.

So Devon calls Cobel not for Mark, but for Gemma, and she immediately talks to Cobel in a very ""Lumon insider"" way with surprisingly little resentment. She didn't know Cobel was an insider at first, but after the ""uprising"" at the end of season 1, she might have been able to get some answers from Lumon, as she essentially thought she was the one manipulating things for Lumon from the outside. Admittedly, this creates two problems for me: first, I don't think Devon would be willing/able to deceive Mark like that, and certainly outie Mark is not in on this conspiracy theory. Second, Devon would not have been quite as confused about the severed birthing cabins - maybe her confusion would arise from ""why didn't they just do that instead of this whole three-year gambit,"" but even then, she wouldn't have shared it with Ms. Selvig, as she didn't know at the time that Ms. Selvig was a Lumon spy. But that's what I've got so far.",3,1741884378.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,6,0.67,False

On Jan 7 we met with an internist who took a detailed history. He felt that she seemed incredibly healthy for her age in every visible way and that the bloodwork below did not overly concern him. Since she hadn't had another episode between Dec 24 and Jan 7, his advice was to just leave her be and bring her back through ER if she has another episode. He did mention doing a test, I believe on the liver, something where they'd have to give her something, do a test, keep her at the hospital all day, and then redo the test. I'm just realizing I never got a copy of his notes, but I can ask for them. When I asked if he'd do it to his cat, he said no. The consult was $260 so I am getting in deep.

The thing is, I think she's getting wobbly again. But not a severe acute episode. She just seems generally like her balance and coordination are off sometimes. No big falls but I definitely see her wobble a tiny bit daily. The other thing I've noticed is she is drinking more water than usual. Otherwise she seems happy and normal.

Is it worth returning to the specialist? I don't know if I'm just going to be sent home again with a wobbly cat. 

ORIGINAL POST FROM JAN 2025:

Cat with 15+ hr ataxia & vasovagal concern? 

Hello! 

To start, I do have an appointment with an internist on Jan 7. However, I'm really at a loss and can't find anything online about a cat experiencing ataxia related to pre-syncope or vasovagal reaction for 15+ hours. She has a hx of syncope 5 yrs ago. I apologize for the long post but am including relevant hx and diagnostic findings from her ER visit. 

Cat is 13yo spayed female. In October this yr she had a full geriatric exam including blood & urine and the vet said she was ""healthy as a 5yo"" and ""wouldn't know she was 13"" if I hadn't told him so. 

Dec 24 I came home at 7 at night. I noticed she was being clumsy, fell off the couch, then the coffee table.. she shook her head and fell while walking. Then threw up a small hairball and after that was very wobbly. She started stumbling. I took her to the ER at 10 where they ran all the tests. 

Note of hx: her movements reminded me of 5 yrs ago when she had 3 syncope events over the course of 3 months-ish. One occurred after she was in the litter box, one after throwing up, and one during a urine draw. At the first event she went to ER where they didn't find anything about the syncope but did find severe cystitis. We treated that over the following few months until everything was normal. Neither condition has recurred since then. 

At ER to my knowledge they couldn't recreate her stumbling but said that's not unusual. Shr was neurologically normal.Bloodwork showed mild metabolis acidosis, mild elevated cholesterol, and elevated sodium and chloride, normal pancreatic enzymes. Urine was normal. Ultrasound showed bilobed gall bladder which he said was normal, and mild irritation around the stomach but no issues with bladder etc. Chest xrays normal. Given her hx he feels this is likely vasovagal related, even though she never actually fainted (to my knowledge) and last time, she always was fine before the syncope and then fine 10 minutes after.

He initially said she should have a cardiology consult, or a neuro, or internal medicine, then seemed to decide on cardiology, but THEN said he knew the internist at the same specialty vet as a Cardiologist and thinks he's the smartest vet he's ever met, so to basically go through him first. I have an appointment Jan 7. 

When I got her home she was still extremely uncoordinated. She promptly fell off the table and if she hadn't landed in some boxes she could have hurt herself. The next morning around 10am, she was still stumbling but seemed slightly better. It slowly improved throughout the day. Aside from  maybe being a little lethargic, she seems fine now. 

Now here's my questions. I am not asking for a diagnosis. 

In her previous episodes she did not have ataxia before or for very long after the syncope. I cannot find anything online about prolonged ataxia related to vasovagal issues... is this something that happens? 

Let's say that this type of thing does happen, is there even treatment of any kind for a vasovagal response causing prolonged ataxia? 

If this is a vasovagal reaction, can this type of thing be fatal? 

I don't want to put my senior cat through a million tests just to find out ""oh well she's got this syncope problem, nbd, nothing we can do about it"". The specialist consults are very expensive and not covered by my insurance, so going in educated and able to advocate for her is important to me. 

Anyway if anyone read this far I really appreciate it and really appreciate any insight at all into this.

Work has been SO hard for me lately. I'm struggling to even think straight at work so I'm curious to see how other people would handle this.

Another NP at my job left suddenly in December and since the New Year I've been getting all her patients. She had an absolute train wreck of a caseload and this lining up with my current state has been really difficult. One in particular is so extremely needy, she is driving me nuts. I think she is Borderline and constantly wants to see me. Half the time it feels like she just wants to talk to me. I will schedule her for two weeks out and then find out she called the office and moved her appt to the next week. It's been like this since I've met her. I saw her last week and I told her I wanted her to go into an IOP, she was hysterical about it so I agreed to keep seeing. So we made a plan and I explained med instructions, etc. My schedule since this other NP left has been so so booked, I'm seeing patients from the second I get in until I leave. Yesterday I get an e-mail from her therapist (also at my practice) asking if I had time today or tomorrow to chat about this pt. I tell her I'm fully booked both days but I can call her on my drive home later. 2 minutes later my front desk girl comes in and tells me the therapist is on the phone for me, with the patient, and that the patient wants to have ""an emergency meeting"". I had ended early with a patient and had 10 minutes free so I picked up. We go over her medication instructions that I clearly explained at our last appt. After that's done (I now have one minute left until my next appt) she goes ""I want to talk about the antipsychotic section of my Genesight results."" I told her no, I'm fully booked today, we need to talk about this at our next appt. She hangs up the phone.

My biggest gripe with all this is that the therapist thought this was okay to do. I feel like e-mailing her and telling her this patient needs clear boundaries and that it's not appropriate to call me for ""an emergency meeting"" (this is an outpatient office). I can't imagine a world where I could call this therapist on a day she's fully booked and expect her to talk to one of our mutual patients.

It‚Äôs not some quirky saying, it‚Äôs the rule. You learn fast that the things you think you see are better left buried deep in the back of your mind. Because when you start asking questions about those things, bad things happen. Real bad.

I‚Äôve been a ranger for almost five years now, and I'd like to say that I have a handle on things. The forest is peaceful, a place to lose yourself, to think. Sure, there‚Äôs the occasional weird noise in the distance, the rustling of leaves in the dead of night when there's no wind, the flicker of movement out of the corner of your eye. But that‚Äôs just nature, right?

Well, two weeks into my job, I found out firsthand why we have that rule.

I was doing my regular rounds, checking the perimeter, making sure the trail markers were still intact, and that the cabins were locked up tight. The usual stuff. There‚Äôs a trail about five miles into the woods that people like to hike, a perfect place for a little solitude and quite picturesque. It‚Äôs calm out there, quiet. You don‚Äôt expect anything to happen in a place like that.

But that day, something felt off. The trees felt taller, the air heavier. It was a late afternoon, and while the sun should‚Äôve been setting soon, it felt like it was setting faster than usual. I shook it off, focused on the job. As I was picking up an empty bag of chips from the trail the wind picked up, making the trees sway and creak. But then... something caught my eye. Just off the path, I saw movement. A figure. It wasn‚Äôt a person, but it also didn't look like any animal I've seen. A silhouette, shifting behind the trees, far enough that I couldn‚Äôt make out details but close enough that I knew it was there. 

My heart skipped a beat, but I forced myself to think it was just some lost hiker, maybe an animal moving in the underbrush. I called out, but the forest swallowed my voice, the wind carrying it away. I stepped off the path and approached the area where I thought I‚Äôd seen it, but when I reached the spot, there was nothing. Just woods, silent and empty. I searched for a few seconds but found no footprints, no signs of anyone or anything being there just a few moments ago.

I started walking back toward the trail, and then I heard it. Footsteps behind me, light, as if someone was following just a few paces behind. My pulse quickened. I turned to see who, or what, it was. Nothing. I‚Äôm not an idiot. I knew better than to ignore it, so I quickened my pace. I tried to convince myself it was the wind, a trick of the mind, but the footsteps didn‚Äôt stop. They stayed right there, shadowing mine, perfectly in sync. And then it stopped. The sudden silence, minus the crunch of my boots on the trail, made the whole situation even more terrifying.

I paused for a moment, too scared of what may happen if I turned around now. So many choices ran through my head until I decided on one. Well, I wouldn't say I decided, more like my body chose for me. A surge of adrenaline pushed me to start speed walking back to the ranger station; something in me screaming that if I started running, I'd be dead. My heart pounded as if I was in a marathon, with each stride goosebumps formed. The crisp wind moving my hair to my face and carried the scent of vanilla through the air. The smell reminding me that any animal could find where I am, especially the thing following.

I reached the station and locked the door. After a few minutes of nothing, I sat behind the desk, chuckling at myself for getting all worked up, and for believing the other rangers' stories. A couple of them even went as far as to claim they saw stuff. At first, I thought they were just trying to mess with the new guy and get him all scared before the first watch. In that moment of giggling at their stories, I realized one of them is lining up exactly like what happened outside. The following footsteps, the feeling of being stared down, the shadow. Even the time of year is exactly when they said it happened. Trying to clear my mind from that, I decided to examine the trail cam footage on the old monitor. It was the most peaceful part of the job, just stare at the footage and take notes of the animals. A bit too peaceful given the fact I fell asleep in front of the screen for a little.

A loud noise jolted me out of my sleep, causing me to fall out of the chair. I picked myself off the floor and walked over to the window to investigate. Flipping on the floodlights outside the cabin, I see a large branch lying just in front of the porch. At first, I brushed it off, it's a forest and branches break all the time, only to immediately remember the fact the station is in the middle of a small clearing. The only way a branch that size would end up here is during a hurricane, and it most certainly was not raining. A multitude of reasons raced through my head, anything that could rationally explain how this hunk of wood got there. I walked away from the window over to the coffee bar, landing on the reason being a giant gust of wind flinging the branch to its spot. Taking a sip of my coffee and quietly humming to myself, I situate myself back into the semi-comfortable computer chair. A few more reports later and I'm back to watching the cameras and naming new faces. A sow, Moon, gave birth earlier in the year and the rangers fell in love with the two cubs due to their fur making it look like Light has eyebrows and Shine has a little mustache. So, one of my duties tonight is to try and spot them and update their information. 

After 3 hours I almost gave up hope, but then I saw movement around the cave Moon had chosen as her home for four years in a row. But it wasn't her. It looked almost like a deer, only the deer was trying to act human. Standing on its two hind legs and with a hunched back, it walked around the flattened area. Its eyes glowing bring in the night vision lens every time it looks in the direction of the camera. Then it paused. Sniffed in the air and looked straight at the camera. I jumped back, shocked at the accurate eye contact made through the screen. I readjusted my chair and continued to watch whatever this thing was, writing down every detail I could get while it was still visible.  The creature started walking towards the tree that the camera was perched on, its steps slow and deliberate. Once it reached the trunk the thing raised its hands the the bark and started shoving. Each push causes the tree, and therefore the camera, to shake immensely.

I stood up and pushed the chair back, the fear truly setting in. Quickly grabbing the walkie on my belt, I call into the closest station near me. Surely someone else is seeing this. The only problem was all the channels I tried were off, or at least that's what I assumed. At the time it didn't make sense. When the 5th station was also static I gave up that plan. I looked back at the screen and see the creature's shoving had only gotten more aggressive. By the looks of it the poplar was rocking back and forth at this point. Then just in the distance the loud sounds of groaning, cracking, and popping cut through the air. Moments later a loud crash followed and the camera was no longer in signal. With no other plan in mind, I scribble the events unfolding into the notebook. Semi-worried no one would believe me, semi-worried this will be the pages that the police would find for evidence.

The chaos didn't stop there. Not even ten minutes later another trail cam, the one filming the trail I checked earlier, showed movement. This activity was different though. The dark shape moving quickly, too quickly, back and forth in front of the camera. As if it was playing with it. I continued my notes until I glanced up and saw it staring right at me again. It's face closer than before. Close enough that I could truly see what creature was out there. It wasn't a deer, not completely anyway. It's head was shaped like a German shepherd's and eyes sat too close at the front of its face, once again glowing in the night vision. The sight of this thing making me scream. I slap my hands over my mouth and stare at the computer screen. The creature was now looking in the direction of the cabin. 

My eyes clench shut as a few tears run down my face. The fear taking complete hold of me. Quiet sobs left my mouth as I checked the camera once again.

It's gone.

You'd expect my reaction to be relief. It was not. To the depth of my core I knew it wasn't really gone. All I could think was, 

""It's coming here. It's coming for me.""

I started rummaging through the drawers of the desk, wincing at every squeak of the steel as they open. In the left bottom drawer I found an spiral notebook with no cover page, the first thing written talking about specific animals to avoid due to temperament, I almost tossed it aside but the loose cover page at the bottom of the drawer caught my eye.

'In Case of ALL Emergencies'

At this point anything could help, plus this should count as one of the emergencies...right? Thank God for whoever was looking out for me because the 2nd page in the notebook I learned there is a specific flare gun behind the antique picture of the forrest. I run over to the wall and take down the picture, setting it on the mantel of the fireplace. And just like the notebook said, a small recessed shelf hidden behind the picture held a red flare gun with three rounds sitting next to it. Realizing I neglected to read what to do with the flare, I hurry over to the book again and see at the bottom in red,

""In the case of Unique Emergencies: fire three shots into the sky.""

The sound of leaves crunching loudly catches my attention and breath. I stand there, paralyzed in terror, unsure of what to do. I can't go outside. I can't fire it in here. If I open a window to fire it will definitely get to me before I could shoot the second let alone the third. The lack of options getting to my head, I began to pace back and forth. Then the steps outside stilled, replacing the sound with jagged breathing. Through the monitor I can see the creature was standing in the middle of the small gravel parking lot, staring at the station with its head tilting ever so slightly. 

I run into the back office, flare gun and cartridges in hand, and lock the doorknob and the two deadbolt locks. I always thought these were for bear attacks. But it seems situations like these have happened before. Looking around the tattered office, I hoped to find anything that could help me. I noticed that the light hadn't been turned on and look up to see a skylight with a small black handle. I grab the step ladder and reach for the handle to see which way it opens. Twisting it slowly, I gently push up and it doesn't budge. The bookcase in the office was at the perfect height and spot to sit with your foot on the step stool for balance, so I did just that. I pushed a little harder but it still didn't budge, on a whim a tried pulling it open and it worked! 

Pulling the cartridges out of my pocket, I open the window just enough to aim the flares at the sky. I load the first one and aim it at the moon.

One down.

With the other two in my hand I quickly reload another cartridge and squeeze the trigger.

Two. One more to go.

The sound of a loud stomp from the roof almost caused me to drop the last round. I quickly caught it a shoved the round into the flare gun, the sound of heavy footsteps nearing me raising my adrenaline and causing me to shake. I aim at the moon again and pull. 

Last one,  help is coming.

I slam the window shut and twist the handle to lock just as the creature jumped into view. It stared at me through the glass, it's eyes wide enough to see the whites. The thing open it's mouth into to what I can only assume was a smile, revealing unnaturally sharp teeth, opened its mouth and let out a scream I would describe as a shrieking whistle. I cower and end up falling off the bookshelf, my landing cushioned by the scattered reports and other papers. Groaning, pull myself into the fetal position and wait for one of two things.

1. Help comes and somehow rescues me
2. This thing makes me it's next meal

The sound of hooves slamming on the glass had me leaning toward the latter being more realistic. I rock myself,  each slam of its hooves making me wince. It didn't take long for the sound of the glass starting to crack to fill the air. I hold my breath, unprepared for what horror lay in store.

Then I heard it. The sound of multiple vehicles from all around the cabin swiftly pulling up and the stomping stopped. Sounds of car doors slamming and three gun shots rang in the air. I looked up at the skylight and the creature was gone. The rangers from the other station banged on the front doors, it took me a minute to compose myself then I let the in. Immediately they asked me what happened, I told them everything that happened as best I could and showed them my notebook for my details. I asked what that thing was and they said it's best if I don't ask things I don't want to know. 

""Next time, ignore it."" A ranger chuckled out and playfully threw his arms on my shoulders, ""remember the golden rule, if you think you see something,  no you didn't. "" 

I live by those words and have kept out of trouble, for the most part, these past years. So, if you're reading this, consider it as an example of why we have this rule...and good luck.",11,1741883829.0,scarystories,2,0.92,False

1jag7ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1jag7ci/ex_coworker_from_hell_and_her_poor_future_child/,Ex Coworker From Hell and Her Poor Future Child,"Hi everyone! I just need to share this with Reddit because, wtf. 

To start from the beginning, I had a coworker whom we'll call Mary. Mary was one of those individuals who would ""never"" hurt a fly because she's just so nice and soft-spoken. Because of this, plus her ""health"" issues (she never drank water and had MULTIPLE Monsters a day, plus extra coffee, AND was prediabetic but refused to change her diet, but I digress) people gave her the princess treatment when she first started working, which cool, okay, you just started working that's fine. But after two months of her jacking off and not working, my coworkers fucking despised her. Now, at this time, I didn't see the point in putting in any energy towards hating her, plus she was the only other woman I worked with, so it was nice to have another woman around, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt (I should've listened to my coworkers from the get-go). 

This isn't even when shit gets started though, it all started when she decided to change her schedule herself to come in early in the morning when there are NO DISHES TO WASH. This ends up pissing the chef's off because like wtf are you doing. On top of that, she ended up completely reorganizing EVERYTHING without asking anyone, and it became a war of organization between Mary and the rest of my coworkers. This prompted Mary to go to our new manager and claim that we were bullying her. This caused a whole meeting to occur, where the manager threatened to write all of us up for bullying and defended the fact that Mary changed her scheduled time (this manager ended up fired two months after this). I kept my cool during that meeting, but my anger was slowly bubbling over. 

So, one day, she does nothing all day while I work my ass off and she dares to ask me to do something that a) doesn't need to be done, and b) would take 20 minutes of my time. I looked at her and politely told her, ""No, it doesn't need to be done."" She gives me a look in response, so I say, ""We've had these pans since eight in the morning; these are more important than something that doesn't need to be done."" She laughs and says, ""Who cares? Leave it for D and A (the closing shift)."" And that's when I lost my politeness, because I am not the kind of opener who 'leaves it for the closers' (I know how closing feels with shitty openers), so I gave her some tone. She hopped off my dick and went to go do the thing herself, but the rest of the shift she was slamming shit around, which caused her to drop multiple ceramic plates. So, she had to whip out the hose to clean up the mess she created, and instead of asking me to move out of the way (I low-key think she did this purposefully), she sprayed my whole feet from ankle down. My feet were soaked the whole day, and my poor skin hated me. I did not report her to the manager for this because I knew the manager would defend her and accuse me of bullying, so I kept my mouth shut. 

But this isn't the end of this 31-year-old woman's tantrums. So, our hospital ended up changing chemical companies, and for some context, she's had this one-sided beef with my 71-year-old Jamaican coworker (D) about the chemicals. D used to work as a janitor in a chemical lab, so he's very strict about what chemicals should be used on which dishes. So when Mary first started working there, D told her, ""we don't use this chemical on ceramic plates,"" and it said so on the directions as well. Apparently, she didn't want to listen to D or the directions, so when we switched chemical companies, I remember her flexing to me, ""Now D can't yell at me for using chemicals on the plates."" (put a pin in this). So, we get the new chemicals, and all is well, right? 

Wrong. I go back into the chemical closet to see the old chemicals unfinished,¬†just sitting in the closet, so I go to switch out the new chemicals for the old ones because that's just wasteful, and I'm not about that. So she tells the manager, and then I bring up to the manager that the chemicals she's using on metal utensils and ceramic plates is straight bleach, which, if not watered down properly, is going to corrode those utensils, so the manager agrees to finish the old chemicals and properly show Mary how to water down the bleach. But it doesn't end here. 

So, some time has gone by since the wasteful chemical incident. Mary had gallbladder surgery (I watched her pour at least a pound of cheese on her nachos after her surgery, which is hilarious) and is now back working. She came back with an even worse omnipotent attitude. So, about a week goes by of her getting princess treatment and thinking she knows everything, and I lose my goddamn fucking shit. 

It started like this. Mary says, ""D is an asshole."" I respond (probably with a lot of tone, to be fair), ""D isn't an asshole, maybe you've done something to him that's passive aggressive?"" this is when she plays the whole ""I'm so nice I would never hurt a fly"" card, so this is what I say, ""But you switched to the new chemicals when we still had the old ones left over, and you told me when you switched them that now D can't yell at you. If I were D, I would take that personally and it comes off as passive aggressive."" So, the merry goes around, and we have the same argument for another minute, until she shoves me aside, unscrews the 100% bleach, lifts it above her head standing about a foot away from me, and dumps it. She ended up snitching on me and leaving work while I stayed behind to take pictures of the damage the bleach did and craft a message to HR (I should've called the cops, but little 19-year-old me was too scared). Thankfully, I did get lucky that the manager who accused everyone of bullying Mary was not on duty, so the fill-in manager just came back there and said, ""That's not cool"" because Mary told her that I said, ""D hates you."" All of my coworkers came to my defense and explained what actually happened. 

Funnily enough, after going through the HR fiasco, she didn't get fired. I got a verbal warning, and she got a written one. In the meeting, I ended up apologizing for my tone, which got me props with the managers, but went completely undetected by Mary, and Mary never apologized or spoke to me again. She stayed working there for about a month until everyone started snitching on her that she doesn't work, so she ended up quitting because ""everyone bullied her."" She tried to apply to a different department within the hospital, but everyone in the hospital knew she was fucking psycho. So, she's fired and gone from the dishroom; life is great. 

Until she started dating a cashier. The cashier, we'll call him Kash. Kash recently moved here and was recently broken up with by someone who worked in the OR. I never liked Kash. He always had an arrogant attitude, didn't respect his older coworkers, and he STANK. So, Kash is without a license, apartment, and family at 32, and he was recently broken up with. Mary was looking for an apartment roommate before she got fired, so they ended up moving in together. Because Kash cannot drive, I would often see her behind the counter with him (I wanted to snitch on them so bad, but karma). Time flashes by, and Mary becomes pregnant with Kash's kid. She found a new job at PetCo (I know the exact location, so I can avoid her), and Kash continues to work as a cashier at the hospital, bringing in that nice, beautiful health insurance. 

Well, secretly, Kash was racking up warnings, and every nurse hated him. In typical hospital fashion, after multiple warnings, he still wasn't fired, but the day finally came when the cherry was put on top of all his warnings. So, Kash is making a nurse her coffee, and he gets a primal, monkey instinct scratch on his balls. He scratches and goes back to making the nurse's coffee. He then hands the nurse the ball contaminated coffee, and the nurse asks, ""Are you really about to serve me that?"" to which Kash responds, verbatim ""What? It's not like my pants were down."" I would like to emphasize that yes, this was the cherry on top, but amazingly, if Kash didn't have all of those warnings, he wouldn't have been fired for that. 

So, now, Mary is about to burst with a kid, and Kash is without a job and living on Medicaid in the era of Trump, all while having no income because Mary cannot work due to pregnancy symptoms and Kash is a dunce. I feel bad for the kid. 

Anyways, I hope someone got enjoyment out of this straight-up essay. Please put positive thoughts out there that the kid will somehow beat the genetic lottery and end up intelligent. ",8,1741883657.0,coworkerstories,2,0.91,False

That hour long Sunsilk ad disguised as first show does not deserve more than a line.

For the entirety second show I was in line(kinda) for biryani, so I cannot comment much on it, however they did sound good(the first guy set the standards pretty low tbh) and the girl was very pretty.

Now, this was the day I learned the true value of food and hunger. Sympathy for the starving is easy but when you are standing for more than hour just for a plate of biryani while the guy is selling flavoured rice because the chicken's over and tells you to wait for another half an hour if you want dum biryani....you get a little closer to feeling empathy for the starving. (Yes, I realise I sound privileged as hell talking about biryani)

But seriously, hunger and those huge wait lines did not go well together.

  
Ab biryani milgayi aakhir main, phir usko pachane ke baad aayi ***DJ PAROMA***

Madam ne bajadiya tha  
easily the best dj out of all the 4 who came during the fest. Had tons of fun during her show.

  
**DAY 2**

The line to get into the show was crazy// then the show started late// BUT it was worth it for Shalmali

She rocked the stage with her vocals (of course) but the dancing and the overall presentation, just umma!üíã

~~and her dancers dev and shreya//unholy thoughts//but ik you agree~~

Show 2---KARTHIK  
Guys, he brought a girl(from the crowd) on stage. It was like a scene out of wattpad. We all know his singing was great, I needn't even mention it. Got to sit back, relax and enjoy with a feel of serendipity during his show.

Then there was some DJ. Yeah.

  
**DAY 3**

**MASALA COFFEE BAND**  
I was so close to the stage and so close to tears by the end of the show. See, however cringe it sounds, that might be one of the best experiences of my life.  
They lit up the stage, the vibes were immaculate and it was so easy to have fun. That is important, see, sometimes you have to try to have fun like move your body or sing, but with this band it came so naturally, so easy to blend in with the crowd and feel special at the same time as you groove to them.

I am learning Malayalam for them. Can DM if you are willing to teach.

2nd Show-

Armaan Malik  
need I write anything here? Of course his music was like breeze on an autumn evening. And he's overall adorable. 

  
THEN

there were 2 DJs  
Cannot write about the first one because I was sleeping or in an inebriated state induced due to gagful music.

And the second guy- ""2000 people 4000 hands!""

  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SO   
That was that. Vitopia'25.

I'd do it again.

Go to your fests man.  
And not even because you will miss out on things but because you might miss out on something that makes you, but mostly, just to enjoy.

Work hard. Party Hard.

Alright

That was me

Now, after spending time here, I can confidently say that it was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made.

Back home, job opportunities were limited, and even when I did find work, the pay wasn‚Äôt great. I wanted something better‚Äînot just financially, but also an experience that would push me outside my comfort zone. I started looking into different countries, and Korea kept coming up as a place with strong work opportunities for foreigners, especially in factories and construction. The wages were higher than what I could earn back home, and many jobs offered benefits like free housing and meals, which meant I could save a lot.

But it wasn‚Äôt just about the money. I had always been fascinated by Korea‚Äîthe culture, the food, the fast-paced lifestyle. I wanted to see it for myself, not just as a tourist, but as someone living and working here. I wanted to learn the language, experience the work culture, and see if I could adapt to something completely new.

The beginning wasn‚Äôt easy. The work was physically demanding, and the language barrier made things frustrating at times. There were moments when I felt out of place, missing home, wondering if I had made the right choice. But over time, things started to change. I made friends at work, learned enough Korean to communicate, and started enjoying the little things‚Äîgrabbing a quick *Ìé∏ÏùòÏ†ê* (convenience store) coffee before work, sharing late-night meals with coworkers, and exploring new places on my days off.

One of the biggest lessons I learned here is that stepping outside your comfort zone is where real growth happens. Working in Korea has made me more independent, resilient, and open-minded. It‚Äôs not always easy, but every challenge has been worth it.

If you‚Äôre thinking about working in Korea, my advice is simple: **go for it.** Be ready to work hard, but also be ready to experience something that could change your life. The opportunities are here, and if you embrace them, you‚Äôll gain so much more than just a paycheck.

Here's a list of highly underrated capabilities that you can instruct the model to apply in a natural language which no editing software or diffusion model prior to it was capable of üëáüèª

1)You can expand your text-based rpg gaming that you were able to do with these models to text+image based rpg and the model will continually expand your world in images,your own movements in reference to checkpoints and alter the world after an action command (You can do it as long as your context window hasn't broken down or you haven't run out of limits) If your world is very dynamically changing,even context wouldn't be a problem.....

2)You can give 2 or more reference images to Gemini and ask to compost them together as per requirement.

>You can also overlay one image's style into another image's style (both can be your inputs)

3)You can **modify all the spatial & temporal parameters** of an image including the **time,weather,emotion,posture,gesture,**

4)It has close to perfect text coherence,something that almost all of the diffusion models lack

5)You can **expand,fill & re-colorize** portions/entirety of images

6)It can handle multiple manipulations in a single prompt.For example,you can ask it to change the art style of the entire image while adding a character doing a specific pose in a specific attire doing a certain gesture some distance away from an already/newly established checkpoint while also modifying the expression of another character (which was already added) and the model can nail it (while also failing sometimes because it is the firstexperimental iteration of a non-thinking flash model)

7)The model can handle interconversion between static & dynamic transition,for example:

* It can make a static car drift along a hillside
* It can make a sitting robot do a specific dance form of a specific style
* Add more competitors to a dynamic sport like more people in a marathon (although it fumbles many times due to the same reason)

8)It's the first model capable of handling negative prompts (For example,if you ask it to create a room while explicitly not adding an elephant in it, the model will succeed while almost all of the prior diffusion models will fail unless they are prompted in a dedicated tab for negative prompts)

9)Gemini can generate pretty consistent gif animations too:

'Create an animation by generating multiple frames, showing a seed growing into a plant and then blooming into a flower, in a pixel art style'

And the model will nail it zero shot

Now moving on to the video segment, Google just demonstrated a new SOTA mark in multimodal analysis across text,audio and video üëáüèª:

For example:

If you paste the link of a YouTube video of a sports competition like football or cricket and ask the model the direction of a player's gaze at a specific timestamp,the stats on the screen and the commentary 10 seconds before and after,the model can nail it zero shot üî•üî•

(This feature is available in the AI Studio)

Speaking of videos,we also surpassed new heights of composting and re-rendering videos in pure natural language by providing an AI model one or two image/video references along with a detailed text prompt üåãüéá

Introducing VACE ü™Ñ(For all in one video creation and editing):

Vace can

* Move or stop any static or dynamic object in a video
* Swap Any character with any other character in a scene while making it do the same movements and expressions
* Reference and add any features of an image into the given video

\*Fill and Expand the scenery and motion range in a video at any timestamp

\*Animate any person/character/object into a video

All of the above is possible while adding text prompts along with reference images and videos in any combination of image+image,image+video or just a single image/video

On top of all this,it can also do video re-rendering while doing:

* content preservation
* structure preservation
* subject preservation
* posture preservation
* and motion preservation

Just to clarify,if there's a video of a person walking through a very specific arched hall at specific camera angles and geometric patterns in the hall...the video can be re-rendered to show the same person walking in the same style through arched tree branches at the same camera angle (even if it's dynamic) and having the same geometric patterns in the tree branches.....

Yeah, you're not dreaming and that's just days/weeks of vfx work being automated zero-shot/one-shot ü™Ñüî•

**NOTE:They claim on their project page that they will release the model soon,nobody knows how much is ""SOON""**

Now coming to the most underrated and mind-blowing part of the post üëáüèª

Many people in this sub know that Google released 2 new models to improvise generalizability, interactivity, dexterity and the ability to adapt to multiple varied embodiments....bla bla bla

>But,Gemini Robotics ER (embodied reasoning) model improves Gemini 2.0‚Äôs existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin.

>Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini‚Äôs coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it. üåãüéá

Yes,üëÜüèªthis is a ne**w emergent propertyüåå ri**ght here by scaling 3 paradigms simultaneously:

1)Spatial reasoning

2)Coding abilities

3)Action as an output modality

And where it is not powerful enough to successfully conjure the plans and actions by itself,it will simply learn through rl from human demonstrations or even in-context learning

Quote from Google Blog üëáüèª

>Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.

And to maintain safety and semantic strength in the robots,Google has developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven \*\*constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language ‚Äì to steer a robot‚Äôs behavior. \*\*

Which means **anybody can create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values.**  üî•üî•

**As a result,the Gemini Robotics models are SOTA in so many robotics benchmarks surpassing all the other LLM/LMM/LMRM models....as stated in the technical report by google (I'll upload the images in the comments)**

Sooooooo.....you feeling the ride ???
