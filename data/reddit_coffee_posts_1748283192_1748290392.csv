1kw45aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kw45aj/whats_the_big_deal_about_coffee/,What's the big deal about coffee?,"been out over a year. I was looking forward to drinking it. I've tried all the coffee.... It's OK at best.  It's good to me with an ""un-godly"" amount of sugar.  I still dry heave a little if I try black.

  
I've always been a heavy caffeine user (1-3 monsters a day for years).  I was hoping coffee would be this tasty low calorie thing that would be healthier.  

Recently started a new hobby brewing kombucha.  And my tea drinking experince thus far was that tea was sort of bland leafy tasting water, but has some abvious health benefits.   Black tea's.  Fucking amazing... WTF.  

  
I feel like there is this thing with the WOW where it's COFFEE & tea.  tea just a little bad.  and if you really think about it.  all tea's are herbal.  

  
If you're like me and didn't like coffee.  try all the tea's.  so yummy. ",2,1748290093.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

So, here goes mine... 

I was pretty excited for this small event at work, 'cause it meant a lot to me. Everything was set up, but then on the day of, things just didn't go as planned. I'm talking projector issues, my documents disappearing into the ether, and even spilt coffee on my favorite blouse. 😅 

Initially, I was so disappointed, especially since I’d been picturing this event going smoothly in my mind. But later that evening, I curled up with a big mug of herbal tea (kinda my go-to comfort drink) and tried to shift my perspective a little. 

I figured setbacks come and go, and we just aren’t always in control. It’s okay to feel bummed in the moment, tho. The next day, a couple of colleagues even shared similar stories of their own flops — it was surprisingly comforting to know I'm not alone in this sorta chaos.

So, I was curious, anyone else here have a small setback story that eventually taught you something or simply connected you with others? I'd love to hear them. 🌻",1,1748289934.0,kindcups,0,1.0,False

Newbie comes on his time the guy says he needs a coffee and disappears for 15 mins. I try quickly sorting all the letters when the manager comes and asks how I will do. I simply say I'm not sure which is me saying nope. 

He says give it a crack take both frames out, usually when he does this I'm for sure bringing stuff back because I'm like 30 minutes behind finishing sorting and with a newbie who is already slacking. 

Keep in mind, on a usual day I would have already left 1 hour ago with my usual partner who is the duty holder, the duty itself is very difficult and mostly stairs.

Anyway short day I bring 4 loops back, out of 12
I message the manager saying i tried my best 

Next day I finish my other duty, come back to the office and manager says the other day I didn't let him know I broke off. The SMS message didn't go through, I showed him he didn't really care but I can tell he was annoyed.

So the question is, is this a sackable offence in general idk even if I didn't message him i did make it clear to him I wasn't going to clear it?

1kw42bc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kw42bc,Herbal Hair Mask,"

Using Ayurveda herbs has been a GAME CHANGER for my hair. Every herb has their own benefits, some have similar benefits. Some are better used  as cleansers other conditioners u have to do your research. Whichever u use you will notice a change after the first use. 


I’ve always been fascinated by Indian women’s hair practices and their ability to grow healthy beautiful hair . I did research and found that they use herbal hair mask & scalp massages with oils weekly. 

I have been using Ayurveda products (oils) since 2012 and back then there was little info on them. So i wasn’t doing it right and had no idea what i was doing. 

In 2018 I started adding 1/2 TBSP of amla l and 1/2 tbsp of henna herbal power to my deep conditioner (aka herbal hair gloss) then i would mix it and heat it on the microwave for 30 secs before adding to my hair and leaving for 30 mins. I found my hair loved this method best bc my hair wasn’t super hard and dry like it would be if i did a mask. 

Fast forward now i understand that these herbs while having many benefits are very strong protein treatments and MUST be followed with a deep moisturizing treatment to balance it. Also it can dry out the hair so it’s important to add lots of oils to the mask. I usually add more oil than herb. 

I do a hair mask every 2 weeks and I always leave it overnight. 
To keep it from getting messy i put on a spa headband over a shower cap to hold the cap in place and to keep it from running. Then I put on a bonnet and place a towel on my pillow case in. 

As for recipes I freestyle i mix 3-4 herbs at a time. The amount depends on how much hair you have. I add my oil mix first then add  hot tea (or coffee) to mix it in.  I make sure the consistency on the runny side for easy application. I start off by adding to my scalp then i add to the rest of my hair. I massage it then i put it up and go to bed. The next day is wash day. 

Some benefits I’ve experienced: 
-less shedding
-stronger hair
-less breakage
-thicker strands 
-darker hair 
- less prone to split ends 

All these help with length retention. 

Favorite oils:
-castor oil 
-Rosemary oil
-coconut oil
-peppermint oil 
-extra virgin olive oil 
-sweet almond oil 
-grape seed oil ",2,1748289886.0,Naturalhair,1,1.0,False

First impressions? It’s like the James Bond of watches, sharp, stealthy, and probably judging me silently for pairing it with joggers. The black dial doesn’t scream for attention.

The ceramic bezel? Glossy enough to make me paranoid about fingerprints, but damn it looks good. And the way the dial reflects light, it’s got more moods than me before my morning coffee.

On the wrist, it’s ridiculously comfortable. The size is perfect, and it slides under a cuff like a seasoned pro.

Between the black and white dials, I’ll say this: the black is the sleeper hit.

1kw3yco,https://www.reddit.com/r/75HARD/comments/1kw3yco/what_works_for_me/,What Works For Me,"I’m currently on day 16 of 75 Hard and here are the top behaviors and key hacks that I have identified in myself as I’m on this journey. 

Side Note: I did get to 69 days last year and failed because I forgot to take a picture… Shame on me, I know.

These are just what I have found to help me out. I’m really just sharing because unbeknownst to the group, this forum has helped me immensely (more on that later) and I would like to contribute.

Obsession
75 Hard has to be the primary focus of everything. Shifting my focus away from everything else and funneling it to my health and well-being is first and foremost. It’s hard to explain, but this is the cornerstone characteristic that has given rise to me tackling the day. It may seem like I’ll be putting everything else on the back burner, but I’ve actually found that it amplifies everything else in my life (work, relationships, etc.). 

A Body in Motion Remains in Motion
I get the most difficult and time-consuming task out of the way. For me, this was the two workouts. I work out first thing in the morning and get my 2nd workout done usually at lunchtime (outdoor workout). The momentum I generate from completing the most difficult tasks I’ve found is important. This also creates a sense of accountability to complete the other seemingly easier ones.

Freedom in Restriction
There were two ways I could look at 75 Hard: I can choose to look at it as excessively restrictive, or I can choose to look at all of the things that are now a possibility to me that I may not have considered otherwise. For instance, with my diet, I’m eating about 2,200 kcals per day, and having the restrictions set by 75 Hard, I’ve found healthy and very satisfying meals that I’m going to adopt when I’m done to remain healthy. With my workouts, it has pushed me to explore different ways to be physically active specifically outside, that I wouldn’t normally do (cough, cough “run” - lol).

Identity
I adopted these tasks as a lifestyle instead of just seeing this as a challenge (even if just temporarily). The age-old expression of “you become what you repeatedly do every day” comes to mind for this. Identifying this as a lifestyle instead of a “I’m doing this challenge that requires me to do this” attaches a different meaning to how I view myself and this challenge. 

A No Matter What Person
I acquired a no-matter-what mindset. I will complete all of these items at a no-matter-the-cost mentality. My mind is that the clock starts the moment I wake up, and I will get these things checked off the list no matter what. 

Finding Inspiration
This group and YouTube have been a source of inspiration for me. I literally watch YouTube videos, look at progress pictures, and read post for inspiration. For me, it’s motivating to see people have success mentally, physically, and spiritually with this challenge. 

Preparation
If I prepare for anything, I do it for meals and workouts. I meal prep on the weekends, and every day I figure out when I’ll be able to get my outside workout done. Thinking ahead is literally 50% of the work for me. This eliminates in-the-moment thinking and decisions (which could lead to a less-than-favorable choices). 

Hacks that make me feel like I’m cheating:
1. Having multiple books (I have 3 books) and at least one that is digital (on my phone). Each book is different in difficulty and one that is vocational.
2. Calorie-free options (drinks, coffee creamer, condiments). G Hughes sauces have literally been a game-changer.
3. Choosing a destination for my outdoor workouts. I go to a lake near my house that has a 2.2-mile paved lap around it. One lap around it is about 45 minutes of walking, and I can’t tell you how uplifting it is to see other people being active as well. This makes me look forward to my outdoor workout.
4. I have a 27-ounce shaker bottle that I fill up and drink out of. Taking the water in small chunks is a literal cheat code. I know it takes 4.75 shaker bottles to get my water intake for the day. Now I’m chasing 4.75 shaker bottles instead of 128 ounces.

I would love to hear hacks and mindsets that you all have created to help you complete this challenge!

1kw3vbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodToronto/comments/1kw3vbn/my_restaurant_list/,My Restaurant List,"Hi Y'all,

I have been working on a restaurant List bc I get asked a lot about which restaurant to go to in Toronto from Friends/Family visiting. Below is essentially my first draft, what are your thoughts?

BTW, it leans queen west heavily bc thats the area I live in.

* [Le Swan](https://leswan.ca/) (French/Diner) – Half diner, half French bistro, this cozy and intimate spot is one of my haunts. The food is straight forward, well executed, and thoughtfully balanced. Excellent cocktails that play on bar standards. It is a tight space, so groups of more than four are not advised. Overall, not spectacular, but comforting and delicious. The ideal spot for a weeknight dinner. (not open for lunch).
* [Le Select Bistro](https://www.leselectbistro.com/) (French) – A Toronto institution and favourite of mine. This is not boundary pushing, but they consistently at deliver great takes on French bistro classics. I dream of their cassoulet in the winter. It's also an enormous space, so great if you are ever dealing with a larger group or looking to book a space. (Open for lunch)
* [Enoteca Sociale](https://sociale.ca/) (Italian) – This Roman spot is all about the tender house made fresh pasta. Comfortable environment and very welcoming staff, this has become a local favourite for a reason. (Not open for lunch)
* [Dreyfus](https://dreyfustoronto.com/) (French) – Another small French bistro, but with a Canadian contemporary influence. The food here is delicious, rich and comforting. Good wine list as well. I always leave Dreyfus with a full belly and having drunk a little too much wine, ideally you should be able to sleep in the next morning. Situated on the first floor of a town house, this is a very small restaurant so book ahead of time. (Not open for lunch)
* [Soos](https://www.soostoronto.com/) (Malay) – Another addition from Ossington St. This is (reportedly) authentic Malaysian cooking with contemporary twists. I love this place for the Sambal chili sauce, which they will sell you in jars to take home. Also, a great option if you are dining with someone with dietary restrictions, they have plenty of good vegan options and are good at accommodations. (Not open for lunch)
* [Union](https://union72.ca/) (French) – The space is appealingly rustic and so is the food. If you sit at the counter, the chef sometimes will serve your dish and stick around to talk about it. Perhaps not the most refined, but Union brings flavour in spades, this place makes me happy. Also they have one of my preferred brunches in the city. (Open for lunch)
* [Sushi Yugen](https://sushiyugen.ca/restaurant/) (Sushi, duh) – I’m not well acquainted with the world of high-end sushi. What I can tell you is this place is awesome. They only do omakase, of which there are two levels. I went here for my 30^(th) birthday for the chef’s counter omakase, and it was without a doubt one of the best meals I’ve ever had. Traditional décor, service is excellent and serious. The female servers wear authentic and ornate kimonos which is a fun touch. (Open for lunch)
* [Quetzal](https://www.quetzaltoronto.com/) (Mexican) – To be honest, I haven’t made it here yet. I felt I needed to include it on here for both it’s critical reputation as well as its revered status amongst many of my friends. From what I hear it’s all the fantastic things about high-end Mexican food. Smokey charred flavours, excellent Ceviche, deep and complex sauces. (Not open for Lunch)
* [Sunny’s Chinese](https://www.sunnyschinese.com/) (Chinese obviously) – In the back of weird hallway in Kensington market, this is a great and hip restaurant. Spicy food abounds in these mouthwatering homestyle shared plates. If you enjoy Szechuan spice, this is for you. black bean fish and Mapo Tofu are my personal favorites. (Not open for lunch)
* [Grey Gardens](https://greygardens.ca/) (Canadian Contemporary) – One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The cocktails are always changing and the are no wrong choices. People more knowledgeable than myself tell me the wine list is also very good.  The smoked fish dip must be ordered; creamy, briny, and bursting with umami. They make smart contemporary dishes that take inspiration from a myriad of different cuisines. Pasta is also very good here. (Not open for lunch)
* [Mamakas](https://mamakas.ca/mamakas/) (Greek) - “Greek food better than what we had in Greece” – CBC food critic Elizabeth Carson, 2024. Fantastic food and friendly service. The space is designed to feel fun and lively which matches a menu of fairly big portions meant to be shared. The meatballs are to die for, seeming to liquifying when bitten. Not your traditional Moussaka, but a very good one with a modern twist.  If you can bring a big group its useful in that you can order more dishes. (Open for lunch on weekends)
* [Imanishi](https://www.imanishi.ca/) (Izakaya) – The first restaurant I went to when I moved to Toronto six years ago, it remains in my frequent rotation to this day. A playful and multicultural take on Izakaya, the menu changes all the time. The corn karaage are little golden bundles of joy that have an almost funnel cake texture. I will say that the seating is not particularly comfortable, and you may end up on a stool. (Not open for lunch)
* [Vinoteca Pompette](https://www.pompette.ca/) (Italian) –They very recently rebranded from Pompette to Vinoteca Pompette, and with that have gone from French to Italian food. I have not been since their rebrand. Setting aside their identity crisis, the kitchen here deserves to all the hype it has been lauded with. Really well considered dishes, elegant and unctuous. If you go for Sunday dinner, they have an alternative menu which can be fun (Not open for lunch)
* [Parallel](https://parallelbrothers.com/geary-restaurant/) (Middle eastern) – My favorite falafel in the city. Parallel serves up lovely herbaceous dishes that lean a little to the rustic side. They are known for their mezze, which they sold commercially before the opened the restaurant and still do now. The patio is well covered and heated, so it is pleasant for most of the year. They recently started a second location in Kensington Market, but I have not been able to visit yet. (Open for lunch)
* [Richmond Station](https://richmondstation.ca/) (Contemporary) – Located in an unassuming spot in the financial district, this little gem makes tasty food with consistency. Dished here come from a wide variety of inspirations, but broadly speaking mostly European and North American. What I find is that means there is always something for everyone on the menu. While not a burger place by any means, they do make a fantastic one if you are dining with someone who would be interested. You will want to sit in the main room further back in the restaurant, the bar space in the front is less pleasant. (Open for lunch)
* Forno Cultura, Queen Location (Italian Bakery) – Forno Cultura has become a part of my weekend ritual. Every Sunday I have a slow morning and then walk over to at lunch for a sandwich, a coffee, and a delightful pastry or baked good. On Sundays they have a Meatball sub that is the stuff of dreams, but all the sandwich options pull their weight. Pastry wise, hard to go wrong here, but I do bring home their biscotti to Calgary for the Holidays. One the weekend their sandwiches can sell out by 1:30/2:00. (Open for lunch)
* [Favourites](https://www.myfavethai.com/) (Thai BBQ) Hidden on Ossington St., this unassuming spot is not your normal Thai restaurant. They use their charcoal grill to great effect, marrying charred and smokey elements to classic Thai flavours. They also innovate by mixing in all sorts of techniques and inspirations from other cuisines. The duck confit with red curry is a dish I enjoy immensely.  (Not open for lunch)
* [Writer’s Room](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/canada/park-hyatt-toronto/torph/dining/writers-room-bar) (Contemporary) – The bar/restaurant on the 17^(th) floor of the Park Hyatt Yorkville. A very cool space with gorgeous sweeping views of Downtown Toronto. Dining here is shared with plenty of tasty bites to pick from, but really, I come here for the drinks and the view. Some of the best cocktails I’ve had in the city come from the bevy of talented bartenders they employ.
* [Koukla](https://mamakas.ca/bar-koukla/) (Greek) – Sister operation and direct neighbour to Mamakas, Koukla is a bar most of the time, with good drinks and good food. Frankly, if you're going for dinner I would suggest you go to Mamakas instead. However, on weekends is when Koukla truly shines they make one of the best brunch/lunches around.

It’s squishy, wrinkled, and utterly electric. And somehow, it runs the show—your habits, your memories, your decisions, even your dreams.

You’ve probably heard people say “use your brain,” but most of us never really stop to ask: **what is the brain actually made of, and how does it do what it does?** If you could shrink yourself down and take a walk through the folds and tunnels of the brain, you’d see a strange and beautiful organ, divided into parts, each with its own job—but all of them working together to keep you thinking, feeling, moving, and staying alive.

[brain anatomy](https://preview.redd.it/kno5torgl63f1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=572e0180a1ef1848eedab3a1b651bdae2b641be9)

# The Brain’s Big Picture: Lobes, Layers, and Left-Right Logic

The brain is split into two halves—left and right hemispheres. They look alike but specialize in different things. Generally, the **left hemisphere** leans logical: language, math, detail. The **right hemisphere** is more artistic: visual processing, patterns, emotion. But they’re in constant conversation, passing info across a bridge called the **corpus callosum**.

[Each hemisphere](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234157/) is divided into four main **lobes**:

* **Frontal lobe** – Think planning, focus, decision-making, and personality. Also responsible for voluntary movement.
* **Parietal lobe** – Handles sensory information like touch, temperature, and spatial awareness.
* **Temporal lobe** – Home of hearing, language processing, and long-term memory.
* **Occipital lobe** – The brain’s visual processing center.

These lobes are wrapped in a crinkled outer layer called the **cerebral cortex**. That’s where most high-level thinking happens.

Now let’s zoom in and explore how each of these areas contributes to the mental magic show happening every second you’re alive.

# Frontal Lobe: The Brain’s CEO

You could call the **frontal lobe** the executive suite. It’s where your brain handles the hard stuff—organizing, deciding, controlling impulses, and figuring out what to do next. It also keeps your emotions in check and helps you plan ahead, even when every cell in your body wants to hit the snooze button.

Inside the frontal lobe sits the **prefrontal cortex**. This area is especially active when you're focused, solving a problem, or resisting temptation. It's the voice that says, “Don't eat the entire cake” even when your taste buds are shouting otherwise.

Then there's the **motor cortex**, stretched like a headband across the top of the frontal lobe. It’s in charge of movement—from blinking to high-fiving your friend to typing your Wi-Fi password with two thumbs.

The frontal lobe is also the last part of the brain to fully mature. That’s why teenagers often take risks adults wouldn’t dream of—it’s not a character flaw, it’s brain construction still in progress.

# Parietal Lobe: The Body Map

The **parietal lobe** helps your brain make sense of where you are in space—and where everything else is too. It's the internal GPS and touch dashboard. Without it, you wouldn’t know if your keys were in your left hand or your back pocket.

Its **somatosensory cortex** processes sensations like pressure, temperature, and pain. Interestingly, different body parts get different amounts of “brain real estate” here. Hands, lips, and face take up huge chunks because they're super sensitive. Your back? Not so much.

This area also plays a [key role in math](https://cortexcurious.com), attention, and even imagining objects from different angles. Ever tried assembling IKEA furniture without these abilities? Enough said.

# Temporal Lobe: Sound, Memory, and Meaning

The **temporal lobes** sit behind your ears and are all about hearing and understanding. They process language and let you recognize sounds, from your favorite song to your dog’s bark.

Tucked deep inside the temporal lobe is the **hippocampus**, shaped like a seahorse. It’s crucial for forming new memories. When you remember your first bike ride or that terrible haircut from eighth grade, the hippocampus helped store that info and retrieve it when needed.

Damage to this area can cause [serious memory issues](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-anatomy%23parts-of-the-brain). People with Alzheimer’s often show early damage here, which is one reason memory fades first.

There’s also the **amygdala**, a small almond-shaped structure right next to the hippocampus. It's the brain’s alarm system. When something scary or exciting happens, the amygdala lights up, tagging the event as emotionally important. That’s why you remember your first heartbreak in vivid detail, but not what you had for lunch last Thursday.

# Occipital Lobe: The Visual Processor

You’d think your eyes do all the seeing, but actually, they just collect light. It’s the **occipital lobe**, way at the back of your head, that turns raw input into something meaningful. It reconstructs what your eyes see—shapes, colors, movement—and helps you identify objects and people.

It’s divided into several regions that each process different pieces of the visual puzzle. For example, one part handles edges and contrast, while another recognizes faces. Together, they let you navigate a room, read a book, or marvel at a sunset.

If this area is injured, a person can lose parts of their visual field—or even become ""cortically blind,"" where the eyes are fine, but the brain can’t process the images.

# The Cerebellum: Balance and Coordination

Behind the brainstem, under the occipital lobe, sits the **cerebellum**—Latin for “little brain.” It’s the unsung hero of motion. It doesn’t make you move, but it makes you move **well**.

The cerebellum smooths out your motor commands so you don’t spill your coffee every time you raise your mug. It handles balance, coordination, posture, and even some aspects of attention and language.

You don’t consciously notice the cerebellum unless it’s not working properly—then walking can feel like trying to steer a shopping cart with a wobbly wheel.

# Brainstem: Life Support Control Center

At the base of your brain lies the **brainstem**, connecting your brain to your spinal cord. This is the oldest part of the brain from an evolutionary perspective—and it does the most essential work.

It regulates involuntary functions like breathing, heart rate, digestion, and sleep. You don’t have to remember to breathe, thankfully—your brainstem’s got that covered.

The brainstem is also a conduit. All the messages from the body to the brain and back again pass through this narrow stalk. Damage here is extremely serious and can affect consciousness and even survival.

# The Limbic System: Emotions, Motivation, and Memory

We already mentioned the **hippocampus** and **amygdala**, but they’re part of a broader neighborhood called the **limbic system**. This system is all about emotional regulation, behavior, and survival instincts.

Here’s a quick lineup:

* **Amygdala** – Tags emotional memories, especially fear and pleasure.
* **Hippocampus** – Stores and retrieves long-term memories.
* **Hypothalamus** – Regulates hunger, thirst, body temperature, and hormone release.
* **Thalamus** – Acts as the brain’s relay station, routing sensory information to the appropriate lobes.

Together, these structures help determine how we react to the world and how we remember our experiences. They’re the reason a song can make you cry—or why the smell of cinnamon reminds you of your grandmother’s kitchen.

# Inside the Neuron Highway: Gray Matter and White Matter

The [brain is packed with about 86 billion neurons](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/brain-tour). These are the cells that send messages through electrical and chemical signals.

* **Gray matter** contains neuron cell bodies. This is where processing happens.
* **White matter** is made of axons, the long wires that connect neurons across regions. It's covered in **myelin**, a fatty substance that speeds up signal transmission.

Think of gray matter as cities where information is processed, and white matter as highways that link them together.

When these highways get damaged—by injury, aging, or disease—communication slows, like a traffic jam in your head.

# Keeping the Machine Running: What Supports Brain Health?

Now that you know the parts, here’s the million-dollar question: **how do you take care of this incredible machine?**

Science points to a few key pillars:

* **Sleep** – The brain uses sleep to consolidate memories and clear out waste (literally—it has a built-in cleaning system).
* **Nutrition** – Omega-3s, antioxidants, and micronutrients all support brain structure and function.
* **Exercise** – Physical activity boosts blood flow, encourages new neurons, and supports the hippocampus.
* **Learning** – Staying mentally active builds cognitive reserve and promotes neuroplasticity.
* **Connection** – Social bonds help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.

Also: limit chronic stress, avoid toxins (yes, that includes heavy drinking), and give your brain a break sometimes. You wouldn’t run a car engine 24/7 without maintenance—your brain needs the same courtesy.",1,1748289269.0,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,0,1.0,False

They weren’t gone while taking potassium alone so I wasn’t totally satisfied but felt closer to my answer… I’ve I also found out my testosterone was extremely low so I completely quit my caffeine intake to rehabilitate my adrenal glands to help my production of testosterone. Within the first 3 days of being caffeine free - my spams have become very mild, almost unnoticeable, and has proven to be more effective than taking my potassium! I quit taking mg my potassium to see if the caffeine could’ve possibly been the cause and lo and behold - my muscle spasms are reduced INCREDIBLY. I was twitching every 10-20 seconds every single day of my life for the last year and a half, now even when I anticipate one, it doesn’t come. I have been experimenting with this for about 6 weeks - I still twitch but it’s VERY mild, less frequency, and overall an incredible change. I experimented by drinking coffee over a weekend to see what would happen and my spasms came back as intense as before!

What areas people do people enjoy in the city/adjacent cities?

We're pretty eclectic about what we are into. We're also not bougie or worried about crime, although obviously we'd prefer a safer area than not.

Ideally, we would also like to find a neighborhood that is adjacent to both a solid middle school and highschool, as my kid will be in middle school when we move and then moving onto highschool and we don't want to have to move when he switches schools. He is also trans and doesn't want to have to deal with bullying/BS at school, so again a more progressive/open-minded area would be the best. Even better if the neighborhood has a community feel to it. I used to live in Oregon and we knew all of our neighbors and our kids played together.

Having said that I know there are some posts out there but I would love to get some specific responses for me instead of digging through comments and posts from old times.

After hours of watching youtube coffee videos from Hoffman and Lance Hendrick I always use 18grams for a yiedl of 36ish, and I try to adjust the brewing time to around 30 seconds..  I am not extremely picky with that but I aim to get it close to that timing...

One of my questions is, why after seemingly adjusting my grinder for certain coffee, maybe the next day I make another coffee and suddenly the extraction is done in like 15 seconds? (I enter an infinite cycle with my grinder where I thought I nailed the grind size around 40 clicks for the K6 and now I am around 15 clicks because re-adjusting)...

Most times whenever it goes weird I notice it being a bit bitter but I am no expert.

Second question is very similar, I have a bottomless portafilter, and if I try to brew 2 times, the second one is ALWAYS extremely quick.. lets say first could take 30 seconds but if I rinse, dry and re use the same portafilter and top mesh (dont know the name)... and brew a second coffee it can pour out like water like opening a tap getting to my desired 36gram+/- dose in like 10 seconds.

I wanted to disassemble my grinder to clean it and see if it made a difference... I was unable to because I just cant remove a metal piece in the K6, I even used a mini screwdriver and the tip of the screwdriver broke.

TLDR: I dont know wtf is going on, I try to adjust grind size but find it never really brings same results,  I dont understand why a second brew on a same portafilter and mesh pours out like water.

1kw3pl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kw3pl8/med_sorting_hack/,Med sorting hack?,"My current hyper fixation is finding a way to make sorting all my meds easier and faster. I’m picturing something that I can dump all my pill bottles into and then press a button and plink plink plink, one(ish) of every pill falls out. It doesn’t need to be perfect or secure, just easy. 

The Problem: I have ADHD and chronic illness so I take a bunch of pills every morning and night (4 in the morning, 10 at night). I’ve tried weekly pill organizers but I just don’t fill them. Plus, I use them so haphazardly that I can’t be sure if I missed a day. I cannot manage to keep my pill bottles in one spot, so I end up losing them or just not even looking. I don’t have any problem remember to take what I call my Mission Critical meds—the ones that are absolutely necessary to get me through the next 24 hours. But a lot of my meds require long-term adherence to be effective, and I’m not taking those regularly. 

The Secret Solution to ALL of My Problems: Obviously, if I can fix this one problem, I will instantly become the Best Version of Myself. I need monthly pill organizers and a streamlined way to fill them, plus something that forces me to keep my pills in one place. I bought the monthly pill organizers already (with the date on them and you can remove 4-day sections). So now I just need this thing I’ve imagined to exist. 

I just got the Hero Pill Dispenser and it was a bust. It’s SO SLOW and really loud. It scares my cats and makes me crabby. I don’t need the security features or the technology. It also only holds 10 different medications. It’s a very very good thing for the elderly and maybe who don’t live alone and probably some other people. But it’s not for me. 

I’ve been looking at these multi compartment “supplement dispensers” and I did buy a small one to keep back-up morning meds in my work purse. But none of them have enough compartments to keep all my night meds together. 

The Request: Does anyone know of like a children’s toy or candy dispenser that could pop out roughly one thing from each of 8-10 compartments or containers? Not like a Pez dispenser, more like a gumball machine. I’m also open to suggestions that would require a little DIY. Ideally it would be relatively compact, like the size of a coffee machine or smaller.

Hey everyone,
I’ve seen a few mentions of the Horse Clementine bag floating around and figured I’d share my own review since I haven’t seen too many people actually wearing it out and about.

So, first things first,I know people call it a Loewe Puzzle dupe, but personally, I don’t think that’s fair. It has its own design language and doesn’t feel like a copy. It’s structured, yes, but also has a nice slouch when not packed full.

Specs & First Impressions:
I got the coffee colour . It's really beautiful, warm-toned, and versatile. The leather honestly feels amazing for the price. I was genuinely impressed by how soft and premium it felt. One downside: I’m in the UK and had to pay around £50 in customs, which made me question whether it was worth it. I still think it is, but I wouldn’t want to pay much more.

Wearability:
When you wear it, especially crossbody or using the top handle, the bag does lose a bit of its slouchiness. That didn’t bother me  tbh.  it still looks elevated and not overly stiff. If you only want that relaxed look, this may not be for you.

Practicality:
I’m a mum of two, and this worked great as a day-to-day bag. I managed to fit two water bottles, snacks, and the usual bits and pieces without overloading it. It has that ideal balance between looking put together and being functional.

Final Thoughts:
If you want something super slouchy 24/7, maybe give it a pass. But if you want a well-made, good-looking everyday bag that feels more expensive than it is, I’d absolutely recommend it. Understated, luxe, and it does the job ! 

Happy to answer any questions if you’re thinking about getting one!

I can't believe how much my life has changed in three months. It still feels like it was last week I graduated from University. I have been living with my sister and her family for the past three months. I am 21 years old, and I work at an IT company, where I was lucky enough to get a contract and my own office. I have been working there for the past two months. I have a substantial allowance but have always been taught to work for the things I value in life. My life is pretty simple, but I can feel something new is going to happen soon. I don t know if I like the feeling or not but let s see what life holds in store for me.

I am brought back from my musings when I feel someone pull on my trousers.

""Aunt, Aunt,"" my cute niece calls, pulling on my trousers to get my attention.

Eman is the female version of her father, except for her skin tone. She has curly black hair, large grey eyes, a heart-shaped face, and beautiful light skin. She is six years old. She is my sister s first child.

""Yes, cutie pie what can I help you with?"" I ask, giving her my full attention.

""Aunt, when I get back from school today could you braid my hair like how you did yours?"" she asks, giving me her best puppy eyes look.

""Of course, honey, once I get back from work I will.""

I can t say no to her, even though I know I am going to be exhausted from work.

After we are done talking, she walks back to the dining table and finishes her breakfast so that she can be on her way to school.

After breakfast, I walk back upstairs to get ready for work. I change from my dressing gown into my work outfit. I wear a pair of plaid pants, a white shirt, a black coat, zip ankle boots and a black bag to match the outfit. I finish dressing and leave the house and get into my car to drive to work.

I arrive at work a few minutes later and take the elevator up to meet with my supervisor. Once I get to her office, I don t spend more than a minute as she already has the work she wants me to do ready for me.

I walk to my office to begin my work. I still can t believe my job came with this gorgeous office. The walls of my office are painted white with three paintings adorning the walls, and my desk is white with golden edges. There are two white chairs in front of my desk while my chair is black. There is a coffee table in the middle with a four-seater couch, and the glass window to the left overlooks the city.

I don t have much to do today, Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah). Most times I have a lot of work to get through but because today we were given half of the day off, I have less to do at the office.

Today I was given the task to play new games and check if they have any glitches. It might sound simple, but it s not. I must play more than ten games before I can finish work today. The fact that sometimes I don t know how to play them makes it a little hard. That s not the only thing I do at work, sometimes I am given administrative work to do as well. So, my job is not all fun all the time.

I am driving back home from a good day at work when I get a call from a friend from work.

""Hello Emma.""

""Hi Umit, I was calling to remind you that the boss is back and will be coming to work tomorrow. He also said he wants to meet with all new staff and the intern s tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.""

""Oh, I didn t forget, but thanks for calling to remind me.""

""You are welcome. Bye,""

""Bye,"" I say ending the call.

I drive through our black, cast iron gate. Our house is a two-story building with beautiful flowers all around the front porch and a water fountain in the middle. While parking my car, I notice a black Lykan Hypersport is parked at our front porch, meaning we have a guest. I wonder who it is.

I walk into our entryway. There are two grand staircases with black bannisters adorning it. There is a chandelier in the middle of the staircases and a black vintage table with a flower vase on it.

I walk into the living room. The walls are painted grey ceramics, there is a crystal chandelier, the couches are charcoal with white and grey throw pillows, a brown coffee table and a fireplace.

I see the last person I ever want to see in my life, my worst enemy. The only person in my life I truly loathe. It is none other than my brother-in-law, Ismail Uthman.

Ismail is 25 years old, 6-foot-tall, has black hair, a solid build, and fair skin. Ismail was born and raised in England. His mother is English, but his father is of Turkish descent. He moved to America when he was 18 to attend university. He has a very thick British accent. His brother is married to my sister, making him my brother-in-law too.

""You!"" I say, pointing my finger at him. ""What are you doing here?""

""If I remember correctly, this is my brother's house,"" he says with disgust.

""Sure,"" I reply, ""but I doubt you came to see him. I bet you came to see if you have succeeded in making my life a living hell. But let me tell you, my life is great and there is nothing you can do about it, so you can leave!"" I say with a deadly look.

""Oh honey, I wish you were the reason I came over, but sorry sweetheart, I came to see my brother,"" he smirks, not meaning those sweet names.

""Okay, whatever you say, Mister,"" I say walking past him.

I am about to go upstairs and get some rest before dinner when I hear my name called from the living room.

""Umit, Umit."" I hear my sister's voice calling me.

""Yes, Waheeda,"" I say walking into the living room to answer her.

Waheeda is different from me in features. I am dark skinned while she is light skinned. She is slightly taller than me. I am 5 feet 6 inches tall while she is 5 feet 7 inches. Waheeda takes after my mother while I take after my father in skin tone. Waheeda and I were born and raised in Nigeria but moved to America after we finished university. She finished years before me, though.

""Please take a seat we have something to discuss with you,"" Waheeda says as soon as I walk into the living room. I take a seat opposite her and her husband, Aazim.

""I know you and my brother have a rough past, but you both have to put that aside because you are going to be sharing a roof. And truth be told, you both know that it is not Islamic to hate one another,"" my brother-in-law Aazim says. Aazim, like his brother is 6-feet-tall, has black hair, broad shoulders, and fair skin. Aazim moved to America from England in his 20 s when he got a job offer.

""I don't understand what you mean by 'this… I stutter with a nasty look, ""whatever he calls himself, and me sharing a roof.""

""What he means is that I am moving in, whether you like it or not."" Ismail is returning the same nasty look.

""UH, what did you say?! You are What?! Moving into where? Please stop with the silly joke,"" I say standing up while laughing sarcastically. ""I have never killed a human being, but if you wake up tomorrow and find your brother dead, don't be surprised. We all know we can t stand each other for a minute, and you want us to live under the same roof?! If I may ask, why can't he live in his own house? Because I saw a 2019 Lykan Hypersport parked outside which I am pretty sure belongs to him. So, I know he can afford an apartment or even an estate if he wants,"" I rant really getting flustered, not really meaning what I said about killing him.

""You are not killing my brother. You will both have to learn to co-exist. Like I said before, it s not even Islamic that you guys fight a lot and the reason he is moving in…, it's not my place to tell you that story. All that matters is that he is moving in and that s final,"" Aazim says.

""Fine, I will try to co-exist because I respect you as my brother-in-law, and for the sake of Allah I will learn to co-exist with him and live under the same roof as him,"" I say.

""Thank you,"" Aazim says, walking out of the living room with Waheeda.

""I am surprised you have not said much since you came in, maybe you are finally starting to learn some manners,"" I say to Ismail with a smug smile on my face.

""Just because I am not giving you the pleasure of hearing my voice, does not mean you should be sad about it,"" Ismail says smirking.

""Who said I like the sound of your voice?""

""You don t need to say it, sweetheart, but I know you do and the sooner you accept it the better.""

""I think something is wrong with you. What makes you think I would like your voice when I can t even stand your presence!"" I state with disgust and annoyance, because even though I dislike him he does have a nice voice, but I will never tell him that.

""Nothing is wrong with me. There is something wrong with you because who wouldn t love my voice? I have a British accent,"" he says sounding proud.

""This is why…"" before I can finish my statement, Aazim walks back into the living room and stops our argument.

""Both of you, what did I just say before I left the room,"" he says with a stern look.

""That we should learn to co-exist,"" Ismail and I say in unison.

""And is that what both of you are doing?""

""No."" we both admit.

""If you don't want me to kick both you guys out of my house you better learn to co-exist before I throw you guys out. I can t believe you guys are adults, fighting like children."" Aazim says shaking his head.

""I can t promise you anything, Aazim, but I will try to co-exist,"" I say.

""Please do,"" Aazim says.

""Same goes for me,"" Ismail says.

""Good! And before I forget Umit, please, will you help Ismail with his things?""

""Do I have to?"" I whine, dropping my shoulders trying to look tired.

""Not really, but it will help with learning to co-exist.""

""Alright fine, I will,"" I say knowing there is no way out.

""Thank you.""

""You are welcome.""

I can't believe I am going to be sharing the same house with Ismail. He is the last person I want to see every day.

I help Ismail take his things upstairs, and I can t believe among all the rooms in the house, he had to choose the one right next to mine.

# Chapter 2 II

I finish helping Ismail. I pray Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer before I go downstairs to make something to eat.

I feel like preparing one of my Nigerian dishes today, but I wonder which I should make. 'Aha, I know just what to prepare'.

I go to the kitchen. The kitchen walls are painted all white. There is a chandelier in the middle, the cupboards are painted white with brushed steel handles, the gas cooker and the microwave are brushed steel, and the worktop is ceramic with a black and white pattern.

I start preparing dinner which is pounded yam and egusi soup with chicken. But if I eat it and go to bed early, my stomach will hurt the next morning, but Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allah) it's 3:00 p.m. I am lucky I got off work early today. There is enough time for the food to digest before I go to bed.

Two hours later I finish making my egusi soup and pounded yam. I am about to dish up my food when I hear someone s voice coming from the living room, walking to the kitchen.

""Hmm, what s cooking? I am so hungry I can't wait to eat,"" Ismail says walking into the kitchen.

""Listen to you! Who said I made enough for you too? If you want to eat, cook for yourself!"" I say, speaking with my Nigerian exclamations.

""Eww, what is that you are cooking,"" he says, taking a step back away from my food.

""What did you say?"" I say raising my brows, looking at him with a look that says, 'try and repeat what you said, and you will see what will happen to you.

""I did not say anything, but please, what is that you made. I have never seen it before,"" he says, moving a step away from me.

""It s called pounded yam and egusi soup.""

""What is e-eg-gusi, and where did you pound the yam.""

""You are not serious! Just because I called it pounded yam does not mean the yam must be pounded,"" I say laughing at him.

""Will you stop laughing. You are laughing at me like I am a Nigerian and I am meant to know all about the way you guys make your meals,"" he says frowning at me while I laugh at him.

""Sorry Mister, but since you don't know, I did not pound the yams. I made it with yam flour,"" I say still giggling a little.

""Oh, you could have just said that instead of laughing at me.""

""Whatever, do you want to try some? And even though you are not my favorite person in the world, I will never poison you,"" I say tasting my food to prove to him it s not poisoned. Before he can reply, Aazim walks in.

""Aha Umit, you made pounded yam and egusi soup today,"" Aazim says smiling.

""Yes, I did. Yours is on the dinner table."" I say, turning back to Ismail waiting for his answer.

""Aazim, you eat this thing she cooked,"" he says, giving my food a disgusted look.

Does this guy want me to beat him? If he gives my cooking that look one more time, I won t be responsible for my actions.

""Of course, why wouldn't I? I am sure you must be wondering why I will eat something I have never eaten before or ever seen in my life. I will tell you, when she first made the dish, I didn t even want to look at it. But when I heard my son say that it was his favorite Nigerian food, I knew this dish must be amazing. Because Aayan is very selective when it comes to food and for him to like it, I just knew that I had to try it. So, one day when she made it, I tried it, and let me tell you something brother, it was amazing,"" Aazim says praising my cooking, which makes me smile and forget I was about to knock some sense into someone.

""Wow,"" he says looking at his brother like he has two heads.

""You should try it too,"" Aazim says to Ismail.

""No, thank you, I will pass,"" Ismail says, walking out of the kitchen.

After dinner, I went back upstairs to do Eman's hair before finishing some work I had to do. I also prayed Isha (night) prayer after I finished working. I am on my way to the kitchen to get a bottle of water to drink when I hear noises coming from the kitchen. 'I wonder who is in the kitchen at this time of the night I ask myself.

I walk into the kitchen to see the last person I want to see, doing the last thing I expected that person would do. Ismail is eating the last plate of dinner I made, and he is enjoying it so much that he doesn t notice when I start taking pictures of him until I started laughing.

""What are you laughing at?"" he asks, dropping the plate in the sink like I did not just catch him eating the meal I made.

""Oh me, nothing serious, just this funny picture I saw online,"" I say flashing my phone in his face.

""When did you take that?"" he says trying to grab my phone from my hand.

""I took it when you were busy eating the food like your life depended on it,"" I reply laughing at him again.

""You have to delete it,"" he says trying to grab my phone again.

""No,"" I say locking my phone so even if he gets it, he won't be able to open it, while I run to the edge of the counter in the middle of the kitchen. We run around the kitchen like little children until we both get tired and decide to stop.

""Fine, I give up. What do you want me to do so you can delete the picture?"" Ismail asks breathing heavily, probably tired from running around the kitchen island.

""Hmm, you will have to be my slave for a whole month.""

""Your what?"" he says with disbelieve.

""My slave,"" I say smiling, knowing I have already won this battle.

""You have to be kidding me. Pick something else, anything but that.""

""You either be my slave for a month or everyone on my snap chat, Instagram and other social media accounts will have a copy of your glorious picture,"" I laugh.

""Fine. Fine, I will do it. But don t make me do things that are not reasonable.""

""I can t promise you that,"" I say smiling.

""I am serious, Umit.""

""I have heard you and I say goodnight. Also, after you have finished eating, do remember to wash the plates. So, no-one will know you ate my cooking,"" I say smirking while walking up the stairs making sure to be loud.

""Will you keep it down!""

""Sorry, sir."" I say in a whisper before disappearing upstairs.",1,1748288432.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kw3hhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1kw3hhr/explora_journeys_made_me_feel_like_cruise/,Explora Journeys made me feel like cruise Goldilocks (Explora II review after Virgin and Silversea),"I sailed on Explora II in Europe and wanted to share some thoughts, especially for others who are relatively new to cruising like me.

For context, I’m a millennial, very low-key, and happiest when I’m near water with good food and no pressure to 'get involved' in social activities (read: boring AF).

My cruise background so far is just  Virgin (chaotic, not for me) and Silversea (great, but a bit too formal).  Explora felt like the happy medium I didn’t know existed.

Here’s what stood out to me:

**1. The food was next-level, especially the Marketplace.**

I wasn’t expecting to fall in love with the buffet-style Marketplace, but I did. The hot seafood station had cioppino (seafood stew) and other rotating dishes, while the cold seafood station had shockingly good crab legs and oysters. 

There’s also a sushi station with fresh rolls being made constantly, and a station with a full antipasti spread (grilled veggies, salumi, cheeses, the works).

All the food is served to you (kind of like Virgin's Galley).  They will load up a plate, though, so be prepared to tell the wonderful crew that you just want a taste/small amount.

I may have gone for a pre-dinner crab leg plate more than once before my 8 pm restaurant reservations. No regrets. Plenty of other stations are on offer with hot food (pizza, pasta, meat carvery etc.) but I stuck to my favourites.

**2. Space and design were perfection.**

The ship holds around 800 guests (we had 650) and feels airy, open, and calming. Infinity hot tubs are dotted around, and there are multiple pool areas, including a conservatory pool with a retractable roof and crazy-comfy loungers.

You’re never far from the sea; there’s glass everywhere and chairs that beg you to sit and stare at the view. Even indoor spaces like the aft lounge had jigsaws, a bar, games, and a lovely afternoon tea setup.

**3. Drinks included = bliss.**

I didn’t have to think about what I was spending. Champagne? Water? Fancy coffee? Done. The service was genuinely thoughtful. Someone was always there with whatever you needed, and it never felt forced or fake.

**4. Sakura (the Japanese restaurant) was a standout.**

I thought Silversea’s sushi bar was the best I’d have at sea. I was wrong. Sakura is open for lunch on port days and dinner with reservations. I would’ve happily eaten there every day. Beautiful food, super fresh, beautifully plated.

**5. Entertainment was a mixed bag.**

Live music was everywhere, which I loved: acoustic,  even some Irish folk music. But the evening theatre shows were not for me. Cruise classics, a Bee Gees/ABBA medley, and an audience participation segment (""everybody, get up and dance"" \*crickets\*) that I’m still trying to forget.

**6. Enrichment that actually felt enriching.**

One of the speakers was a former Fleetwood Mac tour manager with incredible stories. Another gave real, practical port talks that felt like insider travel tips, not just thinly veiled excursion sales pitches.

**7. Chill, no-rules luxury.**

There are no formal nights, no dress code rules after 6 pm, and no pressure to perform “luxury.” I wore white jeans to dinner and didn’t burst into flames. 

It’s the kind of place where you can be comfortable and still feel elevated. No gowns or tuxedos in sight. At night, people just dressed like they were going to a nice restaurant (no need to dress like it's 1980 on the QEII).

**8. Fellow passengers: not a frat party, not a retirement home.**

There were kids on board, yes, but they were quiet, usually with headphones and iPads. I saw one review on Cruise Critic from my sailing claiming it was a kid takeover, and I genuinely don’t know what ship they were on. The vibe was mostly relaxed, low-key, but elegant. I never felt out of place.

**Overall:**

For me, Explora nailed the balance. Virgin was too loud. Silversea was a bit too stiff. Explora II gave me amazing food, plenty of space, thoughtful design, and that feeling of being on holiday without needing a holiday afterwards.

It felt like I went to a really nice hotel that just happened to be floating. I don’t know what direction they’ll take in the future since they're pretty new (if they start chasing the family market hard, I might hesitate), but for now, it felt just right.

I'm a curious one though so I'm looking at Oceania and Azamara now if I can find a nice price. Variety is the spice of life, I guess?",8,1748288407.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

I have no idea what I'm doing, but so far have not been able to make one even tolerable cup. I bought a bag of Kirkland Organic Mexico Oaxaca beans (medium roast) for experimenting. 

I've tried to follow a bunch of different recommendations here but nothing is improving - and my palate must be super unsophisticated because I can't even tell if the taste is bitter or sour (it sort of tastes like a combination of the two). Whatever it is, it's awful. I've changed the grind, the body, the temperature, etc. etc. (I am a bit confused because people are saying to change the water volume 5 mls at a time - but if I'm supposed to be doing the dialing in with the Espresso drink, it only lets you change coffee volume, not the water volume.) I'm guessing that ultimately, the issue is the beans.

Anyhoo, I'm thinking of taking a different approach. I actually prefer milk drinks (my go-to is an iced vanilla latte, but I'm interested in any/all of the milk drinks the machine can make). In the wild my preference is dark roast, but I can't use that with this machine apparently.

For those of you who've succeeded in making milk drinks you love (or even just like) with the KF8...  
  
1. What beans are you using?

2. What settings are you using?

1kw3frz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kw3frz,The beauty of maple syrup! Decided to sample a few I picked up in the past year or so. It's crazy how drastically different they taste,"Pictured left to right:

1. Black Rooster Maple, Keene, NY, Grade A Amber
2. Rivermede Farm, Keene Valley, NY, Grade A Amber
3. Drop o' Gold, New Brunswick, Canada (Canada doesn't grade by color)
4. Sugar & Spice, Mendon, VT, Grade A Very Dark

Biggest surprise to me was #1 and #2 taste very different despite being produced 4 miles away and labelled as Amber. #1 tastes honestly pretty generic with nothing standing out particularly. #2 has this wonderfully nutty taste to and tastes phenomenal. When i bought #2, the sign in front of it in March indicated it was recently bottled.

Number 3 is interesting, almost a coffee esqe taste. I'm surprised it's the lightest color of the bunch. I bought this at a touristy farmers market type place in NB. I'm not sure if this is just generic maple syrup sourced from different places in NB, similar to what's you'd find in a US grocery store. I asked what grade/color it was and the woman told me ""whatever pops out of the trees comes out and they don't label it"".

Number 4 is amazing, incredibly dark. We purchased this in March 2024 when sugaring season just started for them. It was mentioned it was highly unusual to get syrup this dark at the start of the season. We got to taste this pretty much right when it was done (and cooled down).",1,1748288290.0,maplesyrup,0,1.0,False

1kw3edd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1kw3edd/how_do_you_get_into_your_groove/,How do you get into your groove?,"Hi Wattpad!!

Summer has finally arrived!! I’m happy, are you happy? 

I’ve got a question for you, how do you get into your groove?

I moved to the country awhile back, I have a large vast backyard and the best view of a gigantic mountain with literal twin peaks in the distance behind that. 

All I hear is birds chirping, I live on the main road to where you enter into my state, but other than that, it so beats city sounds and life *ANY DAY*. 

Speaking of which, all the sounds of nature; the birds, the hot sun, all put me in my groove. The silence of the air, the slight breeze, and the small chirps on the birds sing to me in a way that surprises me. 

Music is also another that helps put me in my groove, I like really fast paced bassy music that I will get lost in whilst I bob my head or listen to slow ambience music with nature singing in the background, at least inside. When I’m outside I don’t listen to much music, just listening to the music of life I guess. 

Also, to put me in my groove (one of the many ways which I will list a lot more of) and in one of the right headspace I love to smoke marijuana, and drink a couple of drinks. I don’t always drink but I most definitely will smoke some beforehand. 

Sitting out on my second yard (the first yard of mine is the front, my entire second big yard length is 4 acres, and my backyard is honestly the mountains. The property goes all the way back) I have a table and chair set up where I will post my dog and play with him. 

Being able to be free with my body, mind and spirit kind of helps me align me with my writing.

I also put myself in my groove when I will wait until everyone sleeps or wake up earlier than everyone, take a coffee and take my Oculus 2 VR headset and immerse myself for a couple of hours.

Lately I had been using YouTube to look up 360 and 180 degree videos, that specifically align with what I want to include in my stories, but specifically I have been using an app on there called; Worlds and discovered people have made dozens upon dozens of worlds that quite literally boost up my creative juices. 

People have created theme parks, malls, house parties, house carnivals, house theme parks, manors, mansions, houses that are from real houses, houses from other peoples imaginations, vacation lands, forest cabins, woods etc. 

The app literally has the Cullen house from the Twilight movies (I was a huge fan about ten years ago so being able to journey into the Cullen house was absolutely amazing).

I also have been using another app called; Theatre Elsewhere and this has 100+ pages of animations that you can immerse yourself into. Either choose slides or you can “free fly” and go wherever within this animation. 

It’s so so so cool and, all the ways I can immerse myself or put myself into the groove combined is the best feeling ever and the best way to immerse myself.

If you have a VR headset, would you do this? Do you already do this? 

Do you smoke or drink a little before typing or writing out chunks of paragraphs at a time? 

Do you listen to nature? 

Do you listen to music? What kind of music? 

So with all that, thank you to those who stuck around and read through all that, what about you? 

What do you do?

Backstory: My girlfriend and I got together sophomore year of high school. It was amazing for years but she definitely showed signs of mental health issues and parents that were non affectionate with each other and in an odd relationship. We graduated high school and about 5-8 months later we moved in to a house with our friends who are married now. It was amazing for a few months and then she wanted to move but nobody else did and she wanted to get a place with just her and I but we couldn’t find anything in our price range and our roommates would have had to find a place as well. Eventually she grew away from me. Started turning the other way in bed and not wanted to cuddle or hold hands or be happy. She forced her way out of the lease and left the 3 of us to hold the bag for the rest of the year. I don’t even know what to do then. She left our room completely empty despite saying “I need my own space to decorate and have how I want it”. She moved into a 1 room apartment down the road that she’s paying double what we payed for our house and 3 acres on the river. 

She moved out a little over a week ago and we haven’t talked. It’s probably the longest we haven’t talked in almost 6 years. It’s been really hard being lonely. I love her so much. She’s the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen. And so comforting to me. I love everything about her except her constant attempts to dwell on everything bad that’s happened or what about her life she doesn’t like, such as the house. I want her and our future family to be with me when I die. By my side or even just in my thoughts. I miss waking up to the smell of her hair, and waiting for her to wake up and crawl on top of me. 

Anyways, I could go on but I won’t. She works at a coffee shop in the next town over. I was thinking about going to ask her out for a date to her favorite restaurant. But I don’t know if it’s a good idea. Or if I should wait longer. I understand her wanting her own space and I’ve accepted that fact that she’s not going to be there when I get home. But I want her in my life so bad. Even just to text about our day again and come over whenever. I just wish it was different. I trusted that she loved me and wanted to talk to me. I hope she feels similar to me. Lmk what you think or don’t. It just felt good to write this.

Sometimes I’ll make meals, like steak and potatoes, but that’s usually once a week. The rest of the week id only eat one or two packs of crackers and some coffee. People around me have noticed and keep making comments about how skinny I look or that I hardly eat anything. My coworkers have even tried helping me get back to eating which is really embarrassing. I’ve lost a lot of hair and the rest is brittle. My nails are a different texture, I feel lethargic all the time, etc. 

I’m trying really hard to eat three meals a day. I started a few days ago, been mainly salads and vegetables. I am keeping a photo diary of it all too. The problem I’m having is my stomach has been hurting a LOT and I’m incredibly bloated. It’s very uncomfortable. The rest of my body feels refreshed except for that area. Does this go away eventually? Will I gain weight and have this bloating forever even if I’m eating healthy? Any advice on what to do better/transition back into eating? I’m going to the doctor soon so I hope to get more help there but I’ve never fallen so hard into an eating disorder before. ",1,1748287963.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

1kw3a03,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1kw3a03/that_time_i_met_atrioc/,That time I met Atrioc.,"It was a rather faithful Thursday evening, as I was walking down Atlanta in need for a refreshment. I stumbled onto a local coffee shop shop with a mermaid as it‘s logo.
I was manic to see the sight of such beautiful refreshments. I lined up, wanting to order a coffee. Suddenly I saw a familiar face in front of me.
Eyes bright, body white with black dots: It was my favorite streamer, Atrioc the coffe cow. I was surprised to see him in line, because I always assumed the coffee he drank came out of his body.
I asked him about this saying:
„Glizzy, Glizzy. Mr Ewing, what are you doing in the coffee line? Doesn‘t your body naturally produce coffee?“, putting my hand in front of him, ready for a handshake.
„Glizzy, Glizzy, Glizzy. Please, put your hand away. I don‘t want you infect you with my Glizzy hands.“, he began to answer. „It is actually a common misconception that my body is producing coffee natural. I am actually just a cow for coffee and only produce milk. I still need to buy the bean water myself.“

This shocked me. I have always assumed he was a coffee cow and not only a cow for coffee. I wanted to capture the moment, with a photo to post it on the subreddit, but then suddenly Dr. Carbonation entered the establishment, which prompted Atrioc to enter a state of pure shock. You could see the light leave his eyes, as it got replaced by a thousand-yard-stare.
I wanted to bring him back to normal, so I promptly grabbed a bottle of water and put it in his hands. He held it effortlessly, as his hands were truly massive and resembled the size of thick Glizzys.

Atrioc didn’t move. I shouted „GLIZZY GLIZZY GLIZZY GLIZZY GLIZZY“, which led him to snap back into reality. He started drinking the water and looked thankfully at me, saying: „Moooh. Glizzy Glizzy Glizzy“ with a smile on his face. 
Then suddenly a police officer, also standing in the line, turned around and saw the bottled water in the cows hands. 

This ended in the glizzlords arrest, but due to an ongoing legal triel I cannot provide more details unfortunately. But let me just mention that someone with Glizzy hands was about to eat his own fingers due to Glizzy-withdrawal, which is a serious illness and of which I do not want to heard any jokes about, but he then got stoped by handcuffs. 
Furthermore I must mention that the rumor that the coffee cow uses it’s own milk to sweeten his coffee is actually true. It‘s actually quite understandable if you put yourself in a cows shoes.

Months ago they hired this older lady in her 50s and I was assigned to train her. She simply refused saying she knows everything and was trying style things her way and not come to an agreement. We had a new boss and I am pretty sure they knew each other.. he started siding with her. She was so mad at first that I was full-time and she was part-time. Tried to sabotage me by saying lies hoping to get me fired and then she would act all nice and sweet around me. She told our boss that I am trying to hook her up with male coworkers and ruin her marriage amd started to cry hysterically... I ended up getting written up by him. 

The boss guy ended up giving her double shifts and getting like 60 hours a week on average when nobody else has that many hours there. She is obsessed with the job, she doesn't mind coming in for like 2 hours. Last week she worked 7 days. I heard she's even coming in on her days off and a manager told me before how she would call all of the managers on her day off asking if she can come in. She tries to become friends with every employee by doing them favors. Like she cut the hair of a coworker. Or she gives free food and beverages to coworkers when we are not allowed to. I told her before we can't do that, it reached to a point where employees would abuse it and ask for 3747473837 free stuff. She yelled at me saying I have no compassion and I am a bad person. Management found out and sent an email that we can't be handing away free stuff but she keeps doing it.

We were not working as much together anymore and sadly someone quit, so now I see her more. She was acting all nice and of course I dont fall for it because she was making up so many lies about me and telling management and believed her. Our boss was fired so she is negative about him now, she says she was always on my side and he would talk bad about me and nonsense. 

So I am an immigrant and for more than a month, she keeps mentioning that Trump will deport me and they are coming for me. She acts as if she is worried. Sadly another employee who is similar to her has made such 'jokes'. She tried to tell me something and I didn't understand what she was saying and snapped at me. She was trying to say a name that I thought it was pronounced differently (it was a Spanish name) and she told me she is American, she doesn't pronounce it like Mexicans do, so I better understand. (I am European btw)
She has continued saying that. The other day she said it around guests. The guests looked at me and said they have my support. I told the coworker I am a citizen and she replied to me, You wish you were born here, you are not. 

Later on, I made a joke with coworkers asking them why they ask for so much coffee to make for them. She heard that and she got mad and said ""Really? Wtf is wrong with you?""
I defended myself and told her why does she make comments and she makes me feel uncomfortable especially when she makes deportation comments. She snapped at me started screaming and called me a bitch and went back to the kitchen and started crying to workers saying she can't work with a bitch like me. And after 10 minutes she was acting all nice around me. 


She has also targeted two other girls who work in another area. She said one of the managers is gonna become the new boss and she has told him which people to fire and how she can't stand those two girls, they are so conceited and greedy and lazy and will get fired next. She calls lazy anyone who does not stay to finish something after clocking out. (We only get 6 hours shifts and have to leave ASAP due to penalty meal break)
Called me lazy for not cutting fruit and washing dishes when I am a server... I don't mind washing some dishes but I dont know how to use knives and she tries to do others work too to be seen as better. 

I emailed HR all of this but I dont expect much. We have this chef who had employees taking him to HR for a year and nothing happened. Chef made a lot of racial slurs and got away with it, while employees quit. And this lady has been getting away with a lot, she backstabs people to management and acts as if they can trust her and want the best for the hotel.

# By Oliver Kane

#  

IT BEGAN FOR HIM ON the night of July fifth. He had cleaned, of course, but still found bits of paper and plastic wrappers—those ripped from the bodies of small fireworks—on the concrete footing of the backyard, and he still almost caught a whiff of their hot sulfurous odor from within his house and backyard and from those of his neighbors. He knew it wasn’t really there, that it was only a particularly persistent memory, and in truth it was only *almost* a smell, yet he disliked it. Those wafts of an almost organic odor.

There had never been a woman in his house—not one that stayed and gave it a “touch”, anyhow. His longest relationship (more often than not, these things could only be called encounters) had lasted perhaps two months, and he had only invited her to stay a handful of times; most of their encounters had been at her place. On the surface, he had not quite driven her away, but of course, he had. To both of them, it had seemed more a mutual diversion of desire, both physical and emotional, but of course, it was even more mutual on his end. It could be seen in his house, in its decorum and cleanliness, that it did not particularly *need* a woman’s touch. All things had their place, and all were in them. He allowed no pets in for longer than a few hours. No smoking, of course, save for in the backyard. No children to run and break things, to spill on the carpet, to track in dirt and mud and trouble. Clean, it was—tidy and ordered and right.

But that smell…somehow, it was persistent. Somehow, the zipping and spinning colored firebombs and the crackling faux dynamite and the rocketing tubes of the previous day were still there in that smell. Odd, it was, but not yet alarming.

He had a meal of steak—blue rare—Potatoes Romanoff, asparagus sautéed in butter, and a deep crimson Pinot noir. He ate in silence save for his chewing and the clink of fork and knife on white china. His thoughts went around and about, though lazily, as sated as his mouth and stomach were. It was not until he was washing up and putting all the dishes he’d used away that he noticed them, for then, they were naught but seen. In that first moment, they did not itch, nor did they have any texture. Yet, they were there: six orange-red dots on the heel of his right hand, nestled between the two shallow creases that descended from the middle of his palm and nearly connected where his hand ended and the wrist began. The dots had a pattern that was almost that of a star shape, a pentagram, arranged around one slightly larger one in their center.

He cocked his head, idly wrapping the towel in his other hand about the silver ring it always hung on. Using the index finger of his other hand, he rubbed at the series of dots. They did not smear, as if they were some spattering of juice from his steak or errant red wine, nor did they have any depth or protrusion, as blemishes upon the skin would have had. There was no deep itch of irritation, no localized warmth of inflammation that would have given them their color. They were only a flat, really only vaguely colored pattern on his skin, perhaps a quarter-inch across. He took the area of flesh between his thumb and index and squeezed lightly. No tactility, no pain, no shifting of puss or blood underneath.

Despite having cleaned his hands with soap and hot water already, he put them under again. Pale pink hand soap turned to a slick white froth under his scrutiny, and steam rose in light rivulets from the sink and brought a clean and fruity aroma to his nose; yet even after almost a minute, the spots remained, unaltered. Whatever they were, they were insoluble. Not dirt, not grease, not anything but dots. An allergic reaction then? Something he had touched in the last hours, some insect that had crawled into his bed and tasted of him? The thought concerned him, more for the concept of an infestation, rather even than the molesting of his person, unseen until now, until these…dots. And what would make such marks, anyway? What pincers or stinger would, with their jabbing, produce such a pattern?

A resurgence of that acrid smell—that of spent fireworks—saved him from further thought. More frustrated now at its phantom persistence, he flicked water from his hands and snatched at the towel, twisting his hands within it and peering around his kitchen with narrowed eyes. Nose forward and flared, the dots briefly forgotten, he sought out the odor. He looked in the trash cans, both interior and exterior, in the shrubbery that bound his backyard, near and under the patio chairs and table, even in the charcoal grill. He did this all with a small flashlight, as the sun had gone again from the world, and he did it with that smell growing somehow stronger with each avenue checked and rechecked.

No charred stub of sparkler or firecracker. Not even an excessive amount of residue where they had set the cardboard tube launchers. Nothing. The smell was simply everywhere, with no discernable origin to be cleaned. He locked his doors, turned off his lights, and ascended his stairs to shower and find his bed.

The water fell over him, hot and wonderful, and it drew from his skin dried sweat, dirt, dust, particulate, and dead cells. Oil came off, and sweet-smelling lotion went on, for that moment pushing away the smell, and he came from the tub a new man, clean and relaxed and flexible, like a freshly steamed felt hat, ready to be reformed perfectly.

That was, save for the star of red-orange dots that had faltered not a whit with his cleansing.

For a long time, he stood in front of the mirror, bathroom door ajar on the dark upstairs hallway, steam and light flooding out, naked as the day he was born, only staring at those dots and prodding at them. Their color had deepened, though whether of their own accord or only with the ubiquitous subcutaneous flush of his skin, he did not know. And was there something more there now? Was there that itch he had expected? The buzz of one’s body sending a signal of wrongness?

He could not tell.

He read from a medical text for a while by lamplight, sitting in his bed with the pillows propped behind his back, consciously dismissive of the dots on his hand each time he turned a page. In truth, the words on the pages went in the front of his head and exited the back, unchanged, uninterpreted, but he did not draw the pages back and reread; he didn’t even think to.

At some point, he turned out the light, pulled the coverlet up, and rolled onto his side, his left hand rubbing at the palm of his right. There was no light to see the dots, and they grew no texture for his fingers to feel as he fell into the grip of torpor, yet still he saw them as they had first appeared: that flash of red-orange color against his skin. That image remained even as the world of his mind fell from boiling grey cloud into sparkling yellow-shot night and then into the ever-present black void of sleep.

 

He is twelve again. He is small and pale and indrawn, yet he is quick of body and mind. He is about the task never taught him, never shown him, yet that he is so proficient in and that so engrosses him. He has found the wounded albino rat, its two hind legs made limp and useless by a passing car or an angry stamping foot, or perhaps by some degenerative disease unknown even to rats. It squeaks and wriggles as he grasps it by its hard whipping tail, as he runs with it to an even more secluded place. Its beady red eyes know not his plans nor his own inner workings; they know only that the rat has been harmed and that it will be harmed further. And for all that it is broken and defunct, it fights on, and he is only saved from its sharp infected teeth by his thin yet robust leather gloves.

It fights on as he cleans his work area, as he lays it back and uses the nails to pin its legs, both working and not, to the stump of the tree. It fights on, for a time, as he goes to work with the scalpel. Yet, just as all other subjects he has had, as all else he has tried, its entirety falls as limp and useless as its hind legs; its eyes darken from a bright scarlet to a crimson like drying blood; its head hangs and blood drips from the incision he made, matting its hair and bringing a soft pink to its paleness. And he only stares at it, black eyes locked on its red ones, having seen the death and now only looking for the rest, for the after…but of course, there is no after. There hasn’t been thus far, not in any of his subjects. There is only this draining, this egress of a life that he himself does not seem to feel.

He cuts the head from the rat carefully, dismembers it otherwise, and places the head first in a small plastic bag and then into the case with his tools. It is as he clips the black leather case closed, that he sees the dots on his palm. It is then that some part of him knows this to be a dream, a look into a childhood rife with frustrations, confusions, dark urges, and naught else. It is with those dots that his mind comes up and forward, forward through his adolescence and his growth toward the dichotomy, the face man and the inner man. For all that it is a twelve-year-old boy with a rat’s blood staining his fingers that peers at those dots, it is also a man of twice that age looking at slowly dilating black cavities, red around their rims with not his blood, but with some thin alien fluid that freezes and burns in the same moment, that lays into him a black prickling numbness while causing also a bone-deep ache.

The child snatches the scalpel and begins to cut.

 

He awoke with a start and with a fear hitherto unknown to him, evident in the sweat that lay in slick sheets on his skin and his quick drawing of breath. Immediately, he was aware of the sharp pain in his right palm, and his other hand flew to it, rustling the coverlet in its haste and bringing a waft of hot fear-smelling air to his nose. What had been sharp pain, however, was now a dull thumping with the same rhythm of his heart, and his prodding was met not with the gashes he had expected, but only what he knew to be those dots, now six hardly distinguishable lumps, like a tiny nest of ready pimples. He tested them with his fingers, emitting a whimper unlike any sound he had ever produced, and then, with a shaking hand, he reached for the bedside lamp.

Squinting at the light and sitting up, his eyes were met with that same star shape he had seen hours before, though now grown in diameter by perhaps an eighth of an inch, the dots orange-red color now rosier, more filled with blood. Like acne, the dots had grown heads that stood just underneath his flesh, though where the heads of pimples were almost always white, these were jet black and taught, like minuscule drops of crude oil administered by the head of a pin.

Like a spider’s eyes….

He sat and stared at them for a while, noting the ache of the area, and the itch that was more mental than physical: a need to touch and squeeze them, a need to test them. Finally, he did so, grasping the amalgam between index and thumb and squeezing, lightly at first, but with more vigor when met with little more pain and no visible change. With a grunt, two of the six popped with equal pain and relief. A black ooze pooled around the other four blemishes, and he squeezed harder, his face scrunching. The rest popped, nearly audibly, and that black liquid dripped down into the crease where his wrist met his hand and slicked the squeezing fingers of his left hand, staining everything like ink. He only sat and breathed, lightly flexing the hand with the dots that were now holes. Those holes…they themselves seemed to pulse with the beat of his heart. Not only did he see the flesh around them thumping minutely from his attack, but the cavities themselves seemed to breathe, to bleed that black ichor. An insect bite, as he suspected…surely. It had crawled in the night before, while he slept, or perhaps even earlier, and with some movement of his, had felt threatened enough to lash out and bite him, loosing some venom or poison that had only now been dealt with.

He was not sickened easily, or often, and only achieved that emotion with threats to his own body’s well-being, or to the order and organization of the things he deemed within his control. He felt it now, however, for this was both.

The oil washed mostly away under a stream of hot water in the bathroom sink, but there continued an oozing of it from the offending cavities, a slow welling in and spilling over from each, and yet more as he squeezed. It did not seem that the flow would stop; it only continued to darken the flowing water. Whatever it was, whatever had worked its way under his skin and had now been expunged, smelled. It stank, in truth, filling his nose, quite volatile despite its lack of volume. It stank like…well, he wasn’t sure just what it was like. It was somewhat like blood, yet somewhat not, somewhat, indeed, like motor oil, yet not really that, either. More than either, it was a burned smell, a used explosives smell.

He stopped what had been monotonous and nearly thoughtless squeezing and cleaning of the holes. It was not easy to stop, but he did, instead planting the heels of both hands to the sides of the sink and forcing his head upward and outward. He closed his eyes and drew in breath ten times. Ten slow breaths that made up perhaps thirty seconds in all. The tension fell from his shoulders and hands and jaw, the sound of the water was now more calming, where before it had been goading, and the smell fell a bit from the air, or at least seemed to. There was still pain in his right hand, an ache truly up into the wrist now, yet he surmised it was mostly from his own constant prodding.

A normally prudent and intelligent man did not allow such fancies as had been running through his mind—the phantom smell, the holes breathing, the holes bleeding something that wasn’t of his body—to dominate his world. A man like that, a man like him, forced such superstitious thoughts and impulses back; they were for the lower beasts, both animal and “human”; they were not for the likes of him: the experimenter, the scientist. The surgeon.

He had to think…properly and concisely. He took more deep breaths. Whatever it was, the majority was cleared from his flesh. He would have to apply some ointment, perhaps, and bandage it, but in a few days the punctures would be no more, and that buzzing ache would be no more.

He applied the ointment, triple antibiotic, then covered it with gauze and wrapped his hand in flexible water-resistant tape. It was much too tight at first and squeezed almost painfully when flexed. He peeled it back one layer and reapplied it. All the while, he tried not to look at the holes he was covering up, tried not to really see them, and as first the gauze and then the tape darkened like tiny growing thunderheads, he tried not to see that, either. He put the sight of it and the feel of it—still painful, but more than that, prickling, *crawling*—out of his mind, as far away from him as was possible.

It was still deeply black outside his windows, and with the interior lights off, he was drenched in that blackness. It was still only three thirty-eight AM, as told by his digital bedside clock, and though he lay down and curled in on himself, as was most comfortable, he did not sleep again that morning. He finally gave up on trying to at about four forty-five, rising and flicking on lights as he went down to start coffee. He’d programmed it to begin its boiling and dripping at five thirty, but now he bypassed it, and soon coffee was bubbling and dripping, the only sound to break the silence of the prematurely lit world.

Coffee did not help, nor did the sun. His day was spent in a haze whose like was unknown to him, a haze of childlike thoughts, and indeed thoughts of his childhood: unbidden recollections of experiments and dodged authorities, both of which had the texture of reality more than memory. They were quite nearly physical manifestations of sound and image and thought. Where before he pondered not on clues and evidence left, on other’s routes of investigation and profiling, now he did. While seeking out the stench of spent fireworks, while drawing in yet more of it with each and every breath, and while digging with fingernails at the bandage and his darkening wrist and not alleviating that frantic buzz, that itch that was further beneath his skin than any bone or vein or lymphatic vessel, he sought out the origin of the odor. His actions and his paranoia were fueled equally by the images of old bodies burned in shallow graves, leaving only parts and organs and appendages to the world, and by the cursed stench that filled the air, that filled the world. They knew who he was and what he was. His neighbors with their grins as fake as his own, yet mimed out of fear rather than loathing, his coworkers with their laconic, reserved speech only around him, his adversaries the police detectives, his adversaries the incurious and impassive sheep of the world—those who knew not the depth of life, nor had the capacity to take it and revel in its taking—his adversaries the normal; they all knew, for he had left something astray, left something out and open to the scrutinous eye of the world. He had let them in, and they had taken their use of him, had impelled, with their venom-dripping fangs, a curse upon his body and mind. They had all come in and put holes in his story, holes in his order. Holes in his body.

In both the digging into his flesh and the uprooting of his ordered home, he found nothing but a further itch, yet the pain of both mixed with the pleasure of digging, of exploring, of routing out the invaders who had planted evidence of spent powder and decaying flesh. Laughter bubbled and flew from him, his mumbling turned to shouts at phantoms. His breath came hard and ragged and quick, and still the stench of all his burned experiments was wrung from the very air, and still the clattering of their blackened bones berated his mind.

It was with the movement within him that he was brought back to some semblance of reality, brought back to the sights and sounds and smells and textures of the present. It was a writhing unmotivated by any impulse of muscle, any jolting of tendon. With breath and heart quickened to the pace of a sprinter, with lungs so choked by that stench as to be asthmatic, he looked down at his hands, one with its nails blackened and sticky with blood, adhesive, and a black jelly; the other half-curled and trembling. The holes had grown to encompass half of his palm, each the diameter of a dime, though cavernous and shiny black rather than flat and silver, and still they made that pattern on his flesh: a star around a larger central hole. His mouth was as open and as cavernous as each, his tongue a fat, lazy rat between his teeth. He found, for a wonder and for the first time in his life, that there were tears in his eyes, bringing a shimmer to the image. Blinking, he looked on, and as his vision cleared, he saw the culprit of that movement, that writhing.

Rising slowly from within those pulsing holes in his palm, beginning only as dots of grey-white, were thick worm-like things with bulbous, slightly conical heads, like gargantuan spermatozoa. They were smooth and pallid, almost fleshless, marred not with veins, tubes, mouths, or eyes, and they danced in their homes in his flesh, swirling and knocking at the sides of the holes, swaying like snakes, or indeed like worms testing the air for moisture. The one in the center, just as its hole, was larger by a noticeable degree, though it was no different otherwise. They rose and grew until they filled the holes, plugging them with their tear-drop heads and only continuing to writhe. Christ, he could feel it, could feel them, from the surface of his flesh, down into his wrist and perhaps further. It seemed, with any minute movement of his fingers and the subsequent movement of the tendons and ligaments within his forearm, that the area was fuller than it should have been, as if packed with almost twice its intended volume of meat and blood.

There was a sound coming from him, a low whimpering groan that began deep in his lungs and rose outward, turning quickly to a hoarse shout. For another moment, he only stared, another shout brewing and boiling in him, and as it came forth, he grasped with a shaking hand the center worm by its head. It was as unyielding as a hard rubber tube, and tried to dart back at his touch, though with a frantic pinching, he was able to keep it in tow. With short, staccato screams now, high-pitched calls like a wounded dog’s yipping, he yanked at the worm. It wouldn’t come; the shape of its head wedged it in the rim of the cavity. He yanked harder, and with a slight tearing of flesh and a flash of white-hot pain, it came out enough that he could get his fingers around the stem-like body of it. The others slunk backward, seeming to coil up an inch within, bulging his wrist as if it were horribly inflamed. Pulling now as if cinching a knot, the muscles of his left arm bulging and shivering, he felt something deep in his right forearm pop and let go. In the same moment, the worm came free and began immediately to wither and grow limp, drying up and curling as if left out beneath a desert sun to bake. He dropped it on the floor and, still screaming—though now with a glee in violence like some ancient hominid, almost a hooting—he stamped on it over and over. It was like stepping on a thick rope, and it rolled under his foot, emitting the dry crackling of a snake’s shed skin.

He had to get at the others, had to pull them all out by their alien roots and see them wither and die. That, and that alone, would relieve him of this horror. Yet they knew, and they had hidden themselves in his flesh. For all that they had no eyes or mouths or noses or ears, somehow—by some telepathy, perhaps—they knew their host to be an ungenerous one and had retreated. They still writhed in there, however: worms wriggling, snakes slithering.

He started for the kitchen, stepping over the upturned chairs and table in his dining room, over two plants knocked free of their pots and uprooted from their soil, over all his ordered things turned out of their rightful places in cabinets and drawers and shelves, turned out and strewn about the floor. What he sought had been in a drawer across from the range, tucked away along with digital thermometers and other such kitchen implements. Clenching and unclenching his fists, hatefully aware of the burning itch beneath those holes, his heaving breath coming through clenched teeth, he searched and kicked through the mess. Finally, he found it and bent to swipe it from the floor.

A butane kitchen torch, for searing crème brulée or charring vegetables…or popping the heads of rancid alien invaders. With his left hand, he held it, turning the little knob on the back and pushing it in to light it with his right. The gas hissed out, flashed blue and went out once, twice, thrice, and then shot into life on the fourth click. He gazed at it for a moment, hearing that little roar of fire and feeling a smile crawl up his face at that blazing blue cone, tipped with a sputtering orange-white ring at its front, like a little dragon. Then he began to breathe quickly through his mouth, shaped as if to whistle. He had to do it, and before he lost his nerve.

He felt the glow of heat much before that sputtering blue tip of fire touched his flesh, yet he pressed on. There was a small sound coming from the holes in his flesh, like the churning of some thick fluid or like the simmering of a sauce. They had to come out. The temperature just under his skin, where they held themselves, must have been in the hundreds now, for his wrist was bubbling and blackening. The pain was horrid, unimaginable, and exquisite, yet he pressed on. His left eye twitched uncontrollably, his teeth were bared to the gums, and he could feel something in his right hand—the nerves in there, he was sure—crying out, but also dying, popping in the heat like kernels of corn.

More suddenly than he would have thought possible, the small desperate writhing that was each of those worms shying away from the heat ceased. He threw the torch—still lit—into the sink; he could deal with it in a few minutes, and it would not hurt the steel too badly. He had done it! The palm of his right hand was a black ruin, charred and bubbling and already curling in on itself like a dead spider, and those holes curled outward, cracked and mushroomed like the exit holes of large caliber bullets…but he had done it. Those things were dead in his flesh now, likely drying up as the first one had done. He could pluck them out and bandage himself. He had beaten them.

There was a sort of sucking, a vacuous inward movement as fast as an opening airlock. Five nearly distinct lengths of something, like flexible rods, shot down his wrist as he looked on and shouted in surprise. He felt them burrowing and wriggling up his arm, marked at each further inch by a ring-like engorging of flesh and a growing flare of agony. His torso and shoulders tensed instinctively and immediately, yet the rest of him went limp for a second, and he fell onto the edge of the sink, grunting and gritting his teeth against the pain. Further and further, they burrowed, up into his elbow now, following no easy path; they were ripping through muscle and fat and sinew, one curling around and between the heads of his biceps. The pain was utterly wild, unlike anything he had ever experienced. Alternately babbling to himself and screaming at the invaders within him, he shot his eyes frantically around, found what he sought, and moved left, snatching the long knife from its nestled place amid others in a wooden block. It was for the carving of meat, thin enough to be dexterous and sharp enough to move like liquid around fat and sinew and silver skin. It was hand forged and polished to a near mirror shine. It was perfect for the job.

They were nearly up to his shoulder now, spread almost equally around the circumference of his arm. With a cry, he slashed with the blade at the lump on his anterior deltoid. It dug in almost half an inch and would have hit bone if not for sticking halfway into the hard rubber-like body of the alien worm. As it was, he had to tug it free of his flesh. He had hit it, but the thing still writhed onward, faster now. He cursed it and slashed again, harder and with better aim. Twin rivers of crimson began to flow and drip from his raised arm, but that lump had stopped. He could feel and see it shrivel up under his skin, but he wasted no time in revelry. There were still four in him, two almost to his back, one with its head just past the upper connection of the medial deltoid. And one currently in his armpit. He chose to strike at the last, for he surmised it meant to dig into his abdomen, perhaps the chest cavity or the lungs. In truth, they all were on that path, but that one was the furthest along. He swiped twice, knowing he had to aim by feel, and with each, he shouted in mingled pain and ecstasy. They wouldn’t get into him, not deeper. That one took three slashes to wither and die, and he wasn’t sure if he had hit the head; it could have been into his lung already for the hot breadth of pain on his right side. He went for the uppermost worm next, and despite turning the top of his shoulder into a field of ragged red furrows, that one and the two on his back evaded him fully. They had made their trek and had sunk themselves deep again, like diving leviathans.

They were in him. Moving in him.

Screaming, he attempted to tear his shirt open. With only one working hand, and that one holding a blood-dripping knife, it took four tries before the buttons popped and his flesh was revealed. He could no longer see them, yet his eyes followed their paths all the same. One punctured his right lung from behind, and he could only tear impotently at the air. He began to splutter and cough, wet with blood that splattered from his mouth, as another of the worms found its way into some part of his lower abdomen, perhaps the intestine. The last, as he choked on blood and pounded his chest with his ruination of a hand, wormed its way closer to his heart, perhaps knowing its importance and perhaps not, for he felt it there, a physical thing curled against his hammering heart, yet it did not burrow in and end him immediately.

He would die; he knew it for a certainty. Already, pints of his blood had made a thick and slippery puddle on the floor. He had not taken a breath in seconds, and he would take no more unless he could plug up the lung. And that worm beside his heart would at some point grow bored, more likely curious, and bore through it, using the blood-slick arteries like a series of subway trains to the rest of his body. And would they mate? Would they spawn asexually an army of themselves to, at some point, grow from red-orange dots to cavities and then to grey-white worms whose rubbery skin could secrete an acid that dissolved flesh, like “piranha solution”? Were there already a few million eggs throughout his body, only waiting? Yes, he was sure of it all.

He held the knife in front of him, the quivering tip pointed toward his chest. He would die. Yet was it better to choke on his own blood or to be disemboweled by them or to have his heart popped…or to put the knife through the worm and through his aorta? Was this to be the last experiment, the ultimate one? Was he to find the after in his own heart? There was only one way to find out.

He took one more moment to aim, then plunged the knife.

 

**From the journal of Corporal Lee Warner, Markov County Police:**

 

 

*I wanted to be a writer, you know. I never was much good at it, and it never really took root, but it was fun. A lot more fun than this bullshit, I’ll say that. I guess that’s why I journal rather than go down to Monty’s and get sloppy six days a week like all the other “LEOs”. No Monty’s for me. Too expensive. And I’m like George Thorogood, anyway; I drink alone. Right here at home. Better that way. Better than being pulled over hours past midnight.*

*“You been drinking tonight, sir?”*

*“Hey, that’s my line!”*

*Yep, never really took root.*

*Long day today. I think when most people think about police detectives, they see some motherfucker in a trench coat, his glowing cigarette shielded from the downpour by his fedora, on the trail of some crazy bastard killer. And, of course, that motherfucker is the best detective out there. He does things his own damn way, and the brass hates his methods, but by Christ does he get shit done. He’s almost as crazy as the killer he’s chasing, but he’s got a weird sort of charisma and, of course, he gets the girl…. Fake shit. Storybook shit. (“Ooh, aren’t we bitter tonight?” “Fuck off and die.”) The job’s boring mostly in reality. Reports, reports, reports. File the evidence. Take the call. Drink the coffee. Eat the doughnut. Beat the wife, hardy-har-har.*

*Today, though. Today sucked the big one. Another thing they don’t really tell you about crime scene investigation: it fucking smells, man. Today it was…let’s see: piss, shit, burned hair, burned cloth, burned flesh—oh, and blood. So much god damn blood. I can still smell it over my own breath…and you could light a fire on the latter. The fire department called us after the neighbors called them, having seen smoke coming from the place. I guess I can be thankful for that. Otherwise, we’d have been called after the fucker plumped up with gas and then popped, stinking up the entire fucking neighborhood. Silver linings, Lee. Always the silver linings.*

*Suicide, undoubtedly. A pretty gruesome one, but I’ve seen worse. This guy, a surgeon (blind man could see the irony there) first burned the absolute shit out of his hand, then went about cutting his god damn arm off, fucking shanked himself, and then died falling into the sink where he had tossed the still-lit torch, turning himself into something of a pyre. Kind of funny if you don’t have to deal with it.*

*The house was torn up, but there was no sign of a break-in, and all his wounds seem to be self-inflicted, though we’ll have a better picture after the autopsy comes back in a few days. There were two odd things, however: almost perfectly round puncture wounds on the burned hand, and a grey-white powder in the air. Everywhere, like concrete dust almost. There was a pile of it on the floor, and there were more than just traces in the guy’s body. The lab might come back with something on it, but who knows. Doubt it matters, anyway; it wasn’t coke or anything.*

*Can’t say why he did it, not really, but it’s a good thing he did. Sounds bad, I know, but it’s the God’s honest. We were looking upstairs, and there was this custom cabinet sort of built in to the back of his closet. Cracked the lock and found some pictures. Drum roll please…kiddie porn and dead, partially dissected bodies, some adult, some the same kids he made pose. The two-for-one deal. The meal deal. Found the Polaroid the pictures were taken with, a small scalpel that one of our guys says is at least a decade old, and a dried rat’s head. We’ll probably find some body parts in his backyard or in some storage container. Fucking Hell, what a job.*

*Well, I’m gonna go kiss the bottle and then kiss Sally, try to forget a little.*

*Ah, for the life of a writer!*

 

*p.s. I saw something after dinner. There’s a little pattern of red-orange dots on my skin, right above my left clavicle. They don’t itch, but they won’t wash off, either. Odd.*

this will be long – and messy – but the background is important. If you’ve ever had a family member violate your trust, pretend nothing happened, and then watched everyone blame you for drawing a boundary… you’ll get it.

Also, English isn’t my first language, so thanks for your patience.

I (33F) live in a developed country. Years ago, my mom and I moved here from a poorer country with political and economic instability. We had the legal right to citizenship due to ancestry, so we started over here. It was hard, but we made it work.

Later on, we helped other relatives move too – including my cousin “Lisa” (27F at the time). She was in a tough spot back home, and we wanted to help. We sent money, paid for her flight, gave her a chance. She moved in with our aunt.

But immediately, something felt off.

Lisa didn’t speak the language, didn’t have her paperwork ready, but she was instantly on Tinder – going out with random men constantly. One time, she told us she was going out for a walk and ended up taking a 45-minute train to another city to meet a guy – without telling anyone, and stayed overnight.

Yes, she’s an adult. But in our culture, when you live with family and they’re supporting you and also responsible for you, you let them know where you are. It’s not about control. It’s about respect and safety. My aunt and mom were panicking.

The other thing is: her legal status was extremely fragile at that time.

She had only entered the country on a tourist visa, and we were still waiting for her long-term paperwork to come through. The documents were delayed because the caseworker at the local immigration office had called in sick. So for three days, she was technically in the country illegally – and instead of lying low and staying safe, she was out in unfamiliar places, late at night, with strangers from the internet.

If the police had stopped her or checked IDs, it wouldn’t have just affected her – they could’ve traced her back to my mother’s address, questioned my family, and potentially caused serious problems for all of us.

And the worst part? She lied about it. She told my aunt she was just going for a short walk. In reality, she went to a dam at night with some Tinder guy – no documents, no protection, nothing but risk. She knew the situation. We had asked her not to go out until things were clear. She did it anyway.

Luckily nothing happened and she got her papers one week later.

But since this kind of thing kept happening, we thought maybe a change of scenery would help. Lisa came to my place for a weekend – along with my mom and another cousin visiting from abroad. I lived in a small 2.5-room apartment. With four people, it was pure chaos: air mattresses, no space, furniture shoved aside.

After they left, I noticed 40 bucks were missing. I figured I misplaced it in the mess and let it go.

What I didn’t know: my mom was already suspicious.

A few months later, Lisa and my mom stayed at my place again while I was away on business. My mom was watching my dog. During the stay, she noticed Lisa spending unusually long amounts of time in the bathroom – but never showering.

Smoking is strictly forbidden in my home because I have asthma and severe allergies. My mom began to suspect Lisa was secretly smoking in there – which would’ve been dangerous for my health.

One day, after Lisa had been in the bathroom again, my mom looked around and saw that Lisa’s toiletry bag looked fuller than before. Out of concern (and yes, suspicion), she opened it (not cool – we know) – thinking maybe she’d find cigarettes or something harmful.

What she found was worse in a different way: my makeup.

Not just any makeup – but the most expensive items I own. High-end brands I’d saved up for. I have a cabinet full of cosmetics, and people are welcome to use things – but not to steal. And Lisa had handpicked the best items and stashed them away without asking.

So my mom did something bold:
She set a trap.

She removed the makeup from Lisa’s bag, hid it deep behind bottles in the cabinet, and took a photo of the setup. Then she waited.

Two days later, right before they left, she checked the cabinet – and everything was gone again.

When my mom confronted her, Lisa pulled the items out and said, “Oh, that? It must’ve fallen out.”
From the back of a closed cabinet. Behind several objects. Sure.

When I came back and heard everything, I was shaken. Things had been moved. Other items were missing. My mom later admitted she had already believed Lisa took the missing money earlier too.

But I didn’t want to yell or accuse. I did what I’d learned in therapy:
I sat down and wrote a thoughtful message. It took me days. I showed it to my therapist. I wanted to be calm, honest, clear. I told her how I felt – that this wasn’t about money, but about trust and respect. I told her how much we had done for her. I even said maybe she was struggling with something and that I was open to talking.

Her reply came within ten minutes.
She said she had “also lost things,” but didn’t know exactly what. She said she wasn’t organized. She claimed she only went out with a guy “once.” She told me I could just “send her a bill” for anything missing. And then she ended with:

“Let’s just have coffee sometime.”
“I won’t talk about this anymore.”

No apology. No ownership. Just… casual denial and moving on.

I sent one final message. I said:

“This isn’t about charging you. It’s about accountability. If you want to talk honestly, I’m open.”

She never replied.

And the final breaking point?

A while after the last message, I had to visit my aunt to help her with something. Lisa was there.
She acted like nothing happened.
She laughed, tried to talk to me, even jumped into a conversation I was having with my mom – like we were still close.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t look at her. To me, she was air.

That was three years ago.
I went no contact.

But now… my family acts like I’m the problem.

My mom and aunt still talk to Lisa. Every now and then, they come to me to complain about her behavior. And every time, I say:

“I don’t want to hear it. I’m not involved.”

They agree that what she did wasn’t okay – but they still tell me to let it go.
That “family is family.”
That I’m being too cold.
That I’m dramatic.

I think it’s cultural: in our background, family isn’t cut off.
But through therapy – and maybe also from living in a culture that values boundaries – I’ve learned that no contact is okay.

Now, if Lisa is going to be somewhere – I don’t go. I never tell my family to uninvite her. I just make other plans. I come a day early, or an hour later. I remove myself. That’s it.

And yet, I’m the one being told I’m “too harsh.”
I don’t let things go.
I am the cold one.

And then came the holidays.

I now live in the biggest apartment in our extended family, so when a few close relatives came to visit from abroad last year for Christmas, they stayed with me. I hosted Christmas at my place.
Everyone was invited – except Lisa.
Because, of course, I didn’t invite her.

But to be clear:
I hosted on December 25th. She and others had all of December 24th to celebrate however they wanted. I didn’t stop anyone from seeing her. I didn’t make drama.
I simply said: She’s not coming into my home.

And once again, it was used against me.

I was told I should “let it go,” that “Christmas is about family,” that “she’s changed,” and “she deserves another chance.”

But here’s the thing:
She never apologized.
She never responded to my message.
She acted like it never happened.
And somehow… I’m the one seen as cold?

I got this coffee table from FB marketplace for my living room and it had a bunch of hazing/water stains on the top (pic 2) and a bit of missing veneer in the corner (Pic 3).

I thought as a practice piece I’d try to touch up the top. I got a furniture restoration book from the library which suggested gently sanding with 0000 steel wool for the stains. I did that and it got hazier and looked terrible. I put down a layer of shellac and then water based poly and it looks better. I can still see the lap lines from the poly but after multiple layers of sanding and poly and trying to fix the lines and getting frustrated I’ve decided it’s good enough.

For the missing veneer chunk I rebuilt it with wood filler then painted it to match with acrylic paint (pic 4). I wish I had taken a closer up picture of the missing chunk to compare, but overall I’m pretty pleased with this part!

On that date I decided I was going to get back on keto/carnivore and see if it would help me get better. I’ve done keto and carnivore in the past and it’s been hard to stay motivated and stay on the diet. Back in 2015 I lost 72 lbs in five months but after I hit my goal weight I started to cheat here and there until I was fully off the diet. I had gained about 50 lbs of that weight back. 

Since starting in February I’ve lost 35 lbs and it’s been easy to stay motivated since I’m fighting cancer. Not just about weight anymore so no cheating. I do feel great and I’m eating mainly carnivore but I’ve added some low carb vegetables like snap peas, green beans and edamame. Salad too but mainly meat. 

My glucose pretty much stays in the 70 - 100 range but for some reason black coffee does spike me to 110 glucose. 

My ketones stay over 3.5 with 5.9 as my high today. My GKI is almost always 1.2 or under. Today my GKI was at 0.9 but yesterday was 0.8.

Alright, real talk—I run a small baking page on TikTok where I post short clips of cake designs and frosting tips. Most of my videos get a handful of views from friends and randoms, but earlier this month I uploaded a sped-up strawberry shortcake reel that I thought had real potential... and it completely stalled at 42 views. 

Out of frustration (and curiosity), I bought 100 likes from Media Mister. Cost me less than my morning coffee. No password, no weird setup—just entered the video link and hit confirm. The likes started showing up within the hour. Surprisingly, the video hit 1,200 views by the next day and picked up 11 new followers, which is a lot for me. 

Was it worth it? Yeah. Not because it made me blow up, but because it kickstarted momentum on a post that would’ve been buried. For niche accounts like mine, that small push makes a real difference. Anyone else in a similar boat? I'd love to hear if it's helped in other niches too.

1kw31mh,https://i.redd.it/z0qi73ftf63f1.jpeg,Chocolate Truffle Cake- Baked to perfection,"I recently baked a super yummy chocolate truffle cake for my sister's birthday! 🫶🎉

Here is the complete recipe-

To start, preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease an 8-inch round cake pan. 

In a bowl, sift together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, ½ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and a pinch of salt. In another bowl, whisk ½ cup of oil with ¾ cup of sugar, then mix in ½ cup of yogurt and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Add ½ cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice, then gradually fold in the dry ingredients. For deeper flavor, stir in ½ cup of hot water mixed with 1 teaspoon of instant coffee. 

Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let the cake cool completely before layering or frosting.

FOR GANACHE-

Heat 200 ml of heavy cream in a pan until it’s just about to boil. Pour it over 200 grams of chopped dark chocolate and let it sit for a minute. 

Stir the mixture until smooth, then add a tablespoon of butter for extra shine and richness. Once your cake has cooled, slice it in half horizontally if you want to layer it. 

Spread a generous amount of ganache between the layers, and cover the top and sides as well. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours to let the ganache set properly.

BONUS TIP-

For the best flavor, use high-quality dark chocolate with 55% to 70% cocoa. You can also elevate the ganache by adding a pinch of sea salt or a dash of chili powder. Decorate with shaved chocolate, fresh berries, or edible gold leaf for a luxurious finish.

Here’s What I Learned as a New Parent,"I’m expecting my first baby and keep wondering: *do I need a stroller if I plan to babywear most of the time?* After scouring parent forums and product guides, here’s my take.

# The Case for a Stroller

1. **Weight and Fatigue**: Even if you love babywearing, hauling a 20+ lb toddler for hours isn’t sustainable. One parent noted their 6-month-old weighed 24 lbs, making the stroller a back-saver.
2. **Hands-Free Convenience**: Strollers let you carry groceries, manage a coffee, or navigate crowded spaces without balancing a carrier. The storage basket alone is a game-changer for errands.
3. **Naptime Survival**: Transferring a sleeping baby from a car seat to a stroller (vs. a carrier) minimizes wake-ups. Rainy days or long walks? The stroller’s weather shield and recline feature are clutch.
4. **Long-Term Use**: Many use strollers daily for 2+ years. For active families, jogging or all-terrain models handle parks, trails, or uneven sidewalks better than carriers.

# When to Skip It (For Now)

* **Minimalist Lifestyle**: If you live in a walkable area with short trips, a carrier might suffice. Some parents never bought one and relied on babywearing.
* **Budget Concerns**: Wait until after birth to decide. As one Redditor said, *“If you don’t need it now, buy it later”*.
* **Baby’s Preference**: Some infants hate strollers (or carriers!). Testing both post-birth avoids wasting money.

# My Plan

I’ll start with a used stroller frame that clicks into our car seat ($50 on Marketplace). If babywearing works, great—we’ll sell it. If not, we’ll upgrade to a lightweight model later.

**Final Take**: A stroller isn’t *essential*, but it solves problems you can’t predict. Prioritize flexibility over perfection.",1,1748287177.0,greatforkids,0,1.0,False
1kw2yi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kw2yi7/surprising_healing_after_a_burn/,surprising healing after a burn,"hi, I'm 24F and had a bad accident at work recently (I work in a restaurant as a server and bartender) where a coworker ran into me while I was holding a large catering-size box hot coffee. The coffee was in a bag inside but whoever bumped me jostled me enough to break the box, which broke the bag, and the servers around weren't able to help in time. It looked like somewhere above 1st degree burns (but also not really quite 2nd degree) on my chest and stomach, but my thighs, hands, and arms had small blisters and the initial redness eventually looked like a bruise-ish color? just more uniform, less splotchy, and covering a much larger area than a bruise would anyways. I sent pictures over to my mom (she's a teacher now, but went through a long run of years in medical school before switching paths) and we both agreed that those areas looked like superficial 2nd degree burns.

That happened early on Friday morning, just 2 1/2 or so days ago. Since then I've done all the usual burn care stuff (cooling down, aloe, medical wrappings intermixed with letting certain areas breath, etc etc). 

But my confusion is that today the redness is completely gone, the discoloration has lessened extensively, and the blisters aren't uncomfortable, in fact they kind of blend in with the scattered acne or ingrown hair scars that I have from a myriad of lifelong skin problems. I thought burn blisters eventually popped on their own, not that they just shrunk and went away? But my skin is still very sensitive and all the more severe burn areas are still in pain, even though all the visual signs of the burn seem to have just...disappeared? So, questions are: is it possible for a 2nd degree burn to heal so fast, why do I still feel pain and sensitivity when most other signs of the burn are visually gone, and is it more likely I had a severe 1st degree instead?

1kw2xzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1kw2xzo/the_preservation_coalition_primaries_of_1968/,The Preservation Coalition Primaries of 1968 | Peacock-Shah Alternate Elections,"The results of the republic’s first national referendum were verified as a resounding defeat for President Cecil H. Underwood, reforming the electoral college and expanding the Senate. Underwood had presided over a landing on the moon, a war in the Congo, and the dismantling of American fascism, but his quest for a third term was conclusively rejected by the American voter, throwing the Underwood camp into disarray amidst further fissions between Progressive and Liberal elements within the Preservation coalition over the continuance of the War in the Congo and the Underwood Administration’s lurch to the right. Within days of the referendum, Americans reached for their morning coffee and flipped on the television, now in color for most of the nation. Their mornings commenced with two dueling headlines. Firstly, President Underwood had officially renounced any desire to seek a third consecutive term and announced his endorsement of New York Senator Roy Cohn for the presidency days before the beginning of the first joint-Preservation primaries, an affair deeply important for the perception of the race despite being relegated to the handful of states that had recently passed presidential primary requirements.

The second headline would eclipse the first by the hours, held back at first only by the incredulity of the announcement being such that many in the press refused to go forth until further confirmation had been secured. In a backhanded embrace of the referendum he had campaigned against, President Underwood had announced the appointment of 51 additional United States Senators, citing the precedent set by John A. Lejeune’s appointment of Senators to seats once occupied by Revolutionaries a half-century earlier. Though legal battles over the legitimacy of these appointees have already begun, all the President’s men have taken their seats and begun the process of endorsing their patron’s agenda lock, stock, and barrel. Meanwhile, soldiers have not had the worry, for a New Year’s offensive from Patrice Lumumba’s forces has escalated fighting in the Congo to bloody new heights. With the backdrop set, the shaky coalition of Preservation moves to its first primary, one operating on a unique system owing to the dual nature of the coalition that has left candidates with preliminary running mates even before their nomination.

**Coalition Tickets:**

*Certain leading candidates for the nomination have already nominated prospective running mates across the Progressive-Liberal divide.*

[Senator Cohn at a candidate panel.](https://preview.redd.it/ovfxunrcj63f1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=549543e5bdb98b17492c8757670050ba02846c6a)

**Roy Cohn/Strom Thurmond:**

*“I bring out the worst in my enemies and that's how I get them to defeat themselves.”*

Thrust into the race in the wake of the success of the electoral reform referendum, 41 year old New York Senator Roy Cohn has managed to hold his spot on the national stage for nearly two decades. Cohn began his rise as a young attorney in the administration of Philip La Follette forcing accused homosexuals out of the federal workforce before defecting from the President with a lucrative job offer from a certain Representative Joseph McCarthy preceding his ascension to the office of Speaker of the House. Cohn would flower into his own under McCarthy, harassing La Follette allies with allegations of French sympathies in a Fascist Scare culminating in La Follette’s impeachment in relation to administrative connections to the 1939 assassination of General Smedley Butler by the Lindbergh Administration. With impeachment moving from the House to the Senate, McCarthy would find himself behind bars on salacious charges as Roy Cohn pivoted to join President La Follette’s successful defense team before the Senate. President Pete Quesada saved little in saving Cohn from downfall owing to this political waltz, dragging him into the Preservationist fold with a key role as Solicitor General before pushing him to successfully seek election to the Senate in 1956.

A relentless member of the Progressive Party’s right, Cohn emerged as the Senate’s right-wing bulldog, tearing into opponents, Farmer-Labor and Liberal alike, and making a defense of the death penalty, government efficiency, and Congo War his pet political causes alongside an informal alliance with the House’s G. Gordon Liddy in his attempt to root out “un-American activities.” With the endorsement of Liddy and the Administration, Cohn has inherited Underwood’s Committee to Re-elect the President, with John Mitchell and Pat Buchanan among his chief operators. Though a stolid supporter of the Administration through its inception, its conflicts at home and abroad, and the imposition of dozens of new Senators in recent days, Cohn is expected to take a rougher tact as President and align himself more explicitly with Liddy. Further, he may moderate in his economic policy and is expected to show less enthusiasm for tax cuts. While selecting the staunchly pro-Underwood leader of Senate Liberals Strom Thurmond as his running mate, Cohn has been entirely dismissive of anti-war Liberals. To Cohn, the coalition existed to fight the vanquished enemy of fascism and must take a new form to support the America of Underwood and his allies; if members oppose the President, they would have no place in a Cohn-led coalition.

[General Gavin at his post.](https://preview.redd.it/u3wrjzhwj63f1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=cafcbafc87fb08ef442a626cc63c45fc1f350bbb)

**James M. Gavin/John Sampson Cooper:**

*“You can't be just against communism; you've got to be for something.”*

No man in the armed forces was so concerned by the administration of Philip La Follette as General James M. Gavin. Believing that the very fate of the republic was on the line, Gavin organized the highest echelons of the officer corps in a secret plot against the President that burst onto the stage with the shooting of Philip La Follette. As Vice President Michael A. Musmanno rushed to the floor of Congress to claim wide reaching emergency powers amidst a contested election, Gavin joined with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Generals David Shoup and Bonner Fellers to place Musmanno under arrest. The three Generals would then engage in actions entirely unprecedented in American history, forming extraordinary cabinet offices for themselves to govern the nation for a hundred days as the Triumvirate before handing power to Pete Quesada, by then declared the legitimate winner of the election of 1952. The paramount figure of the so-called Christmas Coup and ensuing Triumvirate rule, General Gavin went on to clash with President Quesada’s conciliatory attitude towards La Follette and his allies. Already a critic, Gavin would conclusively break with the Preservation coalition’s mainline in 1965 with scathing attacks on President Underwood and his Congo War, emerging as the hero of anti-war Liberals that sought to secede from their coalition with the increasingly right-wing Progressive Party.

General Gavin would join hands with Wisconsin Senator Orson Welles to rally the social liberals of the Liberal Party against President Underwood, claiming “the real problem is not in the Congo, it’s in the White House,” for “so many things at home are left half-done.” Endorsed by Welles to carry the torch of his own campaign from 1960, Gavin has extended a favorite Progressive of Liberals as his running mate in the personage of Kentucky Senator John Sampson Cooper. Gavin has excoriated Underwood as a failure of a President and claimed his packing of the Senate constitutes an impeachable offense, including suggesting the possibility of a post-presidential impeachment of Underwood to head off any possibility of a non-consecutive third term. On economic policy, Gavin seeks a reorientation of the Liberal Party towards an expansion of social programs while rejecting the Congo War in all forms, calling for an immediate peace treaty with Patrice Lumumba and a complete disentanglement from Central African affairs.

**Shirley Temple/Joachim O. Fernandez:**

*“I think we all learn from the past. I just feel we shouldn't live there.”*

Before the age of five, Shirley Temple was a household name. America’s most famous child actress found herself the star of everything from children’s shows to advertisements, even appearing alongside Clark Gable and an elderly John Wilkes Booth in Godzilla. A moderate Progressive, Temple pursued election to the House in 1954 as a supporter of President Quesada. Temple would prove herself an amiable figure across the aisle, successfully introducing a constitutional amendment to change inauguration day to January 1st, supporting the equal rights amendment, and advocating for gun control, against fossil fuels, and for a renewed separation of church and state against the Jesus Amendment. Nonetheless, Temple remains an economic conservative and staunch anti-communist supporting the continuance of the War in the Congo on to victory. Widely considered a possible contender for the presidency, Temple immediately announced her intention to seek the White House with the defeat of President Underwood in the referendum. In an attempt to connect to the political establishment and emphasize her experience, Temple has selected as her running mate 78-year-old Joachim O. Fernandez, a protege of President Lejeune who served as Liberal Speaker of the House while Temple was still in elementary school and Hollywood.

The central plank of the Temple/Fernandez ticket is clear: unity among Liberals and Progressives. Temple has promised a role for anti-war Liberals in her Administration, including at the table for peace negotiations. Further, Temple has made her opposition to the packing of the Senate clear. Many classical elements of the Liberal Party have promoted Temple in particular as a safe middle-of-the-road nominee avoiding the social liberalism of Gavin or the anti-Liberal approach of the Underwood Administration. Most important among these might be Texas business magnate William Blakley, judged the richest man in the world with a fortune over $800 million dollars, who has effectively authored a blank check to the famous Congresswoman and her associates to campaign for the preservation of Preservationism without such confounding elements as Vice President Curtis’s call for a single tax.

[The Vice President posing as a wraith in the darkness.](https://preview.redd.it/yqocp0whk63f1.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3c9bc22f2104bdd8fe33eb8768328515a97149)

**Thomas B. Curtis/James L. Buckley:**

*“I do not feel prepared to vote without thought.”*

58 year old Vice President Thomas B. Curtis of Missouri proved himself as a formidable candidate for the Single Tax Party by winning a 1956 Senate seat through a motley coalition of liberal Mormons, anti-fascist Progressives, leftists, and Georgists, balancing a stringent alliance with leaders in the Black community, support for Georgism, sympathy for universal healthcare programs, and an otherwise strict fiscal conservatism. Curtis’s affable nature, epitomized in his signature bowtie, would prove key in organizing supporters nationally in the runup to the Emergency Single Tax Convention of 1963, where he successfully led a preponderance of his party into the Preservation Coalition in a move central to securing President Underwood’s 1964 re-election in return for his nomination by the coalition for the vice presidency. With policy views, outside of his Georgism, effectively making him a Progressive, Curtis has emphasized the historic ties between Liberals and Georgists in promoting his candidacy in an attempt to soothe the concerns of Liberals who fear that his victory might undermine their own position. However, the very fact that a Liberal-Single Tax ticket would be untenable in securing Progressive support has required Curtis to select as his running mate Progressive conservative James L. Buckley, the brother of gubernatorial candidate William F. Buckley Jr., who narrowly lost to Gore Vidal in the state’s election of 1962.

Despite having served as Vice President beneath Underwood, Curtis has consistently pursued his own agenda as the acknowledged national leader of the Single Tax Party, including lampooning Underwood’s tax cuts as half-baked without the potential of larger cuts tempered by a vast increase in revenue from a 100% tax upon land values. Otherwise, Curtis has criticized the appointment of new Senators, sought an expansion of the state’s role in healthcare, cuts to Social Security, and has promised his loyalty to the Single Tax Party, which might include continuing his campaign regardless of the Preservation coalition’s judgment on Curtis’s presidential odds at the coalition convention. On the Congo War, Curtis has worked to formulate a policy platform with Progressive Representative Melvin Laird, a likely nominee as Secretary of State in a Curtis Administration, of “Congolization.” The plan would entail a gradual transfer of military duties in the war to the forces of American ally Moïse Tshombe coupled with a continued commitment to preventing Patrice Lumumba from ruling the Congo.

**Individual Candidates:**

*Those persons neither affiliated as Progressives or Liberals with ballot placement have made no selection of a preliminary running mate.*

**Oral Roberts:**

*“I had a vision of Jesus, 900-feet-tall, over the White House and I need $8 million by March to make that dream come true, or God will call me home.”*

The aftermath of the United States’ defeat in the Second Pacific War tore the social fabric of the nation asunder. As the Plains burned in revolution and anti-communist armies roamed the nation to suffocate communism in its cradle, millions of Americans cast into declining economic lots flocked to the Fourth Great Awakening. The Pentecostal movement and its claims of new prophets, faith healings, and spoken tongues offer an opiate to the republic’s dejected masses even as its growth has slowed with the renewal of American prosperity. With the cries of “Tokyo delenda est” and the conclusion of the Third Pacific War, post-war Pentecostalism has seen no more paramount personage than that of Granville Oral Roberts, 50-year-old King of the televangelist airwaves. His greatest innovation? The “prosperity gospel,” promising future worldly wealth to his followers, particularly those that donate some of their present assets to him by mail.

Born to an impoverished North Texas preacher on the eve of the Revolution, Roberts skipped military service in the Third Pacific War to tour the nation with one sweeping tent, three-thousand folding chairs, and countless claims of the ability to heal the sick and speak the language of angels. His growing popularity–and wealth–carried him to the national airwaves and international audiences, as well as humanitarian recognition with a campaign to recruit across racial lines from the French Congo to South Africa. With a hundred and twenty million dollars a year, a college, and an international “crusade” to his name, Roberts has taken inspiration from fellow Fourth Great Awakening figure Immanuel Herrick and tossed his hat into the political ring.

The religious constituency of a high school dropout from a hearth of American communism have naturally been members of the Farmer-Labor Party, but the growth of Roberts’ fortune has coincided with a rising tide of populism among Underwood-aligned Progressives. Running alone as an independent within the coalition primaries with a veritable army of loyal fundraisers behind him, particularly when he prophesied his own death if another million was not raised, Roberts has turned to a political gospel of free markets, low taxes, a staunch social conservatism including national prohibitions on abortion and alcohol, and a promise to keep American troops in the Congo until every communist is six feet under ground. Where the policy bona fides of his campaign may be shallow, the power of his personality has not been, but even those opponents willing to take his following seriously have not been above guffawing in the face of a candidate claiming the endorsement of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Ideally, I’d love to find a few kindred spirits I can call up for a deep chat, a coffee, or a walk in the park.

I recently came across this app called TimeLeft, which seems to organize small meetups for people to connect—but I’m a bit hesitant. You can’t see who else is attending, and there’s not much space to share your own interests either, which makes it feel a bit blind-date-y.

Has anyone here tried it out? Would love to hear your thoughts or any other recommendations for low-key, genuine ways to meet people in the city.",2,1748286910.0,brussels,3,0.75,False

It is not caffeine, because it has also happened with decaf. It also does not happen if I have pure caffeine from a soda or energy drink.

I will try to keep this short and to the point.

I have known this person for over 17 years, we used to be close, hanging out every day. Talked on the phone for hours.

He went through a very tragic event in his life over 5 years ago. I was the only one there for him, literally the only one he shared this experience with, and the only one who spent hours on the phone with him daily. listened to his cries and worry.

2023, friendship for some reason is not as close as it was, he started talking to old friends again and sharing his traumatic event with them...come 2025, he became close with other friends, never wants to hang out with me, not even for coffee...he always has an excuse, but we still talk when he is at work and on his breaks. On his days off, we don't talk, he is with his other friends. He said he doesn't have time for coffee.

He has never come to see my new apartment, I moved in November of 2024, says he is busy.

His mother recently came to town. She and I used to talk until he got close to his old friends again, who, by the way, I've never met. His mother and his friends hung out the whole time she was in town, but I was not invited. I was invited to the last party they had before she left. I did not go...I felt he only invited me out of guilt, he mentioned the party when we spoke. 

I feel as though he resents me; he is a gay male, I am a straight female, and all his love interests have been straight. They have always shown an interest in me, but of course, they would; they are straight. I feel as though he resents me for this.

Hopped off the fence on soo many picks this haul — I’ve been going back and forth on Sakura BS for literally months and I’m so glad I pulled the trigger. It’s a really nice light floral to layer with sprays like Mossy Bottom or GOTF. Really like it. Same with Bitzer!! Both of them smell so much different outside of the store AND so different from what I usually get, in the best way. I actually made an online order last night and there’s 2 more Bitzers on their way to me.. i love him 🥹

Easter Bonnet was also one I’ve picked up and put back half a dozen times — I chopped it into chunks and it ended up lasting for like, 4 baths, and I’m obsessed with the scent (is it a particular scent family?!) so it was definitely a good buy.

I am completely blown away by Retread—I don’t dig the scent and it feels sooo thin compared to the Banana conditioner I’ve been using, but my hair has never looked so amazing. And if you were in the “your darkest lush confessions” thread, you’ll know how I got that Bee’s Knees tester 😂

The brazilian boom was a bit of a surprise hit with a really unique scent and I love the coffee addition. And I’m not sure about the Coco Loco because that and the shampoo bar were my husband’s picks!

Also have to give a huge shout out to the Oak Park KC Lush — they are starting to recognize me 😅 but are always so insanely friendly and didn’t even flinch when I started my sample requests. I need to submit a formal compliment or something, everyone is always so helpful (There’s one employee there who is THE BEST! She has the best suggestions— Tumeric Roll IS amazing, girl!!) and they hook me up every time! I’ve been using the Gorgeous sample which was a mistake, because the price for a full tub is just too much. But I’ve almost sampled every face wash in my journey to find the perfect one… what’s everyone’s favorite?

The toothpaste was a feeebie they threw in at the counter and I probably won’t use it 😅 I’m weird about my teeth, but it does smell really good!",19,1748286102.0,LushCosmetics,9,1.0,False

It was a tight knit team until Lisa joined us as a new barista. From day one she was awful, constantly rude to customers, slacking off and stealing tips. The manager a kind but timid woman didn’t do much about it.

One day Lisa decided to cross the line; she blamed me for messing up her orders in front of customers and even lied to the manager about me stealing from the till. That was the last straw. But I didn’t want to just get her fired I wanted to make sure she never worked in this town again.

I knew the shops security cameras were rarely checked so I took my time gathering evidence. Every time Lisa took a long break I recorded it. Every time she mixed up orders on purpose or was rude to customers I documented it with timestamps. I also discreetly asked regulars to message me about their bad experiences with her.

Once I had a full dossier I scheduled a meeting with the manager and presented everything videos, customer complaints and even the tip jar records showing Lisa pocketed money.

The manager was shocked but grateful and fired Lisa on the spot.

But here’s the kicker. Lisa wasn’t just some random barista. she had connections. She was using the coffee shop as a front to run illegal gambling on the side, something the manager didn’t even suspect. I had accidentally uncovered it when I found a stack of suspicious receipts behind the counter.

I handed that info over to the local police anonymously. Within days there was a raid and the coffee shop next door run by Lisa’s cousin Guadillo got shut down. Lisa herself got slapped with serious charges.

Meanwhile I posted the evidence about her on a popular local Facebook group for small businesses warning the community.

Within weeks Lisa’s reputation was completely destroyed and she left town.

I am specific about who can touch me or my stuff, and he knows this. Even if I tell him to stop, he doesn't. He has been asking me daily at school if I am upset with him, and I've told him yes. The other day I had an orthodontist appointment, so I wasn't at school. My friend, LeAnn, came to me the next day and told me that Amos asked her if I was angry at him.

He has a tendency to grab my stuff after I told him not to without asking. One day I had a ball with me and a kid asked if they could play with it. I didn't really see why they couldn't, because it was one of the people I don't mind touching my stuff, so I let them. Amos got offended and said ""so you'll let everyone else BUT me touch it?"" an I straight up told him yes. There are few people I let touch my stuff, and fewer I let touch me. He is not one of those people. He hugs me and touches my stuff and I pull away and tell him to stop. He grabsvky necklaces and says ""ooh pretty necklace"" and acts like I committed a crime when I slap his hand away, because yet again, I've told him not to do that. I only let some people drink after me, and I'm still hesitant, but he has grabbed my coffee cup and monsters, water and other drinks I have, and drank straight from it without asking.

I told him kinda, that he needs to stop crossing my boundaries, and all he said was ""listen man you know I'm terrible with memory, trust"". It makes me really upset. All my friends are mad at him too because he crosses their boundaries all the time too.

1kw2dmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kw2dmk/does_hourleey_rv_water_filter_really_ensure/,"Does Hourleey RV Water Filter Really Ensure Cleaner, Safer Water? Detailed Review","Testing out the Hourleey RV Water Filter with the item model number RV Water Filter was quite an experience for me, especially because clean water is an absolute non-negotiable when you're living the RV life or spending extended time outdoors. I decided to put this nifty little filtration unit through its paces during a recent camping trip, using it daily for every possible scenario: from cooking and drinking to cleaning dishes and even watering some plants at the campsite. Here’s my breakdown of how it performed.

**Build Quality and Design**  
One of the first things I noticed was the robust design of this water filter. The combination of food-grade plastic for the housing and brass for its fittings offers a sense of sturdiness that you want in an outdoor product. It's lightweight at just 1.85 pounds but feels durable enough to handle a range of environments. The inclusion of flexible hose protectors is a thoughtful touch, making it much easier to set up without worrying about kinks or stress on the connection points. Plus, the compact 3” x 5” x 4” dimensions mean it doesn’t take up much room in your storage. Overall, it's a user-friendly and well-constructed piece of gear.  

**Ease of Installation**  
Setting this up initially had me worried that I might need tools or extra gadgets, but that wasn’t the case at all. The installation is a straightforward plug-and-play process. You just align the incoming water hose with the filter, follow the water flow direction labeled clearly on the unit, and attach the outgoing hose to your RV or watercraft. That’s it—zero technical know-how required. As someone who gets easily frustrated with complex setups, the simplicity of this process was a huge plus.

[Time for Hourleey RV Water Filter? Check price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cbjz4238/)

**Filtration Performance**  
I fully expected the water quality to improve, but this filter still managed to surprise me. With its GAC (Granular Activated Carbon) filtration combined with KDF (Kinetic Degradation Fluxion) technology, it effectively removed all noticeable traces of chlorine, odd tastes, and unpleasant odors. After a day in full use, the water tasted crisp and clean, like it had been bottled. This filter has a rating of 20 microns, which, according to my research, is pretty impressive for its size—it captures small particles effectively while regulating bacterial and mold growth when inactive. Whether I was sipping coffee, cooking pasta, or rinsing vegetables, there was no compromise in water quality.

**Versatility for Outdoor and RV Enthusiasts**  
This isn’t just an RV-exclusive product. On days when I wasn’t hooking this filter up to the RV, I used it with a standard garden hose. The result? Safe drinking water provided for every other task, from filling up my dog’s water bowl to cleaning the patio area at the campsite. If you’re into gardening, pool maintenance, or spa care, the filter works just as smoothly. This level of versatility makes it an excellent choice for anyone juggling multiple outdoor hobbies or responsibilities.

**Durability for the Long Haul**  
After three weeks of use, including countless gallons of water filtered through it, the performance remained consistent. The manufacturer claims it can last a whole camping season, or up to three months, and I can see why. The durable materials and efficient filtration mechanism seem built to last. However, I can’t confirm the full three months yet; I’ll have to wait and see if it lives up to that promise. For now, it hasn’t cracked, leaked, or shown any signs of wear, making this a strong contender for long-term use.

**Good Points**  
- Effectively removes bad tastes, odors, chlorine, and sediment.  
- Straightforward installation process with no tools required.  
- Highly versatile—works with RVs, boats, campers, and garden hoses.  

**Limitations**  
- Not clear when the filter reaches the end of its usability unless you keep an exact count of usage days.  
- Filter replacement instructions could have been included with the box.  
- Slight water flow reduction, although not enough to disrupt usage drastically.  

**Competing Products**  
It’s worth mentioning a few alternatives before you make your choice. Camco’s TastePURE RV Water Filter is one that frequently pops up in conversations among RVers. While it also removes chlorine and bad odors, the Hourleey filter stands out for its higher micron rating and the inclusion of flexible hose protectors. Another competitor is the AQUA CREST RV Water Filter, which offers a slightly longer filter lifespan; however, it doesn't quite match Hourleey's versatility in applications like gardening or pool maintenance. Based on what I tested, the Hourleey filter feels like the better all-rounder, especially for someone who values multi-purpose usage.

**Affordable Quality**  
No product is perfect at its price point, and I don’t expect it to be. However, this water filter does punch well above its weight for what it offers. Considering how much it actively improves water safety and its included features like flexible hoses and durable materials, it feels like a smart investment. I’ve seen some pricier options, but they didn’t offer the same versatility or simple installation process.

She's extremely manipulative and hates me for stealing her son. Also FIL is somekind of antisocial person since he don't even talk to me and used to beat MIL.

MIL started to talk about my boyfriend and her being the star of a family gathering, since she turned 60 and my bf graduated.
She then added that she needs me to do all the baking and prepping, pouring coffee and do the dishes all day long while she and my bf are being celebrated. Of course she don't pay me a dime.
So I'd be in the kitchen cleaning and nobody wouldn't get to see me and talk to me.

In my family we invite everybody's partner, get to know them and they're honored quests. We pay for professional work. There's no way we'd make a quest, who've met 4 times before, to do unpaid labor.

She's completely out of her mind. She tries to control my bf by texting him every night and when my bf doesn't answer, she asks me where he is. I've not answered. She also does this to her other children. She controls their interaction, so they don't message each other but through her instead. One of her daughters calls 4 hour phone calls telling her about her xxxlife. She then disses her behind her back. She's a hoarder also.

We were in a festival and bf:s sister was in there too. She wanted us to get her food Even though she could get it herself, since she bought drinks :D bf texted her hell no. 15 mins later MIL texts and tries to call that we absolutely need to get the spoiled, unstable sister food. We didn't.

1kw2aev,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1kw2aev/i_am_stupid_and_i_hate_myself/,I am stupid and I hate myself.,"My first relationship lasted 8 years. I was young, with no real dreams just drifting through life.

I was 29 when we broke up. She gave me 8 years of her life. She supported me, loved me, gave me everything. So when it ended, I promised myself I’d become a better man.

Eventually, I did. I had a job. A business. Life was going well when I met her.

She was a single mom working abroad. I made it my mission to show her how much I cared. I sent flowers, gifts, food, groceries. I sacrificed sleep to talk to her despite the time difference.

When she came home, she asked me to move to her hometown. I did. She asked me to get a work-from-home job. I did. I treated her family with respect. I took her son as if he were my own.

But once we were together in person, she was busy with everything: friends, coworkers, her business but not me. Even the day I picked her up from the airport, she was on her phone all the time with friends. That night, she gave me a bracelet and ignored me when I lost it because it was itchy.

I cleaned our apartment. She hired a cleaning lady the next day. I cried in the bathroom from exhaustion and feeling unappreciated. She banged on the door.

I supported her online business even while I searched for a job. I did the laundry, cooked, cared for her son when she found work. I paid 80% of the bills rent, electricity, internet, gas.

I picked her up from work, bought her oat coffee when I could. I was always hungry, she only bought food once a day at 7AM, and it was always the same. Meanwhile, she bought herself shoes, skincare, everything she wanted.

I told her I was hungry. She said, “You’re only hungry because you don’t eat.” No concern. Just defensiveness.

I started getting angry. Not out of nowhere but because I was constantly dismissed. Every time I spoke up, she interrupted or argued.

I still left with love in my heart. But now, months later, I still love her. I still care. And I don’t understand why.

I gave everything, and somehow I still miss her.

You work hard. You save where you can. Yet your bank account still looks like it's recovering from a hangover.

Sound familiar? It's very common and you're definitely not cursed—despite what your inner critic might say.

Many people keep grinding without ever fixing the *actual* issue: what's going on between their ears.

If you’ve ever felt like **money slips away no matter what**, the problem might be less about income and more about mindset.

That’s where [Money Magnet Mastery](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official) comes in. It skips the spreadsheets and hands you a 30-second ritual meant to shift your thinking about wealth. The claim? Change your thoughts, and your results follow.

Let’s dig into what this course offers—and whether it can help you **break the loop of financial frustration** without turning your life upside down.

# 📦 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: Money Magnet Mastery
* **Category**: Mindset & Success ➝ Financial Mindset Programs
* **Overall Verdict**: 4/5

# 💸 What Is Money Magnet Mastery?

**Money Magnet Mastery** is a digital mindset course that focuses on helping users build **a mindset focused on financial abundance** using short, daily rituals.

Rather than dragging you through long videos or lectures, it centers around **the Money Magnet Mastery phone ritual**, a 30-second task involving affirmations and visualization.

It’s light on theory but heavy on practice. You’ll find **ways to attract money through mindset** that are simple, consistent, and more engaging than yet another podcast episode about passive income.

This approach feels especially appealing if you're tired of products that require 40 hours of your life to tell you what could’ve fit on a sticky note.

# 🔄 How It Works

Each day, you open the program, follow a few prompts, and practice **a quick daily money ritual that actually works**—all in under a minute.

The main goal is to **rewire your brain to attract wealth** by disrupting thought patterns that tell you you're destined to struggle.

You’re not forced into deep journaling sessions or seminars. Instead, it uses **techniques for manifesting wealth** by combining focus, breath, and [repeated intention](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official).

The phone becomes your ritual tool. Yes, the same device you usually use to scroll cat memes is now part of your **training that builds wealth consciousness**.

Even if you don’t believe in **using the law of attraction to gain money**, this micro-practice helps you pause long enough to act with more intention.

There’s also subtle guidance on how to **reprogram your subconscious mind for wealth** through repetition—not by overhauling your life, but by changing small daily patterns.

# 👥 Who It’s For

If you're looking to **break free from a scarcity mindset**, this course was made for you. It works well for freelancers, creators, and side-hustlers with money anxiety.

It’s ideal for people trying to **transform their money mindset** without adding extra chaos to their schedules. You can literally do the ritual before your coffee finishes brewing.

The tone is practical, not preachy. If you’ve rolled your eyes at “abundance vibes” in the past, don’t worry—it keeps things grounded, while still helping you shift how you think.

# 📱 My Personal Experience (from Robyn)

A friend of mine, **Robyn**, is a freelance illustrator I met years ago through a creative entrepreneurship group. 

She’s one of those people who can make a client’s rough napkin sketch look like it belongs in a gallery—but she’s always joked that her money habits “belong in a dumpster fire.”

Robyn was the first to tell me about [Money Magnet Mastery](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/money-magnet-mastery-official). She’d hit a wall after a slow quarter, spiraling into self-doubt and what she called her “I’m broke so I must be broken” loop.

After hearing about this 30-second ritual that was supposed to rewire your money mindset, she figured, “Why not?”

She started doing the ritual every morning before opening her tablet to sketch.

She’d sit for a moment, repeat the guided phrase, and take a few deep breaths while visualizing a day where she wasn’t in panic mode about rent.

Within two weeks, she said she felt a genuine shift—subtle, but powerful. She was quoting jobs with more confidence, saying no to flaky clients, and even applying for grants she’d normally talk herself out of.

Her one gripe? She mentioned the content could’ve offered a bit more variation or maybe an optional audio format.

“It’s not a podcast—I get that—but I’d love to hear someone walk me through it now and then,” she told me.

Still, Robyn said it was one of the only tools that helped her break that cycle of **negative thought patterns around money**—without requiring hours of her already limited time.

And knowing how many online courses she’s rage-quit mid-module, that’s saying something.

At this point, I don’t know if I am in love or just stuck. Things have become toxic, confusing, and emotionally exhausting. I keep going back, hoping it will get better, but it never really does. I need clarity and I don’t know if I am doing the right thing by staying.

She has ADHD and is autistic, and I’m somewhat autistic too.

In the beginning, I was cautious. I didn’t fully trust her because I had been hurt in the past and assumed she was like others. Early on, she told me some guys had invited her to a fun fair. Since we were already talking, I told her not to go. She ended up not going with anyone, and eventually we moved in together just four months into dating.

At the time, I was working and thought we were building something solid. But had a big argument with my mum, and ended up staying full time at my girlfriend’s house and then I lost my job. That’s when things began to fall apart. We started fighting more, and because it was her place, she would kick me out during arguments. I would stay outside. I stayed calm most of the time, but she would hit me, throw things at me, and spit on me. I didn’t fight back at first. I just wanted peace.

When things got bad, I tried to take my things, but she refused to give them back saying I lost access to them. Still, we got back together. The pattern repeated over and over. She once cut herself with a knife during an argument and also cut me. I had to go to the hospital. I told my mum, then collected all my things and left. But we still got back together again. By then the relationship had changed. I still had no job, but I was trying my best. She worked remotely and supported me for a while. I was very grateful for that because I would have done the same for her.

Eventually, I found a job at a restaurant. I tried to help with money, contribute to food, take care of her dog, and save where I could. But we still argued a lot. She said I wasn’t helping enough. I tried to explain that our lives were mixed now and we needed to cut costs. I never tried to control her money, but I wanted us to be practical. Despite everything, when she got upset, I would still be kicked out of the house. I lost count of how many times I packed my things and left.

Later on, we moved into a new place, and this time my name was on the lease. But again, I couldn’t afford the deposit as I had just lost another job. She covered it. We were still struggling, but somehow there was always money for weed, which we used together. She continued to support me and I appreciated it deeply. But even when I gave her some of my money or bought food for both of us, it never felt like enough to her. She told me she was the only woman who would do this for me and that she regretted it.

Arguments continued. When she was upset, she said things that really cut deep. One time she told me I hadn’t taught her anything and that I brought nothing to the table. At some point, everything that had happened to me being hit, spat on I started doing the same to her during fights. It became toxic on both sides. She would slap me and I would slap her back. I’m not proud of it, and it scared me how far we had fallen us both, I guess she was too.

There were also moments that really disturbed me same with her. I’m not someone who shows big emotions easily. I would freeze while she was crying and she never let me forget it. I explained that I struggle to respond in those moments, but I promised to work on it. I really tried. Our sex life was very intense and very frequent. She liked touching me all the time and at first it made me uncomfortable, but I got used to it and now we touch each other a lot.

However, there were two separate times where we ended up having sex while she was sleeping. I genuinely thought she was awake, as we sometimes initiated things half-asleep. We spoke about it, and I understood how serious it was. But it happened again later and I still thought she was awake. I was devastated because I never wanted to hurt her and I didn’t think it was against her will. But the trust was breaking down. I swore on the Bible that I would never do anything like that again.

She began calling me narcissistic and other names and during arguments i would call her names too. I recognised some toxic traits in myself but I also saw them in her. I kept thinking love meant going through highs and lows, but this felt extreme. She kept my keys during arguments so I couldn’t come back. She would tell me to leave the house and then expect me to sit in a coffee shop and apologise like nothing had happened. That messed with my head so much and I guess her head too.

At one point, I got a storage unit to protect my things since I kept getting kicked out. I still paid rent even when I couldn’t use all the space in the house. She would say I wasn’t doing enough. She told me I couldn’t use the office room because I had left it messy once when I packed up after an argument. I didn’t even know where to go in the house anymore.

We argued again recently because of my aftershave. She had a migraine and said the scent triggered her. I told her I could wipe it off. I tried to open the windows to air out the room but she told me to close them and to leave the room. I left the living room and went to the bedroom. She came and said I couldn’t be there in the bed because I would sweat on it and her cleaner had just cleaned the house. She said she didn’t want me to sweat on the bed. I left the room, but she followed and said I still needed to go to the office instead. The argument escalated. I tried to remove some food my mum had made from the freezer because she said it was too full, and she got upset again. Then she slapped me. I warned her before not to hit me again or I would react, and this time I did. I slapped her back. She dropped to the floor and I panicked. I helped her to the sofa and said I was sorry. Then I left.

As I was heading to my storage unit, she called and said I had her credit cards, which I did. We agreed I would leave them in the letterbox. Then she told me her brother wanted to speak with me and also with my parents. She started demanding money I had been saving for our Japan trip, which I had offered to use to help us both. She said if we are not together, she would change the passenger name on the ticket as she paid for it in full. She also said her mum was on the phone with my mum, crying, and that they were arguing. I called my mum and she said she never spoke to her. Then my girlfriend tried to merge the call with my mum. I was being manipulated and guilt-tripped. I started joking and said sure, my mum will send you eight hundred pounds, just to see her reaction. It all felt so fake and dramatic.

She had returned the birthday gifts I gave her recently, and now she is asking for the laptop she gave me a year ago. I’m tired. We are acting out of pain and pride. It has become tit for tat, and everything is now about what we owe each other instead of what we once felt.

Weeks ago she started talking about wanting to get married and said she wanted us to grow together. She said she wanted to get engaged in 2026. I just don’t see how that would be possible. In my head, I kept thinking we should really take a step back and think about everything before planning that far ahead.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 26, she’s 27, and I feel broken. We keep getting back together, but nothing changes. I have no stability, no peace, no safety. Is this even love? I keep asking myself, do I stay and try to fix it again, or is it finally time to leave for good?!",1,1748285375.0,relationship_advice,4,0.99,False

I just bought a 2009 fifth wheel , it will be parked on my land , with no shore power at the moment ( eventually , power will be hooked  at the end of next summer hopefully).

Me and my wife would like to have a little bit of confort for the time we are staying at the trailer.

Here is my needs ;

We won’t use heavy loads equipement (no AC, no microwave)
Basically , we will sleep , cook on the gas stove , and turn the furnace to heat at the end of the season ( we’re in Canada). Watch television on raining day and charge our phones , using the coffee machine.

I was looking at a solar setup , hooked on a 100ah Lifepo4 battery with a pure sine wave 1200w inverter .

Does a setup like this could be viable ?
The cost would be approx 750$Cad 
(Battery , inverter and Eco-worthy 200w solar kit) 

I would prefer to not spend a lot of money since shore power will be available someday.

I’m a beginner and just started my first worm bin using the 4 tray essential living composter. I started with 100 worms and the first two trays were doing great. A lot of breakdown, worms were getting bigger/multiplying, and I only fed them banana peels, coffee grounds, mango skins, avocado skins, and paper shreds/cardboard.  

The last tray consisted of a lot of bread and the same foods listed as above (except I put all of them in the freezer first to kill any insects as suggested by this sub). I normally aerate the tray every 2 days. Something went wrong because today, I opened the compost and flies just swarmed into my face. I have a ton of mycelium all over the place and now I have an infestation of flies (they’re not fungus gnats because the body is bigger and when you kill them, they seem to ooze a little blood?). I didn’t know what to do so I discarded the tray into my city’s compost bin. 

My question is (1) what are those flies and are the rest of my compost salvageable? (2) what did I mess up on and what should I do differently next time? I’ve attached some pictures of what I could get. Thanks for all your help!",3,1748285208.0,Vermiculture,3,1.0,False

This text is the seed of a torn and critical axiarchic ontology. At its core lies the intuition that suffering is not an accident nor a mere privation of some good (as in the Augustinian tradition), but a structural and constitutive dimension of being itself.

	•	Instead of seeing suffering as a privation or a deviation from being, the text posits that suffering is ontologically constitutive — part of the structure of being itself.
	•	The metaphysical framework of Christianity is seen as insufficient to explain the tragic, conflictual nature of reality.
	•	Pain, contradiction, and conflict are not merely empirical realities but ontological ones — they express the very mode of existence.
	•	Being as participation does not imply harmony alone; it also brings fragmentation, struggle, and insufficiency.
	•	Reality is not a seamless unity but fractured, and this fracture is not a fall from grace, but a primary metaphysical condition.
	•	Rejection of a merely moral problem of evil: Evil is not reducible to human agency or morality but reveals a rift within the very structure of being.
	•	Need for a new axiarchic ontology: Proposes a renewed framework that accepts and integrates suffering and division as ontologically primary rather than as obstacles to overcome.
	•	Any redemption must begin from this tragic ontology — a hope that does not deny the abyss but acknowledges it as part of the ground.

I’ve been giving some thought to the idea of the conversation and the coffee. It seems apparent that your schedule is overflowing with responsibilities and that your occupation stems largely from a proactive disposition—that you aim to allocate your time efficiently for each thing. I don’t wish, in any way, to disrespect that, nor to take from you what I believe to be your most valuable resource: your time, especially without offering anything meaningful in return. That’s why I’m sending this message, which serves as the first question and issue I would have raised. Because I understand that while reading this entire text is already a task, making the journey here and spending hours on this kind of reflection is an even greater one. So I write this and leave in your hands the decision of whether to come, to respond via message or audio, or to redirect me in some other way.

From the very beginnings of Western philosophical tradition, the problem of being has been inseparable from the question of the good. It is no coincidence that Plato conceived of the agathon as that which surpasses even being in dignity and causality. This idea became the cornerstone of much of later Christian metaphysics, which identified the fullness of being with the Supreme Good—that is, with God himself. This is the root of the ontology of participation: creatures do not possess being in themselves, but receive (or participate in) it from the one who is being itself (ipsum esse subsistens), in a descending hierarchy where closeness to the Absolute is measured not by position but by degree of reality. This doctrine allows for the vision of a world where everything that is, insofar as it is, is good—and that evil is not something in itself, but rather a privatio, an absence or failure to participate.

St. Augustine solidified this intuition in his well-known doctrine of the privatio boni, which holds that evil lacks its own substance; it is not a positive entity, but the corruption, deviation, or lack of the being that proceeds from God. Thus, in this tradition, the problem of evil is not so much an ontological wound as it is a moral and metaphysical one. God remains the cause of all that is—but not the cause of evil, because evil is nothing in itself, only the privation of the Good, and the highest Good is God.

This concept is, therefore, profoundly consoling as well as rational—but it suffers from a flaw: it clashes head-on with our direct experience of the created world. Creation, as it is presented to the senses, does not seem to reflect an order in which being coincides with goodness, but rather one in which being arises through negation, destruction, struggle, selection, and pain. The biological logic of the universe—from viruses to predators, from tectonic plates to human wars—shows us that existence is imposed by taking the being of the other to constitute one’s own, whether through donation or through forceful extraction. Rather than a luminous epiphany of fullness, existence seems to depend on the constant death of previous forms; the being of one demands the non-being of another, and all identity appears to be born from the tearing apart of a prior totality.

This opens an abyss between Christian ontology and the reality it attempts to explain. If the world was created ex nihilo by a God who is Good and cannot will evil, how can we explain that the totality of His creation is structured according to a logic of conflict, suffering, and the fragmentation of beings for the benefit of others? Wouldn’t it be more honest to acknowledge that creatures are thrown into a world whose being is marked, from the start, by rupture and loss? Doesn’t creation testify not to a participated fullness of Good, but to an agonizing struggle to seize, preserve, and dominate being through pain? By preaching a morality based on charity, surrender, compassion, and the salvation of the weak, Christ seems to propose a discourse that contradicts the very ontological conditions of the created world—as if trying to overlay a framework of redemption and tenderness upon the cruel structure of reality.

Is Christ proclaiming a revealed truth that contradicts being, or is He denying being in the form of hope? Is Christian morality a call to transfigure the world, or an impotent rejection of its deepest truth? If God has left His imprint on creation, that creation seems to speak a very different language than the one the cross seeks to teach us.

One could say that all of reality is sustained not on the firmness of self-sufficient essences, but on the strained and painful abyss of constant mediation between beings that are not self-sufficient, that do not resolve into a harmony without remainder, but remain open, torn, and conflicted—as if each entity, in giving itself, also negates itself in the same gesture; as if its being consists precisely in withdrawing it from another, in seizing it, in affirming itself as the center at the cost of another’s periphery.

And in this exchange of constitutive negations, what we call being is nothing other than the very field of this struggle—a web of mutually necessary exclusions and inclusions, inevitable mediations in a world of unequal participation in what, never being a “thing” or “substance” as the finite is, reveals itself as the Good in its fullness of being. But not as a sentimental or moralizing goodness, rather as a structuring principle whose historical and concrete manifestation occurs through selection, suffering, extinction, sacrifice, surrender, and tearing apart—just as much as through the love that gives life or the giving of oneself for the good of another (for instance, a mother who, during gestation, redirects nutrients from herself to her child).

Thus, the degree of truth or reality of something can only be measured by its capacity to inhabit that plane of mediations where being is given and taken, where it is affirmed in proportion to its ability to assert itself over what it negates—not as arbitrary domination, but as deeper participation in the very principle of ontological unfolding, which cannot avoid being painful. Every generation is also a separation, every affirmation implies privation, and everything that is, is so at the cost of something else ceasing to be, or being less.

Therefore, the consciousness that asks about evil and injustice should not look beyond being but deeper into it, because injustice—or what we call injustice in an effort to protect ourselves from what causes us pain—is not an accident, but a form of the unfolding of “fallen” being—or rather, being in its natural state. In this view, biting the fruit and falling into concupiscence is not a mythical event that breaks a prior harmony, but something that develops from the very condition of the real, its basic ontological constitution.

The Edenic seems, in this sense, to be a symbol of a metaphysical longing for a fullness that was never given in time, but acts as a regulative ideal to which all moral consciousness refers—yet which remains trapped in its own structure. Because when Being reaches its highest degree of mediation—forming as full human consciousness after a long and painful process of evolution and sublimation—and this human consciousness becomes aware of itself as a form of everything else, it then expresses, through religion, the fundamental impulse to transcend its own finitude. But in doing so, it finds itself in conflict with all that precedes it, as if Being, in thinking and elevating itself, comes to despise its own path—becoming hostile to the very journey that gave rise to it.

And it is here that the drama of the creature reaches its climax: because in sensing the trace of the Absolute within itself, it cannot help but experience its difference from it as guilt or rupture.

For this reason, the doctrine of concupiscence, while astute in diagnosing a constitutive fracture in the human soul, fails to grasp that this fracture is more original than any sin—for it lies in the very being of the created, whose finitude is not a mere limit, but a tragic condition that makes all existence a constant transgression, an effort to be more, to not remain what one is, to affirm oneself beyond the very limit that constitutes it. And the paradox is precisely this: that spirituality is nothing more than another impulse of the finite to transcend itself—from the lowest level to the highest.

Thus, evil, far from being an accident or deviation, appears to be the very mark of the movement of finite being, which only accesses itself through mediation with the other, and cannot take a step without wounding, excluding, or depriving another of its being—or at least its fullness. And it is this structure that throws into crisis every attempt to translate the Good into the language of compassion or non-violence. Because in the logic of being, the Good is revealed not as care for the weak, but as affirmation by the one who bears the weight of mediation and does not fear being an instrument of pain if it means intensifying their participation in being—just as much as by the negation of the one who gives themselves for the other (such as a mother offering herself in gestation).

If Darwin glimpsed some of this when he saw nature as a battlefield where the strong prevail mercilessly—not out of gratuitous cruelty, but structural necessity—then his apparent rejection of God could be read not as a denial of the Absolute, but as a protest against a theology that has forgotten what being reveals in its raw facticity, that has sought to dress in charity what all of reality proclaims as law. And in doing so, it merely projects a human desire onto the impassive backdrop of the cosmos, calling evil what is in fact the very mode of finite being’s self-disclosure.

Thus, it is not enough to say that suffering purifies or that trials strengthen faith. That may be true, but it still doesn’t answer the question: why must being only be given in such a painful way? Why is the Good revealed through tearing, and why does every mediation imply rupture, and every truth require violence?

All of this sometimes leads me to wonder whether the only possible answer lies not in the consolation of Christianity but in the philosophical acceptance that being cannot unfold any other way—that there is no alternative to this finite manifestation. And perhaps the game that God plays with His creatures is not that of a loving Father, but of an Absolute Intelligence that can only manifest itself through a reality whose structure of mediation necessarily implies wounding, rupture, and death as conditions for love, consciousness, and spirit in the highest forms of Being. And in this, it plays a game with its creatures that is somewhat macabre.

Christianity seems like a broken promise in the face of the bitter density of being. For though it is built upon intuitions of immense nobility—such as the dignity of the soul, the redemption of suffering, or the triumph of grace over sin—these promises seem to be articulated from within a metaphysics that fails to account for the innermost structure of real, particular being. And so it resorts to using these principles as an escape—choosing to look away from being itself. Like ostriches burying their heads in the sand at the sign of threat, Christian thought tends to retreat into transcendent formulas that deny or sugarcoat the brutality of ontological mediation.

Instead of confronting the tension that tears at being, it represses it with images of original harmony and final restoration—the comfort of believing that what the world reveals is merely a passing scandal, not the very way in which being is constituted. But just as one can sense the imprint of the Creator in the beauty and order of creation, in everything in existence that morally or existentially pleases us, the same exercise can be done with the ugliness of existence.

In this sense, Christianity appears insufficient to face the most profane realities of the world with courage. It’s not that these things disprove God, but rather that the God proposed by this theology doesn’t seem to inhabit the densest zone of the real, but rather an imaginary beyond that serves as consolation or postponement—not a true explanation.

Christianity, by trying to take the most beautiful part of life (comfort, redemption, compassion) as the whole, ends up castrating itself as a system of thought. It eliminates conflict as a primary form of being from its horizon, treats the wound as punishment rather than structure, and thus is disarmed before death and evil—as if the ultimate scandal were not that the world is wounded, but that this wound is the world itself.

There are many other doubts to raise about the Catholic faith—such as the matter of demons and angels, sacraments, its symbolic apparatus, and the role of suggestion and psychological projection, which sustain much of its historical and spiritual effectiveness. None of this denies its power; on the contrary, it is an attempt to think it through to the very end, even when that thinking is uncomfortable, even when it leads where faith doesn’t want to go.

And if being is given as a tear, then any religion that seeks to tell the truth of the real must know how to dwell within that tear without fleeing from it. Anything else is to construct a hope that denies its object, to bear witness to a God without a world, a Good without being. And in doing so, Christianity risks denying the very world it seeks to save. Because Truth can only be the Whole, and God can only be the Absolute—which means nothing can be conceived above or beyond Him. A God who turns His back on the profane grants a certain aseity to profanity itself—a partial God who is necessarily castrated in relation to His own creation.

I hope this text isn’t bothersome. My only aim is to unravel this knot, among many others, that keeps me from practicing the Catholic faith. I deeply appreciate the time and effort it takes to read it. A heartfelt embrace.",0,1748285149.0,CatholicPhilosophy,5,0.33,False

A God who turns His back on the profane grants a certain aseity to profanity itself—a partial God who is necessarily castrated in relation to His own creation.

IT BEGAN FOR HIM ON the night of July fifth. He had cleaned, of course, but still found bits of paper and plastic wrappers—those ripped from the bodies of small fireworks—on the concrete footing of the backyard, and he still almost caught a whiff of their hot sulfurous odor from within his house and backyard and from those of his neighbors. He knew it wasn’t really there, that it was only a particularly persistent memory, and in truth it was only *almost* a smell, yet he disliked it. Those wafts of an almost organic odor.

There had never been a woman in his house—not one that stayed and gave it a “touch”, anyhow. His longest relationship (more often than not, these things could only be called encounters) had lasted perhaps two months, and he had only invited her to stay a handful of times; most of their encounters had been at her place. On the surface, he had not quite driven her away, but of course, he had. To both of them, it had seemed more a mutual diversion of desire, both physical and emotional, but of course, it was even more mutual on his end. It could be seen in his house, in its decorum and cleanliness, that it did not particularly *need* a woman’s touch. All things had their place, and all were in them. He allowed no pets in for longer than a few hours. No smoking, of course, save for in the backyard. No children to run and break things, to spill on the carpet, to track in dirt and mud and trouble. Clean, it was—tidy and ordered and right.

But that smell…somehow, it was persistent. Somehow, the zipping and spinning colored firebombs and the crackling faux dynamite and the rocketing tubes of the previous day were still there in that smell. Odd, it was, but not yet alarming.

He had a meal of steak—blue rare—Potatoes Romanoff, asparagus sautéed in butter, and a deep crimson Pinot noir. He ate in silence save for his chewing and the clink of fork and knife on white china. His thoughts went around and about, though lazily, as sated as his mouth and stomach were. It was not until he was washing up and putting all the dishes he’d used away that he noticed them, for then, they were naught but seen. In that first moment, they did not itch, nor did they have any texture. Yet, they were there: six orange-red dots on the heel of his right hand, nestled between the two shallow creases that descended from the middle of his palm and nearly connected where his hand ended and the wrist began. The dots had a pattern that was almost that of a star shape, a pentagram, arranged around one slightly larger one in their center.

He cocked his head, idly wrapping the towel in his other hand about the silver ring it always hung on. Using the index finger of his other hand, he rubbed at the series of dots. They did not smear, as if they were some spattering of juice from his steak or errant red wine, nor did they have any depth or protrusion, as blemishes upon the skin would have had. There was no deep itch of irritation, no localized warmth of inflammation that would have given them their color. They were only a flat, really only vaguely colored pattern on his skin, perhaps a quarter-inch across. He took the area of flesh between his thumb and index and squeezed lightly. No tactility, no pain, no shifting of puss or blood underneath.

Despite having cleaned his hands with soap and hot water already, he put them under again. Pale pink hand soap turned to a slick white froth under his scrutiny, and steam rose in light rivulets from the sink and brought a clean and fruity aroma to his nose; yet even after almost a minute, the spots remained, unaltered. Whatever they were, they were insoluble. Not dirt, not grease, not anything but dots. An allergic reaction then? Something he had touched in the last hours, some insect that had crawled into his bed and tasted of him? The thought concerned him, more for the concept of an infestation, rather even than the molesting of his person, unseen until now, until these…dots. And what would make such marks, anyway? What pincers or stinger would, with their jabbing, produce such a pattern?

A resurgence of that acrid smell—that of spent fireworks—saved him from further thought. More frustrated now at its phantom persistence, he flicked water from his hands and snatched at the towel, twisting his hands within it and peering around his kitchen with narrowed eyes. Nose forward and flared, the dots briefly forgotten, he sought out the odor. He looked in the trash cans, both interior and exterior, in the shrubbery that bound his backyard, near and under the patio chairs and table, even in the charcoal grill. He did this all with a small flashlight, as the sun had gone again from the world, and he did it with that smell growing somehow stronger with each avenue checked and rechecked.

No charred stub of sparkler or firecracker. Not even an excessive amount of residue where they had set the cardboard tube launchers. Nothing. The smell was simply everywhere, with no discernable origin to be cleaned. He locked his doors, turned off his lights, and ascended his stairs to shower and find his bed.

The water fell over him, hot and wonderful, and it drew from his skin dried sweat, dirt, dust, particulate, and dead cells. Oil came off, and sweet-smelling lotion went on, for that moment pushing away the smell, and he came from the tub a new man, clean and relaxed and flexible, like a freshly steamed felt hat, ready to be reformed perfectly.

That was, save for the star of red-orange dots that had faltered not a whit with his cleansing.

For a long time, he stood in front of the mirror, bathroom door ajar on the dark upstairs hallway, steam and light flooding out, naked as the day he was born, only staring at those dots and prodding at them. Their color had deepened, though whether of their own accord or only with the ubiquitous subcutaneous flush of his skin, he did not know. And was there something more there now? Was there that itch he had expected? The buzz of one’s body sending a signal of wrongness?

He could not tell.

He read from a medical text for a while by lamplight, sitting in his bed with the pillows propped behind his back, consciously dismissive of the dots on his hand each time he turned a page. In truth, the words on the pages went in the front of his head and exited the back, unchanged, uninterpreted, but he did not draw the pages back and reread; he didn’t even think to.

At some point, he turned out the light, pulled the coverlet up, and rolled onto his side, his left hand rubbing at the palm of his right. There was no light to see the dots, and they grew no texture for his fingers to feel as he fell into the grip of torpor, yet still he saw them as they had first appeared: that flash of red-orange color against his skin. That image remained even as the world of his mind fell from boiling grey cloud into sparkling yellow-shot night and then into the ever-present black void of sleep.

 

He is twelve again. He is small and pale and indrawn, yet he is quick of body and mind. He is about the task never taught him, never shown him, yet that he is so proficient in and that so engrosses him. He has found the wounded albino rat, its two hind legs made limp and useless by a passing car or an angry stamping foot, or perhaps by some degenerative disease unknown even to rats. It squeaks and wriggles as he grasps it by its hard whipping tail, as he runs with it to an even more secluded place. Its beady red eyes know not his plans nor his own inner workings; they know only that the rat has been harmed and that it will be harmed further. And for all that it is broken and defunct, it fights on, and he is only saved from its sharp infected teeth by his thin yet robust leather gloves.

It fights on as he cleans his work area, as he lays it back and uses the nails to pin its legs, both working and not, to the stump of the tree. It fights on, for a time, as he goes to work with the scalpel. Yet, just as all other subjects he has had, as all else he has tried, its entirety falls as limp and useless as its hind legs; its eyes darken from a bright scarlet to a crimson like drying blood; its head hangs and blood drips from the incision he made, matting its hair and bringing a soft pink to its paleness. And he only stares at it, black eyes locked on its red ones, having seen the death and now only looking for the rest, for the after…but of course, there is no after. There hasn’t been thus far, not in any of his subjects. There is only this draining, this egress of a life that he himself does not seem to feel.

He cuts the head from the rat carefully, dismembers it otherwise, and places the head first in a small plastic bag and then into the case with his tools. It is as he clips the black leather case closed, that he sees the dots on his palm. It is then that some part of him knows this to be a dream, a look into a childhood rife with frustrations, confusions, dark urges, and naught else. It is with those dots that his mind comes up and forward, forward through his adolescence and his growth toward the dichotomy, the face man and the inner man. For all that it is a twelve-year-old boy with a rat’s blood staining his fingers that peers at those dots, it is also a man of twice that age looking at slowly dilating black cavities, red around their rims with not his blood, but with some thin alien fluid that freezes and burns in the same moment, that lays into him a black prickling numbness while causing also a bone-deep ache.

The child snatches the scalpel and begins to cut.

 

He awoke with a start and with a fear hitherto unknown to him, evident in the sweat that lay in slick sheets on his skin and his quick drawing of breath. Immediately, he was aware of the sharp pain in his right palm, and his other hand flew to it, rustling the coverlet in its haste and bringing a waft of hot fear-smelling air to his nose. What had been sharp pain, however, was now a dull thumping with the same rhythm of his heart, and his prodding was met not with the gashes he had expected, but only what he knew to be those dots, now six hardly distinguishable lumps, like a tiny nest of ready pimples. He tested them with his fingers, emitting a whimper unlike any sound he had ever produced, and then, with a shaking hand, he reached for the bedside lamp.

Squinting at the light and sitting up, his eyes were met with that same star shape he had seen hours before, though now grown in diameter by perhaps an eighth of an inch, the dots orange-red color now rosier, more filled with blood. Like acne, the dots had grown heads that stood just underneath his flesh, though where the heads of pimples were almost always white, these were jet black and taught, like minuscule drops of crude oil administered by the head of a pin.

Like a spider’s eyes….

He sat and stared at them for a while, noting the ache of the area, and the itch that was more mental than physical: a need to touch and squeeze them, a need to test them. Finally, he did so, grasping the amalgam between index and thumb and squeezing, lightly at first, but with more vigor when met with little more pain and no visible change. With a grunt, two of the six popped with equal pain and relief. A black ooze pooled around the other four blemishes, and he squeezed harder, his face scrunching. The rest popped, nearly audibly, and that black liquid dripped down into the crease where his wrist met his hand and slicked the squeezing fingers of his left hand, staining everything like ink. He only sat and breathed, lightly flexing the hand with the dots that were now holes. Those holes…they themselves seemed to pulse with the beat of his heart. Not only did he see the flesh around them thumping minutely from his attack, but the cavities themselves seemed to breathe, to bleed that black ichor. An insect bite, as he suspected…surely. It had crawled in the night before, while he slept, or perhaps even earlier, and with some movement of his, had felt threatened enough to lash out and bite him, loosing some venom or poison that had only now been dealt with.

He was not sickened easily, or often, and only achieved that emotion with threats to his own body’s well-being, or to the order and organization of the things he deemed within his control. He felt it now, however, for this was both.

The oil washed mostly away under a stream of hot water in the bathroom sink, but there continued an oozing of it from the offending cavities, a slow welling in and spilling over from each, and yet more as he squeezed. It did not seem that the flow would stop; it only continued to darken the flowing water. Whatever it was, whatever had worked its way under his skin and had now been expunged, smelled. It stank, in truth, filling his nose, quite volatile despite its lack of volume. It stank like…well, he wasn’t sure just what it was like. It was somewhat like blood, yet somewhat not, somewhat, indeed, like motor oil, yet not really that, either. More than either, it was a burned smell, a used explosives smell.

He stopped what had been monotonous and nearly thoughtless squeezing and cleaning of the holes. It was not easy to stop, but he did, instead planting the heels of both hands to the sides of the sink and forcing his head upward and outward. He closed his eyes and drew in breath ten times. Ten slow breaths that made up perhaps thirty seconds in all. The tension fell from his shoulders and hands and jaw, the sound of the water was now more calming, where before it had been goading, and the smell fell a bit from the air, or at least seemed to. There was still pain in his right hand, an ache truly up into the wrist now, yet he surmised it was mostly from his own constant prodding.

A normally prudent and intelligent man did not allow such fancies as had been running through his mind—the phantom smell, the holes breathing, the holes bleeding something that wasn’t of his body—to dominate his world. A man like that, a man like him, forced such superstitious thoughts and impulses back; they were for the lower beasts, both animal and “human”; they were not for the likes of him: the experimenter, the scientist. The surgeon.

He had to think…properly and concisely. He took more deep breaths. Whatever it was, the majority was cleared from his flesh. He would have to apply some ointment, perhaps, and bandage it, but in a few days the punctures would be no more, and that buzzing ache would be no more.

He applied the ointment, triple antibiotic, then covered it with gauze and wrapped his hand in flexible water-resistant tape. It was much too tight at first and squeezed almost painfully when flexed. He peeled it back one layer and reapplied it. All the while, he tried not to look at the holes he was covering up, tried not to really see them, and as first the gauze and then the tape darkened like tiny growing thunderheads, he tried not to see that, either. He put the sight of it and the feel of it—still painful, but more than that, prickling, *crawling*—out of his mind, as far away from him as was possible.

It was still deeply black outside his windows, and with the interior lights off, he was drenched in that blackness. It was still only three thirty-eight AM, as told by his digital bedside clock, and though he lay down and curled in on himself, as was most comfortable, he did not sleep again that morning. He finally gave up on trying to at about four forty-five, rising and flicking on lights as he went down to start coffee. He’d programmed it to begin its boiling and dripping at five thirty, but now he bypassed it, and soon coffee was bubbling and dripping, the only sound to break the silence of the prematurely lit world.

Coffee did not help, nor did the sun. His day was spent in a haze whose like was unknown to him, a haze of childlike thoughts, and indeed thoughts of his childhood: unbidden recollections of experiments and dodged authorities, both of which had the texture of reality more than memory. They were quite nearly physical manifestations of sound and image and thought. Where before he pondered not on clues and evidence left, on other’s routes of investigation and profiling, now he did. While seeking out the stench of spent fireworks, while drawing in yet more of it with each and every breath, and while digging with fingernails at the bandage and his darkening wrist and not alleviating that frantic buzz, that itch that was further beneath his skin than any bone or vein or lymphatic vessel, he sought out the origin of the odor. His actions and his paranoia were fueled equally by the images of old bodies burned in shallow graves, leaving only parts and organs and appendages to the world, and by the cursed stench that filled the air, that filled the world. They knew who he was and what he was. His neighbors with their grins as fake as his own, yet mimed out of fear rather than loathing, his coworkers with their laconic, reserved speech only around him, his adversaries the police detectives, his adversaries the incurious and impassive sheep of the world—those who knew not the depth of life, nor had the capacity to take it and revel in its taking—his adversaries the normal; they all knew, for he had left something astray, left something out and open to the scrutinous eye of the world. He had let them in, and they had taken their use of him, had impelled, with their venom-dripping fangs, a curse upon his body and mind. They had all come in and put holes in his story, holes in his order. Holes in his body.

In both the digging into his flesh and the uprooting of his ordered home, he found nothing but a further itch, yet the pain of both mixed with the pleasure of digging, of exploring, of routing out the invaders who had planted evidence of spent powder and decaying flesh. Laughter bubbled and flew from him, his mumbling turned to shouts at phantoms. His breath came hard and ragged and quick, and still the stench of all his burned experiments was wrung from the very air, and still the clattering of their blackened bones berated his mind.

It was with the movement within him that he was brought back to some semblance of reality, brought back to the sights and sounds and smells and textures of the present. It was a writhing unmotivated by any impulse of muscle, any jolting of tendon. With breath and heart quickened to the pace of a sprinter, with lungs so choked by that stench as to be asthmatic, he looked down at his hands, one with its nails blackened and sticky with blood, adhesive, and a black jelly; the other half-curled and trembling. The holes had grown to encompass half of his palm, each the diameter of a dime, though cavernous and shiny black rather than flat and silver, and still they made that pattern on his flesh: a star around a larger central hole. His mouth was as open and as cavernous as each, his tongue a fat, lazy rat between his teeth. He found, for a wonder and for the first time in his life, that there were tears in his eyes, bringing a shimmer to the image. Blinking, he looked on, and as his vision cleared, he saw the culprit of that movement, that writhing.

Rising slowly from within those pulsing holes in his palm, beginning only as dots of grey-white, were thick worm-like things with bulbous, slightly conical heads, like gargantuan spermatozoa. They were smooth and pallid, almost fleshless, marred not with veins, tubes, mouths, or eyes, and they danced in their homes in his flesh, swirling and knocking at the sides of the holes, swaying like snakes, or indeed like worms testing the air for moisture. The one in the center, just as its hole, was larger by a noticeable degree, though it was no different otherwise. They rose and grew until they filled the holes, plugging them with their tear-drop heads and only continuing to writhe. Christ, he could feel it, could feel them, from the surface of his flesh, down into his wrist and perhaps further. It seemed, with any minute movement of his fingers and the subsequent movement of the tendons and ligaments within his forearm, that the area was fuller than it should have been, as if packed with almost twice its intended volume of meat and blood.

There was a sound coming from him, a low whimpering groan that began deep in his lungs and rose outward, turning quickly to a hoarse shout. For another moment, he only stared, another shout brewing and boiling in him, and as it came forth, he grasped with a shaking hand the center worm by its head. It was as unyielding as a hard rubber tube, and tried to dart back at his touch, though with a frantic pinching, he was able to keep it in tow. With short, staccato screams now, high-pitched calls like a wounded dog’s yipping, he yanked at the worm. It wouldn’t come; the shape of its head wedged it in the rim of the cavity. He yanked harder, and with a slight tearing of flesh and a flash of white-hot pain, it came out enough that he could get his fingers around the stem-like body of it. The others slunk backward, seeming to coil up an inch within, bulging his wrist as if it were horribly inflamed. Pulling now as if cinching a knot, the muscles of his left arm bulging and shivering, he felt something deep in his right forearm pop and let go. In the same moment, the worm came free and began immediately to wither and grow limp, drying up and curling as if left out beneath a desert sun to bake. He dropped it on the floor and, still screaming—though now with a glee in violence like some ancient hominid, almost a hooting—he stamped on it over and over. It was like stepping on a thick rope, and it rolled under his foot, emitting the dry crackling of a snake’s shed skin.

He had to get at the others, had to pull them all out by their alien roots and see them wither and die. That, and that alone, would relieve him of this horror. Yet they knew, and they had hidden themselves in his flesh. For all that they had no eyes or mouths or noses or ears, somehow—by some telepathy, perhaps—they knew their host to be an ungenerous one and had retreated. They still writhed in there, however: worms wriggling, snakes slithering.

He started for the kitchen, stepping over the upturned chairs and table in his dining room, over two plants knocked free of their pots and uprooted from their soil, over all his ordered things turned out of their rightful places in cabinets and drawers and shelves, turned out and strewn about the floor. What he sought had been in a drawer across from the range, tucked away along with digital thermometers and other such kitchen implements. Clenching and unclenching his fists, hatefully aware of the burning itch beneath those holes, his heaving breath coming through clenched teeth, he searched and kicked through the mess. Finally, he found it and bent to swipe it from the floor.

A butane kitchen torch, for searing crème brulée or charring vegetables…or popping the heads of rancid alien invaders. With his left hand, he held it, turning the little knob on the back and pushing it in to light it with his right. The gas hissed out, flashed blue and went out once, twice, thrice, and then shot into life on the fourth click. He gazed at it for a moment, hearing that little roar of fire and feeling a smile crawl up his face at that blazing blue cone, tipped with a sputtering orange-white ring at its front, like a little dragon. Then he began to breathe quickly through his mouth, shaped as if to whistle. He had to do it, and before he lost his nerve.

He felt the glow of heat much before that sputtering blue tip of fire touched his flesh, yet he pressed on. There was a small sound coming from the holes in his flesh, like the churning of some thick fluid or like the simmering of a sauce. They had to come out. The temperature just under his skin, where they held themselves, must have been in the hundreds now, for his wrist was bubbling and blackening. The pain was horrid, unimaginable, and exquisite, yet he pressed on. His left eye twitched uncontrollably, his teeth were bared to the gums, and he could feel something in his right hand—the nerves in there, he was sure—crying out, but also dying, popping in the heat like kernels of corn.

More suddenly than he would have thought possible, the small desperate writhing that was each of those worms shying away from the heat ceased. He threw the torch—still lit—into the sink; he could deal with it in a few minutes, and it would not hurt the steel too badly. He had done it! The palm of his right hand was a black ruin, charred and bubbling and already curling in on itself like a dead spider, and those holes curled outward, cracked and mushroomed like the exit holes of large caliber bullets…but he had done it. Those things were dead in his flesh now, likely drying up as the first one had done. He could pluck them out and bandage himself. He had beaten them.

There was a sort of sucking, a vacuous inward movement as fast as an opening airlock. Five nearly distinct lengths of something, like flexible rods, shot down his wrist as he looked on and shouted in surprise. He felt them burrowing and wriggling up his arm, marked at each further inch by a ring-like engorging of flesh and a growing flare of agony. His torso and shoulders tensed instinctively and immediately, yet the rest of him went limp for a second, and he fell onto the edge of the sink, grunting and gritting his teeth against the pain. Further and further, they burrowed, up into his elbow now, following no easy path; they were ripping through muscle and fat and sinew, one curling around and between the heads of his biceps. The pain was utterly wild, unlike anything he had ever experienced. Alternately babbling to himself and screaming at the invaders within him, he shot his eyes frantically around, found what he sought, and moved left, snatching the long knife from its nestled place amid others in a wooden block. It was for the carving of meat, thin enough to be dexterous and sharp enough to move like liquid around fat and sinew and silver skin. It was hand forged and polished to a near mirror shine. It was perfect for the job.

They were nearly up to his shoulder now, spread almost equally around the circumference of his arm. With a cry, he slashed with the blade at the lump on his anterior deltoid. It dug in almost half an inch and would have hit bone if not for sticking halfway into the hard rubber-like body of the alien worm. As it was, he had to tug it free of his flesh. He had hit it, but the thing still writhed onward, faster now. He cursed it and slashed again, harder and with better aim. Twin rivers of crimson began to flow and drip from his raised arm, but that lump had stopped. He could feel and see it shrivel up under his skin, but he wasted no time in revelry. There were still four in him, two almost to his back, one with its head just past the upper connection of the medial deltoid. And one currently in his armpit. He chose to strike at the last, for he surmised it meant to dig into his abdomen, perhaps the chest cavity or the lungs. In truth, they all were on that path, but that one was the furthest along. He swiped twice, knowing he had to aim by feel, and with each, he shouted in mingled pain and ecstasy. They wouldn’t get into him, not deeper. That one took three slashes to wither and die, and he wasn’t sure if he had hit the head; it could have been into his lung already for the hot breadth of pain on his right side. He went for the uppermost worm next, and despite turning the top of his shoulder into a field of ragged red furrows, that one and the two on his back evaded him fully. They had made their trek and had sunk themselves deep again, like diving leviathans.

They were in him. Moving in him.

Screaming, he attempted to tear his shirt open. With only one working hand, and that one holding a blood-dripping knife, it took four tries before the buttons popped and his flesh was revealed. He could no longer see them, yet his eyes followed their paths all the same. One punctured his right lung from behind, and he could only tear impotently at the air. He began to splutter and cough, wet with blood that splattered from his mouth, as another of the worms found its way into some part of his lower abdomen, perhaps the intestine. The last, as he choked on blood and pounded his chest with his ruination of a hand, wormed its way closer to his heart, perhaps knowing its importance and perhaps not, for he felt it there, a physical thing curled against his hammering heart, yet it did not burrow in and end him immediately.

He would die; he knew it for a certainty. Already, pints of his blood had made a thick and slippery puddle on the floor. He had not taken a breath in seconds, and he would take no more unless he could plug up the lung. And that worm beside his heart would at some point grow bored, more likely curious, and bore through it, using the blood-slick arteries like a series of subway trains to the rest of his body. And would they mate? Would they spawn asexually an army of themselves to, at some point, grow from red-orange dots to cavities and then to grey-white worms whose rubbery skin could secrete an acid that dissolved flesh, like “piranha solution”? Were there already a few million eggs throughout his body, only waiting? Yes, he was sure of it all.

He held the knife in front of him, the quivering tip pointed toward his chest. He would die. Yet was it better to choke on his own blood or to be disemboweled by them or to have his heart popped…or to put the knife through the worm and through his aorta? Was this to be the last experiment, the ultimate one? Was he to find the after in his own heart? There was only one way to find out.

He took one more moment to aim, then plunged the knife.

 

**From the journal of Corporal Lee Warner, Markov County Police:**

 

 

*I wanted to be a writer, you know. I never was much good at it, and it never really took root, but it was fun. A lot more fun than this bullshit, I’ll say that. I guess that’s why I journal rather than go down to Monty’s and get sloppy six days a week like all the other “LEOs”. No Monty’s for me. Too expensive. And I’m like George Thorogood, anyway; I drink alone. Right here at home. Better that way. Better than being pulled over hours past midnight.*

*“You been drinking tonight, sir?”*

*“Hey, that’s my line!”*

*Yep, never really took root.*

*Long day today. I think when most people think about police detectives, they see some motherfucker in a trench coat, his glowing cigarette shielded from the downpour by his fedora, on the trail of some crazy bastard killer. And, of course, that motherfucker is the best detective out there. He does things his own damn way, and the brass hates his methods, but by Christ does he get shit done. He’s almost as crazy as the killer he’s chasing, but he’s got a weird sort of charisma and, of course, he gets the girl…. Fake shit. Storybook shit. (“Ooh, aren’t we bitter tonight?” “Fuck off and die.”) The job’s boring mostly in reality. Reports, reports, reports. File the evidence. Take the call. Drink the coffee. Eat the doughnut. Beat the wife, hardy-har-har.*

*Today, though. Today sucked the big one. Another thing they don’t really tell you about crime scene investigation: it fucking smells, man. Today it was…let’s see: piss, shit, burned hair, burned cloth, burned flesh—oh, and blood. So much god damn blood. I can still smell it over my own breath…and you could light a fire on the latter. The fire department called us after the neighbors called them, having seen smoke coming from the place. I guess I can be thankful for that. Otherwise, we’d have been called after the fucker plumped up with gas and then popped, stinking up the entire fucking neighborhood. Silver linings, Lee. Always the silver linings.*

*Suicide, undoubtedly. A pretty gruesome one, but I’ve seen worse. This guy, a surgeon (blind man could see the irony there) first burned the absolute shit out of his hand, then went about cutting his god damn arm off, fucking shanked himself, and then died falling into the sink where he had tossed the still-lit torch, turning himself into something of a pyre. Kind of funny if you don’t have to deal with it.*

*The house was torn up, but there was no sign of a break-in, and all his wounds seem to be self-inflicted, though we’ll have a better picture after the autopsy comes back in a few days. There were two odd things, however: almost perfectly round puncture wounds on the burned hand, and a grey-white powder in the air. Everywhere, like concrete dust almost. There was a pile of it on the floor, and there were more than just traces in the guy’s body. The lab might come back with something on it, but who knows. Doubt it matters, anyway; it wasn’t coke or anything.*

*Can’t say why he did it, not really, but it’s a good thing he did. Sounds bad, I know, but it’s the God’s honest. We were looking upstairs, and there was this custom cabinet sort of built in to the back of his closet. Cracked the lock and found some pictures. Drum roll please…kiddie porn and dead, partially dissected bodies, some adult, some the same kids he made pose. The two-for-one deal. The meal deal. Found the Polaroid the pictures were taken with, a small scalpel that one of our guys says is at least a decade old, and a dried rat’s head. We’ll probably find some body parts in his backyard or in some storage container. Fucking Hell, what a job.*

1kw24d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kw24d0/aitah_for_being_upset_my_bf_found_a_gift_for_him/,"AITAH for being upset my bf found a gift for him, called me to inform me and then said too bad?","So I 36F and my bf 38M live together. I had bought a coffee mug for him and put it in one my drawers. I could have hidden it better but the man does not go into my drawers and figured even if he did he probably would not notice it for whatever reason.
Fast forward to today. He recently visited me (im living abroad for a few months) and I sent him back with some of my clothes. He figured I'd reorganize my clothes when I got back so opened my drawers to find space to put said clothes away. Well turns out he opened the drawer with the mug. 
So he calls me.
Proceeds to, with a smile I see theough the call, recount step by step him going through every drawer trying to find enough space to put away my clothes. Then hes like 
""BABY I found the mug! ""
""Put it back please""
""No too bad! I found it im going to use it!""
""No, please put it back.""
""No! Why? It's your fault I found it since I was trying to find space to put your clothes away""
""It's not my fault. You're not going to use it. Put it back""
""No! Too bad! Youre being childish!""

Needless to say, the convo did not get better from there. I told him I didn't appreciate being told I was childish, and him refusing to place it back and saying too bad is childish. Also that him taking something that isn't his is wrong, not me asking him to put it back. He went on to say hes found out that a pattern that if things don't go how I planned for them to go, that I act ""this way"". I guess childish and firmly putting my foot down and saying no. He said he is within his rights since he called me to tell me about it - so he did nothing wrong since he called me right away to tell me he found it and is going to start using it. Oh and besides, I wouldn't know if he's used it or not so it doesn't even matter.

For reference: as a stocking stuffer I give him a 20oz/jumbo coffee mug of things he likes:games, shows, characters etc. They are, because of the size, surpringsly hard to come by and expensive. Some I have ordered custom some, like the aforementioned mug, I come across. So part from him not leaving a gift where he found it, even though it is very probable to be for him, I did not want to even with 6+ months find another stocking stuffer this year. Would it be the end of the world? No. Would it be the end of the world if he used it rn? No. I guess I just did not appreciate his entitled tone that because he found it he gets to keep it or general the convo.
I know this isn't the same thing as finding an engagement ring, but majority of people put the sock drawer back how they found it and don't mentioned finding the surprise. Even in Love Actually she put the gift back (sadly it wasn't for her).

(EDIT; I added a general summary/guide in the beginning for those not wanting to engage the whole of the text). 

Here it goes;

This text is the seed of a torn and critical axiarchic ontology. At its core lies the intuition that suffering is not an accident nor a mere privation of some good (as in the Augustinian tradition), but a structural and constitutive dimension of being itself.

	•	Instead of seeing suffering as a privation or a deviation from being, the text posits that suffering is ontologically constitutive — part of the structure of being itself.
	•	The metaphysical framework of Christianity is seen as insufficient to explain the tragic, conflictual nature of reality.
	•	Pain, contradiction, and conflict are not merely empirical realities but ontological ones — they express the very mode of existence.
	•	Being as participation does not imply harmony alone; it also brings fragmentation, struggle, and insufficiency.
	•	Reality is not a seamless unity but fractured, and this fracture is not a fall from grace, but a primary metaphysical condition.
	•	Rejection of a merely moral problem of evil: Evil is not reducible to human agency or morality but reveals a rift within the very structure of being.
	•	Need for a new axiarchic ontology: Proposes a renewed framework that accepts and integrates suffering and division as ontologically primary rather than as obstacles to overcome.
	•	Any redemption must begin from this tragic ontology — a hope that does not deny the abyss but acknowledges it as part of the ground.

I’ve been giving some thought to the idea of the conversation and the coffee. It seems apparent that your schedule is overflowing with responsibilities and that your occupation stems largely from a proactive disposition—that you aim to allocate your time efficiently for each thing. I don’t wish, in any way, to disrespect that, nor to take from you what I believe to be your most valuable resource: your time, especially without offering anything meaningful in return. That’s why I’m sending this message, which serves as the first question and issue I would have raised. Because I understand that while reading this entire text is already a task, making the journey here and spending hours on this kind of reflection is an even greater one. So I write this and leave in your hands the decision of whether to come, to respond via message or audio, or to redirect me in some other way.

From the very beginnings of Western philosophical tradition, the problem of being has been inseparable from the question of the good. It is no coincidence that Plato conceived of the agathon as that which surpasses even being in dignity and causality. This idea became the cornerstone of much of later Christian metaphysics, which identified the fullness of being with the Supreme Good—that is, with God himself. This is the root of the ontology of participation: creatures do not possess being in themselves, but receive (or participate in) it from the one who is being itself (ipsum esse subsistens), in a descending hierarchy where closeness to the Absolute is measured not by position but by degree of reality. This doctrine allows for the vision of a world where everything that is, insofar as it is, is good—and that evil is not something in itself, but rather a privatio, an absence or failure to participate.

St. Augustine solidified this intuition in his well-known doctrine of the privatio boni, which holds that evil lacks its own substance; it is not a positive entity, but the corruption, deviation, or lack of the being that proceeds from God. Thus, in this tradition, the problem of evil is not so much an ontological wound as it is a moral and metaphysical one. God remains the cause of all that is—but not the cause of evil, because evil is nothing in itself, only the privation of the Good, and the highest Good is God.

This concept is, therefore, profoundly consoling as well as rational—but it suffers from a flaw: it clashes head-on with our direct experience of the created world. Creation, as it is presented to the senses, does not seem to reflect an order in which being coincides with goodness, but rather one in which being arises through negation, destruction, struggle, selection, and pain. The biological logic of the universe—from viruses to predators, from tectonic plates to human wars—shows us that existence is imposed by taking the being of the other to constitute one’s own, whether through donation or through forceful extraction. Rather than a luminous epiphany of fullness, existence seems to depend on the constant death of previous forms; the being of one demands the non-being of another, and all identity appears to be born from the tearing apart of a prior totality.

This opens an abyss between Christian ontology and the reality it attempts to explain. If the world was created ex nihilo by a God who is Good and cannot will evil, how can we explain that the totality of His creation is structured according to a logic of conflict, suffering, and the fragmentation of beings for the benefit of others? Wouldn’t it be more honest to acknowledge that creatures are thrown into a world whose being is marked, from the start, by rupture and loss? Doesn’t creation testify not to a participated fullness of Good, but to an agonizing struggle to seize, preserve, and dominate being through pain? By preaching a morality based on charity, surrender, compassion, and the salvation of the weak, Christ seems to propose a discourse that contradicts the very ontological conditions of the created world—as if trying to overlay a framework of redemption and tenderness upon the cruel structure of reality.

Is Christ proclaiming a revealed truth that contradicts being, or is He denying being in the form of hope? Is Christian morality a call to transfigure the world, or an impotent rejection of its deepest truth? If God has left His imprint on creation, that creation seems to speak a very different language than the one the cross seeks to teach us.

One could say that all of reality is sustained not on the firmness of self-sufficient essences, but on the strained and painful abyss of constant mediation between beings that are not self-sufficient, that do not resolve into a harmony without remainder, but remain open, torn, and conflicted—as if each entity, in giving itself, also negates itself in the same gesture; as if its being consists precisely in withdrawing it from another, in seizing it, in affirming itself as the center at the cost of another’s periphery.

And in this exchange of constitutive negations, what we call being is nothing other than the very field of this struggle—a web of mutually necessary exclusions and inclusions, inevitable mediations in a world of unequal participation in what, never being a “thing” or “substance” as the finite is, reveals itself as the Good in its fullness of being. But not as a sentimental or moralizing goodness, rather as a structuring principle whose historical and concrete manifestation occurs through selection, suffering, extinction, sacrifice, surrender, and tearing apart—just as much as through the love that gives life or the giving of oneself for the good of another (for instance, a mother who, during gestation, redirects nutrients from herself to her child).

Thus, the degree of truth or reality of something can only be measured by its capacity to inhabit that plane of mediations where being is given and taken, where it is affirmed in proportion to its ability to assert itself over what it negates—not as arbitrary domination, but as deeper participation in the very principle of ontological unfolding, which cannot avoid being painful. Every generation is also a separation, every affirmation implies privation, and everything that is, is so at the cost of something else ceasing to be, or being less.

Therefore, the consciousness that asks about evil and injustice should not look beyond being but deeper into it, because injustice—or what we call injustice in an effort to protect ourselves from what causes us pain—is not an accident, but a form of the unfolding of “fallen” being—or rather, being in its natural state. In this view, biting the fruit and falling into concupiscence is not a mythical event that breaks a prior harmony, but something that develops from the very condition of the real, its basic ontological constitution.

The Edenic seems, in this sense, to be a symbol of a metaphysical longing for a fullness that was never given in time, but acts as a regulative ideal to which all moral consciousness refers—yet which remains trapped in its own structure. Because when Being reaches its highest degree of mediation—forming as full human consciousness after a long and painful process of evolution and sublimation—and this human consciousness becomes aware of itself as a form of everything else, it then expresses, through religion, the fundamental impulse to transcend its own finitude. But in doing so, it finds itself in conflict with all that precedes it, as if Being, in thinking and elevating itself, comes to despise its own path—becoming hostile to the very journey that gave rise to it.

And it is here that the drama of the creature reaches its climax: because in sensing the trace of the Absolute within itself, it cannot help but experience its difference from it as guilt or rupture.

For this reason, the doctrine of concupiscence, while astute in diagnosing a constitutive fracture in the human soul, fails to grasp that this fracture is more original than any sin—for it lies in the very being of the created, whose finitude is not a mere limit, but a tragic condition that makes all existence a constant transgression, an effort to be more, to not remain what one is, to affirm oneself beyond the very limit that constitutes it. And the paradox is precisely this: that spirituality is nothing more than another impulse of the finite to transcend itself—from the lowest level to the highest.

Thus, evil, far from being an accident or deviation, appears to be the very mark of the movement of finite being, which only accesses itself through mediation with the other, and cannot take a step without wounding, excluding, or depriving another of its being—or at least its fullness. And it is this structure that throws into crisis every attempt to translate the Good into the language of compassion or non-violence. Because in the logic of being, the Good is revealed not as care for the weak, but as affirmation by the one who bears the weight of mediation and does not fear being an instrument of pain if it means intensifying their participation in being—just as much as by the negation of the one who gives themselves for the other (such as a mother offering herself in gestation).

If Darwin glimpsed some of this when he saw nature as a battlefield where the strong prevail mercilessly—not out of gratuitous cruelty, but structural necessity—then his apparent rejection of God could be read not as a denial of the Absolute, but as a protest against a theology that has forgotten what being reveals in its raw facticity, that has sought to dress in charity what all of reality proclaims as law. And in doing so, it merely projects a human desire onto the impassive backdrop of the cosmos, calling evil what is in fact the very mode of finite being’s self-disclosure.

Thus, it is not enough to say that suffering purifies or that trials strengthen faith. That may be true, but it still doesn’t answer the question: why must being only be given in such a painful way? Why is the Good revealed through tearing, and why does every mediation imply rupture, and every truth require violence?

All of this sometimes leads me to wonder whether the only possible answer lies not in the consolation of Christianity but in the philosophical acceptance that being cannot unfold any other way—that there is no alternative to this finite manifestation. And perhaps the game that God plays with His creatures is not that of a loving Father, but of an Absolute Intelligence that can only manifest itself through a reality whose structure of mediation necessarily implies wounding, rupture, and death as conditions for love, consciousness, and spirit in the highest forms of Being. And in this, it plays a game with its creatures that is somewhat macabre.

Christianity seems like a broken promise in the face of the bitter density of being. For though it is built upon intuitions of immense nobility—such as the dignity of the soul, the redemption of suffering, or the triumph of grace over sin—these promises seem to be articulated from within a metaphysics that fails to account for the innermost structure of real, particular being. And so it resorts to using these principles as an escape—choosing to look away from being itself. Like ostriches burying their heads in the sand at the sign of threat, Christian thought tends to retreat into transcendent formulas that deny or sugarcoat the brutality of ontological mediation.

Instead of confronting the tension that tears at being, it represses it with images of original harmony and final restoration—the comfort of believing that what the world reveals is merely a passing scandal, not the very way in which being is constituted. But just as one can sense the imprint of the Creator in the beauty and order of creation, in everything in existence that morally or existentially pleases us, the same exercise can be done with the ugliness of existence.

In this sense, Christianity appears insufficient to face the most profane realities of the world with courage. It’s not that these things disprove God, but rather that the God proposed by this theology doesn’t seem to inhabit the densest zone of the real, but rather an imaginary beyond that serves as consolation or postponement—not a true explanation.

Christianity, by trying to take the most beautiful part of life (comfort, redemption, compassion) as the whole, ends up castrating itself as a system of thought. It eliminates conflict as a primary form of being from its horizon, treats the wound as punishment rather than structure, and thus is disarmed before death and evil—as if the ultimate scandal were not that the world is wounded, but that this wound is the world itself.

There are many other doubts to raise about the Catholic faith—such as the matter of demons and angels, sacraments, its symbolic apparatus, and the role of suggestion and psychological projection, which sustain much of its historical and spiritual effectiveness. None of this denies its power; on the contrary, it is an attempt to think it through to the very end, even when that thinking is uncomfortable, even when it leads where faith doesn’t want to go.

And if being is given as a tear, then any religion that seeks to tell the truth of the real must know how to dwell within that tear without fleeing from it. Anything else is to construct a hope that denies its object, to bear witness to a God without a world, a Good without being. And in doing so, Christianity risks denying the very world it seeks to save. Because Truth can only be the Whole, and God can only be the Absolute—which means nothing can be conceived above or beyond Him. A God who turns His back on the profane grants a certain aseity to profanity itself—a partial God who is necessarily castrated in relation to His own creation.

I hope this text isn’t bothersome. My only aim is to unravel this knot, among many others, that keeps me from practicing the Catholic faith. I deeply appreciate the time and effort it takes to read it. A heartfelt embrace.",0,1748284937.0,Catholicism,8,0.5,False
1kw21ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kw21ne/loverboy/,Loverboy.,"The motel reeked of copper and decay. Rain sheeted down like knives as Detective Caleb Voss ducked under the crumbling awning of the Red Lantern Inn. He didn’t bother with an umbrella. Let it soak him. Let the filth sink into his bones. After all, it wasn’t like anything could wash away what had already been done.

“Room 309,” a trembling rookie told him. “We… we didn’t touch anything.”

They wouldn’t have dared.

The room was a slaughterhouse masquerading as a love nest. The walls pulsed red with blood. Human skin hung like streamers across the ceiling fan, which slowly rotated, slinging droplets in a lazy circle. A man’s body sat on the edge of the bed, legs crossed like he was waiting for room service. No eyes. No lips. His heart had been torn out and placed inside a champagne bucket full of ice. A note sat beside it:

""For my forever, Caleb.""

Written in lipstick.

The mirror was smeared with another message, carved through condensation:
""DID YOU MISS ME, SWEETHEART?""

Caleb stared at it, his stomach knotting. He didn’t need forensics to confirm it. Loverboy had returned.

The third victim in two weeks. Each scene more grotesque. More personal. Each message signed with affection—and obsession.

And this time, he left a photo.

Caleb’s hands trembled as he picked it up.

It showed him. Sleeping. In his living room. Last night.

Timestamped 3:08 a.m.


---

Caleb’s house was dark. Too quiet. He kicked open the front door, weapon drawn. The air inside was floral. Wrong. Roses. A cheap, choking perfume. The kind you spray on corpses to hide the rot.

His recliner still held the shape of his body. On the coffee table, beside a burnt-out candle, sat another polaroid.

His daughter’s room. Ablaze. A tiny silhouette against the fire-rimmed window, her dollhouse melting into slag.

A scream twisted in his throat, but never came out.

Loverboy hadn’t just killed his family.

He’d watched them burn.


---

Three days later, the next body dropped. Inside a church. The victim—headless—was crucified against the altar. Choir music played on loop, warped and slow, like a dying lullaby. Candles surrounded him in a perfect heart shape. His wedding ring was sewn into his mouth. A bridal veil draped over his shoulders. A mannequin head wearing smeared lipstick crowned the corpse.

Inside his chest cavity, a cassette tape.

Caleb listened to it alone, behind locked doors.

The voice was high. Breathless.

""Will you finally love me now, Caleb? I did this for us. I made them pure.""


---

Sleep became a memory. Every night, he found new photos. One taped to the ceiling above his bed. One floating in his toilet bowl. One slipped inside a slice of bread. Always images of him—shaving, crying, screaming.

He was being watched.

Not just followed. Known.

One night, he found the words ""MINE FOREVER"" scrawled on his bedroom walls. In blood.


---

Then came the voicemail.

“Hi, my sweet Caleb,” said a voice like a child whispering through a vent. “I’m ready for our special night. I picked out the perfect dress.”

A rustling. Then giggling.

“I left a piece of her under your bed. Be gentle.”

He dropped the phone and fell to his knees.

Beneath the bed was a wedding dress—his wife’s. Folded like a corpse in a coffin. Inside the pocket: a human ear, still warm, with a tiny pearl earring.

His daughter’s.


---

The precinct’s lights flickered constantly now. Caleb barely recognized himself in the mirror. Hollowed eyes. Stubbled jaw. He looked more like a victim than a cop.

He gathered the files. Rewatched the crime scene tapes. Over and over.

Each message. Each pose. Each bloodied ballet of cruelty… it wasn’t random.

It was courtship.

Loverboy wasn’t trying to scare him.

He was trying to marry him.


---

That night, the lights in Caleb’s house didn’t work.

Every candle from his wedding sat burning in the living room. Wax pooled like veins across the hardwood floor.

A table was set for two. Wine. Steak. Rose petals soaked in blood.

Across from Caleb’s seat sat a man in a white tuxedo, his skin slick with sweat and red stains. He wore a porcelain mask—an angelic boy’s face with painted red lips and black, empty eyes.

“Happy anniversary, darling,” Loverboy cooed.

Caleb raised his gun. “Take. Off. The mask.”

Loverboy giggled. “Still shy?”

The mask came off.

Underneath was a face stretched too tight over bone. Familiar. Beautiful, once. Peter Lang.

A man Caleb had arrested a decade ago. Domestic abuse. Peter had survived by carving his abuser’s chest open with a carving knife. Caleb was the only one who treated him like a human being.

“You told me I deserved better,” Peter whispered. “So I became better. For you.”

“Jesus Christ,” Caleb whispered.

“No,” Peter said, standing, revealing a butcher’s knife soaked in pink glitter. “Just your husband.”

He lunged.


---

The struggle was primal. Screams. Blood. Flesh torn open. Caleb fired. Once. Twice.

Peter laughed even as the bullets tore through him.

“You never loved me!” he screamed. “You loved the idea of me! Of fixing me!”

He tackled Caleb through a glass cabinet. The candles roared. The house caught fire. Again.

Just like last time.

Caleb stabbed him with a broken bottle and didn’t stop until Peter’s face was pulp and bone.


---

When the firemen arrived, they found Caleb kneeling in the ashes, the house ruined.

Again.

On the wall, burned into the soot, was a final message.

""I’LL WAIT FOR YOU IN HELL, BABY.""

And beside it, untouched by flame, was one last polaroid.

Caleb.

Smiling.

Arms wrapped around his wife and daughter.

But in the background, just beyond the family…

A masked figure.

Porcelain face. Smiling.

Watching.

I never thought I’d be in this situation, but here I am 23 and three days into being homeless for the first time in my life. I was kicked out after a heated disagreement with my ultra conservative parents. I won’t get into all the details, but it ended with me being told to leave and not come back. And I'm newer to the area. It sucks, and I know I probably could’ve handled it better, but right now I’m just trying to survive and figure out my next steps.

I’ve got an old car, but it’s out of gas. I haven’t eaten a proper meal in days. I have a few changes of clothes, but nowhere to shower. I’ve been parked at a Walmart lot (, not in SF but near ish. My parents house is in SF and I'm trying to get back there to get some of my stuff) trying to stay safe and lowkey, but I’m starting to spiral. I don’t want to involve police or escalate anything. I’m not trying to burn bridges, but I also can’t go back.

I’m doing my best to stay hopeful, but I could really use help... Anything at all:

Are there any places with free showers or hygiene kits?

Where can I safely park overnight without getting towed or harassed?

Do you know of any food banks, soup kitchens, or churches that offer meals?

Any places that give out gas cards or help people with job-hunting stuff like clothes or showers?


I want to get on my feet, but it’s hard to apply to jobs when you’re hungry, exhausted, and feel gross. If anyone knows of local resources or has any advice, I’m all ears. If anyone is in a position to help with food, gas, or even a coffee, it would mean the world.

Thank you for reading this far. I’m trying to stay strong and not give up. Even just sharing this post helps more than you know.

Edit: it was suggested in DMS to add a way to receive funds if anyone is interested. I feel terrible asking for anything but I'm just not in a position where I can really do too much.

\
(Worthy Satire) - In a bold new prediction, Elon Musk proclaimed that by 2040, ""tens of billions"" of humanoid robots will populate the Earth — a number slightly higher than the planet’s total square footage and about 30 billion more than the current human population.\
\
“Humans are overworked,” Musk tweeted. “Robots don’t unionize, never need coffee breaks, and most importantly — they don’t launch three-hour podcasts about hustle culture.”\
\
Musk says the bots will be powered by Tesla software, run on Optimus energy cores, and come pre-installed with X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) so they can argue with each other in real time.\
\
When asked if humanity might feel threatened, Musk replied, “Oh, I think humans just need a long-overdue break — maybe a few decades off while the robots handle things.”\
\
The World Economic Forum applauded the move, saying it would allow humans to “own nothing, do nothing, and finally relax” — all while quietly drafting plans to run the world unchallenged by a society too lazy to notice.\
\
As for Musk? He’s reportedly developing the next big leap: a more efficient, less sleep-deprived version of himself called eLon-2.0 — freeing up the original to finally focus on planning his long-awaited escape to Mars.\
\
“I’m tired,” he said. “Let the bots figure it out.”\

(Worthy Satire) - In a bold new prediction, Elon Musk proclaimed that by 2040, ""tens of billions"" of humanoid robots will populate the Earth — a number slightly higher than the planet’s total square footage and about 30 billion more than the current human population.\
\
“Humans are overworked,” Musk tweeted. “Robots don’t unionize, never need coffee breaks, and most importantly — they don’t launch three-hour podcasts about hustle culture.”\
\
Musk says the bots will be powered by Tesla software, run on Optimus energy cores, and come pre-installed with X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) so they can argue with each other in real time.\
\
When asked if humanity might feel threatened, Musk replied, “Oh, I think humans just need a long-overdue break — maybe a few decades off while the robots handle things.”\
\
The World Economic Forum applauded the move, saying it would allow humans to “own nothing, do nothing, and finally relax” — all while quietly drafting plans to run the world unchallenged by a society too lazy to notice.\
\
As for Musk? He’s reportedly developing the next big leap: a more efficient, less sleep-deprived version of himself called eLon-2.0 — freeing up the original to finally focus on planning his long-awaited escape to Mars.\
\
“I’m tired,” he said. “Let the bots figure it out.”\
\
Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

And yes, I did get it from Gilmore Girls because I kin Rory Gilmore.

However, I've remebered recently my mum has some trauma around that name; she had a stillborn baby she'd wanted to call Rory. She told me this 10 years ago, but I do remember her saying that she thinks about that baby every time she hears that name. And it's upsetting, because Rory really does feel like my name at this point, but the last thing I want to do is put her through more pain every time she has to refer to me. It's a sacrifice I feel willing to make.

So; does anyone know any variations of or names that sound like/are close to Rory? The one I have gravitated most to is the Gaelic version Ruaridh (pronounced rur-ee). I'd also thought of Tori but I didn't like it as it felt too feminine, and Ronnie, which I could get behind, especially since I love Heathers and Ronnie is a shortened version of Veronica, the main character.

* Start drafting and editing essays EARLY if possible. Having my personal statement basically ready to go with some supplementals brainstormed before classes began enabled me to be ready to submit by October. I also made an essay writing/editing schedule for the summer and beginning of the semester. 
* If your LOR writers are professors, build as much rapport with them as possible, especially when you're not in class with them currently! This can be as simple as grabbing coffee. 
* Use any possible resources available for essay feedback: friends, family, supervisors, campus writing tutors/pre-law advisors, etc.
* Devote time to prepping for interviews. I used 7Sage's question bank and created bullet-points to brainstorm responses. Then, I ran mock interviews for myself just to practice answering questions organically. UChicago and HLS interviews are tough - they really grilled me on why I want to go to law school, why I want to go to law school **now**, and why I need a JD to accomplish my goals.

The admissions process is grueling, but **YOU CAN DO THIS**! Happy to answer any questions or chat :)

Throughout our journeys, we’ve carefully tracked every dollar spent. Previously, we shared similar travel reports from our trips across Europe and Asia.



One of our goals is to visit as many UNESCO World Heritage sites as possible. So far, we have explored 124 out of the 1,224 listed sites, which we’re proud to say is about 10%.



After working hard for decades and saving steadily, we now spend from our retirement savings and a modest income from social media. We cover all expenses ourselves, splitting costs where we can — accommodation, taxis, groceries, and so on.



We’re happy to answer any questions about our budget, destinations, or long-term travel lifestyle. Feel free to ask or send a direct message.



All amounts are in USD.



TOTAL SPENT: $8,076.58

Average per day: $49.86 over 162 days, which is $12.36 above our original daily budget goal of $37.50.



This total includes accommodation and flights.



Connectivity:

We used a RedteaGO eSIM card, which gave us reliable, affordable mobile data across multiple South American countries — no need to swap physical SIMs. Just $0.70/day for unlimited data



Expenses breakdown:



Accommodation $1715.10 – Mostly we stayed in comfortable, quiet guesthouses or small hotels with private rooms, suitable for a couple our age. We chose places with good reviews for accessibility and calm atmospheres. We still booked mostly through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) or Hostelworld when options suited us.



Activities $981.50 – We focused on gentle cultural experiences like museum visits, national parks with easy trails, and of course, UNESCO World Heritage sites. We avoided strenuous hikes and instead chose guided tours that were paced for seniors.



Alcohol $153.65 – We enjoy a glass of wine or local beer occasionally.



Coffee $81.36 – Mostly from cafes. My wife is a fan of Juan Valdez coffee and visited their shops regularly.



Food $1,024.92 – We mostly shopped at local supermarkets and markets for fresh produce, enjoying simple meals in our accommodations. We occasionally ate at local restaurants known for authentic cuisine but favored quieter, less touristy spots.



Health $129.30 – Sunscreen, medications, toiletries, and other essentials.



Misc $24.25 – Includes small fees like bathroom usage and other minor expenses.



Mobile Phone $91.66 – We bought local SIM cards in each country except Uruguay, where our eSIM sufficed.



Laundry $42.48 – We chose accommodations that offered laundry service to avoid heavy physical work.



Souvenir $20.46 – We collect magnets from each country as small keepsakes.



Local Transportation $611.83 – We mainly used taxis and reliable local buses or trams, avoiding crowded and uncomfortable public transport where possible.



Travel (inter-city/country) $1,839.11 – Long distance buses and flights. We preferred comfortable options with good legroom and reliability.



Our flight from the USA to Santiago, Chile was paid with airline miles.



Countries Visited and Highlights:



Chile (twice) – A beautiful but pricier country. We explored Patagonia and the Atacama Desert with a relaxed pace, taking in the stunning landscapes without rushing.



Argentina – Prices rose recently, but we enjoyed visiting cultural sites and nature. Buenos Aires was interesting, though we preferred quieter places like Peninsula Valdes, where we saw orcas.



Uruguay – The most expensive country we visited. We moved quickly through the UNESCO sites here. Friendly locals and lots of delicious meat.



Brazil – Our favorite country. The warm people, excellent food, and spectacular beaches made it a highlight. Rio de Janeiro was vibrant but manageable with careful planning.



Paraguay – A peaceful and quiet country. We enjoyed the calm of Asuncion and planned to explore more but visa requirements limited our time.



Bolivia – Affordable and stunningly beautiful. We spent three weeks in Sucre taking Spanish classes at a gentle pace, really enjoying the local culture.



Peru – The best food on the continent, in our opinion. We traveled mostly by bus between cities like Cusco and Lima, avoiding busy tourist spots for a more relaxed experience.



Ecuador – Underrated with breathtaking landscapes and welcoming people. Cuenca was one of our favorite cities. The Galapagos remain on our wish list for a future trip.



Colombia – Not our favorite, mostly due to rough bus rides and travel delays from protests. We did enjoy Medellin and Salento but weren’t fans of the local cuisine.



Favorite Countries:

Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia



Least Favorite Countries:

Hello! I've been growing this Jade for a few years now. My mom has a 16 year old one and this is a propagation from it, a branch that fell off in summer of 2023 that started growing little roots and we stuck in some soil, lol. I've been doing okay so far with it but I dont actually know what I'm doing, and I want to take better care of it. It hasn't ever been repotted yet, and it's definitely grown quite a lot since I first got it, but does anyone have any tips? I've been reading through this sub lately and am thinking about using coffee to fertilize it since that's something I've never done, and I'm putting it out in the sun more now, but I actually still can't tell how much I should water it and how often. Most things I've seen are ""a lot at once but not that often"" which is really not that specific. 

I live in zone 5 and have been putting it out in the sun lately on days that are warmer, since I read it shouldn't be out in cooler temperatures. It gets okay sun year round when it's on a shelf at my apartment's biggest window, which is east-facing, but it's very little direct sun. 

I've been having one issue lately - a few leaves slowly turning yellow and then dropping off. Is that normal? 

Any help or tips would be super appreciated, I want to take good care of it! Thanks!

So, a long, long, long time ago I wrote a silly little fanfic called Allegrezza. The brony community was good to me during a hard time in my life, and fanfic became my outlet. Over the years I closed off my socials or even shut them down, (in hindsight I regret just deleting my DA, but handing over ownership of my fics to Gravekeeper on [FIMFiction.net](http://FIMFiction.net) was a fun inside joke between us).

I would occasionally peek in on it, over the years since, and really smile that people still read it now and then. I don't think it's the best work out there, but well, I put a lot of myself into it at the time.

Anyway, I found out that Ministry of Image printed it in a compendium with a couple of other great stories. I have sadly missed the boat *so* horrendously that it's not even funny. It's no longer in print, I've reached out to a couple old friends and MoI themselves to see if there's the barest possibility that somepony, somewhere, has a copy that I could buy.

I cannot express how wonderful it would be to finally have in my hands this little story that I poured a year of writing into. That people thought it was worth printing made me tear up, but seeing people post pics of it on their shelf has made me just bawl.

If anypony can help this little dream come true, please reach out and we can work something out. <3

I read things and forget within 12hours.
I get super fixated on random thoughts (today, I spent the whole morning googling moisturisers).

I feel so sleepy when at my desk and need to pace around to feel awake.

I drink insane amounts of coffee, even if I’ve slept for 8 hours at night.

I collect many hobbies but never revisit them. I was convinced I’d learn to crochet, sew, knit, book bind, open a YouTube channel….

I like to cook but have never made the same recipe twice(unless it’s literally, rice).

I learnt keyboard from class 6 to class 10 and never finished a single song.
Never.

I get very easily annoyed even when my brain is screaming at me that it’s not reasonable.

I carry everything in my bag because otherwise I forget. 


My cheeks are scarred due to all the picking. I also pick at my fingernails, corners of the pages of my books, erasers, etc.

I recently went to a psychiatrist and they gave me anti anxiety medication but honestly I’m not convinced at all.

I would say I have too less anxiety. I don’t start to feel the pressure until it is literally impossible to finish the task.

I haven’t put away my clothes in drawers in the last two weeks. I just keep them on my bed.

I really need someone to either confirm or disapprove the diagnosis of adhd. 
An online consultation would be better since I don’t live in a metro city with access to psychiatrists who would even consider the fact that I may have adhd.

1kw1jps,https://i.redd.it/bhbxows1563f1.jpeg,The Union Carbide,"Interview: The Union Carbide – “This Is Not Performance. This Is Interference.”
Uncharted Magazine – Issue 217, May 2025
Conducted by Ezra Rafe

Meeting The Union Carbide is like stepping into a malfunctioning broadcast from a future industrial collapse. They arrive in partial disguise—goggles, grease-stained jackets, and what may be part of a discarded lab centrifuge strapped to one of their backs. They decline names, biographies, or any suggestion of hierarchy: “We are not a band. We are an event.”

We meet in an unlit concrete structure outside Fenland—possibly a grain silo, though one of them insists it’s “a post-anthropocenic resonance chamber.” There is static playing softly from a spool-to-reel tape loop of broken fan belts.

EZRA RAFE (Uncharted): You’ve been compared to Throbbing Gristle, Test Department, Einstürzende Neubauten, and Hantarash. Are those touchstones you claim?

UNION CARBIDE (collectively): Absolutely. Throbbing Gristle for dismantling music as a concept. Neubauten for turning demolition into expression. Test Dept. for militant rhythm. Hantarash for pure sonic terrorism. But you forgot The KLF. They taught us to burn institutions, both figuratively and literally. And unlike most academics, they meant it.

RAFE: And yet, your sonic materials don’t seem to come from traditional instruments.

UC: We’ve left instruments behind. Instruments imply rules. We work with expired apparatus, mostly pilfered—rescued—from the graveyards of knowledge. Hainbach was an early influence. His gentleness with obsolete equipment intrigued us, but we asked a different question: Will it noise?

We don’t “restore” anything. We rewire it into chaos. Tape machines loop field recordings of decaying universities. Oscilloscopes sing through rusted amplifiers. In Nil Ca-Borundum, we used a scorched laminar flow hood to generate sub-bass throbs.

RAFE: Your latest album has caused quite a stir. Some call it unlistenable.

UC: Good. If it were listenable, it would be complicit. Nil Ca-Borundum is the sound of structure refusing itself. It's a scream trapped in copper.

RAFE: Let’s talk about Fenland University College. Several of you were connected to it, and to Professor Jemima Stackridge, before your separation.

UC: We’ve said this before: we don’t reject Jemima Stackridge. We mourn her. She meant well—perhaps the last of the genuinely sincere academic visionaries. Her belief in performance as a philosophical force was noble. But she believed in refinement, in tradition. We believe in rupture.

Our real problem was with her mouthpiece: Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston. A careerist par excellence. The kind of person who plays synth drones in coffee shops and calls it “resistance.” She was always watching, always reporting, always trying to polish our noise into something respectable enough for conference brochures.

She talks about “timeless values.” We talk about radioactive half-lives. Her art is embalming. Ours is decay in motion.

RAFE: And the stolen lab equipment?

UC: Stolen implies ownership. Those machines were long dead—discarded, decommissioned, forgotten. We gave them new life, and they screamed. Fenland didn’t want them back until they made sound.

RAFE: What’s next for The Union Carbide?

UC: Live transmission from the former radar bunkers under the fens. No audience. Just frequencies, distortion, and what remains of the university’s comms array—once it’s ours. We’ll flood the airwaves with corrupted hymns.

RAFE: Final words?

UC: Academia seeks citation. We seek corrosion. You don’t need to understand. Just feel the voltage.

Editor’s Note: Members of The Union Carbide were arrested by university authorities days after this interview, following the destruction of several pieces of scientific equipment and a failed attempt to broadcast a sub-bass loop across the college chapel tannoy. Professor Stackridge has made no public comment. Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston has issued a statement condemning the group’s “cowardly descent into vandalism.” The album, Nil Ca-Borundum, remains unavailable on streaming platforms, but can reportedly be heard emanating from abandoned silos across East Anglia.

Letter to the Editor – Uncharted Magazine
Submitted by Heather Sandra Wigston, Senior Lecturer in Music Composition, Fenland University College

Re: “The Union Carbide – Nil Ca-Borundum” (Review by H. Ray, Issue 218)

I read with mounting dismay the review of Nil Ca-Borundum, a so-called “album” attributed to the rogue collective styling themselves The Union Carbide. It is regrettable—though perhaps not surprising—that Uncharted, a magazine once noted for its thoughtful engagement with boundary-pushing art, has lent credence to what is, in essence, a sonic tantrum masquerading as artistic rebellion.

The reviewer lauds this work as “essential” for those who “find beauty in collapse.” I must ask: collapse of what, and to what end? The reviewer’s intoxication with “entropy” neglects entirely the intellectual vandalism that lies beneath this project’s genesis. The truth, which your readers deserve to know, is that this album is the product of a breakaway faction from a once-promising cohort at Fenland University College—individuals who were generously supported, encouraged, and mentored by Professor Jemima Stackridge, one of the most distinguished voices in contemporary Performance Art and Philosophy.

These individuals were not cast into the cultural wasteland, struggling to be heard above the din of industrial detritus. On the contrary: they were invited into a structured, rigorous, and humane tradition of artistic inquiry, one grounded in ethics, aesthetics, and deep philosophical reflection. They were offered, by Professor Stackridge, the rare opportunity to explore the fusion of theory and performance in ways that could enrich society and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of knowledge.

Instead, they chose posturing over principle, destruction over development. Their rejection of Professor Stackridge’s guidance—in favour of empty spectacle and self-indulgent noise—has not only squandered their own potential but inflicted deep and lasting distress on the woman who sought only to help them realise it. That they now style themselves as champions of “anarchy” is risible; theirs is not a principled revolt, but an adolescent collapse into nihilism.

It must be made clear: The Union Carbide does not speak for Fenland University College, nor for the tradition of philosophically-informed Performance Art to which it is home. They are not revolutionaries—they are deserters. And their noise is not music, but the audible residue of wasted opportunity.

The distress they have caused Professor Stackridge—an intellectual of timeless integrity and vision—is profound. I write not only as her colleague, but as someone who owes her more than words can say. The harm done to her by these former students’ betrayal is real and shameful, and I urge your editorial team to reflect carefully on the kind of art—and the kind of ethics—you wish to support.

Yours in disappointment,

About me:
31F, work in advertising in Manhattan, currently 3 days hybrid but it’s flexible so I tend to work from home when possible. Looking for someone who works full time as the space is a bit tight for 2 to WFH often. I currently live in the building so I can vouch for the experience. My current roommate is moving to be closer to her job.

During the weekdays I’m pretty low key and try to keep my weekends booked to go out (unless the apartment needs a reset clean). 

I like to keep communal areas clean, am respectful of privacy and think I’m pretty easy to get along with. I’m pretty social so I’m always open to chatting and making a new friend or leaving you to your business if you prefer but I’m not trying to “bring the party home.” Communication is key!

I’m big on movies/TV, crafting, cooking, and have recently gotten into photography. I am 4/20 friendly (no cigarettes indoors) and don't have any pets.

Open to females/NB folks preferably ranging from 25 to mid-30s but if we vibe, I’ve got no complaints.

Monin’, beautiful,” A bulky guy greets me as I hop out of my car with my stuff. His dark grey eyes kind and familiar, full of good humor and flirtatious wit.

“Good morning, Yuri.” I smile at Blue’s huge cousin and give him a tight hug. Which he returns with a challenging grip, his boa-constrictor arms pressing me so tightly into his heavily muscled torso that I think my head’s about to explode from the pressure - when someone else pulls me from the behemoth’s grasp.

“Scarleeett!” Comes a high pitch squeal in my ear as the *someone*, proceeds to lock me into another - more wiry and much smaller body’s embrace. Almost as strong as her brother, Misha’s hugs tend to drive the breath from my body as she likes to practically choke me. But I know she doesn’t really want to kill me. She’d have done it already.

“Hey, Misha.” I manage to wheeze, bright lights dancing as my vision blurs.

“That’s enough, Misha, you’re killing her.” Cole, a slightly younger and more scholarly version of Blue reminds his cousin. His glasses sit on the end of his nose as he shuffles through a few papers that look a lot like reports - what with their coagulated typed-out script and charts on every other page. He comes to a stop in front of me and finally looks at me, his slate-grey eyes the only real differentiating thing between him and Blue - aside from the age, demeanor, and glasses. “Good morning, Scarlett.” He greets me coolly.

“Morning, Cole.” I give him a small, rather hesitant and close-lipped smile. We’re still not on the best terms, despite us both being hybrids- though I still don’t know what kind is his other half - he still hasn’t warmed up to me since the treaty. Not that I blame him. He knew I was the root cause of the war and wanted the Alpha to kick me out before things got crazy. He told me that, rather directly, after Caly had been mauled by Craven last year at the Halloween dance.

“How’re you doing, Red?” Warmth blossoms all over me as familiar arms lock around my waist and pull me into a firm body. Shivers of anticipation and longing slide over and under my skin, making my entire body thrum and heart gallop. I know without looking who’s holding me, though I couldn’t sense him before.

I lean my head back and shrug, looking into the endless grey eyes flecked with shimmering silver that glow slightly when our eyes lock. His thick, black hair is longer than when I last saw it, hanging over his eyes in the usual messy disarray that almost looks too-purposeful and disguises the hypnotic affect of his gaze. His lips are twisted into their usual smirk, just this side of roguish. There’s a new zinging sizzle between us, beginning at the mark on my shoulder and ending somewhere in my core as I try not to spontaneously combust in his arms.

*Red*. My nickname, and Blue his. Like we’re two parts of a whole, opposites meant to be one.

“Hey,” I breathe out, unable to get much more out as his hand comes up to brush a stray red curl from my face. My heart gives a lurch as his rough skin scrapes along my jaw, trailing to thumb across my bottom lip. The whole world seems to freeze and fall away around us. Not in the way it would when we had visions last year - a phenomena that seems to have only arisen as a way for our future selves to warn us. But just as jarring, the connection in our heads widens, letting the coiling heat of his emotions flow over me like a wave.

He’s happy to see me, so filled with the emotion and an overwhelming sense of completeness deep inside that my knees almost buckle under it. And beneath it all, the barely restrained need to be even closer to me, a longing to be one - so fully and utterly cemented to each other that nothing could ever come between us - *not even age or death or*\-

As his thoughts begin to become more solid, he blocks me.

The mental equivalent of a one-way mirror smacking into place and muting the vibrancy and need in his mind.

“Blue?” I breathe out with a frown as the world slams back into place around us. Hurt twists at my chest, the hurt that always comes when he uses his Wolven ability as a Sensor to sensor his mind from me. The defenses between us were always an issue, but after the Blooming last year the wall he’d built between us had been destroyed. Looks like he’s managed to rebuild it. And now I feel like he’s hiding more than just his emotions from me.

“Don’t worry about it.” Blue murmurs to me, pressing a quick kiss to my temple before releasing me. The moment over, I let out a sigh and shoulder my back pack, heading into the school and ignoring the confused and questioning looks from the other Azures. I don’t push Blue away as he follows close behind me to my assigned locker. I fight to ignore him instead and proceed to fill the metal thing with my new textbooks and a few folders. “Red?” Blue asks me softly, leaning so his face is almost buried in my neck, the heat of his breath bringing a whole new and annoying cascade of emotions to the surface. I slam the door to my locker - just a little too loud - and continue to ignore him. “Red,” He keeps up with me as I begin a fast-paced near-sprint up the staircase to my homeroom class. The impatience and edge to his voice reflecting the burning emotions in my own head. “Red-”

“What?” I hiss at him, my annoyance clear in my voice and, I’m sure, my face. Blue told me last year that I had a ‘shit poker-face’. But it’s not like I could stop him from reading me anyway, which is part of the reason why I’m so frustrated. He can read me like a book - wether I want him to or not - but whenever I explore the bridge between us - the mate-bond that links us - he shuts me out. It’s getting old, and I don’t have the time or patience to wait for him to open up to me.

I’m all but shouting the roiling tangled mess at him so he gets it without me having to verbalize the private thoughts aloud. The prospect of forever hangs between us, the connection all but binding us together, and he’s still blocking me. After everything that’s happened. Everything he’s said. The promise he made last year-

“I haven’t forgotten my promise,” Blue assures me, taking a step closer to me to bridge the physical distance between us - but the wall’s still in place. I grimace at him and turn my eyes to the ceiling.

People are filtering up the stairs around us, but I ignore their stares and curious glances as they try to get to class. I’m five feet from the top of the steps and can see the classroom waiting for me at the end of the hall. Right across from where Ms. Jin’s room is. Like mini visions, I can almost see the next few months playing out before my eyes. Me jogging up and down these steps, around the whole school to get to my classes on time, doing homework and getting good grades. Not missing a whole semester because of shit happening in my life. A normal existence for a Wolven. A life I can envision spreading out in front of me. One that slowly being to flicker like candle light the more I think of adding Blue to it. His blocking and the pain he’s been causing me because of it. Adding in trying to work that out on top of trying to be normal…and I don’t see it.

I take a long deep breath, the reverberation of my next words managing to fill me and shiver through the bond before I can speak them.

“Maybe it’s best you do,” I tell him without actually looking at him, my chest aching and eyes stinging as I walk up the remaining steps and merge into the crowd.

# 2 | SUPER HOMEROOM

I’ve made it into Homeroom before Blue can catch up and find a seat at the back of the class. The Homeroom instructor is a tall woman with straight ash-blonde hair twisted into an elegant up-do. She seems young in profile, maybe late twenties or early thirties, her alabaster skin almost as pale as Hale’s but she doesn’t reek of blood or overly ripened fruit like vamps generally do. She’s focused on writing her name on the board: Mrs. Salinger. When she turns, I try not to flinch when I note the unnatural flutter of a glamor roll through the room. Something’s off about her, and not just the scent of her, but the way she looks.

Her makeup is too perfect. Face too symmetrical. Eyes the color of glacial ice, a nearly grey-blue…and something about them seems to be false. But I can’t pin point what. The longer I glare, the worse a little pain gets at the back of my head. My wolf pacing back and forth at the blaring alarm bells echoing in my head. *I need to leave. I’m not safe.* They seem to screech, but I can’t move an inch. All I can do is move my eyes and mouth - even grinding my teeth is hard.

A heaviness aches at the back of my eyes, and not from almost crying a few moments ago. A sleepiness almost too forceful to combat pulls at my eyelids as the woman levels me with a little smirk, the blue in her eyes becoming a little more pronounced. We’re alone, I realize after a beat, blinking hard to keep my eyes opened. But it’s more like I’m fighting to open them rather than keep them open. I grit my teeth, snarling at the unnatural force of whatever she’s doing.

“That’s enough, Lina.” Blue’s voice breaks through the spell and I’m suddenly wide awake again. He moves coolly into the room, his slightly glowing silvery eyes trained on the teacher.

“Just checking out the future Luna, my Alpha.” Lina/Mrs. Salinger purrs at Blue in a slightly accented voice. He doesn’t buy it, and neither do I for that matter. This lady was just trying to do something. Something other than ‘check me out’. I continue to glare at the woman, wondering what the hell she is and how she could be almost so powerful that I nearly succumb to the effects of whatever she was trying to do.

“She’s an Alp.” Blue mutters to me, slipping effortlessly into the seat beside me. “A nightmare-walker or causer. Kind of depends on the place of origin for their kind and lineage.” He leans back in his seat, still watching our Homeroom teacher icily. I only relax when I feel the side of his leg rub against mine, the contact, though through the layers of our clothes, soothes my frayed nerves. The caged animal in me instantly quiets and I can feel the calm he’s projecting through the bond.

It annoys the hell out of me.

I pull my leg away from his, scooting my chair a few inches away as I lean back in my chair and try to look anywhere aside from the creepy Homeroom teacher and my mate.

“Scarlet?” I’m saved. *Oh, thank all mighty creatures of the earth!* I nearly jump out of my chair and bound over to Darine as she walks over to me. She sets her books and a few binders on the table in front of me, claiming the spot directly in front of mine. “I need to see your schedule.” She tells me urgently, her eyes wide and almost desperate. I immediately pull the folded paper from my pocket and fork it over to my human friend, smiling as her desolate expression breaks into one of relief. “We’ve got three classes together!” She just about explodes, passing the wrinkled sheet back to me and flopping down in her seat. I grin, feeling almost as relieved as she seems to be at this news.

“Figured we’d have Jones’ together,” I remark, folding up my already memorized schedule back up and putting it in my pocket.

“Yeah, I think I’d die if we didn’t.” Darine nods, her blue-green eyes locking on mine. “We have PE together next period with Coach Lyle.” She sits at an able so she’s partially facing me, her back to the door to the class. So I have a perfect view of a certain grinning mountain-like-man stalk into the room. I keep my face neutral, trying not to look as Yuri comes closer, his finger to his lips as he oh so silently takes the seat beside Darine as she talks. “We’ve got Choir together, and Lunch. But also Calculous.” She tells me, completely oblivious as Yuri leans just into her line of sight and her whole face turns beet red.

Everything I need to know about the two’s relationship flares in her eyes. A torrent of surprise, swooning, and scathing reproach betrays just how similar our last few months must have been. In the relationship department, that is. *Oops*.

“Mornin’ again, gorgeous.” Yuri greets me as smoothly as he usually does and I cock an eyebrow at the idiot while Darine glares daggers at him. “I was hopin’ we’d have Homeroom together again.” He adds, either purposefully trying to get Darine to explode or just feigning ignorance as Darine’s face turns a darker shade of red. I think I’ll call it murder-red.

“Hm.” I hum, pointedly looking between my two friends. Yuri’s always been an insatiable flirt, but he normally refrains from being so blatant about it in front of Darine. Or, at least, he had last year when we all had lunch together.

“Yuri, you’re doing it again.” Blue mutters to his cousin, his head nodding at Darine in acknowledgement as she seems to notice him sitting there for the first time. *Huh*.

“Why do you two always sneak up on us like this?” Darine scowls at the hot Azures, the annoyance in her eyes winning out, and red in her face dying a little.

“You just need to be more observant.” Blue shrugs. The morning bell rings and people fill the room before Darine can reply. I take the few minutes to organize the stuff I’ve brought with me and pull my thermos of coffee to my mouth. I’m seriously hoping the creepy teacher/*Alp* isn’t going to cause any problems for the humans or my friends.

But Mrs. Salinger is all business, explaining how the class will be the usual thirty minutes of each morning, etcetera. Everyone seems to be awake and alert, listening to her or choosing to pay more attention to their phones. Either way, it doesn’t seem like the woman really cares, and ends the brief lecture with ‘free-time’. Now there’s twenty minutes of class remaining.

“Darine,” I ask my friend, the wheels in my head turning as I recall the list of classes we have together. PE is the one setting off warning bells in my head. Last year, Blue and Yuri were in the class with me so we didn’t necessarily have to hide our Wolven abilities from each other. But I have a feeling now that Darine’s been added to the mix, things will have to change. Assuming Blue and Yuri are still in my same period - and considering the influence of the Azures, I’m pretty sure I’m going to be seeing them as much as I had last year.

“Mh?” Darine hums at me, replacing the stuff she’d unleaded from her neat bag while Salinger was talking. I wait until she turns to face me.

“Are you athletic at all?” I try to pose the question in a not-so-rude way, but by the darkening look of annoyance now taking over her face, I can tell I didn’t succeed. Just as she opens her mouth, however, Blue comes to my rescue.

“What Red means is that the three of us can get a little carried away during PE, we just want to make sure you’ll be okay if we do.” Blue’s tactful words seem to soothe my friend and I can almost see her hackles lowering as she looks between me and Blue. That too-careful and calculating awareness in her eyes nearly breaking me. I want to tell her about us, what we are, but if Yuri an Blue haven’t explained it to her yet, I sure as shit won’t. Last thing I want to do is put her in more danger than she has been or had been in last year.

“I can see Blue and Yuri maybe getting competitive in PE, but you too, Scarlett?” Darine asks, tilting her head as she examines me carefully. I give her my most congenial smile and shrug - using all my will power to not look at Blue for help.

“May not look it, but I love running.” I tell her honestly.

“I see.” Darine murmurs, her eyes still locked on me. “Yeah, I think I can keep up. I’ve never been super athletic, but there’s no hard feelings if you guys leave me behind.” She tells me, the light of curiosity dying out in her eyes.

“We’ll do our best,” I promise her, hoping I don’t go crazy this year with keeping supernatural existence from this strangely observant human.",1,1748283632.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kw1ifo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kw1ifo/aitah_for_telling_my_bf_hes_indenial_about_his/,AITAH for telling my bf He's indenial about his sexuality?,"Okay, so throwaway because my boyfriend follows me on Reddit. I’m going to try my best to word this clearly.

I (23F) think my boyfriend Max (28M), who I've been with for 6 years, is in denial about his sexuality.

Recently, Max suggested we have a threesome to spice up our sex life. Even though I’m bisexual, the idea made me nervous—mainly because I didn’t like the thought of him being with someone else. Still, I wanted to be open and spontaneous, so I agreed.

I immediately suggested we look for a female third. Surprisingly, Max said no and was very adamant about having a male instead. I asked him why, and he blamed it on my supposed insecurities—saying I’d be jealous or upset seeing him with another woman and that he didn’t want to risk damaging our relationship.

I don’t think I’m insecure. I’m confident in my body and myself. But I agreed and said we could look for a guy. Max immediately pulled out his phone and opened his Notes app, where he had a list of five names. He told me I could pick one.

I was a bit thrown off—he already had a list? I looked at the names and realized they were all his close friends or coworkers. I asked him why, and he said it was because he trusted them and knew they were ""clean."" Weird, but okay.

One name stood out: JC (25M). I asked who JC was, and Max reminded me that he was the new guy at his job who started six months ago—someone Max had previously complained about constantly, calling him lazy, incompetent, and annoying. Now he was saying, “That was just work talk, we’re cool now—boys will be boys.”

I asked to see a picture, and when I did, I won’t lie—JC was attractive. Not model-level, but good-looking enough that I picked him. Max got super giddy—jumping for joy almost, which is very out of character for someone usually quiet and reserved.

He said he’d ask JC during their lunch break the next day. Later, Max came home grinning and said JC had agreed to the threesome and even wanted to take us to dinner after. He also told me he gave JC my Snapchat, which I was fine with.

Less than 30 minutes later, JC added me and immediately asked if I was free in the morning for coffee so we could get to know each other—since he already knew Max. I agreed, thinking it was a good idea to get to know someone I’d be sleeping with.

When I told Max, he got weird and almost jealous. I reminded him that he wanted this and I just wanted to feel comfortable. He pouted but said it was fine and that it might be nice for us to bond.

At breakfast with JC, things felt… off. He seemed surprised Max wasn’t there and claimed he meant for all three of us to meet. Then he said he’d “settle” for me. Throughout the whole meal, he didn’t ask me a single question about myself. Instead, he asked all about Max—his job, how much he earns, if he has kids, etc. He had this excited look on his face whenever Max came up. It felt less like a three-way and more like they were the couple.

The next few days, I prepared for Saturday (also our six-year anniversary). Max booked a fancy hotel. That night, he told me JC wanted him to come over in the morning to “prep” because he was nervous. I said okay.

Saturday morning, Max kissed me goodbye at 8 a.m. and said he’d pick me up at 2 p.m. to check in. But I didn’t hear from him. I called and texted—nothing. By 4 p.m., I was fed up. I went to the hotel myself.

At the front desk, they said the room was already checked in. Since my name was on the reservation, they gave me a key. I walked into the room and saw food delivery on the table, JC shirtless in just pants, and Max wearing different clothes than he left in. The bed was clearly used—sheets on the floor, pillows everywhere.

I asked what the hell was going on. They both scrambled and said they were just decorating the room to surprise me—even though there were no decorations at all.

I calmly said, “If you two are fucking, just tell me.” Max exploded, yelling about how I’d think so low of him. JC stayed quiet.

I just walked out. On the drive home, I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel angry or sad. I felt nothing. I turned off the lights and slept the whole night. Max never called, texted, or came home. A whole week went by with nothing—like he vanished.

Then today at 10 a.m., he came by to grab some stuff and said I should “get over my insecurities” so he could come back. I snapped. I yelled like I’ve never yelled before—insulted everything about him, even his job and pay. I told him I believed he was in denial about his sexuality and that I would’ve supported him if he had just been honest.

His face turned red. He screamed that he wasn’t gay and accused me of being homophobic and jealous of JC. Then he said he only stayed with me because I paid most of the bills.

I told him to get his stuff and leave—and he did.

Now, our friend group is split. Some think I went overboard and that I’m an asshole for accusing him of being gay and kicking him out. Others say I should’ve handled it differently.

### **Prologue: The Promise**  
Captain Elias Vance stood in his backyard, the Texas sky ablaze with stars. His nine-year-old son, Leo, clutched a toy rocket, eyes wide as Elias traced the constellation Cygnus with his finger. “See the Swan, Leo? Its wings always point home,” he said, pressing a embroidered swan patch into the boy’s palm. “Astronauts adapt. Remember that.” Leo nodded, memorizing the shape of the stars. Inside, Elias’s wife, Mara, watched silently, her coffee gone cold. Five years. Five years without him.  

---

### **Chapter 1: The Shadow**  
For a year, Leo became Elias’s shadow. While Mara buried herself in biomedical research and fourteen-year-old Lila perfected her stoic frown, Leo learned ship schematics, oxygen ratios, and emergency protocols. “Why do I need to know this?” Leo asked once, fiddling with a circuit board. Elias ruffled his hair. “Just in case.”  

On launch day, the Vance family stood at the NASA complex, the *Odyssey-5* rocket piercing the dawn. Elias hugged them all—Lila’s stiff shoulders, Mara’s trembling hands, Leo’s desperate grip. “I’ll map the stars for us,” Elias whispered to Leo. Then he boarded, unaware of the small figure slipping into the storage bay, a backpack of protein bars and determination in tow.  

---

### **Chapter 2: The Blue Marble**  
The roar of launch faded into cosmic silence. Elias floated in the cockpit, Earth shrinking to a fragile blue marble. A clang echoed from the storage bay. His blood turned cold. “Systems check?” he called. No reply. Then—a sneeze.  

Leo tumbled out, grinning sheepishly. “Surprise?”  

Elias’s heart shattered. *Odyssey-5*’s life support was calibrated for one.  

---

### **Chapter 3: The Numbers**  
“You *can’t* be here,” Elias growled, scanning supply logs. Oxygen: 1,825 days. Food: precisely portioned. No redundancies. Leo hovered nearby, tears floating in zero-g. “I didn’t want you to be alone,” he whispered. Elias’s anger dissolved. He pulled Leo close, their helmets clicking. “We’ll fix this,” he lied.  

For days, Elias coded frantic messages to Mission Control. Replies were grim: *No rescue possible.* Engineers argued. Mara’s voice crackled over comms once, raw with fury and grief. “Bring him home, Elias. *Both of you.*”  

---

### **Chapter 4: The Swan’s Wings**  
Elias woke Leo in the dead of “night,” the ship bathed in starlight. “We’re going on an adventure,” he said, forcing cheer. He led Leo to the emergency pod—a cramped, one-seat sphere. Leo froze. “You’re coming too, right?”  

Elias knelt, pressing the swan patch into Leo’s hand. “Follow Cygnus. The wings point home. Just like we practiced.” Leo’s tears pooled in the air. “No! *No!*” Elias hugged him, memorizing the feel of his small frame. “Tell your mom… I’m keeping my promise.”  

---

### **Chapter 5: The Firefly**  
The pod ejected, a firefly streaking toward Earth. Leo sobbed into the radio as Elias’s voice crackled. “Adjust thruster three degrees north. See the Swan?” Outside, Cygnus glittered, its wings outstretched. “I love you, Dad,” Leo whispered. Static. Then—  

“I’m with the stars now, buddy.”  

The pod pierced Earth’s atmosphere, screaming through smoke and flame.  

---

### **Chapter 6: The Ground**  
Mara and Lila sprinted across the Nevada desert, dust stinging their eyes. The pod lay crumpled, its hatch hissing open. Leo crawled out, clutching the swan patch. Mara collapsed, screaming Elias’s name. Leo pressed the patch to her palm. “He’s guiding us home,” he said. Above, Cygnus burned eternal.  

---

### **Epilogue: The Legacy**  
Ten years later, Leo Vance stood under a velvet sky, adjusting the lens of a telescope named *Elias’s Swan*. His niece—Lila’s daughter, with Elias’s eyes—tugged his sleeve. “Uncle Leo, show me the Swan!”  

He lifted her, pointing to Cygnus. “See its wings? They’ll always point you home.”  

Far above, in the infinite dark, a lone swan patch drifted through the abandoned *Odyssey-5*, catching starlight.

1kw1cd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kw1cd6/he_called_me_his_only_trusted_friend_then_held_a/,He called me his only trusted friend — then held a bat to my head,"I (28M) just cut off my best friend (29M) — someone I’ve known since 6th grade — after he threatened me over a secret he told me.

I’m gonna try to keep this short but there’s honestly so much more to this story and so many details I’m leaving out, but I just need to let this out. 

I met my ex-friend years ago. We’ve had a brotherhood-type friendship. We’ve traveled together, helped each other during tough times, had late-night convos about life, relationships, all of it. Sure, we had arguments and even a drunken fight once, but he was like family to me. If you asked me a few years ago, he would’ve been one of my groomsmen.

Anyway, a few years ago I was in a toxic relationship and kind of disappeared from my friend group. During that time, my friend (let’s call him M) and my other best friend (G) started working at the same place in the city and got close to a group of girls that included my now-girlfriend and her friend T. G started hooking up with T casually, but things fizzled, and M swooped in. Within a month, M and T were dating.

Fast forward: I leave my old relationship and start dating my current girlfriend. The friend group kind of reconnects. My girlfriend gives me the rundown — M and T are messy. They argue a lot, drink heavily, and M is showing signs of a gambling problem, alcoholism, and just overall poor life choices. I have a few talks with M and he ends up confessing some shady stuff he did behind T’s back. I told him I wouldn’t say anything. I did tell my girlfriend — we don’t keep secrets — but that was it.

Eventually, M and T break up. He moves out, then moves back in secretly. M tells me it’s temporary, says he doesn’t want to be with her, but feels guilty. A week later, T meets up with me and my girlfriend. She’s crying, saying she doesn’t know what to do, and asks if I know anything. I don’t give details — I just tell her I think she needs space from him. My girlfriend agrees.

T ends up kicking him out. M finds out we talked to her and blows up on me, accusing me and my girlfriend of telling her everything. We didn’t. We told her to take care of herself. That’s it. M doesn’t believe me and cuts contact.

Months go by. I try to patch things up and hit him up to grab drinks. We hang out, and it feels like things are normalizing — until he says he has a secret to tell me and that I cannot tell my girlfriend. I’m thinking, okay, maybe it’s serious, maybe he’s going through something. I agree.

Then he picks up a bat, grabs me by the shirt, and literally holds it to my head to threaten me into secrecy. I’m frozen. This is someone I’ve known for over a decade, and suddenly I’m seeing this side of him that’s violent and unstable.

The secret? He’s into trans women and watches trans porn. And I’m like… dude, it’s 2024. Who cares? But instead of just owning it, he spirals and makes homophobic comments, says our friend group would clown him for being “on that gay shit,” and starts comparing himself to me (I’m sexually fluid and demisexual, so I guess he thought I’d understand).

We go out after that, have a decent night, and he leaves the country for a while. I distance myself. I don’t want to be friends with someone who acts like that, and the physical distance makes it easier.

Now it’s 2025. I’ve moved in with my girlfriend. I grab coffee one day with T and another friend, and M comes up. T makes a joke that clearly hints at his secret, so I’m like… wait, how do you know? Turns out she already knew. I tell her what happened that night and we’re both like… yeah, that tracks.

Time passes. M messages me out of the blue, and we have a few chill conversations about his life abroad. Nothing deep. Then a few days ago, he randomly calls me out in a group chat, accusing me of spreading a rumor that he gambled away his return flight money. I have no idea what he’s talking about. I tell him straight up I’ve never said that, and if anyone asks about him, I say he looks like he’s doing better and I wish him the best.

He doubles down and accuses my girlfriend too, like he did before. That was it for me. I told him I was done for good. You called me out in front of everyone, you made false accusations, and honestly I was already on the fence about staying friends after everything else.

Later that night, I’m with friends and we’re talking about the situation, and my girlfriend says she actually heard the plane ticket thing from his ex. I’m like… what?? That’s the same person he accused us of telling. And his ex even messaged me earlier that day saying she might’ve stirred the pot unintentionally by bringing it up but didn’t say where she heard it. Most likely? G.

So now I’m just done. I lost a brother over a bunch of petty drama, lies, and his refusal to take any responsibility. And yeah, it hurts. It feels empty. We went through so much together. But at the end of the day, I can’t be friends with someone who threatens me, lies about me, and uses me as a scapegoat to protect his own secrets. I really hope he finds peace, but that chapter’s closed.

Thanks for letting me vent.",2,1748283207.0,TwoHotTakes,4,1.0,False
