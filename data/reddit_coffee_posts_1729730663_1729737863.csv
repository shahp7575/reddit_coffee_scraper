I was hoping to hold out until December so I could drop my family not so subtle hints to order some for my Christmas present. But I've lit the last one and anytime I sit to write I grab a cup of coffee or tea and light a candle. It's just part of what I always do - my ritual I guess. So here's hoping my candle lasts until reinforcements arrive.

Do you have any journals writing routines or rituals?

1gashsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gashsq/what_think_of_this_wsj_article_about_trying_to_be/,What think of this WSJ article about trying to be more authentic and casual by wearing primarily athleisure no makeup for dates? Doing more informal and casual activities? ,"[The New Rulebook for First Dates: Sweatpants, No Makeup](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-rulebook-for-first-dates-sweatpants-no-makeup-11635542692)

Cut the bul$hit and actually try to see early on if this is a guy you would love to build a life with? 

I've also read about extending the concept to going on more informal coffee dates, active dates outside, and fun casual activities. The bottom line is to be comfortable. I wear little to no makeup anyway.  I mean, if he asks me to an orchestra, I’m going to be appropriately dressed, but whenever and wherever possible stick with activewear and steer towards more authentic or character revealing activities.

Key sections from the article (as it is paywall):

>Why spend hundreds of dollars and precious time to dress up and get your hair and makeup done, just to slug wine during dates (some of which she termed “hellish”) with random fellas from Bumble? Plus, were they even seeing the real Amy? And so she “cracked the code” as she puts it, by coming to dates in athleisure, applying minimal makeup and minimal effort. 

>For a first meeting with a match, she advises clients to come straight from a workout (or the couch), barefaced and without artifice. She calls it a “mini screener date”: 30 to 45 minutes for coffee or an early drink.

>New York City recruiter Julie Samuel, 32,  used to dress up in heels and nice jeans for fancy-drinks dates. But then last year she consulted with Ms. Nobile, who told her, “You’re not meeting people who want to get to know you—they’re getting to know this perfect version of you.” Ms. Samuel took the advice to dress down and immediately saw its wisdom. She said it helped her “weed people out faster” by breaking down any walls and getting to know them in their normal state. She didn’t dress up for her current partner until four months after they began dating, when they attended a wedding together. She remembers, “I turned to him and said, ‘This is totally the opposite of every other relationship I’ve been in. The first time you’re seeing me dressed up is when you already love me.’” Ms. Samuel mused that the “Love, Amy” approach was focused on “values.”

I focused on grad school and my career. I was open to relationships, but didn’t actively seek them for lack of time and opportunity unless I really thought there could be compatibility. A majority of my field are women which doesn’t help. I have tried to ask two different guys out in an informal, plausibly deniable way, but it didn't work. They did clearly get the memo, but they were each already with someone. I am such a go getter and girlboss, but just so much more shy when it comes to guys. Those micro convos took me over a week to plan bc I didn't want to damage my standing in the environments in which I met them (fitness class, office party). 

I really more introverted I guess, but I want do the things now that as a young professional with more time and money I can. Like the article says, I find going out, dressing up, and slugging wine are hellish. I don’t really even drink. Bars are boring and boorish. Local alumni groups seem like the adult version of sorority parties. I’m planning to do things I actually enjoy, like a running club. I do group fitness but it isn't at all conducive to this. The local professional society is majority women and not an appropriate way to find guys. I like hiking, but there aren’t really many groups where I’m at. Meetup for that just kind of scares me I guess. Churches both that I actually agree with and have any young professional social life are a long commute. So I think I’m almost certainly going to end up resigned to primarily online dating like the article indicates, as terrible as I know that is supposed to be. I want to be able to treat finding my guy like my second job because of course it’s that dedication which got me my grad degrees and my real job. If only there was a textbook, ""The Technical Processes for Finding a Husband."" Alas I know love doesn’t really work this way, which is somewhat scary.

I love the idea of this article, but might struggle a lot with the confidence to pull it off knowing it goes against the grain. I’m in my early 30s and feel like time is really ticking as I want kids. My parents are getting older and I want to be settled before I have the emotional labor of caring for them (financially they're okay). Most of my friends who didn’t do lengthy grad school are married, many with kids. My chances of finding an unmarried guy I actually want to date in the wild seem infinitesimal or at least super super time cost prohibitive - all the time investment to those groups with a very limited unmarried pool in this age bracket in those groups and getting smaller by the year.  Besides, in each group I can realistically only shoot this arrow once; the math stinks.

I just want to cut the crap, get past the pony show stage as much as I can and find my faithful, intelligent, responsible, and caring soulmate guy. Will online dating with an ""athleisure"" approach really help?",1,1729737673.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

1gase4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gase4j/10_years_of_loss/,10 Years of loss,"My story started when I was 16 in 2013, and that year, two of my best High School friends passed away. One by a car accident, and then a close friend of mine committed suicide in grief concerning our friend dying, leaving in his Instagram bio for the rest of time to read, ""I'll see you one day, buddy""

Before my friend passed away, we went on a summer vacation with friends to another friend's house to stay over a weekend. We got in a huge fight, and we had a major falling out. I didn't talk to him before he died. 

The last time I saw my best friend, who I had homeroom class with every day, was at my friend's funeral. 

Then, before that, he was expelled from school for becoming behaviorally reckless and bringing a bottle of alcohol to school to drink through the day. Right before he was caught and arrested at school. He saw me in his last class of homeroom, where he tried to get me to take the bottle from him ""because they were onto him."" 

I said no because I didn't want to get in trouble myself. I could've easily taken that bottle and stashed it or trashed it somewhere from my book bag, and he would've possibly never gotten caught with it. He was acting a fool, and his breath reeked. I still second-guess this.

When I turned 17 in 2014, my Senior year of High School. A girl met me, and it was love at first sight. The week I met her, I experienced what the Doctor at the Hospital called a ""First break, prodromal psychosis"". 

During my first ""episode,"" I experienced my first Command Hallucination phrases from auditory hallucinations and delusions. 

In my new homeroom class, after being transferred from my friend passing away. Meeting all new people that year after - I met this girl over the weekend at a school soccer game. She was very shy the last time we met. She approached me without saying a word, outlined my stenciled ""Stussy"" shirt, and asked what it meant. She was very coy, didn't say a word to me, blushed, smiled like a child, and ran off laughing like a kid. 

The people I sat with were talking about meeting her at a party over the same weekend that I met her at a soccer game. 

They were talking about taking advantage of her and trying to get her drunk so they could ""Bring her to the back room and hook up with her."" I jumped out of my skin emotionally and lashed out verbally. Attempting to fight one of my classmates, 

These were the group and type of kids that my group and type of people hated morally, and we rivaled. One of my other best friends, and best friends with my now-dead friend. Kicked in this guy's car door because they came by his house to punk on him. The same guy, the owner of the house party, and his girlfriend cheated on him with me at age 15 because she said she hated him. We were considered ""Rat or trashy"" by this other ""In-group,"" and she was just meeting these people for the first time that night. I was attempting to protect her from these awful people, and that's simply what I was trying to do: save my love for her and me. 

Also the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that he should be dead. 

I continued in my psychosis that day. Remembering, thinking I was a highly intuitive psychic time-traveler.

For some reason or the other. I had the rationale of believing that the girl that I met was endangered by these people after this incident that day in her classes, and I became concerned. Becoming so delusional that I left one of my classes to search for her in random classrooms. 

I landed on a teacher who told me in the past, a year before after my friend's death. ""If I ever had an emergency, you can come to my classroom. I can take all the students out of the class. I can help you."" So this happened, and we called my parents. My parents were on the way from work to pick me up because I started to become concerned for my mental health. They were going to take me to the hospital. - During this encounter, the school police were involved and began questioning me when in the room after the call. I started to become paranoid, thinking I was under arrest and going to jail. I started to become delusional and verbally violent with the officer in disrespect without reason. The police officer ran at me, tackled me onto the floor, and arrested me. 

I screamed for my life Bloody Mary, and every single surrounding classroom heard me. Students came to the door, trying to get into it to save me. 

I got expelled from school for ""Fighting a police officer"" and resisting arrest, when never under any crime committed to arrest me. Only able to come back on medical waiver from the hospital, and on thin ice. 

\-

When I arrived at the hospital, my first grandiose delusion was the Shutter Island theme. I fought with the nurses on admittance and became hostile because I was delusional and thought they were lying to my parents to separate me from them. 

They held me down in an 8-point procedure and briefly held a plastic bag to prevent me from spitting on them. They injected Ativan into my IV, and my vision faded from colored vision to black, like turning off an old-school television. 

\-

Coming back to High School a week later, experienced the daydream nightmare of the immaturity of teens in High Schools. like me, Dorthy of bullying, dealing with hazing, two-faced liars intentionally stigmatizing and creating mis-socialization-ally drama to misinform others about my false identity reputation. Marginalizing my life without chance or opportunity to show worthiness or growth. Stunting my whole lifeline, 

Also, the day terror of sitting in front of all the people had just experienced everything that happened the week before during class; like it didn't happen. 

Whipped cream on top was going to a soccer game the next weekend. To watch the girl that fell in love with me at first sight. Walking up to her while she was sitting alone in the stands, attempting to sit around near her to start a conversation about what happened so I could explain it. She stood up and ran off without a word right as I sat down and said, ""Hey,""

The cherry on top was during my psychosis. I had the delusion that one of my friends at the lunch table across from me during my episode was texting this girl, I grabbed his phone out of his hand. He said ""She's not in my contacts,"" I scrolled down his list, and found her in his phone book. I got her # out of it, and - then started to text her over the next month. 

She started to reply, and I would text her every morning before school - like my dead best friend had taught me to do with girls. To wake them up with a smile every day, ... So I would text her ""Good morning"" and even do it normally without a reply. At one point after this, I asked her if she liked me, and she said, ""Yes."" 

Over time, after this. I don't remember what happened because she just randomly stopped replying out of the blue one day. I still haven't talked to her in person, a whole conversation. Just a simple, Hello, Goodbye. 

\-

After graduating High School in 2015, we followed each other on Instagram for 2 years. I got the Follwers+ app, and it showed my insights, her being my #1 liked on all photos. 

I had not yet said anything about my Hospitalization up to this point and kept my experiences to myself with my trauma. Going to therapy and trying to resolve it. Unsuccessful, grieving the reality that would come if I became vulnerable to her when telling her the truth of my visit. 

I saw her from time to time when I would go out and get something to eat. One time, when she was working at a Hostess job, she waved at me, and I put my head down in my hat and walked past her through the door. I saw her at a friend of friends, a foreign exchange student party. I guarded her in basketball and made her laugh, bouncing goofy on a trampoline. I saw her at two graduation parties, and we played volleyball together on a team. We also had an exclusive night, where all my old High School friends played soccer 5-5, where she showed up. I picked her to be on my team in line up, as captain. Also scored on her nutmeg, while the goalie ran around with my shirt over my head. Victorious, her guy friend we played soccer with that night was good friends with me and took her to prom, and told me ""She was happy to see me that night""

In this era of my life, I was delusional. Dropped out of school due to trauma and paranoia. To start selling marijuana by the pound, to escape my judgmental Hometown. I planned to run away to Europe and become homeless & nameless. Sleeping on Euro-Star trains nightly traversing the country's borderlines, moving around enough to never been seen. My wish. 

Robbed at gunpoint, during a deal that went South one night over 3/4 a pound of weed. 

\-

In 2016 moved on to a new girl, about a year after this. Meeting someone new online. She liked my photos on Instagram and was from my old High School. She followed me, and I DM'd her. We started to talk for a week,

Sympathizing toward her Dad's Stage 3-Terminal Lung Cancer, we began to bond over her struggle empowering her strength. 

My at-the-time best friend, from High School. Knew this girl, and when I told him I was talking to her - He looked at me like he had seen a ghost, and didn't say a word as the hair on my arms stood up in the deafening stare of silence. 

He said ""I shouldn't be talking to her,"" and wouldn't explain why. I thought it was because he was family friends, with their family. It didn't make sense to me at the time a very big head-scratcher. 

Over the next few days, I was messaging her still and she became less and less frequent in replies reply text emotions, and length. I thought she was depressed because of her Father, the last messages I remember sending her were ""You are strong""

The next day, after waking up and realizing I was out of the blue, blocked. I received a random text message from an old High School classmate I used to sell weed to. He had made up some whole elaborate scheme, of a lie of a story. Saying that him, and this girl that I was talking to - for a whole week. ""Had a boyfriend, and I'm her boyfriend. You need to stop talking to her, she doesn't want you talking to her. Me bothering her, and creeping on her."" 

This conversation delineated and descended into madness. I rivaled him, knowing this wasn't the truth. Having zero photos on her Instagram of him, or even mentioning him once during the week she contacted me. He ended up telling me to ""Go hang myself"", and I figured out it wasn't the truth. The last message I read from him, was before putting my phone down and started calling people for days to find out where he lived.

Even worse, after this. I decided to further my investigation, of what was going on with my reputation that I didn't know about wasn't my idea of my own life, but others' disrespectful perception. 

I took to Instagram, to air out the dirty laundry of the conversation between me and the guy that texted me. Losing 500 followers in 2 days. I messaged the best friend of the girl who had just blocked me. She was my older brothers, Ex-girlfriends' younger sister. I thought I could trust her enough, having conversations with her in the past. She told me that ""in 1-2 years, her best friend who blocked me would be coming out as lesbian, and that she was unsure about her sexual emotions towards men, and me"". She had said that she had liked me, but I was starting to pressure her into love, or romance because I thought she wanted a relationship messaging me. - I believed it, and this was a 2-year long lie. That I believed. 

\-

After this lie was told to me in 2017, I thought that we all were literally ""Best friends forever"" because she just told me her best friend's deepest, darkest secret that she'll be coming out within 1-2 years. 

This also led me into delusional thinking and thought that since now these girls were friends with me, she was a lesbian. I could move on to a new girl, or what I poorly decided to do looking back. I went back to the first girl - her being friends with these girls. That I thought I had a second chance, her being a lesbian. I had feelings for in High School that I met at the Soccer Game, that I had my episode over. 

This fooled me into delusional thinking that these people were my friends. Literally, 

I made a Twitter account. Because I thought I was popular, and started following all of these people that lied to me because I wanted to speak on the topic over social media, so I could follow my friends and clear the air, to get my reputation back. 

I followed and messaged the first girl that I met in High School at the soccer game - trying to rekindle our relationship. Thinking we were friends now, us all being in on the know-how. 

I started to Tweet, but this is when my first manic/depressive episode happened. Back when Twitter was 140 characters, I tweeted 500 tweets. Opening up about the Hospital, because I felt comfortable about my new ""friends"" accepting me, and I wanted my whole community to know about this story now. Us being friends and feeling wanted and belong. 

The girl from High School got a No-Contact, Restraining order against me. 

She didn't even read a single one of the Tweets I sent, and just saw her name mentioned and filed it. Because now this was technical-ly ""harassment and cyber-stalking"" 

\-

I still was fully under the delusional misinformed perception, that this other girl was fully a lesbian, and was coming out in College in 1-2 years. After he Father passed away, she had time to heal. Feel comfortable.  

I tried to express this story to my old friends, over social media. That had now ghosted me, unfollowed me, and blocked my number. 

I didn't know what was going on, I was in the dark for 2 years. No one, not a single person. No old ""friend"" decided to tell me anything about it - likely such a well-hidden secret targeting character assassination that all these other people my old friends hung out with. Lied to them. To rid me, 

I sat on Social Media over Twitter for 2 whole years, with 0 followers, tweeting my life and heart out away trying to make up for the past and be forgiven. Through reconciliation, and went to church weekly for the whole time. Thinking that Jesus had ""Blessed Me"" - Waiting 2 years for this girl to, never come out. To figure it was a lie. 

1 year of realization of this lie, and no friends later. I attempted a suicide mission, to talk to the girl from High School at the soccer game. On the address where it was put on the restraining order to stay away from. I wanted to die and prayed too.  

I got arrested after showing up to her College dormitory campus, of 40,000 people. Twice, two days in a row. Searching for her name on the dorm doors. I was going to knock on her door, and wished she was inside to speak to her. It was my dying wish almost looking back. 7 years ago this week, 

I went to Jail for 9 days, only. Thinking it would be more severe ""Stalking"" charges which, I literally Googled and researched before because that's what I wanted to catch, to keep myself in jail long enough to be killed by an inmate. 

My parents could've bailed me out on day two, but hung up on me over the phone in a screaming match while staring at inmates that wanted to kill me over my charges. 

I went to the Hospital for two weeks after this and was misdiagnosed as bipolar. 

\-

I went to therapy monthly, which was mandatory for my plea deal while on probation back in 2017-18. With the same therapist for one whole year. Talking about this story, and about how she was a ""Lesbian"" and I hung out with one friend in this entire timeline of my probation of two years. 

The night I hung out with my one friend from High School an old best friend, it was for 1 hour. His girlfriend at the time went to the College I showed up at. He harassed me deceptively in front of my face, to hang out with me to ""Figure out what's going on in my life"" my guess, and poked around making fun of my life, all while calling me a friend. 

At one point making up a game, and scenario, where we would ""Imagine our future life's;"" He started to get sinister, and said that ""I could see you being physically abusive towards your future wife, and just lightly slapping her around""... it got dark for no reason in particular. I didn't even say what I thought his life would be, or look like. I didn't get it, and couldn't believe he went all that way just to make it like that. In awe to this date, appalled, 

He got cancer 2 years later, and didn't let me visit him once while it was happening, 

My other best friend; the one that looked like he saw a ghost when I was talking to the new girl. I hung out with him one night after this incident, when after I got diagnosed. I talked to him, and we bro'd it out. Apologized, and agreed to disagree on the topic. He had changed drastically, and he and his girlfriend I knew from High School. Weren't even going to tell me they were planning on getting married together soon. I found out later after on Instagram, not hearing about it when we hung out together, and he didn't even tell me it was going to happen. Most likely didn't want me asking to come, or be invited, or even think of such ideas. 

I had received a \*67 Caller ID prank call, with a girl disguising her voice as a man. I heard snickering and laughter from boys and girls in the background. They had asked me ""Did you get laid by that one girl at the cul-de-sac party?"", Putting the idea later together in time ""The Block Party""   .... Up to this point in my life I haven't talked to a girl in 5 years. 

I started to make over-the-phone death threats, and then, over the internet on Social Media on Twitter, I had a mental breakdown where I name called and put death threats on my social media to people I thought had my number and were messing with me. 

The police were called, and I got in trouble by them filing a report! They interrogated me in front of my parents, and I told them what was going on with me. They believed me, but told me to not go about doing it that way, ... I was just triggered and exploded in rage. 

I kept up the Twitter, unknowing of the idea that she wasn't lesbian, or not being real. Trying to communicate with the first girl with the restraining order, to reconcile forgiveness. Attempting to persuade her to love me again, and negotiate out a deal between us to have happiness because it wasn't me, but my mental illness. 

Speaking to no one about it, and thinking that I shouldn't come out with her lesbian secret because he Father passed away from Lung Cancer now. I didn't aim to disrespect. 

I met an old High School friend I used to sell weed to at a gas station one night, ironically enough. His girlfriend at the time that was with him, was best friends with the girl that had the restraining order on me. He actually came up to me in line, behind me, and stuck out his hand to handshake, and say ""What's up"", like nothing happened. 

I messaged him on Snapchat, and he filled me in on a major truthful update. He said that the girl I thought was a lesbian; wasn't. The girl with the restraining order was getting a second one, and she was also ""Happier without me""

Coming shortly later to find a couple months later, on her newly created Facebook. She was dating the guy that was the host of the party back in High School, best friends with one of the guys that tried to take advantage of her in High School. The guy that his girlfriend in High School Freshman year cheated on me because she hated him. The guy that got his car door kicked in by my best friend, and my now dead best friend. Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that it's better that he's dead. Also found out she joined a sorority and started to become egotistically classy. 

She had also stated that I was ""Visionless, and controlling"" , I needed ""to be happy, to be in a relationship""

\- 

I became suicidal again in 2019, but was hospitalized after writing a suicide note and put on medicine shortly after dropping out of college for the third time due to being symptomatic from stress. 

I went to therapy for years after this, and after being discharged by my last therapist for ""inability to treat client, needs a higher level of treatment"" I bounced around from therapist to therapist. 

One time being called a stalker, and then by another an ""Incel"" 

My parents started to fight so much over the last years, with this idea and with me. Talking of divorce, and fighting screaming at each other in death matches with me.  My own Mother stated to me out loud once in a fight over this topic where she chose their side for years against me. ""I don't know who you are anymore!""

Getting in a fistfight with my Father where I knocked him out unconscious when he told me ""I'm glad I kept you in jail for longer and didn't bail you out""

My brother, abandoned me. Not talking to me for whole years. Disliking me If we already didn't get along before enough a verbal fight with him one night brought out the idea, and words that I was a ""Fuck up"" 

\-

In 2020, I had another hospitalization, this one being my fourth and fifth. 

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar. Originally, just diagnosed bipolar but it was a misdiagnosis. Unmedicated improperly for 4 whole years. In and out of psychosis, delusions, hallucinations. Etc,. 

I had contacted the friend that met me at the gas station, that I used to sell weed to back in High School. He said that he can talk to her about it, and we talked back and forth for about a week. 

He said that she said that ""It had been so long since we met, and everything including us has changed. We weren't the same anymore, and that we didn't have the same alignment that we used to have growing up.

That sunk me like a rock to the bottom, and I was told that she was moving states. 8 hours away. 

4 years had passed on the restraining orders, and restraining orders only last 2 years til you have to decide if you need to refile. Or it become permanent if necessary. 

She didn't renew the restraining orders. When she had enough evidence to. 

Months later, I kept tallies of her Instagram over the years. Dreaming of being unblocked and happy together once again. I kept tallies on her friends Instagram's too, to check to see if she's in the photos; or if they leave me little coded messages like they used to back in the restraining order to communicate how they felt towards me with what I was saying.  

I found one day on her best friends instagram, saying ""You're not alone"", ""I set you free for freedom sake :)!, Never give up, there is always brighter days around the corner."" 

I deleted my instagram, in rage and realization of a reversal in loss of time. I took it more than personally. 

I was frustrated with life. 

\-

During the next two years 2021, & 2022,

I took medicine, looked around for jobs. Couldn't find therapy. One friend at the time, and he then suddenly passed away on his birthday night I took him to the bars to drink. 

He co-piloted me that night, and wing manned me because he knew about my story. I grew into being diagnosed with abandonment issues, trust issues, and avoidant personality disorder.  

I had met a girl, with him. He let us be, and I got her number that night. Took him home and talked all about it, smoked a blunt before he went inside for the last time. Talked about music, and how art needs to be relevant,. 

He left his lighter in my car that night on accident, and in the morning when I figured out he passed away. I found his lighter that reads ""Going Nowhere Fast""

He smoked about two packs a day, and worked 80+ weeks, he passed away from a widow maker heart attack. Age 25. Apparently had a undiagnosed murmur.  The military never spotted it in his service. 

I worked around at my Dad's janitors' office for $3,600 a year. Couldn't get any jobs anywhere; not even Walmart with my misdemeanor ""Invasion of privacy"" charges. I wouldn't even get calls back after two interviews, and companies would flat out ignore me like I was obsolete.  

I worked terrible, under the table jobs where I would make cash and often times manipulated out of money.

Quitting wear house jobs on the spot multiple times because I was unable to keep up with demands. 

\-

2023, & 

I was talking to a doctoral-level psychologist, who was also a therapist. She was a trauma care specialist, and she also specialized in intellectual disability to name a few. She is no longer my therapist. She had me sign up for an Autism Screening Test, which I never ended up taking. 

Before she dropped me as her patient.. she said after jail & the hospital ""I was trying to have a relationship with her"" 

?

In 2019 when I went to the psych ward at Methodist after a voluntary commitment for suicidal ideation, I got evaluated for a week for Autism. 

The same dual doctorate resident who told me that she thought I was on the spectrum sat me down, and told me she wanted to take me out of the ward after the week's evaluation and take me to ""meet the other people just like me, to get to know myself better"". I told her ""No, I don't want to go"" because I had been there for 3 weeks and it was a day before my birthday that I got discharged, and told. 

I had an unmedicated delusion. Where I stopped taking medicine from when I started in 2021-2023 after my diagnosis.

I bought that same first girl that forgave me, and had the restraining orders on me a Tiffany Charm Clasp Bracelet for $1,500 off my parents credit card, because I thought they were satanists, and wanted to make it up to her, and piss them off for messing up my life abusing me emotionally.  

I got into a delusional fight about thinking my parents were living a double-life as Free Masonic demonic worshipers. Which wasn't even close to the truth, just found an old Free Mason book on our book shelf from 2000, where my Dad attended a introductory meeting with his friend when he was trying to sell him insurance. 

  
I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.

My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.

I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.

I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.

I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.

The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)

The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.

For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.

I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,

I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.

The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.

When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery

I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punked being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.

Entering at exactly 7:07 am the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.

Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.

I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.

People coming in, and multiple jumping's were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""

Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.

Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.

Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate into giving me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway, and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer, that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.

Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

\-

During my 3 1/2 week hospital visit, after jail. Where I fought verbally and emotionally with the Head Doctor this time, over my ""Austim misdiagnosis"" 

I made a ""friendship bracelet"" that said the girl's name that I fell in love with back in High School, and the same one that got a restraining order on me. It was for a memories sake because I was losing track of time 

Meeting a lady there for two weeks, and on her last two days before getting discharged. She telling me that she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lung Cancer, 

Another patient told me that he was going to kill himself, and I made friends with him. He had just been released from prison and moved here. He was depressed, and shot himself in the mouth; a bullet ricocheted into his skull. Making him eyeless in one eye, and not killing him.  

During my inpatient stay, I was notified that my charges from 2017 were expunged.

This year, 2024.

My Grandfather had been battling a five-year-long battle with his health in decline because of Alzheimer's'. Passing away this year. 

My Dad got really abusive drunk one night, saw that I spent $200 at a museum gift shop in a manic episode, 

I came home and me and him got into a fight where he attempted to choke me, and grabbed me by the throat. The neighbors heard us fighting the whole night, and weirdly enough; right as my Dad grabbed my throat. The doorbell rang simultaneously, and a police officer heard me scream ""HELP"" My dad grabbing my neck, my Mom tried to break us apart. 

Police officer waving red beam dot in my face and all across my whole family chest, 

Right after the police kicked in my Childhood home door 

I had an NDE where I tried to take my own life. I drove at 100mph and crashed into a tree line on purpose, totaled my car, and salvaged it. I didn't have a seat belt on, and my kneecaps went under the steering wheel, coming out walking on my own with just getting two stitches to my right eye. 

I received a DUI that night but was only taken to the hospital because I was only high and not drunk, they took my blood level and found six months later that I had marijuana in my bloodstream. They let me go that night without arresting me. 

I received an EEG where it was for my ""Autism misdiagnosis"", and confirmed that I was still schizoaffective bipolar. 40x higher more sensitivity than the regular human to anxiety. OCD, 

Also, a life-changing diagnosis. Amnestic Disorder. Or, Hereditary, Short-Term Memory Loss. 

6 months later, at the start of the month. On the 2nd, I was issued my charges for my arrest for my DUI, but then the next day, I had two warrants for my arrest. 

I had been in communication with the local Crisis Intervention team at my local county police department after I was arrested, and trying to explain to her it was me trying to take my life. They sympathized and talked to the prosecutor, who talked to the judge who had my bail posted before being arrested and jailed.  So I wouldn't have to sit in jail for 24 hours until seeing a judge, getting my bail posted, and then being bailed out. 

The same guy that made fun of my dead best friend, and dated the love of my life. Drove past me when I drove by his road the other day near his house. He laughed visibly from his windshield, I could see when spotting me driving in the opposite direction on the road from him going to his house. 

I had posted about my most recent suicide attempt online to my social media, and the girl with the restraining order noticed. I posted about receiving the diagnosis of Short Term Memory Loss, and ironically enough. Her college's sorority's main donation focus is Memory loss, with Dementia & Alzheimer's. Have raised and donated more than $9 million to the Alzheimer’s Association.

I may be delusional again, but she seems receptive to the diagnosis, but sad and concerned about the failed suicide attempt. 

I deleted my Instagram recently to make a new one.  I got blocked by her again, but she was her best friend. The same one that told me, ""You're not alone,"" & ""I set you free for freedom's sake! :). Never give up there are always brighter days around the corner."" ... She doesn't have me blocked, which she has for the last 5 years on my other Instagrams'.

I've followed her a lot and unfollowed her to notify her phone through Instagram follower request notifications for a silent alarm message, to check my Instagram. I've been posting new photos. 

I've been tagging her friend in posts, and commenting on photos'  atting her, allowing me to talk to her. Apologizing, and trying to make her happy on her birthday month.

1gase3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerSuccess/comments/1gase3l/awards_season_is_here/,Awards Season is Here,"So, if you spend any time on that other hellsite (linkedin) you've probably noticed that it's ""I'm a top -25, -50, -100 CS influencer"" season. 

I'm sure there's a lot of smart people who get this kind of recognition. But please remember that there are just as many grifters. There's no objective assessment with these awards other than their ability to get attention. It's essentially a popularity contest dominated by people who have the time to produce a lot of content and tag every other influencer they've ever had a coffee with. It's a self-reinforcing guru ouroboros. 

You should never feel bad if you aren't on these lists. Often the people who are doing the work IRL are far too busy to build an audience. It is not a reflection of your skill or experience. 

I implore you to think critically about what these influencers say. What they say maybe brilliant or they may just be full of shit. Or have had very specific experiences that may or may not apply to you. You might have even noticed that a few of these folks even behave combatively to drive engagement for themselves.

Seeking advice and perspective is natural and I bet most of us have gotten a lot out of joining this subred or following some of these folks. But sometimes, I don't know, it feels a little too culty and all these people touting their ""ranking"" is when it feels that way the most, at least for me. 

As someone who as been at this for a few decades, I think the best thing you can do for your career is to develop real mentoring relationships. Having one person or a select group of trusted people who you can bounce specifics off of, who understand your situation, and who know who you are--is unbelievably valuable in a way a parasocial relationship cannot be.

Being an engineer, my workdays are pretty hectic, and after squeezing in a quick gym session, I often find myself getting home late. But I've got a bit of a cleanliness freak and OCD thing going on. To keep from putting things off, I've got a little habit: I come home, whip up an instant coffee, put on a podcast, and dive right into chores. That's unpacking boxes, sorting stuff, sweeping and mopping, loading the laundry, hanging clothes, and taking out the trash. The whole shebang takes me about an hour and a half. The mixed blessing is, I recently got promoted, but with it, my workload has shot up too. It's harder for me to keep everything in order at home now. So, my friends, do you have any cool, automated gadgets that can help lighten the cleaning load?

1gas7qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1gas7qd/filled_questionnaire_and_speculation/,Filled Questionnaire and speculation,"I've been really into enneagram lately (I’ve been posting and active as of late) and wanted to see what this sounds like.

I decided to do a general questionnaire (By u/Brouhaus) to get a better idea as to what my ideals and motivations are;

**Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?**

This is a tough question. I guess I am just me. My experience of myself If I had to explain would be “by a thread”- it's like my true nature has always been there, shadowing me and wanting to engage with the world. Some people say they are their values or what they produce, what they mean to others and personally I just feel as if I “am”. 

As of late I've done a lot of introspection, reconnecting with what was and what I used to love doing. I feel as though I haven't been myself as of late and enneagram is a great tool to help get to the nitty gritty of how, what, when and why. I just seek to understand and to have that awareness. I will say, I'm more in touch with my negative traits than I am my positive ones.

I guess I can get easily jaded, I do have a way I wish I were treated and an inherent want to be kind. Interacting with the outside world and how harsh it can be has made me apprehensive to extend that olive branch because often, it’s swatted away. It's not that I think humanity is inherently evil or that it’s that simple- it just is. Unfortunate.

I don't feel as though I answered this well, but it's what I know.

**You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.**

I had a great day recently- I was off work and woke up early enough to make a nice breakfast for myself, went and got myself a nice little coffee and sat down to do some paperwork I'd been neglecting. It was nice to not be on the move and to tick off the “to-do’s” of what’s been long set aside. 

I think my best days are when I don't have a set plan or obligations or work  and I’m able to just be and do whatever looks interesting. Don't get me wrong, a loose structure (Early risings, basic hygiene, etc.) are important but I find it nice to go visit places that used to and still make me happy. Indulging in a new book or sketchbook, or baking and trying a new cute craft, etc. I love not feeling rushed and like I have time to just sit and work on fun lore/drawing/design concepts, ideas.

**If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.**

When I seem inconsiderate. I don't mean too, I actually try my best to be aware.

A recent example was me being busy at work and missing a few things, knowing I would come back to it later when I wasn't busy and my coworker being upset about it assuming I left a mess.

**What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.**

I kind of shut down and focus on the task at hand. I get agitated with any obstacles that make things harder. I work harder and when I get home, I will neglect chores/everyday needs and seek to distract myself. I often find myself craving smoke or alcohol and try to make plans with friends as soon as possible.

 I’ll often get home after a long stressful day, then think about something I’ve been wanting or craving and no matter how small.. I'll go get it and spend more money than I should. I'm way more impulsive and afterwards I usually feel anxiety and guilt for my choices.

**What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?**

People who are extra, self-deprecating humor, Loud abrupt noises, plans that were made that I'm apparently part of without my consent. Nit-picking. Strict rules with no explanation. General inconsiderate behavior, hypocrites, people who are fine remaining ignorant and unresponsive for no reason other than spite. People making assumptions rather than just asking me.

My anger manifests quietly, but if I'm annoyed I can usually cool myself down quickly. If it’s work related, I usually just focus on the task and block everything out until I can deal with it later but I can get short and direct with customers. If it's friends, I just get quiet and distance myself, I don't like to vent and when I do, I usually do a bad job of explaining. I don't elaborate but it's obvious I’m a little off kilter.

I have had moments that only close loved ones see, where I just lose my shit and explode, especially if what I'm saying is being misunderstood. It takes a lot to get me to that point, I usually cry in frustration. 

**What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?**

That's the thing, I don't know but I know a few things that are terrifying to me.

 Working though life to get to the point where I can enjoy it, only to be old and unable to. Being in a vegetative state and unable to communicate or locked into my body, Loss of control. Having zero freedom to make my own choices.

**What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame?**

Weirdly enough, I'm pretty sexually repressed. I went through some things that made it hard to enjoy, be in the moment and connect to my partner. I’d also had my parents invade my space and find things that weren't any of their business.. It's violating. Any memories of my sexual experience or expression. I'm very private. I don't get how people discuss it freely, I don't want to be seen as a slave to my desires, I guess.

One other thing would be when I was growing up and going through things and treating people with unnecessary cruelty. I don't like thinking back on when I did stuff out of impulse or went for what I wanted without consideration and out of desperation. Its the fact that it isn't how I really am.

**What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?**

I mean.. One aspect as stated above. My relationship with pleasure is complicated. I don't feel as though I have an inherent belief that I don't deserve it and when it comes naturally I embrace it. I seek it out through everyday life, even just in small ways, like my hobbies. I feel I do go through long droughts without pleasure and in stress seek it out in excess, because I suppose it's making up for lost time and I deserve it.

**What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority?**

Family- I'm reluctant to share much of my goings on, besides work or creative projects/trips. 

Parents wise, I’m closer to my mom because we relate more. She was a very positive influence in my life and embraced my inherited traits and creativity.

My father was partially absent and didn't know how to father. When I was younger I was scared/angry with him, but now that I'm older, I understand and have sympathy. He was very aggressive and would lecture me or force me into things I didn't even want to do and get mad at me for not excelling. I don't hold it against him, however he acts in repentance. He has regrets and tries to support me now, although I don't need it or ever truly expect it- never surprised nor disappointed.

I don't know much about political figures to have an educated opinion other than they’re both extreme and dumb at times. 

Religious figures, I respect when it's used for actual good, to inspire and nurture community and shared ideals instead of spreading fear. I personally don't subscribe to anything in particular.

Jobs and bosses are tricky, I actually made a posting of this on the enneagram6 sub relating to this. I'm a notorious job hopper (I call it the one year curse) so it's safe to say I don't have much of a commitment to anywhere in mind besides what I actually wanna go to school for. I can respect some bosses when they treat me like another person, but not care for or do the minimum for those who treat me with disrespect. 


**When your mind wanders, what are you thinking about?**

Whatever I'm currently obsessed with (Enneagram, music, media, lore, etc.), or my own ideas and concepts for world-building. I'm usually thinking about my personal interests or concepts, kind of like autopilot. Rarely is it current happenings, unless it's pressing and distressing.

**You have a big decision to make. Describe how you decide what to do.**

Take a step back, consider and weigh the experience, the lesser evil, the one that makes the most sense, then come to a conclusion. I need time to know and fully understand just what I'm deciding on, especially if it's something “big”.

**What’s your biggest flaw?**

I can never ask for help, it's like I forget it's even an option.  I always find ways to throw duct-tape at an issue until I can deny it no longer. It's embarrassing. 

**What makes you special? (Or, if you don't feel special, what at least makes you different from other people?)**

I mean, with so many other people on the planet it's hard to feel special. Objectively there's only one you, I guess I feel honored to be able to make of what “I” am and that I have the capacity and control to decide that for myself. 

**How much of your mental energy is spent on thinking about each of the past, the present, and the future?**

I think about the future a lot, because I'm excited for it. Probably the past second, because while it's pretty bleak there's still feelings and experiences that were unforgettable, yes, the “good old days” even if they weren’t all that good. Present is last, because I don't exactly feel satisfied with where I am now- I am practicing gratitude.

**You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?**

Anything I've been wanting to do for a while. Setting up a comfortable structure for myself, engaging in my interests, getting work done that's been on the back burner. relaxing. If I have enough money, I would probably spend a little on something that might have caught my eye but I haven't had time for. 

**What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?**

That's tough, I kind of just like what I like and cultivate it- which is a mixed bag. I pick and choose bits from various media/styles/etc. and just make my own thing. I like perusing Pinterest and just putting together things I like, even if they don't make much sense together. I just collect various pretty things.

It’s whatever comes naturally and I usually don't think much of it nor do I spend much time refining it. I wouldn't say I turn it off/on either, it just is.

**Which of the following is the most like you? Explain. A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen, and people won't stop me. B) I am content to be on my own and not draw too much attention to myself. C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.**

B. I won't bother anyone else if they don't bother me and I respect those who just live and let live. I'm perfectly fine on my own and often daydream about having my own little home in a loft cabin with comfortable amenities. When I’m in public I'm just quiet, go and get what I need, maybe look around a little bit then move on.

**Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from my problems. B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily, and am not afraid to show it. C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.**

C mostly and A. I do tend to throw myself into distractions and try to keep a reasonably positive outlook but I'm not in denial. I don't like to let my feelings show unless I’ve had the chance to sort them out and know why I feel that way. I wouldn't be taken seriously if I didn't handle them well.

**Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed. B) I am always aware of how things could be better, and I’m disappointed that they are not. C) Deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.**

It's hard to pick one, so I'll answer why I feel each of them apply.

1. Just to get a general and well rounded idea of different perceptions or things I wouldn’t have considered. I don't change my decision or considerations unless I feel it aligns with my own.
2. Yes, I notice a lot of things could be better or optimal, but I don’t feel comfortable bringing it up unless asked.  I'll turn a blind eye not to deal with it because I feel I don't have the influence, power or know enough about it to enact anything. 
3. Yes. I feel like a lot of things are transactional and hate being tied down or obligated or “owed”, it's why I prefer to work things out myself.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Alternative short questionnaire**

**Take your time to think about it, and try to write 3-5 sentences for each.**

* **If you're feeling negative emotions, do you show those emotions to others? Do you let your feelings out, do you try to look on the bright side, or do you put them down and aside so that you can be logical?**

I don't show them unless they are close to me, even then I try to just keep it to myself. I do try to keep a positive outlook but with a healthy dose of realism so as not to be disappointed. I do try to think objectively but I need time.

* **When you are your worst self, what are you like and what's driving that?**

When I am my worst self I'm impulsive, selfish, dismissive, neglectful and snap at everyone who asks me if i'm okay. It's usually when I feel overwhelmed, or when it's one thing after another.

* **What’s your biggest strength? What’s your biggest flaw?**

I don’t have just one for each unfortunately. Strengths would be perspective, creativity and empathy. Weaknesses would be sensitivity, overthinking and feeling weak.

* **When you are getting in your own way, what does that look like and why does it happen?**

I can get stuck on loops, reminisce, think about what should've been instead of what is now and the possibilities. I can be ungrateful, feel as though I’ll never have what I need. It happens when things feel like they never stop piling on, when I get overwhelmed and have a lot of obligations at once. Instead of compartmentalizing and getting them over with.

* **What are your behaviors that cause you to get into conflict with other people?**

Not taking immediate action, doing something in an eccentric way and then calling it out, overthinking things and doing it “Harder not smarter”, not begging for forgiveness when I make a mistake and apologizing. I tend to be accused of not paying attention but it's not true.

**The last two questions felt redundant to the ones I’d answered previously about anger and fear.**",1,1729736806.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False
1gas70j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gas70j,Bike is life,"Papajort adjusted his wide-brimmed hat, eyes gleaming with excitement. Today was a great day biking adventure—an idea that sparked over his morning coffee. His old bicycle (venzo 26er) but reliable, stood waiting by the gate like a trusted steed.

He hopped on, grinning ear to ear, and pedaled down the dirt road that wound through hills and meadows. The wind whistled in his ears as the landscape whizzed by, a blur of vibrant greens and wildflowers. Every bump and turn in the road was met with laughter—Papajort had long learned that life's rough patches were just part of the journey.

As he reached the base of a steep hill, he paused, panting but undeterred. With a determined huff, he stood up on the pedals and pushed onward, slowly inching his way up. Sweat trickled down his forehead, but the thrill of the climb kept him going. Reaching the top, he let out a triumphant yell that echoed through the valley below.

The view was breathtaking—endless fields, rolling hills, and a golden sunset stretching across the sky. Papajort took it all in, resting for a moment to soak in the beauty before heading down the hill. The descent was exhilarating, the wind rushing through his beard as he flew down the slope, free as a bird.

By the time he reached home, twilight had settled in. Tired but fulfilled, Papajort leaned his bike against the porch and smiled. Another adventure, another story to tell.",2,1729736750.0,mountainbiking,0,1.0,False

1gas3oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterAnime/comments/1gas3oz/coffee_and_alcohol_symbolism/,Coffee and Alcohol Symbolism?,"Just finished Monster and thought it was fantastic. I loved the characters and the overall plot and themes of the story (though I’m still kinda struggling to understand Johan a bit). But enough about that, I wanted to have a discussion about something I noticed a bit with certain characters and that was the contrast between the coffee and alcohol and how its used as a medium for development and character psyche. 

I may be reaching on some of these, but I’d still love some other perspectives on this. Also apologies if this has been brought up before, I searched the web and it didn’t seem like anyone discussed it so I wanted to see what others thought. Also this may be a bit disorganized, but bear with me 😅.

So first character, and really the character that got me really thinking about the whole thing, was Eva. For a majority of the show, she wallows in her own self-loathing and jealousy that it takes root in her habit of drinking and getting wasted. The alcohol metaphorically imo seems like an amalgamation of the ugly things within a person’s character. In Eva’s case it’s her greed, possessive and obsessive relationship with Tenma, and her subtle issue with abandonment. She refuses to take proper measures to reconcile with her demons and at some point starts believing that she is beyond redemption or forgiveness, which is why it seems like she has a death wish at times imo. But that meeting she has with Martin and his eventual death changes her. She realizes her life has value and to persevere through all of life’s ills. Throughout all the darkness, there’s still a hope that everything turns out ok. I find it hard to believe that almost the scene directly after she learns of Martin’s passing, she starts drinking coffee. Essentially what I’m getting at is alcohol shows a character embracing or consumed by the negativities of life while coffee represents hope for the future.

I feel like this can be further seen with Robert earlier in the story. Robert’s drinking basically cost him everything and that bottle of whiskey almost always seems to taunt and remind him of both his mistakes and imperfections. One of my favorite scenes was that scene where Robert learns his daughter doesn’t want to see him. He looks around and seems like he’s about to relapse, and after a tense moment he says “One coffee please”. He didn’t give up and still held hope that one day he’ll finally be able to build that relationship with his daughter he yearned for. I also think that Johan, who at this point had been built up to be a figure of pure evil, is the one who mentally breaks him down and offers him a bottle. Almost like a literal devil on his shoulder, tempting him to give up and sadly he did. 

You can also see coffee as a lens for somebody who is trying to reconnect with their humanity. Grimmer and that one ex-assassin were both emotionally stunted individuals with bloodstained pasts yet you can find them drinking coffee at some point or another. Almost like being able to simply enjoy the mundanity of a cup of coffee perfectly exemplifies what it feels to be a human. 

Again, I might be stretching so what do you guys think?

### Background 

Set a goal of running a marathon and doing an Olympic Triathlon in 2024. 

 I don’t have a strong fitness background/base. Intermittently lifted weights from 2017-2020. Then post Covid I set goals to achieve 1000lbs within my big 3 lifts. Which I did. 

I had to set my sights on a new goal. I set the goal of running a half marathon last year (2023) which I was able to do! 

Before 2023, I had maybe cumulatively run 150km across my life. 

But 2024 I had loftier goals and I knew I had to take running more seriously. 

Unfortunately I suffer from AS/SI and when I get flare ups I pretty much cannot do any lower body workouts. (Hence my lack of running history) 



### Training 

I created my own training plan loosely based on Hal Higdon’s Novice 1. However between June - Aug I had incorporated more Swimming and Cycling to prep for my Triathlon and was running about 3 times a week. I was also going to the gym 3-4 times a week. 

Unfortunately I got Covid during late June, early July so I missed 2 weeks of training and the subsequent weeks were basically unproductive as my body still wasn’t at 100%. 


My stupid self rushed back into my workouts and this cause alot of aches and pains and general fatigue throughout. so I had to take about 4 days off from training. 

Unfortunately I hit yet another roadblock as the week leading up to my Triathlon, I had an AS flare up and was not able to run properly. I had to finish my triathlon with a run/walk. 

The 2 subsequent weeks were also lost due to my AS flare up. 

Thankfully I was able to run again and was able to lock in for the final 6 weeks of training. 

I had to skip my 20 mile run due to time crunch, so ended up with my longest run being 30k, with a peak week of 71k. 

The training didn’t go to plan and lost about 5 weeks of training in total. Had accumulated 850km YTD. 


### Pre-race 

Started my taper 3 weeks out. The first week was fine but the last 2 weeks I had the full on crazies. With insane aches and pains, night cramps and self doubt. But I was assured this was normal. 

The week leading up to the race I heavily focused on drinking fluids and eating almost nothing but carbs. Focused on eating Bagels, White Bread, Graham Crackers, Oats, white Rice, Potatoes and Bananas. Drank a Gatorade and Coconut Water everyday. 


### RACE DAY

We were blessed with perfect weather… for a park day. Debatably this weather wasn’t super ideal for a marathon. Temperature reached a high of 21 Celsius and Sun was out in full effect. While it was cool enough that I wouldn’t overheat, the Sun made it a lot tougher than partly cloudy would’ve. 

I made sure to get up early, eat oats, a bagel, a banana, 2 cups of coffee and a Gatorade. Got to the start line early and stayed the in hotel lobby to do my foam rolling and warmups. Made sure to use the loo 3 times (had to force myself to go). Took a tums before the race to help ease my butterflies. 

I initially planned to run at about a 7 min/km pace and looked for the pacers but I guess they had none running that slow. So I said I would go off feel. 

The first kilometre I felt good but due to the sheer number of people, my watch couldn’t get a good reading on the pace I was running at so I went off feel which ended up being slightly faster than 7min/km. But I trusted the feeling. 

1-21k were pretty much perfect. I was going at a pace faster than I had aimed for but I didn’t feel tired, I felt relaxed and energized. I made sure to drink water + electrolytes at every station and fuelled with gels every 4K. 

Post km21 I felt the fatigue start to settle in, but I still had energy to push. At km 29 is where I really started to feel the dumps. I wasn’t able to down anymore gels. My stomach was turning but I didn’t want to wait in a line for the toilet as I was hitting an ideal speed. My arms and back were starting to feel tired and tight. My legs seemed to be doing ok, but I definitely knew I was starting to push my limits. 

At km 32 I lucked out and was able to use a port a potty with no line. Did my business and felt so much better. Took another gel here, finally. Was able to fly through to km 35 pretty easily. 

KM 35 - 40 is really where the mental battle started. The stretch had no shade and was a turnaround stretch so it felt so familiar. The sun was beating down, no breeze to cool me down. I saw people starting to drop like flies due to heat, injury or just general fatigue. There were no crowd here, no one cheering you on, it was just yourself and the other runners around you. I told myself I would take short breaks at every aid station but I had to keep running. 

Km 40 I was defeated. I had just climbed the final hill and walked a couple metres to take a brief rest. I had to keep going I was so close. My arms were tired, my legs were tired. My mind was tired. But victory was right there. I lucked out and my friend was waiting in that final stretch to cheer for me. He ran with me for 1.5km to give me the last bit of motivation to push myself to the end. I picked up the pace as much as I could for that final stretch. My vision was getting blurry, but the finish was right there. And I did it. 


### Post Race 


I finally achieved my goal of running a marathon. I felt so accomplished despite being barely able to walk. I was able to complete it faster than I thought I could. Even though I felt like I left nothing in the tank, I do wish I pushed a bit harder to get sub 4:30, but that’s a challenge for another time. 

The difference between a full and a half marathon is no joke. That last stretch on the marathon is so mentally and physically demanding I was almost brought to tears. But I’m so happy I pushed through. It’s time to rest and refocus now for the next challenge.

I know there are lots of great resources out there for last minute prep tips and recommendations for making sure you're on top of the story etc. However I'm more interested to know, what are you actually doing in the time that leads up to the session?

Personally I'm not a person who's good at following a sets of steps. So my build up tends to be a quick scan of notes, ideas and pictures at a surface level. Often grabbing a coffee while I think on it for a moment. Then usually I'll start pulling a bunch of maps from online, that might be good fits for potential upcoming sections. And inevitably hoping people turn up a few minutes late so I can flesh out some ideas further.

I'm grateful to say this method works for me pretty well. Although the slap dash style in the early days definitely had me experiencing lots of anxiety filled wishing I could cancel the session!

Should I ask for clarity?,"My head has been going in circles for the past 2 months and I thought this would be a good way to get some advice/outsider POVs of the situation. A little background to start:

Last summer, my co-worker (who is also a close friend), Sam, got his best friend, Tom, a job at our coffee shop while he was out of school. Our friend group became close friends with him and hung out all summer - having movie nights, going to each other's houses, etc. During the time he was working at the cafe, Tom would express how much he liked working with me and how funny he thought I was. He even told me one time that he thinks I'm the funniest person he ever met. I developed a little bit of a crush on him but ultimately did nothing about it because he did have a girlfriend of a few months. We enjoyed our summer and eventually, he went back to school. The next time I would see him was when I hosted Friendsgiving and Friendsmas at my house, which he would come to without his girlfriend. 

Fast forward to this past May. He and his girlfriend broke up and all I had heard was that it wasn't a good ending to their relationship. I was shocked that they weren't together anymore but didn't think much about it since I didn't see him much anymore. The only interaction I got from him was him liking some of my IG stories. 

Fast forwarding to the beginning of July. I like to run and sometimes post my Strava logs onto my IG story for fun. Tom had replied to my story asking about my running, and I replied not thinking much of it. But then he had kept the conversation going. He was asking me how work was since he left, where I wanted to move in the future, what I wanted to do with my life and things like that. I still hadn't thought too deeply about it and just thought he wanted to catch up as a friend. The conversation naturally ended and that was it. Until he texted me the next morning and once again started up a conversation. Now I knew that he had some sort of intention coming into this, and I was a bit weary knowing that he just got out of a messy relationship. But I knew how he talked about me to other people and how he viewed me as a friend, so I was (and still am) sure that he wasn't using me as some sort of ""rebound"" opportunity.  About 2 weeks later, we were still texting all day every day -but never had a conversation about what was going on. He was coming back into town and asked that we have a movie night at our friend Sarah's (who is Sam's GF), house like we always used to. I thought that him coming back to town would allow us to hang out and talk, but we didn't. While he was still here, he would come by my work to get coffee and hang out at the cafe, and he even came by one time as soon as I was done my shift to ask if I wanted to go for a walk. We did and it was really nice, I was super nervous but it also felt very natural and comfortable. He went back to school that night and we continued to talk.

He came back to town the following week and asked our friends to hang out at Sarah's again, which we did and things were still really good. He would text me to make sure I got home and we continued to talk into the early morning. He came by my work again and was there for a few hours. He went back to school and about a week later I noticed things started to change. He had expressed to our friends and me that he wasn't doing well mentally. He said that he needed to spend time away from social media and his phone in general so if he doesn't answer me on specific things, that's why. We were still talking everyday, just not as often. It was a bit saddening to me, considering how emotional and personal some of our conversations would get, and now its not like that at all. I understand his need though and what he needs to do for himself, so I tried to not let it bother me that much. He had also opened up to me a couple of times about his breakup and how his girlfriend really messed him up and how she treated him - which made me understand him at the moment. At the end of August, I had finally asked him what was going on. He told me that he truly needs to not be on his phone for a bit and it has nothing to do with me. He then said that he would like to take things seriously if things were to progress, but it's not in his cards and we should be friends. This hurt a lot. Considering he started all of it and never brought up his intentions, this was the first actual conversation we had about it. I quickly said its all good and I'm glad he is being honest, and left the conversation at him saying thank you for bringing it up. 

It took me a couple of weeks to get over it, although I still think about it often, but over these 2 months he has still been liking my strava runs and had even liked my comment on Sarah's IG post. There has been no other communication otherwise. Until his bday. I decided that I would reach out and wish him a happy birthday and that I hope he is doing well. He replied saying thank you and that he hopes I am doing well also. Then 2 minutes later sends me a picture of the moon. This confused me because it's something we'd do a lot. I love the moon and he knows that, so when it was out and looking pretty he'd always send me a picture of it. I don't know what message he was trying to convey with this, but I just liked the photo. No conversation after this.

I wasn't sure if I should have addressed this but just decided to leave it. Sarah had said that she truly thinks Tom really likes me and didn't want to pursue something further if he couldn't give his 100%. She had told me that Sam talked to him and basically said to not mess around with me and take it seriously, so I know his intentions weren't bad from the beginning. Sarah had also told me how (before any of this happened) every time her and Sam were hanging out with Tom, he would tell them how much he adored me and thought I was so special. Tom also texted Sarah once something random about me that he thought was funny out of the blue. I also think that he had/has feelings for me but realized that he isn't healed and that he shouldn't have started something with me so soon and abruptly. 

I know I'm going to eventually see him sometime in the future so I need some advice as to where to go from here. I never got any closure or clarity on this situation and feel like I need it, but since he was the once who pulled away I feel like I cant.",1,1729735881.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I came to this sub after getting torn a new one in r/debtfree about my horrific budgeting skills. I've been no buy since the last week of September (give or take) and here were my general rules: 

- no more coffee runs
- no eating out
- only buy what you need (stick to meal plans for groceries, only restock on items when they're out)

for the most part, I'd say I stuck with this 90%. I still budgeted some fun spending and eating out, but considerably less, and only for ""emergencies"" (ie, long day at the office and I forgot to pack lunch) so I only ended up eating out two or three times. for my personal spending, while the ""restocking"" mindset still grabs me and I ended up repurchasing soap and shampoo and other personal care items before I was TOTALLY out, I stuck to my guns and didn't really spend outside of this.

aside from my normal spending (groceries, gas, rent, utilities, etc) I only had a few unplanned expenses:

- a $400 vet visit (what I thought was a kitty UTI was her just being a little silly goofy)
- a $20 eyeshadow palette that I had my eye on for months now (oops!)
- went out to eat at work twice and at home once

overall I'd rate my experience with this an 8/10! it definitely got me to be more mindful of my spending and appreciate what I have. in the future I think I'd do more meal planning (I only planned one or two major meals a week and then snacks/breakfasts, so I'd plan out further/more) to help trim down the budget even further.",6,1729735764.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

Reason being : I was having a conversation with a female at the casino but copyright music was blaring in the background causing issues when uploading to your tube. I’m going to replace background music with copyright free music and add the lines to her talking. 

The female was mid 40s white English speaking female in America . Anything close to that would be ideal. 

Happy to buy a coffee via tip jar or send $5.00 USD via PayPal as I think it’s about 2 minutes of work. 

Let me know if anyone  is interested in a fun project . 

Cheers ",1,1729735592.0,CreatorServices,0,1.0,False
1garsh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1garsh8/new_job_role_mathematician/,New job role: Mathematician?,"One from my education tech support days.

Two students walk up to the helpdesk, and I walk out to greet them and ask them what's going on. They told me they were having troubles doing a maths test online, so I get them to open the laptop, log in and show me what's going on.

The website they use to do the tests will grey out the boxes or display an error on screen if the internet drops out or something fails to load. It happens once in a while, so I figured that was the issue. I pull the laptop towards me and type some numbers into the two boxes. It works, and they're connected to the internet, so I ask them what the issue is because as far as I can see, everything is working fine.

They proceed to tell me that they didn't know the answer to the question, and neither did their (substitute) teacher, so they sent the students over to IT for help. They said their normal teacher didn't know the answer either when they were in class the day before, so they've come to us for the answer.

I told the kids ""this isn't IT related, so I can't help you"". I asked who the teacher was (they didn't know, substitute, but I worked it out later on), and send them back.

So I guess the school wanted me to add ""maths wizard"" to my long list of jobs that aren't my job, like ""coffee machine repairman"", ""lockpicker"", ""window repairman"" and ""delivery boy""",10,1729735504.0,talesfromtechsupport,1,0.92,False

I've recently sent and received a few emails with Delta customer service about a case of food poisoning that I strongly suspect happened at the SEA Sky Club.
I arrived at the Sky Club at 3pm Seattle time feeling fine. I had a chicken salad and a fruit cobbler like dessert. I had ravioli on the plane. My spouse only had coffee and dessert at the Sky Club. She said I was crazy to have a salad, which I'm thinking I'll hear about forever now. She also had the ravioli on the plane. 
We landed 6 hours after I started eating at the Sky Club. I started to feel some nausea and unease. We got to our hotel an hour later and I quickly felt very nauseous. Over the course of 10-15 minutes I vomited 6 times. I soon felt better and was fine in the morning. My wife never felt sick. The Washington State Department of Health wanted a 3 day food history before the event which I obliged. My wife and I had the same meals and she never got sick.

Delta offered me 5000 sky pesos which I think is totally insufficient considering what they give out for late bags at baggage claim, and broken entertainment screens. I pushed for more sky pesos. What would you do Reddit? ",0,1729735312.0,delta,4,0.4,False

so while i'm getting ready for school this morning, i get a text from my friend at 6 in the morning. i've barely been awake 15 minutes. he tells me that he has a crush on a girl at our school, so i'm like, ""ok..."" and he then proceeds to not add anything to it. so i ask who and he says that i know her, but he won't tell me who it is. he then proceeds to say that he's gonna play the long game and wait to do anything about it. 

so now im sat there on my bed wondering why the fuck he told me if he wasn't gonna tell me who it was. the sun wasn't even up yet. it was still dark. i hadn't had my coffee. why was this was he was thinking about at 6am?

so obviously im confused. there's only so many people it could be because i dont talk to very many people, let alone *know* that many people. and then... the most mind boggling part of all this shit. he proceeds to tell my 13yo sister who he likes and gives her a description and name. my friend is 16 and she only has his number because we all hang out when he brings his younger siblings out, so she bothered him til he gave it to her. 

this man is almost grown and he told me he likes some girl i supposedly know, but he won't tell me who. and then he tells my sister who. 

my mom thinks he likes me. which... i should hope not cuz that's gonna be one awkward conversation. i don't want him to like me. in fact i think id rather he hate me than want to date me. the levels of ""oh shit"" that have been going through my mind is insane. 

please tell me what you think and if you agree that this is just a ""what the fuck man"" situation. if you don't if you'd explain why that would be great",1,1729735086.0,teenagers,3,1.0,False

Vitola: Robusto

Okay let’s start off by saying I’m excited and nervous for this review. This is a highly opinionated smoke…in both directions. However as I’m coming to learn, taste and enjoyment is subjective to the individual doing the smoking. This is probably the darkest smoke I’ve attempted on my own. I usually have a smoke buddy to help out when things get tough lol. I am a newbie after all. Only about 6 months into my journey. So here we go. 

He’s hefty in hand with a gorgeous, silky smooth, dark and oily sheened wrapper. Let’s take a good whiff. I get tanned leather and a very woodsy scent. He is impeccably crafted. Gorgeous cap and heavily coffee scented foot. Initial taste is earthy. V-cut to perfection. Toasting is beautiful. That initial resting scent is heavenly. Sweet and spicy campfire…yum. 

1/3 he is STRONG. Heavy taste of leather and creamed coffee. But oh my word is he smooooooth. I’ve opted to pair him with a black coffee. Perfect match. Half way through the first third I’m picking up on spicy black pepper heavy at the back of my tongue. I’m enjoying this change of pace. Ash line is straight as a pin. 

2/3 still coming in strong with that leather profile but infinitely sweeter and creamier. Smoke is coating my tongue and taste is lingering long after exhale. I’m in love with the resting smell wafting off this big guy. Sweet toasted campfire marshmallows. Ash line is still holding straight. 

3/3 my biggest pet peeve if you’ve read my reviews before is that damn char taste. It throws everything off. I’m pleased to say zero char taste. Tons of black pepper and back to that earthy, woody taste. He’s still hitting strong but not in a bad way. No nic fatigue. He holds true to full bodied from start to finish. Yes I smoked him to the nub. Fingernails come in handy to ward off the heat of the ember lol. 

Overall if he weren’t so expensive I’d enjoy him weekly. However at the price point he comes in at, I’m more likely to make him an occasion stick. He’s not mild by any stretch of the imagination. I would not be able to smoke him on a two smoke night. Pairs well with coffee but would probably also go well with a plain coke. His resting smell is intoxicating and one of his best attributes. If you’ve never had one you are missing out in my humble opinion. This guy gets a 9.5/10 for me. Lost .5 for cost. ",1,1729734870.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

1garijv,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1garijv/im_going_to_have_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,I'm going to have to break up with my boyfriend and I'm about to have his baby.,"I (24F) am 35 weeks pregnant with a baby I didn't necessarily want. I'll never make my baby feel unloved or unwanted, but I am terrified to have a baby, especially with the way the world is now. My boyfriend (22M) wanted a baby and therefore poked holes in the rubbers and got me pregnant. After coping with the resulting anger, fear, frustration, etc. I began to try and make myself feel excited. I am excited to meet my little girl, but I am absolutely terrified of labor. 

My bf and I started having problems a couple weeks back. We've sorta been having problems this whole pregnancy, but it got bad enough that I told him to go and stay with his family for a few days. A few days has turned into almost 3 weeks, and he doesnt want to come back. He doesnt want to break up, tho. He wants me to send him n*des and have intercourse with him and give him oral pleasure, but then he wants to run right back down the road again. I am unable to have intercourse because it is ridiculously, incredibly painful right now (just due to being heavily pregnant). I don't want to send him n*des because he demands really specific pictures or videos, gets to bust, and then ignores me for the rest of the night. It's not fair. 

I also feel like he may be cheating. He had messaged other women over the summer, and I found out about it. The only reason I didn't end the relationship there and then was because I needed him. Not emotionally as such, but I had a LOT of complicated things going on in my life and needed his help. 

His family are decently nice to me, and they don't agree with the way he's been treating me. They want to be a part of the baby's life and I feel like it's unfair to cut them out just because bf wants to be an ass. But he lives with them; I don't want to take her to visit and have to see him too. Especially if he gets with another woman.

The other night, i sobbed into the phone, begging him to come back. I was alone at home and my brain was getting dangerously toxic. I needed him to come to me. I needed him to hold me and tell me that everything was going to be okay. I hiccuped and sobbed and begged, I offered him sex and everything else I could think of, but he still wouldn't come. I cried until my ribs hurt and I was scared I had hurt my baby by crying so hard. He still didn't come. 

I want out of this relationship (not that you could really call it a relationship at this point) but I don't want to be alone. I'm someone who craves kisses, hugs and love the way some people crave coffee or cigarettes. I feel so disgusting, undesirable, unwanted. I feel like I'll never find another person to be with, because who wants a woman who has a kid from a previous relationship? I don't wear makeup or do my hair up pretty or wear pretty clothes. I just want someone to look at me and think ""that is the love of my life right there."" I've given so much of myself to make this man happy, and all I've gotten in return is gaslighted, called crazy, and made to feel like I'm the guilty one when I just feel like a real man would want to be here. A real man would've come when I was crying. 

I know I shouldn't take this abuse. I know I should end things for the good of myself and my child. But I don't want to be alone. I just want to feel like I'm loved. I just want a hug or a kiss here and there. I just wanted him to hold my hand in the hospital. Is that too much to ask?",1,1729734653.0,helpme,0,1.0,False

1garg73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1garg73,Late trip report ,"This was stop 2 of 3 for our anniversary trip. We flew into Napoli and got a driver to get to Minori. We were initially going to take the Pintour bus but we’d missed it by 10 minutes and my husband didn’t want to wait at the airport for 3 hours for the next one. All I can say is these drivers are amazing… especially the bus drivers. Seeing them travel down the windy 2 lane roads with such agility is a sight to behold. 🤣 So glad we didn’t rent a car. I don’t think my nerves could’ve handled it. 

We chose Minori because we didn’t want to deal with crowds we read about in Amalfi and we chose to stay Agroturismo Villa Maria because it’s at a lemon farm.  This place is simple but just beautiful. It’s family owned/run and they treated us like family. Each room had an incredible view. You have the option of full board (room and meals) or half board (room and breakfast). Breakfast is simple… coffee made to order, fruits, yogurts, pastries. The other meals we had there are wonderful. Simple ingredients but tasty and well made. 

Oh but the climb. Getting up their us not for the faint of heart! And it’s not just getting up to the Villa, it’s the entire Amalfi area. You’re climbing up and down all the time! 

It’s easy to catch the ferry or Sita bus to other towns in the area from the Minori port area. There’s a little 15 passenger van that leaves from a building next to the church (you literally have to walk towards the church and the face left to find it). It’s cask only and I think the fare is 1.5€ We took it to and from Villa Maria, which is located in the upper part of Minori, providing a spectacular view. We took the Path of Lemons into Maiori and had a great meal at Ristorante Pizzeria Nettuno. 

We took the ferry to Vietri sul Mare for the ceramics. Don’t be like us… find the bus that will take you to the ceramics “zone”. We decided to walk, not realizing it was all uphill. Nearly died (I’m joking, but this was during September and it was HOT). 🥵 

We also took the ferry to Salerno. Much cuter than I anticipated! It’s also where we had one our best meals… Mamma Rosa. Make reservations. Again, simple ingredients but they just… 🤤🤌❤️

Really enjoyed this part of our trip and wish we had stayed longer than 4 days we allotted. The toughest part was trying to coordinate the logistics of when the town bus would pick us up so we could make the right ferry or bus time. Just seemed as thought if you didn’t make the 11:30 ferry to anywhere you weren’t leaving Minori until 2:30 which is when the next ferry would leave. 

Definitely recommend Minori and Villa Maria for a visit to the Amalfi coast. ",4,1729734459.0,amalficoast,1,1.0,False

Fast forward 6 months, still no closure.
I saw that she had finally completed a marathon (a goal of hers for a while now), figured I’d open with that and ask to meet as friends to gauge the vibe. Again, it’s been 6 months with not a single word spoken.

Our situation was very messy; yes we are high-school sweethearts but it's a lot more than that and a lot more complicated. I left home at 17, for reasons mainly pertaining to my safety and I moved in with Zachs family not even 6 months after that. We have lived with each other for almost 6 years now.

That being said, we have a lot of hard times and I'm not lying if I said there hasn't been a million red flags. We fight, we break up, sometimes even kick each other out and we always end up back together. Being together so young & without any friends or family to support me, has left for some intense moments. We have been together through some pretty rough financial times and through every extreme high, plus low, you can think of. 

A lot of the time I have doubts that I am only with Zach because his friends are all my friends,and his family is pretty much mine as well at this point. We both have agreed that we are very different people and we want very different things out of life, yet we keep dragging this relationship on.

The final straw, was when we realized we wanted very different things romantically. When we were teenagers we would do a lot together & I was always on board for it. Admittedly, my mental health was not in a good place and once I found the words for what I was feeling, I came out as asexual to Zach, very late into our relationship. 

He always knew I was Queer and could tell as time went on, I just wasn't enjoying it like he was. I told him that I faked it a lot and I went through a really bad period, where it only felt good if I was high. 

A lot of problems came afterwards from him pressuring me into having sex and we tried everything we could to make sex, more 'fun'. We started communicating better and he tried really hard to make it enjoyable, yet all the pressure to do something I didn't wanted to do, lead to panic attacks in the middle of it. I started developing really bad anxiety, almost like PTSD, from doing things that made me uncomfortable. I even started thinking, that if I couldn't please him he would find me undesirable and not want to be with me. Of course this made everything spiral, the more I pretended to enjoy it for him, the more disgusted I felt about myself. I found myself really heavily disassociating & waiting for it to be over, instead of being in the moment. 

I have heard many times, open relationships don't work and I know it was risky. Our situation though, is very different to things I read online and I sincerely didn't think Zach would do anything, even if I gave him the option. He always made it really clear, despite our problems, he wanted to be with me and felt really bad about how intimacy was making me feel. 

Well it finally happened- he met a girl in our neighborhood online and he told me that they were going to meet up before I left for work. I was a bit distracted & didn't know he meant that day. I also didn't know that he was going to bring her over to our apartment.

I made it very clear with Zach that for this open relationship to work, it needed open communication and honesty. He didn't ask for my permission to bring her into our home and he didn't even tell until the next day. I came home late from work upset that they were cutting back my hours, so he said nothing. He let me sleep in the bed he fucked her, only hours prior and he kissed me goodnight.

He brought her into our home, my safe space. I thought going to see her, meant getting coffee, not bringing her into the apartment that I primarily pay for. This is my space. My privacy. I feel so violated and he said he didn't mean for it go that far. They laid in our bed watching TV & than she got super filrty, pressuring him a lot from what he told me. Afterwards, the girl felt horrible that they went so far and apparently felt sorry for me, ( she was aware of our sitaution),so she went home, unfollowing my partner from all her socials.

My partner that next day, went around the house as if he had been broken up with and I was really confused. He told me they slept together on our way to run errands, so I couldn't even break down. His uncertainty about how it made him feel and how he felt about me after it, says enough. 

I just booked 2 plane tickets for a 10 year anniversary trip to Scotland next year and as crazy as it sounds I was going to propose. Despite how badly we have hurt each other over the years, it hit me one day that I can't really see myself with anyone else. Almost a decade, builds a comfort level with the other person that is unmatched. Even though I wish he would show he cared about me more and put more effort into the relationship, we have shared a lifetime of experiences between each other, that is hard to simply just erase. 

I have no idea what to do and I have no where to go, or a safe place to stay. Even if he goes back home with his family, I cannot afford to live on my own. I just need advice.",3,1729734156.0,relationship_advice,14,0.8,False

1garac6,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1garac6/the_want_to_become_minimalistic_again/,"The Want to Become Minimalistic, Again","So here is my back story as it is important to current day.

I 41M lived by myself for 3 years in a 550 soft studio in Denver before meeting my partner. With having only 550 soft to myself, I knew I had to be conscious about my buying decisions. I was very well of the space I had and didn't buy out of want. I only had a double bed, a love seat, tv stand and the TV in the one room. My closet was a walk in, so I was able to have a dresser in there with ample room for clothing and storage. So that was where I had an extra sheet set and comforter, my laundry basket, laundry supplies, and stored off season clothing in vaccum packs. My kitchen was literally smaller than my closet, so not much storage either. I only had 2 plates, 2 bowls, 2 coffee cups, 2 water glasses, and silverware. Instored my pot, frying pan, and a baking sheet in my oven.

My current situation has me wanting to go back to that! My partner and I live in 3k sqft home with 2 small dogs. There is, what I consider, clutter everywhere! Every wall has about 2 or 3 pictures on it. Dinningroom sitting for 10, with a buffet table, and a china hutch. We have a music room with a sofa, 2 arm chairs, the piano, with plants, floor lamps, and coffee table. 4 bedrooms, 1 turned into a office and 3 1/2 bathrooms. 2 car garage, yeah we don't even park the cars in there because every wall has a 7 foot shelving units that are filled with bins and other stuff. Our attic is chalk full of Christmas; 7 trees and decor to decorate those trees. Decor for the outside innthe attic and garage. Other seasonal decor in the attic as well. Oh, did I mention his clothing takes up about 90% of our master closet along with 2 other walk in closets? I cannot forget his costum closet either!

We have been going on 8 years in March. I knew what I was getting myself in when we moved from Denver to Vegas to Phoenix to our current home. I have asked him before can we pair stuff down, can we pull strings to get rid of stuff, and he has always said ""no"". It is so bad that there is a 4 foot by 4 foot cow print foot rest stool in one of the bedrooms cause we can't put it somewhere else!

I now dream about living back in that 550 sqft studio, I cannot go anywhere without seeing something we do not use. Such as I bought him for his birthday a blow up hot tub, we haven't used it in 4 years. I told him let's get rid of it since all it does is sit in the garage on a shelf, he said no.

I have also gotten to the point of instead of buying him things for our anniversary, birthday, and Christmas; I get him experiences. Such as for Valentines Day, I bought a city pass to 4 places in Atlanta... it has been used!

1gar40o,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gar40o/cmv_the_vast_majority_of_cuban_poverty_and/,CMV: The vast majority of Cuban poverty and authoritarian policy can be attributed to the USA.,"Let me lead with why this view of mine initially changed and why I would like it changed again. I’m a left wing person whose core values are democracy and that regular people should have much more autonomy over their lives than they generally do. So as someone in the west, I believe in policies that will strengthen our democracy (better education, electoral reform, banning lobbying, etc.) and provide more autonomy to people and communities (worker cooperatives, stronger unions, policies to restrict landlords and let people own their own homes, etc.). Thus, I’ve never been supportive of supposedly left wing regimes that in reality seem to be more akin to “state capitalism” and moving the centralisation of power from the wealthy to the political elite, like Stalin’s USSR, Castro’s Cuba, and Mao’s China, as they fundamentally go against the values that make my consider myself on the left. However, as I learn more about Cuba, I find myself sympathising more with their plight and believing that in this specific case, the revolution generally held admirable goals of liberation and the key reason for the poverty nowadays and the authoritarian policy in Cuba can be attributed to US policy regarding Cuba and the wider region.

To change my view, I would require it to be shown that the Cuban revolutionaries genuinely held the goal of a centralisation of power and terrorising the Cuban people (rather than repressive measures such as on free press being instituted to due the historical abuse of this by the US), and/or that the poverty and woes of the Cuban people are due more directly to Cuban policy than it is US policy crippling the Cuban economy. Now, as to why I have changed my view.

**Authoritarian Cuban domestic policy**

My general thesis on the authoritarian policy of Cuba is that most of it can be attributed as a way to avoid the regime change that the US had organised in many other countries which had similar elections or revolutions. 

For example, one instance of regime change that lived in the minds of the Latin American left was the overthrow of Guatemalan president Jacobo Árbenz. At the time that Árbenz was democratically elected, [the United Fruit Company owned 42% of all arable land, and was exempted from paying taxes and import duty ](https://www2.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/historylabs/Guatemalan_Coup_student:RS01.pdf). As in the previous link, this company was very well connected to the US government, and US policy supported this. Moreover, the workers of the company were compensated with next to nothing, and were primarily the poor marginalised groups (the indigenous population, black people, etc.). On top of all this, there was [other instances of a complete disregard for human rights by the US](https://www.oah.org/process/crafts-the-hidden-us-experiments-in-guatemala/) in the country. 

So naturally, Árbenz attempted to change these things. One of his most important policies was land reform, to redistribute all the land to ensure a fairer treatment for the poor workers of these companies (and the few other landowners). Now luckily, while Árbenz did [compensate the landowners based exactly on the value of the land that they declared at tax time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree_900), [the United Fruit Company and other landowners had massively been undervaluing its land](https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/united-fruit-guatemala/) to pay less taxes, so the compensation was relatively easy!

Now, Árbenz did other things that were completely within his rights, but the US didn’t like. [He strengthened labor laws and union rights](https://adst.org/2016/06/cleaning-americas-backyard-overthrow-guatemalas-arbenz/), [he imported arms from Czechoslovakia after the US enforced military embargo on selling arms to Guatemala, diversifying the Guatemalan economy which due to control by United Fruit was almost all based on the export of coffee and bananas](https://cejiss.org/images/issue_articles/2013-volume-7-issue-3/article-05.pdf), [he built highways and hydroelectric dams](https://www.jstor.org/stable/156959), [he continued the massive expansion of public education begun by his predecessor](https://read.dukeupress.edu/hahr/article/53/3/494/151696/Historia-de-la-educacion-en-Guatemala), [he restored freedom of speech and the freedom of the press](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1951v02/d800) and so on. However, one of the most notable things was that [he legalised the communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz). It is important to understand they remained weak, low in number, and were never in Árbenz’s cabinet.

Combined, these things were unacceptable, and the US had decided to overthrow Árbenz via the [covert operation operation PBSUCCESS](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB4/). It’s very important to understand the [methods through which this coup was achieved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Operation_PBSuccess). The US trained and funded a paramilitary force to overthrow the government, they utilised the freedom of speech and press that Árbenz had enacted to use huge amounts of propaganda (both within and outside Guatemala) and psychological warfare to lie about Árbenz and turn the population against him, they positioned their naval fleet as if to invade the country, and they placed the country under a blockade that it promised the military it would lift if Árbenz was deposed. This culminated in Árbenz fleeing the country 3 years after being democratically elected and enacting waves of great legislation, and the [awful legacy of the dictator who succeeded Árbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Castillo_Armas#:~:text=Castillo%20Armas%20cracked%20down%20on,a%20list%20of%20suspected%20communists.) I don’t think needs to be explored, but essentially he rolled back all that the Guatemalans had won with the support of the US.

I know I labour the point of Guatemala on a post about the Cuban revolution, but this coup was extremely important in the minds of revolutionaries such as [Che Guevara](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/castro-che-guevara-1928-1967/) who was in Guatemala city to witness the overthrow of Árbenz, but certainly knowledge of this coup spread to the wider Latin American left, and in particular the Cuban revolutionaries (especially through the first hand experience of Che). Likely, knowledge of other recent coups of democratically elected leaders such as in Iran, or repression of leftist revolutionaries fighting against repressive regimes such as in the Philippines and Laos were known as well. This is on top of the continuation of these policies while Castro held power in Cuba, such as the [US-backed coup in Indonesia that lead to a brutal dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Indonesia), or the [overthrow of the democratically elected leftist in Chile](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/10/1193755188/chile-coup-50-years-pinochet-kissinger-human-rights-allende) who [Castro warned about the possibility of a coup](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v34/n14/greg-grandin/don-t-do-what-allende-did).

I labour on about other countries precisely because I think this is what lives in the minds of the Cuban revolutionaries. After the overthrow of the [brutal US-backed and American mafia-backed dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista) (who was certainly no friend of democracy, freedom of speech, and so on), the Cubans obviously wanted to preserve their extremely popular revolution. In fact, [even the CIA noted in a 1969 report](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00927A006900020002-5.pdf) that Castro consistently maintained the support of the majority of Cubans in his revolutionary program. So, what did they do to maintain an extremely popular revolution in the face of the US, [who wanted to overthrow the regime](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/bay-of-pigs#:~:text=In%20March%201960%2C%20President%20Dwight,overthrow%20of%20the%20Castro%20regime.)? Well, Castro and the other people in the revolution must have considered that in many other US-backed coups beforehand and that would be to come, [the US exploited freedom of speech and the press by funding propaganda in the media](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp90-00552r000201100005-4), they exploited normal democratic processes by huge amounts of election funding and interference for groups that would often become puppet regimes if they won (just ctrl+f for “United States” on [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_electoral_interventions)), covertly [funded and influenced militaries that had some independence from their leaders so that they could overthrow governments themselves without a direct US invasion](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/the-indonesia-documents-and-the-us-agenda/543534/), and so on. Well, the natural position then is that these processes must be curbed to maintain the other benefits of the revolution.

The worst part is, these fears would be validated as time passed on. Between a [literal invasion in the form of the Bay of Pigs](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/the-bay-of-pigs), a [terrorist and propaganda campaign in Operation Mongoose that funded arson attacks and bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mongoose#:~:text=The%20Cuban%20Project%2C%20also%20known,Kennedy.), [countless assassination attempts on Castro’s life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro#:~:text=The%20assassination%20attempts%20reportedly%20included,%2C%20mafia%2Dstyle%20execution%20endeavors%2C), [economic warfare through some of the harshest sanctions seen on a country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/), [sabotage on Cuban industries](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v11/d346), and [diplomatic isolation through exclusion from US led organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba%E2%80%93OAS_relations). Through all this, it was clear that any fears Cubans may have had of a US campaign to overthrow the revolution were legitimate (which as in many other countries would almost certainly regress on the many social gains won by the Cubans), and further cemented these authoritarian measures.

Once again, I want to reiterate that I whole-heartedly support freedom of speech and wish Cuba had it, I whole-heartedly believe in a free media and wish Cuba had that. But I simply cannot find it in me to believe, after the US involvement in countless coups and attempted coups via these avenues not to mention the attempts of regime change in Cuba, that the blame falls on Cuba more than it does for the US. The US created the environment where restriction on freedom of speech and media and democracy is the most clear pathway to preserving any significant gains in small Latin American countries, be it land reform, women’s rights, indigenous and other racial minority rights, and most importantly of all autonomy in their own governance.

While I don’t want to spend as much time on other examples of authoritarian domestic policy as much of it will involve the same explanation as the above, I will give some quick examples of common criticisms of Cuba’s policies. One that I hear often is the brutal executions that came after the revolution. Firstly, the targets of the revolution [were former Batista officials](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/post-revolution-cuba/), who as described before was an extremely brutal regime. There were [many massacres and instances of inhuman torture that killed at least 20,000 people](https://havanatimes.org/diaries/elio/massacres-during-batistas-dictatorship/). Meanwhile, the estimates of the executions in the 6 months after the execution are around [550](http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat6.htm#Cuba59), who as before are noted to be mostly Batista officials who were involved in the barbarism themselves. Now, there were countless executions after this and I don’t know too much about these (e.g. how many of these were these executions of US-backed terrorists vs regular political dissidents), but as before I think it’s reasonable to assume that some of the justification for executions was that there was [legitimately US supported terrorists in Cuba](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4871&context=masters_theses) as discussed before and [CIA-backed groups attempting to overthrow Cuba from the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorio_Revolucionario_Estudiantil). If this was happening, the leadership would certainly be more paranoid and take more draconian measures towards cracking down on this kind of potential for foreign subversion in the country. Once again, I do not support this. I am against capital punishment and am glad that [Cuba has effectively ended this practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Cuba), but this can be justified from the perspective of a small autonomous country suffering from huge interference at the hands of its powerful and adversarial neighbour. 

One other example is the crackdown on religion, and in particular the Catholic church. Firstly, note that [the Catholic church has historically been a very conservative organisation in Latin America](https://oxfordre.com/politics/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-811#:~:text=Summary,elites%20following%20Latin%20American%20independence.), and because of this they have been an [instrument which the CIA uses to try and subvert populations in Latin America against left-wing governments](https://nacla.org/news/2013/3/14/liberation-theology-cia-and-vatican-new-direction-latin-america). Once again, this regrettable act makes sense in the shoes of a leader who is (justifiably) paranoid at the use of any avenues to overthrow the government.

Now, one of the most controversial aspects of the revolution were the Cuban labor camps, or the [UMAP camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Units_to_Aid_Production#:~:text=The%20UMAP%20camps%20served%20as,Castro%20or%20his%20communist%20revolution.). I won’t labor the point too much more, this was extremely regrettable and horrible, but crackdowns on dissidents and religious people could make sense in the eyes of the government as described above. There are things in this that are impossible to justify this way. The fact that a large percentage of these prisoners were LGBT people is awful, and there is obviously no history of the US using the LGBT populations to subvert popular governments around the globe. This is one of the key reasons I make the point that it is only the “vast majority” of Cuban policy that can be attributed to the USA, because there is no justification for this. While once again, this is profoundly terrible and regrettable, this is something that [Castro has personally apologised for](https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyle/fidel-castro-takes-blame-for-1960s-gay-persecution-idUSTRE67U4JE/#:~:text=%22We%20had%20so%20many%20and,policy%20questions%2C%22%20he%20said.). 

The last thing I want to touch on in terms of Cuban domestic policy are the travel restrictions that were implemented. This is similar to what I’ve previously discussed, so I want to be brief. If the US is sponsoring terrorist groups and training militias outside of Cuba, why would they risk letting those militias and terrorists into the island? Once again, freedom of movement is beautiful and I yearn for a world with as much free movement and as few borders as possible, but it’s sadly completely understandable under the thumb of the US.

Now, given the above, I believe there is justification for such policies in the mind of a leader trying to sustain a legitimately uplifting revolution for the people, however, this justification could very well be an excuse to terrorise the population. For example, North Korea has many brutal measures which it blames on the US, however I think this is clear from a basic analysis that the lengths to which they go and the lack of any positive policy in the country nowadays show this is more for clinging onto power more than anything else. So what evidence is there that the Cuban revolution genuinely pushes for positive social change, and would likely do this in a free world where countries can genuinely decide their own policy? I discuss this in my next section.

**The good of Cuban domestic policy**

Now, despite the many awful policies that Cuba has domestically, despite this they have managed to push the country forward in so many directions and [Castro is generally regarded as a leader who, despite flaws in as described above, made incredible strides in human rights as well](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/fidel-castro-s-human-rights-legacy-a-tale-of-two-worlds/). One of the most impressive is that of [universal health care](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2315760/), where the Cuban government has provided free health services for every citizen. Cuba even has [very strong infant mortality stats for the world overall and especially for the region, beating out even the USA on this metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates). Moreover, until recently [life expectancy in Cuba had been on par with the USA for decades](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), which frankly is incredible for a country under such a harsh economic embargo, and in fact Cuba had a higher life expectancy in 2020. Now recently due to [struggles with the pandemic and the wider economy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/13/cuba-revolutionary-generation-old-age), the life expectancy gap between Cuba and the USA has widened from 1 year to 3 years, but I still view this as an incredible achievement in prioritising health care. Finally on the healthcare front, Cuba has invested incredibly and become legitimately a [strong player in](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-cuba-became-a-biopharma-juggernaut) [developing pharmaceutical products](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/article/development-of-cubas-biotechnology-mechanisms-and-challenges/F7B1D8B23AA01C58A55EACF0FB0E3A39).

Another achievement is education. [Cuba provides universal education for free at all levels including higher education](https://acei-global.org/15-facts-on-cuba-and-its-education-system/#:~:text=2%2C%20The%20education%20system%20is,into%20education%20for%20many%20years.), and even the World Bank, which is certainly no communist institution, regards [Cuba as having the best education system in Latin America and the Carribean](https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/LAC/Great_Teachers-How_to_Raise_Student_Learning-Barbara-Bruns-Advance%20Edition.pdf). Moreover, universal efforts such as these have had[ great effects on racial justice](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/abs/puzzle-of-racial-inequality-in-cuba-1980s2010s/DFF6923CAAF7CC66AD8C88D427CC2810), although as this review and [the Cuban government themselves note](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/cuba-acknowledges-vestiges-of-racism-launches-program-to-fight-it-idUSKBN1XX00B/) this is not at all fixed yet, but it has been substantially improved since the Batista regime.

One other notable area of improvement, especially given the awful policy I detailed in the last section, is that of LGBT rights. Now, while there were still horrible stains on their policies throughout the 80s and so on (such as the Mariel boat lift), [Cuba decriminalised homosexuality in 1979](https://coha.org/from-persecution-to-acceptance-history-of-lgbt-in-cuba/), well before other Western nations [such as the US which only decriminalised it everywhere in 2003](https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/us/lgbt-rights-milestones-fast-facts/index.html). Moreover, in 1979 [Cuba established the Multidisciplinary Commission for Attention to Transsexuals, which treated gender-transition issues as a health problem](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6293354/) (although this was of course flawed and cancelled) and [since 2008 have provided all health care for gender reassignment surgeries to its citizens](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN06395397/), something which the US is not close to doing at all. [Cuba was the first Latin American country to celebrate LGBTQ+ history month](https://www.reuters.com/article/cuba-lgbt-history/cuba-marks-latin-americas-first-lgbtq-history-month-idUSL5N2WV5FH/), has [set up a government agency to promote acceptance of sexual diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Sex_Education), and while it was certainly a bit late [has legalised same-sex marriage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/24/cuba-same-sex-marriage-referendum/). 

This is not an extensive list. There are many [great achievements in the area of racial justice for example, although there is still much work to be done](https://oxfordre.com/politics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1702?d=%2F10.1093%2Facrefore%2F9780190228637.001.0001%2Facrefore-9780190228637-e-1702&p=emailAWJYXMlLXOTd2). You can point to [women’s rights](https://un-dco.org/stories/gender-equality-daily-commitment-cuba), [for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Cuba#:~:text=In%20modern%20Cuba%2C%20women%20have,Spain%2C%20making%20abortion%20highly%20restrictive.), although once again there is still work to be done. I could go on, but I think I’ve made my general point that generally the revolution has succeeded in progressive social policy.

Now, of course, I acknowledge Cuba is not at all a perfect country, as I extensively outlined in my first section. However, the Cuban government certainly seems to be more committed to social justice than the US government and many other Western countries. Given this, I fail to see how Cuba’s oppressive domestic policies (which I will reiterate again and again, I do not support and are condemnable) are more likely a result of the desire to be authoritarian than instead to avoid the government being overthrown by the US and the many social gains that Cuba has made being lost.

**Cuban foreign policy**

One thing that is very often criticised about Cuba is its foreign policy. Here, I generally want to make the point that much of Cuba’s foreign policy was good, actually, and where it wasn’t again it is understandable in the light of being at risk of being overthrown by the US government.

One of the most common points is the government's support for foreign terrorism, to the point where it is considered a [state sponsor of terror](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/). However, many of the movements that Cuba supported we look back on today positively, regardless of their methods. One of the most famous groups that Cuba supported was the African National Congress, which was Nelson Mandela’s group. [They supported the ANC in the fight against apartheid](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/cuba-and-struggle-democracy-south-africa), and this was one of the reasons [Mandela so strongly supported the Cubans](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/africa-fidel-castro-nelson-mandela-cuba). They also supported liberation movements in other nearby countries. For example, they [supported the Angolan rebels against the fascist Portuguese government which owned Angola as a colony until 1975 and then in the civil war against sides supported by Portugal and the US](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/do-you-remember-cuba-dedication-to-angola/), and this is regarded as their most significant involvement. However, they also [supported Mozambique in their fight against Portuguese colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambican_War_of_Independence), and also [importantly supported Namibia in the fight against the apartheid South African government](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14682740701284215) (which was enforcing apartheid what was then called South-West Africa) in their fight for independence. Now, I’m sure you can point to awful acts committed by these groups. Indeed, the Truth and Reconciliation Committee said that [“Despite these noble intentions, the majority of casualties of MK operations were civilians.”](https://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume6/section3/chapter2/subsection7.htm?t=%2BGaborone+%2Braid&tab=report) I won’t argue any of this, because today it is inarguable that these groups I’ve pointed to were on the right side of history. The noble side in the fight against apartheid was indeed against apartheid, not the fight to support it, and this is what the Cubans supported. I think that overall goal is more important than the atrocities committed by the righteous side, as in any war there will be atrocities committed on both sides. It’s not reasonable to expect every victim of violence be a holy and completely virtuous victim. It’s why we don’t condemn women who lash out against their abusers for example, and supporting such a woman is not condemnable because of the reactions on their part. I think the exact same idea applies in the fight against apartheid and colonialism. There is also [Cuban support for the IRA](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/i-backed-castros-ira-stance-cuban-ambassador-to-republic/35455292.html) and [the PLO](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/01/31/cuba-a-historic-friend-of-the-palestinian-people), which I would generally view as being on the right side of history.

Now, there are regimes that Cuba supported that I don’t think can be lumped into the same category as the previous cases. For example, Gaddafi’s Libya, North Korea, and I haven’t looked into the guerilla groups they supported in Latin America so I’ll lump them in here. However, as usual, it’s hard to, for example, criticise Cuba’s support to Latin American guerrilla’s too strongly when they were completely isolated in the Western hemisphere by the US and US backed regimes in Latin America that again, I’m not sure I see these as moral wrongs, at least not enough to discount their positive intervention stories.

The most famous event of course is the Cuban missile crisis. This was something which nearly brought the world to its end, and yet I can’t see the Cuban’s as the main “baddies” in this conflict. Firstly, nuclear weapons are undeniably a great way to dissuade an invasion, and certainly as discussed the US was gearing to invade Cuba. Moreover, it’s not like it was helping the Soviet Union do something unprecedented. The US [already had nuclear missiles aimed at the USSR in Italy and Turkey](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/jupiter-missiles-and-endgame-cuban-missile-crisis-sealing-deal-italy-and-turkey), and so in a sense this was just evening the playing field. And certainly Turkey and Italy weren’t under the threat of Soviet invasion in the same sense that Cuba was under the threat of a proper US invasion.

Moreover, Cuba has aspects of foreign policy that are, as far as I’m aware, universally considered positive. For example, [Cuban medical brigades are sent across the world to help developing countries](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/4/1/cuba-has-a-history-of-sending-medical-teams-to-nations-in-crisis), and [Cuba provides more medical personnel to the developing world than the G8 countries combined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_medical_internationalism). The have supported countries in particular [suffering during the Ebola crisis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27956578/#:~:text=Cuban%20authorities%20responded%20immediately%20to,October%202014%20to%20April%202015.), [or during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8136810/) for example. Cuba has also supported [literacy campaigns in Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Literacy_Campaign#:~:text=The%20first%20phase%20of%20the,learned%20to%20read%20and%20write.) for example. I really do with all of this believe that generally, Cuba’s foreign policy has been overall positive, despite some disagreeable policies and alliances. Of course, this all comes under the thumb of the US as well.

**The Cuban Economy**

Finally, I want to talk about the economy. I want to point out that first of all, I’m no fan of central planning. I generally support more libertarian approaches such as worker cooperatives, and the idea of public and private competition in markets to get the best of both worlds. But it’s clear through, say, the rapid economic development of China and even the economy of the USSR that central planning alone does not condemn a country to poverty. In fact, many economists note that even in capitalist countries like [South Korea that their “anti-market” policies were key in their economic development](https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/17/2/131/1675971). So [why is Cuba’s economy so awful](https://www.reuters.com/markets/cuba-announces-new-measures-war-time-economy-amid-growing-crisis-2024-07-01/)? Is it the result of horrible leadership or is it the result of the economic embargo?

One thing to note is that [Cuba has significantly liberalised it’s economy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55967709), and the percentage of workers in the private sector has risen from [8% in 1981 to 35% in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Cuba). On the face of it, this isn’t too dissimilar to China and Vietnam, other countries that are communist (or at least they have an extremely powerful state that plays a huge role in the economy) yet doing incredibly well economically. Yet, [the economic situation in Cuba continues to deteriorate rapidly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/13/cuba-revolutionary-generation-old-age). So what’s happening? The main thing that hasn’t changed is the existence of the embargo. In fact, one of [Trump’s final acts was to make the embargo even harsher](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-hits-cuba-with-new-terrorism-sanctions-in-waning-days), despite the aforementioned liberalisation of Cuba’s economy. Some of the incredible achievements in healthcare mentioned before are waning, such as [the life expectancy and child mortality](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/cuba). Yet, the policies of Cuba haven’t substantially changed on this front, but the embargo has gotten even stronger. 

[A comprehensive report was released on the effects of the embargo on the health and nutrition of Cuba](https://www.american.edu/centers/latin-american-latino-studies/upload/impact-of-us-embargo-on-health-nutrition-in-cuba-1997.pdf) by the US committee for the WHO. The embargo was reported to increase malnutrition among the population and resulting in low-birth babies, decrease the water quality by restricting access to water treatment chemicals, restrict the amount of drugs that Cuba has theoretical access to by over 50% (and that’s not even considering the practical effects of whether they can even buy the rest), among many other horrible outcomes. [Several preventable health crises have occurred due to the sanctions](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-132-2-200001180-00010?journalCode=aim), and this is a consistent story [from all the research I can find](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1380757/).

One of the most insane things is that the [US tightened the embargo following the collapse of the Soviet Union](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-cuba-relations), and [making it exorbitantly difficult for foreign countries and companies in general to trade with Cuba](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1537&context=jil). While there was some normalisation under Obama, the [new sanctions under Trump that Biden left in have continued to devastate the country and severely restrict the amount it can trade with foreign nations](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cubas-humanitarian-crisis/). With the continued sanctions ever since its inception, there are estimates that overall, [the embargo has cost Cuba $1.1 Trillion US dollars](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/6/17/el-bloqueo-55-years-of-obstructing-the-cuban-people), which for an economy the size of Cuba is an incredible loss. In fact, [since 1970 the cumulative GDP of Cuba totals just under $2 Trillion](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CU), and so the proportion that this embargo has cost Cuba is astronomical. Especially once considering the fact that economic growth tends to be exponential.

Moreover, one of the worst parts about this is due to the fact that Cuba was something close to a colony of the US before the revolution, [80% of the sugar that Cuba produced was sold in the US](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/jq085j963/sf2688339/ft848t829/ERSF-03-07-1962_Cuba_Shifts_Trade_in_Farm_Products_to_Soviet_Bloc.pdf), and [sugar comprised 87% of Cuba’s exports](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v06/d285). Moreover, the US owned [60% of Cuba’s sugar industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba%E2%80%93United_States_relations). Being forced to be such a monocrop economy is obviously a horrible economic choice, but especially so when the country which you had to sell all your sugar to then places you under a horrible economic embargo. Factors such as this, that it wasn’t exactly the Cuban people’s choice to become a monocrop economy, aren’t even factored into the analysis on how much Cuba has lost due to the embargo.

While I’m no economist and understand that this economic section was a little all over the place, I hope that I’ve made it clear why I believe so much of Cuba’s poverty was due to the US embargo. Sure, I am not exactly a fan of their economic system and certainly would rather them liberalise it and allow more worker cooperatives and so on, but overall, it’s hard to say that this is the main reason for Cuba’s woes. [I’ll end with a quote from a right-wing economist, certainly no friend to the Cuban government](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jun/15/cuba-us-trade-embargo-obama) who gives the final interesting point I want to make: why let Cuba have a scapegoat if their economic policies are so bad? If they can see that their policies are so bad when having a level playing field with everyone else, let them see that! Maybe then there’ll be no excuse and finally enough pressure to change the system for the better.

>“The embargo has been a failure by every measure. It has not changed the course or nature of the Cuban government. It has not liberated a single Cuban citizen. In fact, the embargo has made the Cuban people a bit more impoverished, without making them one bit more free. At the same time, it has deprived Americans of their freedom to travel and has cost US farmers and other producers billions of dollars of potential exports. As a tool of US foreign policy, the embargo actually enhances the Castro government's standing by giving it a handy excuse for the failures of the island's Caribbean-style socialism.”

**Conclusion**

Really, after looking into it, I struggle to see the common narrative that Cuba is just another backwards communist country with tyrannical leaders who are hungry to maintain power at the expense of its population. I can’t help but see a genuinely progressive and admirable revolution that has been forced towards regretful and bad policy in order to maintain the victories that it was able to achieve since the fall of the dictatorship. I’m interested to see the arguments against this view.",0,1729733429.0,changemyview,33,0.44,False

So I wanted to have that experience with my dad too. But too many people watched HGTV during COVID and decided they knew how to remodel a house..... They did not, and we both agreed we weren't paying that much for a house that needed to be remodeled from it's remodel. This is important for later stories) 

(For this story we will call my son James, my dad will be Harry, landlord will be Useless, and entitled roommate will be EB for Entitled bitch) 

When looking for a temp place, we needed to find something furnished as I was moving from the state to the left and my father the state above and to the right, and new we were buying so we agreed we wanted to have new furniture (we always bought second hand and he and I living together when I was a kid never had anything new, so we felt we deserved it). We found what we was an AMAZING mob era mansion, with all the rich people mansion, outdoor amenities. Since we only planned to be there for 3 months tops, we thought this would be great for my (then) 4th grader. 

When we first moved in we were told that there were only 2 other people that were living there, and that they lived upstairs, while we would be taking the three bedrooms that were downstairs (there were two ""exterior"" rooms that had doors into the main living area but a 3rd bedroom that was down the hall, and couldnt be accessed unless through one of the other two rooms, and a bathroom at the end). That didn't last more than 3 weeks, but that's a different story. 

We didn't meet the other people the first couple days we were there. The 3rd day we meet EB, the very first thing you notice about her is that she, absolutely, smelled like she slept in a trashbag full of stale cigarette butts. Aside from that she's ridiculously pleasant, and kindly shows my son where all the basketball's and what not are outside, as well as showing me around the kitchen. We have normalish new roommate small talk (she's 25+ years older than me so it's a bit awkward) and that was that for a few days. 

Fast forward a few days and I start to notice that it smells a bit like stale cigarette smoke, I brush it off knowing that Useless (who has a private mother-in-law suite off the livingroom, but only had access into from outside), and EB both smoke. Sometimes out back by the pool, or by the back garage door, so I just figured it was because they smoked too close to the door and didn't wait long enough before coming inside. So I shrugged it off. The next day I'm walking to the kitchen to get my coffee, and there's EB standing on the Landing upstairs SMOKING!!!! No shame whatsoever, even though 2ft from her head there's a no smoking sign. 

I'm an extremely non confrontational person, if I can avoid it (that and my mama bear mode scares even me 😂), so I said nothing, got my coffee and went back to my room and called my father. Harry is PISSED (he's a former smoker and is one of those 'yeah I used to be a smoker but now I hate them types'), he calls Useless and I'm assured that it won't happen again... Jokes on me, it would in fact keep happening, over and over and over! 

Everything seems fine the next day, until I'm in the kitchen making dinner! EB comes screeching into the kitchen, like a derranged, and possessed pterodactyl. She starts lighting into me, and I'll never forget the words she said (they were actually hilarious), she goes ""You fucking fat entitled fucking princess ass narwhal, who the hell do you think you are?"" I look at her like a deer in the headlights, tripping on LCD because it thought it saw a 5 headed Cougar after it. Then proceeded to ask her what she's talking about. For the next 10 minutes she switches between screaming and screeching at me, about how it's fucked up that she has to smoke all because my ""dumb ass kid is in the house now"" 

I'm internally seething and can't leave because I'm  cooking something that can't be stopped once started, and must be constantly stirred. I'm doing my best to ignore her, but finally get annoyed and pick up my phone to call Harry. This EB then screeched ""of course the fat bitch who can't live without Daddy paying her bills is going to whine to Daddy"". Ive lost it at this point, put my phone in my pocket, pick up the pan, walk past her into my room (don't worry dear readers,thankfully the food was nearly done cooking, so I could finish it off the heat) 

Not 5 minutes later there is a loud, firm, and insistent knock on my door. There's Useless FUMING, he then starts raging at me about ""cooking in the rooms"" (one of the rules was no cooking in the rooms). So I ask him, ""who's cooking"" and he wags his finger at the pan in my hand. So I look at him and say ""oh that, I simply decided to bring my child his dinner in his room so he didn't have to listen to the irate Banshee that's blaming him for the reason why she can't smoke in the house, even though you have signs plastered in nearly every room of the house"". He looked a me for a minutes then just turned and huffed away. 

Nothing has been said over the next couple of days, I barley see EB, and when I do, she's at least silent, so I think that's that (again boy was I wroooong). I go to take a shower one morning, and I'm a later shower taker, as I like to have my coffee/wake up juice of the day and smoke a joint, which I do while walking the dog, so I'm not even on the property. It's probably 10:30-11, it was already warm in the bathroom, so I opened the tiny window above the mirror. A few minutes after I'm in the shower, I again smell smoke in the house. This time is different though, I decide to get out of the shower long enough to ask my son to call Harry and tell him it's happening again. As I'm stepping out of the shower, the same time EB sticks her lips up to the screen of the bathroom window AND A CLOUD OF SMOKE FOLLOWS (turns out she was standing on the storage box for the garden hose). 

Thankfully my son hates putting his head under the shower head, so we have a cup in the shower. I filled it and tossed out the window. Her shrill gasp was music to my ears. 

There's a ton more crazy ass entitled stories about this woman. And before y'all ask, finding a furnished space for 3 people and a small dog, for a reasonable price, in a major tourist area in the states, was impossible and beggers can't be choosers. So I had to suck it up unfortunately. ",21,1729733250.0,EntitledPeople,7,0.84,False

I reached out to her last week, and we grabbed coffee last weekend. I told her that I want to start dating her again. We had a nice coffee chat, but she didn’t seem super interested in dating again (and she got a little mad when I brought it up). She felt like I wasn't honest about why I broke up with her (because I actually do feel a very strong connection to her).

She said that she needs to think about it, and we left it at that.

I texted her after our coffee that I’ll give her some space, and that she can respond to me when/if she feels like it. That was over three days ago, and I haven’t heard anything from her since then.

I am open to seeing a movie and going to a theatre that has those cuddle seats, going to an arcade room(?), a museum, some drinks (smoothie, coffee, tea etc.),  going for a walk or relaxing at the park (if the weathers nice, it’s Michigan idk), I’m open to pretty much whatever I am not to picky.
Other than that I’d say I’d love to just cuddle and relax with you and be your big or small spoon!!!

I’m more than fine meeting somewhere I am also more than willing to text for a bit to get comfortable with each other first, but if we just can’t wait I am fine with meeting sooner. I don’t mind if we don’t meet immediately because we are random people on the internet. let’s get to know each other first. I’m not saying we need to talk for over a month before we meet but a at least a few days  or so. Or until we are comfortable.

I don’t know what else to say besides if you are reading this I hope you are having a good day and if not I hope your day gets better! Hope to hear from you soon!",1,1729732950.0,cuddlebuddies,1,1.0,False

Atrazine manufacturer is Bayer which now owns Monsanto. 

***

Bottled water can contain just as much atrazine as tap water. Boiling water may actually increase the concentration of atrazine.

Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides in America – it is estimated that about 70 million pounds are used on crops every year.

Atrazine has been linked to various cancers, reproductive harm, and developmental delays.

https://clearlyfiltered.com/articles/atrazine

*

Atrazine can have harmful effects on the reproductive systems of men, including: 
 
Demasculinization: Atrazine can decrease testicular size, sperm production, and androgen production. 
 
Testicular lesions: Atrazine can cause testicular lesions, or loss of testicular tissue, in mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. 
 
Feminization: Atrazine can cause partial or complete feminization in fish, amphibians, and reptiles. 
 
Low sperm count: Atrazine exposure is correlated with low sperm count in humans. 
 
Poor semen quality: Atrazine exposure is correlated with poor semen quality in humans. 
 
Impaired fertility: Atrazine exposure is correlated with impaired fertility in humans. 
 
Atrazine is a chlorotriazine pesticide that can be absorbed into the body through ingestion. It can also give off toxic fumes if it's heated or burned.

New Study Confirms Atrazine's Effects Across a Range of Species (Including Us)

Put plainly: atrazine shrinks testicles, reduces sperm count, and can even make males grow ovaries.

*

Atrazine is a herbicide that can have adverse health effects on women, including: 
 
Menstrual cycle changes
Women who use atrazine may have irregular menstrual cycles, missed periods, or intermenstrual bleeding. 
 
Hormonal changes
Atrazine can disrupt hormone function, leading to low estrogen levels or lower estrogen levels during a key part of the menstrual cycle. 
 
Reproductive health
Atrazine can disrupt reproductive health and lead to reproductive tumors. 
 
Cancer
There is suggestive evidence that atrazine exposure may increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. 
 
Atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant in groundwater, surface water, and rain. It is frequently detected in agricultural areas of the Midwest, where it is the most widely used herbicide in the United States. 
 
Atrazine does not build up in the body, and most metabolites leave within 24-48 hours.

Menstrual cycle characteristics and reproductive hormone levels in women exposed to atrazine in drinking water

In toxicological studies, exposure to chlorinated triazines, which include atrazine and its metabolites has been shown to cause altered estrous cycles, delayed puberty, pregnancy loss, prostate inflammation, hermaphroditism and gonadal dysgenesis (Cooper et al., 2007, Hayes et al., 2002, Hayes et al., 2003, Laws et al., 2000, Narotsky et al., 2001, Stevens et al., 1994, Stoker et al., 1999, Wetzel et al., 1994).

Atrazine is a chlorinated herbicide of the triazine class.[2] It is used to prevent pre-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn),[3] soybean[3] and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns. Atrazine's primary manufacturer is Syngenta and it is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States,[2] Canadian,[4] and Australian agriculture.[5] Its use was banned in the European Union in 2004, when the EU found groundwater levels exceeding the limits set by regulators, and Syngenta could not show that this could be prevented nor that these levels were safe.[6][7]

Yes, atrazine can affect humans: 
 
Reproductive system
Atrazine can affect the reproductive system in humans by blocking the surge of luteinizing hormone that occurs before ovulation. Atrazine exposure has also been linked to poor semen quality in human males. 
 
Cancer
There is some evidence that atrazine exposure may increase the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. However, more research is needed to make a definitive connection between atrazine and cancer. 
 
Birth defects
Atrazine exposure may cause birth defects. 
 
Liver, kidney, and heart damage
Atrazine can cause liver, kidney, and heart damage in animals, and it's possible that it could cause these effects in humans as well. 
 
Brain aging
Inhaling atrazine can cause neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and accelerate brain aging. 
 
Preterm birth
Some studies suggest a link between atrazine exposure in drinking water and preterm birth. 
 
Atrazine is a widely used pesticide that has been found in drinking water wells in the Midwestern United States. You can reduce your risk of exposure to atrazine by ensuring that your water supply is free of atrazine.

Side effects
…
Atrazine side effects
Atrazine, a herbicide used on commercial crops, can have a number of side effects on humans and wildlife: 
 
Human health: Atrazine can cause a variety of negative health effects, including: 
 
Nervous system: Drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, mental or mood changes, shaking, seizures, and fast or irregular heartbeat 
 
Gastrointestinal: Constipation and dry mouth 
 
Other: Organ damage, birth defects, nose bleeds, facial edema, salivation, drooping eyes, chills, and exhaustion 
 
Wildlife: Atrazine can have negative effects on wildlife and the environment. For example, atrazine can cause birth defects, reproductive tumors, and weight loss in amphibians. 
 
Mammary gland development: Atrazine can delay mammary gland development in female rats. 
 
Testicular toxicity: Atrazine can cause testicular damage in male quail. 
 
Atrazine can enter the body through inhalation or by swallowing food, water, or soil that contains it.

Atrazine is the second-most commonly used pesticide after glyphosate, more commonly known as Monsanto's Roundup. “Government agencies have a legal and moral duty to ensure that harmful chemicals aren't sprayed in the same places where vulnerable wild animals are trying to survive,” said Hartl.

(BUT what about vulnerable humans and domestic species??)

Degree Xtra Herbicide

Herbicide

Degree Xtra® herbicide is a premix that contains acetochlor and atrazine. As soil temperatures rise, the patented micro-encapsulation technology in Degree Xtra delivers an immediate dose of atrazine with a slow release of acetochlor for just the right amount of weed control. The process allows for increased crop safety and longer-lasting residual control of a wide range of key grass and broadleaf weeds.

The merger between Bayer and Monsanto was a $63 billion acquisition of the US agricultural company by the German pharmaceutical and chemicals company in 2018: 
 
Announcement
In 2016, Bayer and Monsanto signed an agreement for Bayer to acquire Monsanto for $128 per share. 
 
Approval
The European Commission approved the merger in 2018, but with conditions, including the sale of parts of the company. 
 
Impact
The merger was one of the biggest acquisitions in history and had a significant impact on agricultural practices and policies. However, it is also considered one of the worst mergers in history. 
 
Challenges
The merger faced challenges including antitrust concerns and Monsanto's controversial brand image. The US Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to block the merger. 
 
Bayer's woes
Bayer's shares have plunged more than 60% since the merger was announced, and shareholders have pushed Bayer to undo it. This is due in part to the company's exposure to litigation over Monsanto's herbicide Roundup. 
 
Bayer drops Monsanto name
Bayer dropped Monsanto's name after the acquisition.

Coli: A Tale of Two Uncertainties,"The air in Seattle was thick with the scent of rain and the promise of coffee. It was a typical morning, but the news cycle was anything but. The E. coli outbreak at McDonald's was dominating headlines, and I couldn't help but feel a familiar sense of unease. I've spent years working in the tech world, but my roots are in the Philippines, where food safety is a constant concern. Back in Manila, my family always emphasized the importance of thorough handwashing and cooking meat properly. It was a lesson I carried with me to the United States, and it was hard to shake the feeling that this latest outbreak was a reminder of the fragility of our food supply. 

The investigation pointed to sliced onions as the culprit, but the details were still hazy. It was a stark contrast to the certainty of the election, which seemed to be hanging in the balance. The polls were tight, and the outcome felt as unpredictable as a dice roll. It was a bit like the time I was working on a complex software project at Google. We had a deadline looming, and every decision felt like a gamble. We poured over data, ran simulations, and tried to anticipate every possible outcome. But in the end, we were still left with a healthy dose of uncertainty. 

As I delved deeper into the election analysis, I was struck by the parallel between the E. coli outbreak and the political landscape. Both were driven by unseen forces, both were shrouded in uncertainty, and both held the potential to significantly impact our lives. The similarities were unsettling, but they also offered a valuable lesson: life is full of uncertainties. We can't control everything, but we can learn to embrace the unknown. 

The E. coli outbreak eventually subsided, as did the uncertainty surrounding the election. Both events reminded me that the world is a complex and unpredictable place. But it also reminded me of the resilience of the human spirit. We have the ability to adapt, to learn, and to overcome challenges. As I sat down with my morning coffee, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope. Even in the face of uncertainty, life goes on. And we, like the millions of people who voted in the election, will continue to navigate the complexities of our world, one step at a time.",1,1729731618.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England, from Massachusetts, I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win a lot!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay, geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

Message me if you’re weird in your own way, genuine, grounded yet haven’t lost your childlike wonder, and overall fun!

1gaq821,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1gaq821/tipping/,Tipping ,"Hey! I just wanted to share an experience I’ve been having at my local DB lately. I start work at 6 am and have been stopping by Dutch right when they open at 5 am on my work days (about 3-4x a week) and the morning crew at this DB is particularly confrontational with tipping. When I go by this DB in the afternoon, they usually just hand me the iPad and let me fill it out without looking at it but lately the girls at the window have been saying “do you want to add a tip for the crew today?” And doing the iPad themselves after I pass on tipping. I was just wondering if you guys do this normally or if this is just a thing at my DB. I wanted to put it out there that it makes me feel a bit awkward if im in between paychecks and decide not to tip that day😅 so I would probably advise yall to not do that if that’s something you do. Especially when my drink is already almost 7$ I rarely ever tip. I recently quit my job at starbucks where I worked for 3 years so I do believe in tipping baristas but in my mind my perspective was always if this person doesn’t tip someone else will and I never expected people to tip because it’s a coffee shop not a hair salon or a restaurant. Anyways! That’s all😁",4,1729730803.0,dutchbros,11,0.67,False

1gaq7nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gaq7nx/i_like_a_woman/,I like a woman,"Hi everyone, 

I come here to write this because I can't trust anyone to speak without them having a “you are disgusting” bias, and I need to tell someone. This is making me struggle with my feelings. I apologise in advance, this is gonna be long, because I want you to have a good overview.


I (39M) am married to the love of my life (37F). We are together since we were teens (will check later). We are happy together, we have the life we wanted and developed together, except for the part where the life does whatever it wants. We have fight together, we have laugh together, we have done everything together since we decided we wanted to spend our lives with the other one together.

She's just wonderful. She's the best person I know. She's lovely, clever, faithful and trustful. She loves her people, she takes care and makes them know with her acts. 

But once we were young and I was stupid enough to cheat on her, so we broke. I know I did it so bad, I wasn't giving her the value she deserved, because I was a worse person than I'm now that she has helped me be the best me, and I wasn't giving myself all the value, as the good guy I am and I'm always been. At that point of my life, I didn't feel like that and I saw myself in a bad way. Teen problems, maybe. Life's a bitch sometimes and I wasn't prepared to be a responsible adult.


A couple of years later, we eventually got back together, we talked about all. I explained how I was feeling then and apologised. Her pain was my fault, because I cheated before broking with her and that's not how you do it. She thought she was partly guilty too, because she has been insecure all her life, but we talked a lot, we put our hearts out, we share our feelings to each other, we worked together to be a best person to each other and we grew up as a couple. 


Time goes by, and we are living together for some years. Jobs come an go, a couple of house changes and we decide to marry. I proposed on a lovely, exciting, intimate and romantic way in our special place. We build the best wedding ever and we enjoy it with family and friends. We continue growing as a couple and I feel we are the best us ever, and I especially had changed for the best. I resolved some personal issues so I was a better person, a better husband, a better friend, a better worker. Thanks to my wife and to the life I live with her, I was better. 

Being with her made me change completely how I saw relationships and how I wanted to be with a partner. I started being more like her, I started taking care of her, I took care of our house so she had more free time for relaxing and resting (she has a tough job), I was loving her in all the ways I could.

At some point, I realised that cheating is a decision. You decide to cheat, there's no accidents, there's no “I let myself go”, that's all bullshit. When you are about to cheat, there's this last moment when you decide you are going to do that. And I knew I will never make that decision, I will never break my wife again being so stupid and selfish to make that decision. 


So now, present day, my wife is going through some mental issues associated to modern life. I suffered the same last year and I'm grateful for having been there before her, for some reasons. 

One reason is that if she had knew exactly how i was feeling, she would have done much more efforts to help me, and doing a lot of efforts on this moment of her life had lead her to her condition. 

Of course she knew what I was passing through, but this condition is a thing you can't truly understand if you hadn't been there. Try explaining pain to someone who has never feel pain. You can't do that.

Other reason I'm grateful for is that I use all that I learned to help her. I've doubled my efforts to make her happy, comfortable, relaxed and rested. I do all the chores and take care of her wellbeing (and that's exactly what she did when I was suffering this condition), while getting in shape again and trying to grow myself learning something new and looking for a better job, so she can be in a clean and tidy home, without thinking if there's anything left to be done, and also see that this condition has an end and after that end, a person can be herself again. I spend almost all of my free time with her, I do all of those things at home, while she's resting or entertained watching series or social media. I'm loving her more than ever and maybe I'm loving her better than ever because I want her to be healthy again to continue being as happy as ever. Now we are happy, but the happiness is stronger when we are both good.


Now you know our past and our present. I wanted to give you a good approximation to us, as a couple, and as people. Now that you're going to judge me, at least you have some points. 

 
So… I like other woman. She works in the same building I do, and we know each other for several years. We had a cordial relationship for many years. We said our hellos and had some small talk. A couple of years ago, her company moved nearer mine and we started talking more. We are not friends, but it's almost at the same level in the personal way with the colleagues I like to be with. We have developed a good relationship. We usually take coffee together, once or twice a week, sometimes with all her colleagues, sometimes just the two of us. We talk about a couple of things we have common interest in, a little about our friends and our lifes, and make some jokes. We are close enough and know each other enough to ask for advice about something the other one knows or to borrow some things we know each other has. Most part of the time we always are in a good mood together. 

One of the things we talk about is mental health, because our jobs are pretty mental demanding and the bosses are quite disconnected about our necessities. She's grateful I speak about it openly because it's like a taboo and with our conversations she's learning some point of views about that, in order to understand the signals and be prepared to avoid the worst part. 

We barely speak or text out of the job, some days we continue same day previous conversations or so, some news about our common interests, stuff like that, and sometimes some jokes, cause I'm such a clown, but we don't communicate daily. 


The other day we talked about her company moving to other part of the building and we spoke about how we were going to miss the coffee breaks. We agree to keep taking coffee together, as we're not going to be that far. So did her colleagues too, it's not only a two of us thing. When they left, I told her she was the one I was going to miss the most, because it is great to have her around even if we don't talk every day. She told me she would be missing me too, and that she always checks if I'm at my desk when passing by. It didn't feel any romantic or anything.

And until recently that was all. Nothing has change between us. We behave the same way. We talk the same way and about the same stuff, we do the same things. But I've realised I like her, that's the truth. 

I didn't look for it. I'm not flirting. I'm not trying to get sexual with her. I don't want a relationship with her. I don't love her. But I like her, and that feelings are making me feel awful, a bad person and a bad husband. 

I don't want any of this, and of course I'm not trying anything with her. I love my wife and I don't have any doubts about her, about us nor about our relationship, and I feel bad of having developed feelings for another woman. I'm sleeping badly or having trouble falling asleep. 

I have pretty clear that if my feelings keep growing I'll lower my interactions with her to the level of cordial relationship again. It would hurt because she's almost a friend, but that would be the best thing to do. 



Thanks for holding up to here, I know this is a long text but I needed to write it. In some way, I'm relieved for telling someone, but I know tomorrow will feel bad again along the day

Casa de Luz equivalent (community center for wellness events)?,"Howdy! Any Austinites who could point me to a place in Portland that is similar to Casa de Luz? For those not familiar: Casa de Luz is a near magical place that is basically a community center for wellness/crunchy hippie shit - really, it’s more like a campus. It has several spaces for group classes and workshops, such as group breathwork, meditation, tantra, yoga, all kinds of misc other events along these lines. It has a Kava bar and a cacao/coffee shop and a juice bar. It has an apothecary. It also has a vegan restaurant that is partially run by volunteers. It’s amazing. What I really like and miss about it though is that it’s a great space for socializing with like-minded folks. People often hang out here between classes or just come to chill. I was really hoping to find something like this in Portland. Any leads? If not, suggestions on where I might find group breath work classes/sessions would be super appreciated. Thanks so much!
