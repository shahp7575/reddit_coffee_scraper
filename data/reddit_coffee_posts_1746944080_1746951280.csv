A tale of heat, hollandaise, and emotional damage.

6:30 AM – Pre-Shift Calm (Delusional Phase)
You show up early, knowing brunch is a warzone. You sip burnt coffee, fire up the flat top, and tell yourself: “If I can get through Valentine’s Day, I can do this.”
Spoiler: you can’t.

7:15 AM – Egg Prep Begins
You prep 200 eggs. Some for poaching. Some for scrambling. Some for boiling. You whisper, “You’re beautiful, don’t break,” to each egg like a desperate therapist.

Sous chef yells: “WE NEED MORE HOLLANDAISE.”
You: “We just made two gallons!”
Sous chef: “Well guess what—it’s Mother’s Day, and everyone wants to drown their feelings in butter.”

9:00 AM – Tickets Start Printing... and Don’t Stop
You glance at the ticket machine. It’s printing nonstop. You’re 40 minutes behind and haven’t plated your first dish yet.

Expediter: “Table 6 needs an eggs Benedict, gluten-free, sauce on the side, add avocado, no meat.”
You: “That’s just... warm sadness on toast.”

10:30 AM – Poachpocalypse
You’re juggling 12 poached eggs at once. Two break. One slides off the plate. One comes back because the yolk’s too firm. You resist the urge to fake your own death and hide in the walk-in.

Server drops a ticket with a smile:
“Chef, this table says they're in a rush.”
You don’t scream, but it’s close.

12:00 PM – Benedict Backlog
Every single person has ordered some version of eggs Benedict.
Your hollandaise is breaking. Your wrist is twitching. You’ve said “Behind!” more than your own name.

You whisper to yourself: “After brunch, I will become a librarian.”

1:30 PM – The Last Ticket... or So You Thought
You start cleaning. You feel hope. Then a 10-top walks in and orders 3 steak & eggs, 4 Bens, 2 vegan scrambles, and a “breakfast sushi.” You look at the sous chef.
Neither of you speaks. Only pain remains.

3:00 PM – Silence
You’ve cooked over 200 plates. You’ve died and come back. You peel off your apron, sticky with egg goo, and wonder what your own mother had for brunch.

You consider texting her but fall asleep standing in the walk-in next to a crate of lemons.",1,1746951139.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

I would love if we can talk OOC and become friends. I'm someone who ask you about your day and share how mine was, maybe sneaking in a picture or two of my two cats. Talk about games, books or shows.

About the rp: 
I have this little plot in my head where my character moves in the same appartment as your character and become room/housemates. I would love for them to go from enemies to lovers in a slowburn romance. I like to include 🌶🌶 but i do not want this to be the main focus. I don't really have much other stuff in mind so if you have ideas, feel free to tell me <3 Other than that it would be amazing if we can make a story/plot together and come up with some cool creative ideas 😊

My character:
Name is Aron, he is 26 years old , 100% gay and he is a bit of a diva and a total bottom. And maybe even a virgin even though he might not admit that. He has blond hair and blue eyes.  He wears shorts and crop tops because they are comfortable and he loves flaunting his body.  

Aron is pretty new in the city and doesn't know his way around yet. He got this job at a cute little coffeebar around the corner and is slightly crushing on his straight boss. 

Aron is a bitch and doesn't like anyone straight away, he tolerates people if they don't annoy him to much. But once you get to know him and can make way through his heart, he is a big softy and gets very protective and maybe even jealous. 

His hobbies are mostly going out its either to a club/bar or just go drink some coffee somewhere and maybe go shopping. But he is also a sucker for staying in with a glass of wine/drink, some snacks and a good movie. 

My rp style:
I only roleplay in third person and I prefer using discord and have our own private server. Love using Tupper but if you don't feel like it, that's totally cool! It's all about having fun afterall! I have years of rp experience, still my English grammar ain't the best but I really love roleplaying and connecting with someone so I hope you can see past my errors and enjoy the rp with me ☺️

My rules:

- Be 26+ Otherwise it's uncomfortable for me.
- Don't dm me for hook-ups or to get off. I am taken and just here to make friends.

1kjvsyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dr_Daniel_Harper/comments/1kjvsyx/the_most_popular_weight_loss_supplements_what/,The Most Popular Weight Loss Supplements – What Science Says About Them,"Almost everyone who is trying to lose weight looks for that extra help. Many people even resort to supplements or to herbals. However, before you reach for a bottle off the shelf or order online, research into many of these products are dubious at best. Sometimes there’s not much science behind them, and at other times there are truly health risks to be found.



The FDA has also acted against some weight loss supplements for including prescription drugs that are not mentioned on their labels. To put it differently, you may not always be aware of what you consume. Supplements are not reviewed by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before the product can enter the market unlike food or medication. That’s why it’s crucial to understand what you’re taking.

# Popular Weight Loss Supplements – What the Research Says.

# Chitosan.

Chitosan is a type of sugar that comes from the shearing of shellfish including shrimp and crabs as well as lobsters. It is said to block the absorption of fat and cholesterol.

But does it work?

The answer: **not really.**

Independent researchers, such as the Natural Medicines and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, do not see large evidence of weight loss effect of chitosan. While safe to consume, it may cause a mild upset stomach or constipation in some people. Avoid it if you have a shellfish allergy.

# Chromium Picolinate.

Chromium is a mineral that helps your body process insulin and store macronutrients. The product is used to reduce weight. In other words, a review of 24 clinical trials saw little to no impact on weight.

According to Natural Medicines, it may not work. People regard 35 mcg or less as safe, but anything higher can result in.

• Insomnia.

• Mood changes.

• Headaches.

• Cognitive issues.

• Possible harm to kidneys especially for those with previous problems.

# Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA).

CLA is a fat found in meat and dairy products. The supplement is used in order to cut body fat while increasing muscle mass.

According to some studies, obtaining 1.8–6.8 grams a day could provide small benefits. However, other studies show it might not cause weight loss at all. CLA may be effective according to Natural Medicines.

Watch out: When used over time, the risk of insulin resistance worsens and it lowers “good” cholesterol or HDL which increases the risk of cardiovascular wellness. Common side effects include.

• Nausea.

• Fatigue.

• Loose stools.

• Upset stomach.

# Glucomannan.

Glucomannan comes from konjac roots. It is a type of fiber. It may prevent fats from being absorbed. It may suppress the appetite.

Evidence is inconclusive. Natural Medicines say that early studies are very promising. Overall, however, there is not enough evidence to prove effectiveness.

Take this warning seriously: it may choke you when taken as tablet or block the gut. It’s safer in powder or capsule form.

Take it at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after any other medicines, as it may interfere with their absorption.

# Green Tea Extract.

Green tea extract is used in many ‘thermogenic’ products because it can help burn fat and suppress appetite.

There isn’t enough evidence to suggest that significant weight loss is common in this case. High doses can cause.

• Nausea.

• Dizziness.

• Gas and bloating.

• Insomnia.

• Diarrhea.

• Restlessness.

# Green Coffee Extract.

This supplement is made from unroasted coffee beans. It has caffeine and chlorogenic acid, which may help people lose weight.

However, the evidence is not strong enough to support its effectiveness. Side effects—mostly from caffeine—can include.

• Nervousness.

• Insomnia.

• Digestive issues.

• Irregular heartbeats.

# Guar Gum.

It’s a fiber from the guar plant; it suppresses appetite and absorbs fat. Many research experts conducted on this fiber, yet little or no research showed its effectiveness for weight loss.

Natural Medicines claims that it does not work. Side effects.

• Gas.

• Diarrhea.

# Hoodia.

A desert plant of Africa traditionally used to suppress hunger. Today, it's marketed as a natural appetite suppressant.

The active ingredient P57 is believed to curb appetite, but evidence that it does or is safe is not credible.

Natural Medicines says that there’s not enough data to assess its effectiveness.

# 7-Keto-DHEA.

A naturally occurring substance in the body, may help boost metabolism.

There is some proof from small studies that it may help with weight loss when combined with exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.

However, the evidence is not sufficient to recommend it. More research is needed before it’s considered effective.

# Ephedra (Ma Huang).

Herbal substance that was used in many weight-loss products but banned by the FDA due to some serious risks.

It has ephedrine, a powerful stimulant drug like pseudoephedrine. It’s been linked to. • Heart attacks.

• Strokes.

• Seizures.

• Psychosis.

• Death.

The FDA concluded that the risks far outweigh any benefits. Ephedra is considered likely to be unsafe.

# Bitter Orange (Synephrine).

After it was banned, many supplement makers began using bitter orange instead of ephedra. It contains synephrine, another stimulant.

There isn’t much research on how well it works, and it may not be that much safer than ephedra. Natural medicines labels it “possibly unsafe”. Potential dangers include.

• Increased blood pressure.

• Irregular heartbeat.

• Heart attack.

• Stroke.

• Death.

It's especially dangerous when combined with any type of caffeine or if you have heart problems, high blood pressure, or take MAO inhibitors.

1kjvr4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/EconomicHistory/comments/1kjvr4b/paraguay_argentina_brazil_and_uruguay_prosperity/,"Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay prosperity and fall.","##Paraguay...

was one of the most modern countries in South America in the mid-19th century after independence from Spain (1811) with a policy of near-total self-sufficiency. Foreign influence was minimized, and economic activity focused on internal development and local industries.

Paraguay built the first railway in South America, from Asunción to Paraguarí (inaugurated in 1861), telegraph lines were installed. Iron foundries and shipyards were established, education was expanded, with the opening of schools and technical institutions. Paraguay developed state-owned industries producing textiles, weapons, and even steamships — rare in South America at the time. The Ybycuí Foundry produced cannons and iron tools domestically. Paraguay government prioritized public education, aiming for universal male literacy and sending students abroad to learn. A relatively well-trained and equipped army was built, seen as essential for sovereignty in a region full of foreign interventions.

The War of the Triple Alliance by the influence of British government (1864–1870) — against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay — devastated Paraguay. Population loss: Around 60–70% of Paraguay's population perished, infrastructure was destroyed, and the economy collapsed. After the war, Paraguay lost territory and never fully regained its pre-war prominence.


##Argentina...

,in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, emerged as one of the wealthiest and most economically promising countries in the world. Its fertile Pampas region allowed it to become a global agricultural powerhouse, exporting beef, wheat, and wool to Europe. The country attracted massive foreign investment, particularly from Britain, which funded infrastructure such as railways and ports. This economic boom was further fueled by waves of European immigration, which contributed to both industrial growth and cultural vibrancy. By the early 1900s, Argentina had one of the highest per capita incomes globally, and Buenos Aires became known as the ""Paris of South America.""

In response to the global economic turmoil of the Great Depression, Argentina adopted a model of import substitution industrialization, aiming to reduce dependence on foreign goods by building up domestic industries. While this created some industrial growth, it also led to inefficiencies, protectionism, and reliance on state subsidies.

Compounding the problem was increasing political instability. The country experienced a series of military coups and swings between authoritarianism and populism, which disrupted consistent economic policy.

The collapse that began after this period was not only internal but also heavily shaped by global financial markets and U.S. influence, particularly during the interwar period and the Great Depression. After decades of strong growth driven by exports and foreign investment—mainly British—Argentina was deeply tied to global markets. Much of its infrastructure and industry was owned or financed by foreign capital. This made Argentina vulnerable to external shocks. The crucial turning point came in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the Great Depression struck. The collapse in global demand—especially in Europe and the United States—caused commodity prices to plummet.

Argentina's exports, which were the backbone of its prosperity, lost value almost overnight. At the same time, international credit dried up as financial institutions in New York and London pulled back, worsening the contraction. During this time, the United States emerged as a dominant global financial power, and its policies had a ripple effect worldwide. U.S. protectionism, particularly under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, further damaged Argentina’s ability to export. Financial institutions and creditors became increasingly skeptical of peripheral economies like Argentina, and investment inflows halted. 

Argentina had no choice but to pivot inward. In response, Argentina adopted import substitution industrialization (ISI), a strategy encouraged by the economic nationalism rising in the Global South during that time. While ISI was seen as a way to reduce dependency on foreign markets, it also marked the end of the liberal export-driven model that had once made Argentina wealthy. The government began intervening more in the economy, setting the stage for decades of state control, protectionism, and political instability.


## Brazil...

followed a somewhat parallel path to Argentina, though with key differences. Like Argentina, Brazil experienced significant economic growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely driven by exports—especially coffee, which accounted for more than half of Brazil’s export revenue. The country was deeply integrated into global markets, and its economic elite benefited from strong trade ties, foreign investment (mostly British), and a growing infrastructure network of railways and ports. However, this export-driven prosperity created structural vulnerabilities. 

Brazil’s economy was highly dependent on a single commodity—coffee—and thus extremely exposed to fluctuations in global demand. The government even engaged in valorization schemes, where it purchased surplus coffee to artificially stabilize prices. The crisis hit in 1929 with the Great Depression, when the global coffee market collapsed. Prices plummeted, international credit dried up, and Brazil’s economy contracted sharply. Like Argentina, Brazil was caught in a bind: it had little industrial capacity and relied on imports for most manufactured goods, but now had neither export income nor access to credit to finance those imports.

The response in Brazil, however, took a different political turn. In 1930, amid economic and political instability, Getúlio Vargas seized power in a coup and launched a new phase of Brazilian development. He abandoned the laissez-faire export model and pushed for state-led industrialization, economic nationalism, and protectionism—similar in theory to Argentina’s later path, but with stronger state control and long-term strategic planning. Vargas’s regime laid the groundwork for Brazil’s transition to a more diversified economy. While this did not eliminate inequality or poverty, it did reduce Brazil’s dependence on coffee exports and increased domestic production. Importantly, the U.S. also began to take a more active role in Brazilian affairs during World War II and the Cold War, offering loans, military cooperation, and influence that shaped the country's policies going forward.

The crisis that followed Brazil’s industrialization—particularly from the late 1970s onward—was rooted in a mix of external shocks, domestic policy failures, and growing debt, all of which reversed the progress made during the earlier state-led development period.

After the 1930s, and especially during the Vargas era and later under the military dictatorship (1964–1985), Brazil pursued aggressive import substitution industrialization (ISI). The state took on a central role in building infrastructure, supporting heavy industry, and creating state-owned enterprises (like Petrobras in oil and Vale in mining). This led to rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and a rising middle class, especially during the so-called ""Brazilian Miracle"" of the 1968–1973 period, when GDP growth sometimes exceeded 10% annually. But this development was largely fueled by foreign borrowing, and Brazil’s growing reliance on external debt would soon become its undoing. In the 1970s, global conditions changed. The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 drove up import costs, and the global economy slowed down. To keep growth going, Brazil borrowed heavily from international banks, which were flush with petrodollars. At the same time, inflation in Brazil was rising steadily, but the government continued to maintain artificially cheap credit and currency controls.

The crisis exploded in the early 1980s, when U.S. interest rates—raised sharply by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation—caused debt repayments for countries like Brazil to balloon overnight. Suddenly, Brazil faced a balance of payments crisis, unable to meet its dollar-denominated debt obligations. Foreign lenders pulled out, investment stopped, and inflation surged. This ushered in what’s often called ""The Lost Decade"" in Latin America. Brazil's economy stagnated through the 1980s, marked by hyperinflation, wage erosion, IMF-imposed austerity, and political instability. Economic growth collapsed, and despite democratization in 1985, the new civilian governments struggled to control the economic chaos.

The crisis dragged on into the early 1990s, until Brazil implemented the Plano Real in 1994, which introduced a new currency (the real) and finally brought inflation under control. However, the cost was high: decades of state-led development had ended in unsustainable debt, inequality remained severe, and faith in national development models was badly damaged.

##Uruguay...

, like Argentina and Brazil, experienced a remarkable period of economic prosperity in the early 20th century, followed by a long and complex decline shaped by both internal and external forces. However, Uruguay’s case is distinctive for its small size, early adoption of social democratic reforms, and its efforts to balance export-led growth with progressive welfare policies.

From the late 19th century through the early 20th century, Uruguay benefited from agricultural exports, particularly beef and wool, which were in high demand in Europe. The country became known as the “Switzerland of South America” due to its relative wealth, stable institutions, and advanced social policies. Under the leadership of José Batlle y Ordóñez in the early 1900s, Uruguay developed a modern welfare state, establishing public education, universal suffrage, labor rights, and a strong public sector. This combination of economic openness and social protection made Uruguay one of the most progressive countries in the region.

Like Argentina, Uruguay’s prosperity was deeply tied to global commodity markets and foreign demand. As long as the demand for meat and wool remained strong, the economy flourished. But when the Great Depression struck in the 1930s, Uruguay’s export earnings plummeted. This exposed the country's dependency on external markets and led to budget deficits, rising debt, and political instability. In response, Uruguay—like its neighbors—turned toward import substitution industrialization (ISI) in an effort to reduce reliance on imports and promote domestic manufacturing, but its ISI was exclusively by receiving foreign companies industries instead of develop industries of its own, impeding the country to develop its own industrial wealth and remaining totally dependent of foreign investments.

During the mid-20th century, Uruguay’s economy became increasingly inward-looking. The state played a central role in industry and welfare, but productivity lagged, and exports stagnated. By the 1950s and 60s, economic growth slowed considerably, while inflation and unemployment began to rise. The welfare state, which had expanded rapidly during the boom years, became difficult to sustain. The urban middle and working classes grew frustrated, and political tensions mounted.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Uruguay descended into a deeper crisis. Inflation surged, industrial output stagnated, and rural poverty worsened. The political system became polarized, and the rise of the Tupamaros urban guerrilla movement triggered state repression. In 1973, a military coup suspended democratic institutions and installed a dictatorship that lasted until 1985. The regime imposed neoliberal-style reforms, suppressed unions, and opened the economy—but these moves failed to restore sustained growth and instead increased inequality.

After the return to democracy, Uruguay gradually rebuilt its institutions and economy. It avoided some of the more extreme volatility seen in Argentina or Brazil, but it took decades to recover from the combined damage of deindustrialization, financial crises, and authoritarian rule.

In essence, Uruguay’s fall from early prosperity was a result of over-dependence on a few export commodities, the shock of the global depression, the limits of ISI in a small economy, and the social tensions that followed. While it had a more equitable and democratic starting point than many of its neighbors, it was not immune to the broader structural traps faced by Latin American economies during the 20th century.

Day past, then weeks, then months, then years, I found love, got married, got a job, had a good life, It was my 65th birthday, I woke up that morning, had a cup of coffee (I hate coffee in real life), kissed my wife goodbye, got dressed and went out for a jog, for some reason I slammed the door shut on my way out.

1kjvqng,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjvqng,I'd forgotten how much fun this was.,"Grandpa Laurie passed away this year, and as part of his estate, we were gifted his Hi-fi. The main item here, we thought was the turntable, but we also got an FM/AM tuner that I've used a surprising amount, a CD player that has allowed playing of old discs, and a double cassette deck that we kept for style points and honestly never thought I'd use.

One of my mates was all about the deck, encouraging me to use it, saying that it's niche for sure, but a format that's worth playing with. This led me down a rabbit hole of learning about tapes, different tape types, decks, Dolby NR, and eventually to here. As a child of the 80s, making mixtapes was a pleasure that I'd forgotten existed. Today I put one together, and had an absolute blast doing it.

Nostalgia is a factor for sure, but there is something special about a cassette. I am looking forward to gifting these to some very confused friends in the near future. ",1,1746950039.0,cassetteculture,0,1.0,False

A Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition Chronicle

Rain-drenched neon. Crypts beneath coffee shops. Power trades hands over hand-poured cocktails and backroom blood pacts. In Seattle, the Camarilla clings to civility while tech-money, Thin-Bloods, and Anarch insurgents rise from the cracks.

This is a sandbox chronicle of street-level survival and high-stakes intrigue. Seattle’s Kindred factions are watching. What you do next will echo.

**Themes:** Personal horror, political manipulation, identity under pressure.  
**Tone:** Gritty, modern gothic.  
**System:** Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition  
**Location:** Transposed from *Chicago by Night* to Seattle and Spokane.  
**18+**

**Seattle by Night** is a sandbox chronicle focused on neonate survival, interpersonal tension, and the haunting weight of choice. You'll navigate nights of bloodthirst, bad decisions, and shifting allegiances in a city that thrives on masks. Politics simmer. Every Kindred you meet is playing a long game—or pretending not to.

**What to expect:**

* **Street-level horror:** You start small. You're being watched.
* **Faction intrigue:** Camarilla, Anarchs, Thin-Bloods, SI, cults—pick your poison.
* **Theater of the Mind:** Voice-based scenes, atmosphere-rich, no maps.
* **RP & Consequences:** Social drama and vampire politics

All play is hosted via **Alchemy**, 3–4 players per session. No experience required, but expect mature themes, ethical ambiguity, and blood. Bring a flawed vampire and a secret you don’t want the others to know.

1kjvjxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaTravel/comments/1kjvjxg/melbourne_sydney_20_days/,Melbourne & Sydney - 20 Days,"Hello everyone,

I’m flying to Melbourne and Sydney soon for a total of 20 days, excluding arrival and departure dates.

Below is my planned itinerary. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, as this will be my first time traveling for such a long period (I usually travel for just 7–9 days). I’ll also be traveling solo. I haven’t booked any tours or accommodations yet, but my arrival in Melbourne and departure from Sydney are already confirmed.

Please let me know your thoughts. September still feels far away, but once I finalize my activities, I’ll need to start booking accommodations and figuring out transportation in both Melbourne and Sydney. I believe I can just use a card in Sydney? And for Melbourne, I’ll need a Myki card.

Also, **I’d love your recommendations for restaurants, cafes, streets to explore, etc.** I’ve read that coffee is a big thing in Melbourne. I’m not a big coffee drinker, but I’ll definitely give it a try on this trip (maybe every other day at most)!

A little about me and my travel style:

I don't aim to pack in as many stops as possible each day, so if you think there are places I should skip, let me know. I enjoy museums, historical sites, and artsy streets. When it comes to food, I love sweets and seafood. I’d also like to include some hiking, though I might need to take it easy—I’m good with 1–2 hour hikes, especially if I can take plenty of breaks along the way! I’m 28 but I don’t drink, so I’d appreciate it if bar recommendations are left out.

**Some notes:**

* Day 1 will be a chill day, as I’ll be coming from another 9-day trip (with lots of walking involved!) right before arriving in Melbourne.
* I’ve included another chill day while in Melbourne as a buffer, in case I need to rest or the weather doesn’t cooperate.

I’m only spending a few days in Sydney because I checked the accommodation prices and they’re too expensive for me, lol.

I considered flying to Brisbane (and shortening my Melbourne stay), but the extra cost and the activities there didn’t appeal to me as much.

No wine tours? Yeah… I’m still thinking about that. I don’t really drink wine, but it’s not like I absolutely don’t, so I might decide while I’m there. I do enjoy fruit-picking and similar activities, though.

Unless it says “TOUR” on my list, the trip will be DIY—so fingers crossed I can figure out the directions. 😂

I would love if we can talk OOC and become friends. I'm someone who ask you about your day and share how mine was, maybe sneaking in a picture or two of my two cats. Talk about games, books or shows.

About the rp: 
I have this little plot in my head where my character moves in the same appartment as your character and become room/housemates. I would love for them to go from enemies to lovers in a slowburn romance. I like to include 🌶🌶 but i do not want this to be the main focus. I don't really have much other stuff in mind so if you have ideas, feel free to tell me <3 Other than that it would be amazing if we can make a story/plot together and come up with some cool creative ideas 😊

My character:
Name is Aron, he is 26 years old , 100% gay and he is a bit of a diva and a total bottom. And maybe even a virgin even though he might not admit that. He has blond hair and blue eyes.  He wears shorts and crop tops because they are comfortable and he loves flaunting his body.  

Aron is pretty new in the city and doesn't know his way around yet. He got this job at a cute little coffeebar around the corner and is slightly crushing on his straight boss. 

Aron is a bitch and doesn't like anyone straight away, he tolerates people if they don't annoy him to much. But once you get to know him and can make way through his heart, he is a big softy and gets very protective and maybe even jealous. 

His hobbies are mostly going out its either to a club/bar or just go drink some coffee somewhere and maybe go shopping. But he is also a sucker for staying in with a glass of wine/drink, some snacks and a good movie. 

My rp style:
I only roleplay in third person and I prefer using discord and have our own private server. Love using Tupper but if you don't feel like it, that's totally cool! It's all about having fun afterall! I have years of rp experience, still my English grammar ain't the best but I really love roleplaying and connecting with someone so I hope you can see past my errors and enjoy the rp with me ☺️

My rules:
- Don't tell me you are interested and ghost me right after. So don't be a d*ck and randomly dissappear. Seriously, if you are not interested anymore just be honest and tell me.
- Be 26+ Otherwise it's uncomfortable for me.
- Don't dm me for hook-ups or to get off. I am taken and just here to make friends. 


If i have peaked your interest,  please send me a DM and tell me your age and your ideas and I would love to hear about your character.😊 See you soon <3",1,1746949197.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

	I don't remember a time before the blasts. I was only two when my father locked the whole family underground.

 ""Father had spent months working on it."" My mother would tell me. ""He always knew the safest place was out here, away from the chaos of the cities."" She said,""Why should we waste money to be crammed in some tuna can next to a bunch of city slickers who wouldn't know the right way to turn a wrench, when we could build our own shelter. Stock our own supplies, afterall, we wouldn't need that much with just the three of us out here. So your father took it upon himself to fortify the old family root cellar. He studied filtration systems for the air and water. Your father used his connections as a mining engineer to invest in four local mines just to get better deals on material. I remember distinctly, him saying, the walls are a combination of steel, lead, concrete, and alot of will power. He insulated the shelter so much that we could barely feel the blasts.

 Your father was determined that we would survive. He dumped all of our savings into this bunker. He wanted to make sure you had a future.""
What a future it turned out to be...

	The way the story goes, a week or so after we came down here, my dad realised he forgot the bag of ammunition. He grabbed his mask, his coat, and his gun, leaving us with a few shells and nothing to fire them. From inspecting the shells I've found down here, I'd say it was a twenty gauge. He left to check the house, locking the door to the shelter behind him. The lock was of his own design, special, needs a key on both sides to open. Mother claims to have heard gunshots from the door not long after.... She thought ""He must of found the ammo! Yes! Yes he's shooting at bandits!"" Mother waited patiently by the door for Father to return, only leaving to check on me. 

After the third day, Mother finally gave up. She knew father wasn't coming back. Knew he was most likely dead, killed by the bandits he was fending off. Most of all she knew that without someone to let us out, we were trapped...  That was twenty three years ago.... 
	
I don't have any memories of father. He left us alone down here when I could barely speak. I only know what he looked like from and old photo, one mother has kept in a cigar box for all these years. I like to think he was good man, afterall he provided us this shelter. Not to mention he braved the fallout and died trying to protect us. Mother thinks of him as a hero. Part of me feels the same, but an equal part blames him for the life I've been forced to live.

	I'm grown now, still down here with my mom. Though over the past year or so her health has diminished rapidly. She says its radiation coming through the vents. I still feel fine though, so I'm not so sure.

	Ive tried the door on many occasions throughout the years. When I was sixteen I was convinced dad was still alive out there. I was hell bent on finding him and reuniting the family. I tried and tried for hours on that door kicking and wailing on it. I even tried to pry to door open with a left over steel pipe. It was no use. The door woouldn't budge. A few years later I tried again with similar results. All the while mom telling me ""It's not safe out there. There's still too much radiation!"" She wasn't wrong, when I put the geiger counter near the seams of the door, it spiked. After awhile I stopped trying the door, I came to accept living in this hole in the ground, we were safe, we had clean food and water. Sure, all I have are my dad's old clothes to wear, and given the size, he was much larger than me. It's not so bad, I guess... We ARE still alive...



	01.26.Unknown Year

	We spend our days eating pre rationed meals and playing the same two board games dear old dad was nice enough to bring, Checkers and Connect Four. I think Dad had a thing for poker because each box has far too many pieces and a deck of cards with each. Although, even playing those games is difficult in the dim glow of a single filament lightbulb. A light so far past it's prime it flickers and dims every minute or so. I'd replace the bulb but I haven't been able to find anymore. Guess dad didnt think of everything.

	The water and air purification are still running at 98%, according to the gauges dad installed on a maintenance panel. Fecal generator is still kicking too, one of dads ideas to cut cost. We burn our waste as fuel to keep everything running, mom says it was a genious idea, I say it stinks, literally. But, I guess it does keep the light on... somewhat. I hate refueling day though. Emptying the refuse bin from the toilet into the generator is quite a process. I have to say that two peoples shit is alot more than you'd think it'd be, and the smell. It was like rotten eggs and spoiled milk mixed in hot pot. A smell so fowl it makes my nose burn and my head all fuzzy. Just thinking about it ⁹makes me gag.

	All in all, things are, have been, and will be the same. Mother wants me to write our story. That way there is a chance our memory will live on. There's not much of a story when you've been trapped in a hole your whole life. The first few entries made me feel good. Even if they don't get found, I atleast enjoy focusing on something.

	Mother woke up vomiting today. It finally subsided after two hours. She's ice cold to the touch, but claims to be burning up. I went ahead and set up an IV with some nausea medicine for her. I offered her something for pain, but she refused. After the fit of vomiting and getting the IV set up. Mother just lied in bed, going in and out of consciousness.

	I have a basic understanding of the medicines we have down here. I won't lie though, I am worried about my mom. I've never seen her this weak. It seemed to happen so fast, almost over night. I know she's been getting worse, but I guess I was just in denial. Not letting myself see how frail she'd become. Just being blissfully unaware of her worsening condition. I see my mother now, lying there. Her paper thin skin, showing every blue and purple vein against her ghostly white figure. Subtle breathing letting me know she's still alive. I'm honestly unsure of what to do. I'll just let her rest for now. Maybe she will be feeling better tommorow.



01.30.Unknown Year

	Mothers condition appears to be worse today. I tried feeding her to keep her strength up, but she couldn't keep it down. I didn't eat my rations today. It didn't feel right with my mom unable to stomach anything. She spent most of the day asleep. One of the few moments she was conscious, she spoke to me. 
	""I'm so happy I have you to take care of me. It's been so hard. Im grateful you're in my life."" 
	""Of course, I feel the same about you."" I responded. ""You dedicated so much of your time taking care of me through the years. It's my turn to take care of you."" 	
	She grinned. It was subtle and weak, but I could see it. A tear rolled down her cheek. ""You've taken care of yourself all this time. I had nothing to do with it. You're a smart and handsom man. We survived this long because of you."" I felt my heart flutter as my eyes started to water. 

	Then she said something unexpected. Looking me dead in the eyes. My mom said. ""I'm so happy you're here now. But have you seen Adam? My heart sank. ""Michael, have you seen Adam around? He'd be so happy to see you."" I smiled trying to hold back tears. ""Get some rest I'll look for him."" I put her to bed, checked her IV, then sat on my bed crying until I couldnt cry anymore.

	I've not said but, my name is Adam. Mothers name is Beth, and father was named Michael. I look like my dad in the face but not the body. He was a burly man who wore glasses and always rolled up his sleeves. I've taken to wearing an old pair of his glasses to help read labels. His clothes are so big on me, I have to roll up my sleeves and pantlegs just to fit. There was a resemblance. Though just.

	Mothers symptoms are getting worse. Im reading these medical books and nothings making sense. Im at a complete loss. I'm afraid if this goes on much longer she won't make it. I can't think about that but its becoming more and more likely. I don't think I'm ready for that. Ready to say goodbye. Or ready to be alone...



02.01.Unkown Year

	Today something even weirder happend. Mother was sleeping. I was making a house of cards. All of a sudden the radio, that has brodcast nothing but static for as long as I can remeber. Shot to life, It was a mans voice, repeating "" 51 . 21 . 25 . 52 . 32 . 41 . 24 . 34 . MESSAGE WILL REPEAT..."" It played for a solid ten minutes. Half way through the third echo my mother stirred. She didn't quite wake up, but she spoke.""Michael, Michael, where are you?"" I went to her side and rubbed her back. She drifted back to her slumber. 

	I don't know what to make of all of this. I think the message was some type of code. Maybe a government message? That means there's likely people still up there, and maybe there's still a government. It has me rethinking the door. Im not that big, but I'm quite a bit stronger than the last time I tried.

	Right now all I know is. I need to take care of my mom. She's becoming more and more delirious. She barely calls me by my name anymore. She's deathly skinny now. Im going to keep her comfortable. Ive accepted I only have so much time left with her. I'm going to spend it well.



02.21.Unknown Year

	Mother passed the fourth of Febuary. She died in the early hours of the morning. It was peaceful, toward the end she agreed to the pain medicine.  I took some time to process and empty a third of my liqour supply. I had to get creative with the burial. That said, it wasn't really a burial. 

	I had to cut up my mother, into tiny peices. It took several attempts to get the job done. Then I stored the peices in old jars. Safe till I use her remains to fuel the generator. I know it sounds gruesome and trust me it was. Unfortunately one persons refuse isnt enough to power this place consistantly. So I'm forced to burn my mother.	

	Im doing what I can to stay numb and not think about it. My usual remedy is some pain pills washed down with whiskey. After a few rounds I'm right as rain. That was the only way I could bring myself to write this.

	 Today was my birthday. For the special day I got to top the tank off with my moms left foot. Happy birthday to me right? 

	I have a new goal. I'm gonna get through that door, however I can. The radio comes on at the same time every week ever since the first. Just like clockwork it came on midday. It plays for ten minutes then stops. I swear it doesn't sound automated. It sounds like someone is actually speaking each time, there's slight differences each time and pauses at points. But it's the same message. "" 51 . 21 . 25 . 52 . 32 . 41 . 24 . 34 . MESSAGE WILL REPEAT..."" There has to be someone out there. Making these messages. There must be. Someone, anyone... Tommorow I begin.



02.22.Unknown Year

	I started the day early. I made coffee and went right to the door. I spent a solid five minutes just standing there staring. Eventually I gathered myself and began inspecting the door. My geiger counter was starting to tick at that point. I didnt care. I needed a way out.

	After looking for awhile I have a couple ideas. The door itself is a thick metal. However it appears dad used the original door frame. It's made out of, what at this point is over a hundred years old, wood. There's only about a quarter inch showing all the way around. I may be able to chip the frame away from around the hinges.

	I looked around for a chisel or something sturdy and sharp. All I found was the rusty machete I used to dismember mom.

	I began chopping at the door frame. Methodical, and as targeted as possible. After a few hours, I have taken away a good chunk of the frame at the top hinge. However I was unable to chop deep enough to free any of the bolts securing it. I'll have to think of something else.

	Also, I started feeling nauseas after awhile, I had stopped listening to the steady tick of my geiger counter. No doubt the sickness is a syptom of exposure. Im going to take some meds. But I have to get out of here quick. I cant die down here. I have to know. I have to see.



02.24.Unknown Year

	I spent all of yesterday brainstorming. I'd found those shotgun shells, found out they were slugs. I figured that'd  be enough to get through the frame.

 After further thought I've settled on a pipe gun. I have a four foot and a few two and three inch pipes. As well as a few conectors and caps. Luckly the shells fit perfect in the pipe.

	I spent today trying differnt contraptions. Without a drill to make a guide hole in the cap for the makeshift firing pin. I was forced to use a burlap sack instead.

	The design, that I'm mostly sure is going to work, needs to be assembled for each shot. I take the four foot pipe and place a shell in the end, next I put a connector over that end. Then I add a two inch pipe onto that. I stretch a peice of burlap over the opening and place a filed down construction nail, makeshift firing pin, directly in the center making sure it is barely making contact with the shell. I put a cap on the end and tighten it up to the head of the nail. 

	All I should need to do is pont the pipe and hit the cap with a hammer. If my design will actually work. I only have eight shells and I need to free three hinges. Here's hoping I don't need them all.

	I spent a lot of time today working on my ""gun"". Im going to eat extra rations tonight. Make a few stiff drinks. Then pack and prepare for tommorow. If everything goes to plan. I should be out of here by midday tommorow. Now if only I could quit puking. This may be my last entry. I'll come back for the logs when I can. I want my mothers memory to live on.
	Its getting late. Wish me luck. Adam signing off.



02.28.1976

	I started the twenty fifth of Febuary early morning. I had my pipegun and a go bag. I was wearing my moms gasmask. I kissed then pocketed my moms wedding ring. I was ready.

	I gripped the pipe and placed the end right up against the frame at the top hinge. Just as I had invvisioned. I smacked the cap of the pipe gun and BOOM! It fired. I was blown away by how well it worked. All of the wood aroud the hinge was completley blown through. I could see daylight through the hole. My singing geiger counter kept me from celebrating for too long.

	I quickly reloaded. I took aim at the second hinge. Wound up and... CLANG! ""Crap."" I thought I tried again. CLANG! One more time. CLANG! Has to be a dud shell. I reload again, take aim and. BOOM! The top of the middle hinge was blown free but it still had two bolts attached. I tried again with another shell. BOOM! The hinge blew back at me. There were shard of wood all over. The constant ticking picking up speed.
 
	WIth four shells left and only one hinge left. I was confident it wouldn't be much longer. I lined up a shot on the bottom hinge. BOOM! A crack ran all the way through rest of the doorframe. It was still attached. One final shot. I line it up. CLANG! ""Shit. Only two left."" I loaded my penultimate shell and said a small prayer to my parents. ""Okay one, two, thr..""BOOM!

	The last hinge was free! I pulled the door down along with my mask and took my first steps outside. It was so bright when I first emerged. I was essentially blind for a few minutes. After a bit my eyes finally adjusted. There were barrels everywhere around the bunker door. Yellow and white barrels. They all made my geiger counter scream. I looked around and saw and old house in the distance with smoke coming out of the chimney.
	
  ""People!"" I thought. I started rushing towards the house. Once clear of the barrels I stopped registering radiation. I decided to try with my mask off. I could hardly see with it on. Part of me expected my first breathe to burn. To my surprise the air was cool and had more moisture than my lungs had ever felt. I looked around and took in my surroundings on the way to the house. The trees seemed bare,  but the grass was green and the sky a blue grey. I was 200 yards from the shelter at that point and was gasping up the fresh air.

	Everything didnt seem destroyed like mom said. It looked like winter from the pictures I've seen. ""Maybe the government has already started cleaning the iradiated areas.""

	As I approached the house I noticed a couple women on the porch. I started sprinting and shouting. ""HELLO! I NEED HELP! IM A SURVIVOR!"" They looked up suddenly, they didn't speak. The one closer to the door, the older of the two. Went inside. After a moment or so, a large man with glasses and a big grey beard appeared. I'd never met anyone other than my mom, yet he felt familiar. He pushed up his glasses whilst calming his partners. As I took my first step onto the porch He motioned his partners inside then looked me up and down. Crossed his arms and said. ""Adam.... come inside we need to talk...""

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

I wanted to share how I built a newsletter that focuses on something I think a lot of founders and builders need more of — detailed startup case studies.

A while back, I found myself constantly searching for real stories: how startups got their first users, how they failed, why they pivoted, what decisions they made when things got hard. Most advice felt vague or too surface-level. So I thought — why not start something that breaks it all down simply and consistently?

Here’s how I did it:


1. I kept the format super simple
No fancy designs, just clear writing. I break down one startup at a time — what worked, what didn’t, and what you can actually learn from it. I cover both success and failure stories, because both have gold in them.


2. I write like I’m talking to a friend
No jargon, no fluff. Just practical insights in plain English. I wanted it to feel like someone sharing what they learned over coffee — not like a lecture.


3. I post twice a week (and keep it consistent)
I send it out every Tuesday and Thursday. That rhythm keeps me accountable and gives readers something to expect. It’s slow and steady growth, but it’s real.


4. I started small and grew through word of mouth
I shared the first few issues with friends, startup groups, Twitter, and here on Reddit. People started forwarding it, and it’s been growing from there. A few sponsors have even reached out, which has been a nice bonus.

I personally recommend everyone to read BUSINESS BULLETIN which provides in depth startups case studies:

https://business-bulletin.beehiiv.com

If you’re thinking of starting a newsletter or building a side project, my advice is: don’t wait for perfect. Start small, be consistent, and focus on creating something genuinely useful.

But other then that I wanted to give a review of what the experience was like as a spectator. I have been to Spa before (Spa Classic, 24H, ELMS) but this was my first WEC.

So I'll start with the positives. Parking was easy. Bit of a cue to get in the venue but it all moved along smoothly. There was a huge crowd but it was still manageable. I did my usual walk around the track and there were no real bottlenecks (other then the pitwalk but I'll come to that one). And there were enough facilities. Sure there were cues at the food vendors but as far as I could see they were not insane. But I always just bring my own food and drinks so other then the obligatory paddock coffee I didn't buy annything. Lots of smiling faces and a very relaxed atmosphere. People were enjoying the race and the weather and there was little to get in the way of that.

But there were a few things  that could be improved still. First of all the pitwalk was clearly oversold and I feel sorry for all the poor souls who had to endure that cue. It felt like a cash grab and they should really rethink how they organise it. Also they need to get rid of the bar thing on top of the old pits. People go there to watch the race, not to pay 10€ for a cocktail while the worlds worst DJ plays obnoxiously loud crap. Also turn down the music in the grandstands a bit. And allthough I get why they moved the main race to later in the afternoon it meant that the gap between the final Carrera race and the start of the main race was too long.

Other then that it was an excellent event. Totally worth it and I will probably come again next year.",7,1746947942.0,wec,4,1.0,False

Seventeen year old Ben Chambers has spent his entire life being tugged around this way and that serving in a role to which he never applied, a politician’s son. With his US Senator father up for re-election, Ben’s eager to escape to a faraway university and survive one final election unscathed. But when the daughter of his dad’s opponent goes viral for creating a philanthropic app, Ben is given an ultimatum. Dive in and help the campaign in every way possible, including interviews, photo shoots, public appearances, and smiling for every camera. Accept, and his college education will be completely paid for. Refuse, and be left to pay his own way. Reluctantly, Ben chooses option one. He quickly finds himself immersed in his father’s swarm of greedy lobbyists, eccentric pastors, and gun obsessed militias, serving in a Gen Z, “eyes on the ground” role.

When public school teachers go on strike and are replaced by megachurch volunteers, fiction books are pulled from school libraries and replaced by Christian textbooks. Fed up, Ben decides to act. With the help of his classmate Joan, they build a “big little library of banned books” on Joan’s front lawn. Together, they create social accounts for the library with frequent video updates, their subscribers grow, and similar libraries sprout up across the country. Joan becomes the face of the account, while Ben, unbeknownst to his dad, films and edits all of the channel's content. Ben begins to view Joan as more than just a partner in crime, developing feelings for her along the way. Things come to a breaking point when the library is decimated in the middle of the night by a local militia full of his father’s supporters.

Ben decides the battle against censorship and an oncoming evangelical wave is more important than playing the perfect son for college tuition. With the help of his friends, he comes up with a plan. Remain near his dad’s inner circle and secretly record what his dad and his colleagues say when they think no one is listening. Then, near election day, release the recordings, exposing their duplicity and effectively blowing up his dad’s campaign from the inside.

IMPOLITE COMPANY is a young adult novel with adult crossover potential at 61,000 words. The novel combines the battle against censorship found in *This Book Won’t Burn* by Samira Ahmed with the youthful activism in *Wide Awake Now* by David Levithan. This book will appeal to teenage activists, political junkies, free speech advocates, fans of comedy and satire, and readers that appreciate coming of age stories.

Sunday morning I awoke to a dozen drag queens standing on the sidewalk in front of my house reading “*Green Eggs and Ham*.” A massive rainbow had been spray painted onto our lawn. The drag queens read with deft precision that can only be achieved through rehearsal time.

	“*I do not like green eggs and ham! I do not like them Sam-I-Am!*”

Undoubtedly this group had been reading at a library or some event, and my father put his foot in his mouth again. What did he say? Verbatim? No idea. But twelve strangers don’t show up at your house in high heels and full makeup for nothing. I respected their tenacity. It was early Sunday morning, dew on the grass, the whole thing.	

“*Would you eat them in a box? Would you eat them with a fox?*”

I peered through the blinds at the protesters, curious. On my kitchen counter was a fresh box of Costco muffins and some small bottles of iced coffee. I grabbed both and strolled outside wearing my baseball themed pajamas. I aim to seek new experiences and a group of drag queens reading Dr. Seuss outside your front door qualifies. A few of the queens stopped reading to hiss at me. 

“Don’t let me interrupt,” I said.

One of the queens, wearing a purple feather boa and neon green frameless glasses, held up their finger, motioned towards the others, and the reading continued.

“*Sam, if you let me be, I will try them, you will see,*”

The spectacled queen was over 6 feet tall, much more with heels. Setting the box of muffins on the ground, I paused to take a sip of coffee and continued listening. I liked this book. It was getting to the good part.

I’ve had 3 Macbooks before but I legit never used them and ultimately sold them because prior to this time I didn’t feel like learning how to use a Mac.

I recently got a 15” 512GB 16GB M4 MBA. The laptop is great but I have two issues with it.

1) RAM: As a google.com power user with a world of tabs open at once, I did run into slow down issues after somewhere between 20-30 tabs. It was a struggle to even close them all so it stops lagging and it was using 10GB of swap memory. 

The other thing I didn’t know prior to switching to mac for real this time, is how many third party background apps I needed to install to get basic functionality that’s available on windows by default. The money aspect of it aside, obviously they too use a bit of memory and if I knew how many little apps I needed left and right, I would have definitely bought 24GB of RAM no question.

2) MBP > MBA: This one is more of a nice to have unlike the RAM which i think is a necessity but, even though i like how the MBA is lighter and has a bigger screen with the 15”, the screen brightness leaves a bit to be desired. I don’t care about the quality. It’s fine as is but (and i never thought i’d say this) somehow the brightness became a noticeable issue for me. 

I thought I’m always going to be using it indoors not on a bench at a park and it won’t be an issue. But I have since took it to coffee shops with me and noticed with how bright coffee shops are especially if you sit next to a window, it would be nice to have a brighter screen. It’s not unusable by any means but if you are an avid laptop user at coffee shops, then a brighter display might be something you need.

I wont be exchanging mine because I CBA setting up a new laptop again this soon but I’m keeping this in mind for my future upgrade.",0,1746947229.0,macbookair,2,0.5,False

I used to work surrounded by clutter—papers, cables, coffee mugs everywhere. I thought I was used to it. But once I intentionally created a tidy and organized workspace, I noticed a huge shift. Fewer distractions meant more focus, and more focus meant I got things done faster and with less stress.

A clean environment doesn't just look better—it *feels* better. It reduces decision fatigue, helps with task initiation, and makes deep work easier to enter.

I'm into video games like Dark Souls, Diablo, Fire Emblem, many Nintendo franchises, Persona, JRPGS, Castlevania, and I could go on. It goes without saying I'm into anime as well.

I play three instruments: bass, guitar, and keyboard, although now I favor bass. I don't really have my own practice space. I also make my own music, or I used to when I had more time, but it's something I like to do when time allows. I'm big on video game music.

Other music tastes include metal, rock, metalcore, goth, some alternative/indie, citipop, trance, and I could go on.

Board games are cool. So are walks and bicycle rides in nature. Coffee almost anytime of day. Drinks sometimes. I like to also go on adventures near or far. It would be cool to get back into DnD some day.

I would love to meet some new people on here to DM and have a coffee with. It's hard to make friends here.

1kjusmf,https://i.redd.it/jhnla1qrn30f1.jpeg,Finally met my beans for the first time. They’re lovely.,"We’ve all heard it before: the grinder is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle. I *knew* that too, but didn’t *experience* it until now.

I just got a Timemore Chestnut C3S. It’s not a top-tier grinder by any means, but it’s a solid step up from what I was using. And honestly, even though I’m still figuring out the right clicks, it’s already changed everything.

For a long time, I was frustrated. I’d try great beans and different recipes, but still couldn’t get the clarity I was after. The tasting notes never quite came through. But with this grinder, suddenly they do. It’s like someone cleaned the window. Cups are cleaner, more balanced, and I can finally start to taste what’s actually in the coffee.

It’s brought a lot more joy to brewing again. I feel like I’ve unlocked a new level, and I’m genuinely excited about what’s ahead. Like every bag of beans is now an unopened letter waiting to be read properly. 

So if anyone out there is on the fence about upgrading their grinder - especially if you’ve been feeling stuck or underwhelmed with your brews - this is your sign. Just do it. You might be closer than you think to the cup you’ve been chasing.

#**Episode 37 -  vibes in our space**

**Hiroko Yamamura DJ set at Boiler Room Event in Chicago**

https://youtu.be/8Yfj_zB-PIE?feature=shared

Found a few DJ sets that I liked which give us maybe a longer music experience here.  The one posted above is a daytime event, so maybe a bit bright for us here :) but Hiroko Yamamura mixes techno , acid-y techno, house and it’s a very nice set.  I hope you enjoy it.  *(video is from the account of the content owner, Boiler Room, so I think it’s OK to post)*

The other one I found, unfortunately I’m not sure if it was properly recorded, so I won’t post the link.  It was Ricardo Villalobos’s Ruta 5 Sacre set in Paris.   The vibe is exceptionally dark and gritty and the set builds into a great energy about an hour in if you have patience for it.   This is actually an amazing and freaky set so it’s a shame I can’t post it but maybe you can search his other sets.

Enjoy your Sunday ☕️ coffee and have a great week 💕

>An incredibly important song for ""Zenkimi.""

From the group's official Twitter.

Below you can find my translation of its lyrics:

>Lonely and devoid of feelings.  
""Who’s that? I don't know."" Whatever, just go away.  
Every time, it leaves me with new wounds, self-destruction washes over me for the thousandth time.  
""Actually, it’s not like that at all...""  
I’m not a villain. But not a hero, either.  
I’ve never thought about who I really am.  
With a half-asleep face, swaying,  
I gaze at the sight before me and suddenly realize: ""I’m alive.""  
   
The radiance of love dazzles me with its light.  
I'm not that innocent, but I’m always looking at you.  
Everything will be okay. Holding the flickering signal close, I smile.  
With feigned indifference.  
   
I keep inflating my wild fantasies more and more.  
Though I’ve lost count of the nights I cursed this world,  
I've understood everything long ago.  
For the thousandth time, I laugh in a fit of self-destruction: ""I'm such a weakling!""  
I'm nothing special, just a nobody.  
""Why was I even born?"" I tremble at dawn.  
There, deep behind my eyelids are memories. I remember those laughing voices. ""How foolish.""  
   
And it doesn’t matter anymore whether love shines or not. I’m alone, in this little room.  
I promised I would come for you.  
Even if miserable, even if torn to pieces, even if crawling, I will reach you.  
You know it’s not a lie, right?  
   
I've gotten more wounds, more wounds dear to my heart.  
Not just me - you probably do too.  
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.  
But the fact that I love all of this, **all of it**, with my whole heart—whose fault is that?  
   
The radiance of love is also half-asleep.  
The light dazzles my eyes. What will tomorrow bring?  
Everything will be okay. It’s still flickering.  
I'm not that innocent—neither am I, nor you.  
   
The radiance of love, colored by tears—everything is so blurred  
That I cannot see what's before my eyes, but I feel the warmth of your hand.  
Everything will be okay. I used to be alone,  
But even that past, I want to love—together with you.  
Let's be together forever.

Aside from the song's incredibly strong and determined message, there is another notable detail found in the lyrics: the members' names are subtly woven into the text, something that could not be fully reflected in the translation. Specifically:

* the kanji for ""love"" is part of **Megumi**'s name;
* the first kanji in the word ""flickering"" is pronounced the same as the name **Mei** (""Meimetsu,"" literally ""sparkle"" (""mei"") and ""vanish"" (""metsu"")), and in the lyrics, just like her name, it is written in katakana;
* ""half-asleep"" refers to **Komochi**'s surname, which consists of the kanji for ""sleep"";
* ""innocence"" is the meaning of **Muku**'s name;
* ""light"" is the meaning of **Hikari**'s name.

All of this clearly indicates the group's firm resolve to move forward with the current lineup, while not just cherishing their past, but also sincerely loving the multitude of wounds it left behind.

>The song I wanted to convey to you, the poem I wanted to sing for you—  
I wove \[sang\] it together with the others.  
   
Please listen to it.  
I’m sure it will reach your heart.  
If you don't listen to it, there is truly nothing I can do. The truth is, I'm terribly powerless.

⭑⭑⭑

>I will always be here. If I have to put it that way, I'm one of those who always chose to stay.  
   
And I continue to protect the very words ""Let's be together forever,"" living by them here.  
Let's be together forever, truly.  
   
Shall we be together forever?  
I want to keep singing that, again and again.

On May 4, at their final solo concert of the **NEO ROMANCE BUTTERFLY** tour, **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da** announced the release of a new single, with ""**GOLD**"" as the lead track (set to be released on July 9). Additionally, during the show, the group performed another new song, and there was a surprise collaboration with **milcboy**/**Shounen ga Milc**, during which they performed a cover of ""**Kake Nukete Seishun**"" by **GING NANG BOYZ**.

""**Zenkimi**"" also announced a long tour with a title that roughly translates to ""**?? countries and cities, breaking beyond even the land of the rising sun \~Growth-Change-Invasion-Devouring — Loverosion\~ TOUR**"" (？？国都市日の本も飛び出し 〜増変侵喰愛rosion〜TOUR). It will kick off on July 13 with **Nene Komochi**'s birthday concert. A key feature of the tour is that it includes shows in China, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Notably, the full tour schedule has not yet been revealed — the dates currently end after **Kisaragi Megumi**’s birthday concert on January 11, 2026, with more performances — including overseas shows and, of course, a tour finale — expected to be announced. According to a recent livestream, the group hopes to expand the list of countries they’ll be able to perform in as part of this tour, and they’re currently actively working on it. Meanwhile, even before the start of the tour, **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da** are already scheduled to perform at two events in Taiwan on June 25 and 26.

>To everyone abroad, and everyone in Japan —  
we're starting a tour with no end in sight.  
   
*We will be doing a tour including overseas.*  
*I'll come to you little by little, so please wait.*(\*)

From **Kisaragi Megumi**'s Twitter.

*(\*) Originally written in English.*

Several official photos from the performance were published on Twitter, including the moment of collaboration with **Milc**:

>For ""Zenkimi,"" this was the first long joint tour with someone within codomomental.  
   
Watching my kouhais, I often caught myself thinking: ""I must have had a time when I was caught up in these worries too, right?"", “So this is how they work hard together?” and so on.  
   
Looking at the members, looking at all of you, I truly felt how precious it is not to be alone. Really.  
   
It was a very fun tour.

The group also has released a music video for “**MemaiPoem**”:

From **Nene Komochi**’s Twitter.

April 3 marked three years since **Komochi** joined **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da**.

>Today marks my 3 years in ""Zenkimi""!💚✡️🧚🏻  
   
I'm happy to be in the color of ramune🦖🦕  
Thank you for everything💭💚

From **Nene Komochi**'s Twitter.

A couple of facts from a recent livestream:

* According to **Komochi**, during the time ""**Seireki**"" existed — even after she joined ""**Zenkimi**"" — she always held herself back a little, trying not to come across as “too un-cute” (for example, while performing “**Cult Scream**”), so she wouldn't deviate too much from the **Seireki13ya** image. Now that the group has disbanded, she no longer holds back in that way.
* Reflecting on the year since the group’s revival, **Mei** notes that she’s become physically stronger.

>**Mei Yui Mei**: I’ve gotten stronger.  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: You’ve gotten stronger?  
**Mei Yui Mei**: Yeah, against pain.  
**Everyone**: (laughs)  
**Mei Yui Mei**: This past year has probably been the hardest for me. So hard that I feel like it was the most exhausting year of my life.  
**Nene Komochi**: Yeah, that happens.  
**Mei Yui Mei**: But I’ve gotten stronger!  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: Physically, right?  
**Mei Yui Mei**: Yeah yeah yeah, physically.  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: You know, when you do this kind of work for a long time, parts of your body start breaking down, and you don’t even notice.  
**Mei Yui Mei**: That’s true.  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: You don’t even notice it happening, but you end up with stress fractures and stuff like that.  
**Everyone**: (agrees)  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: We just don’t talk about it, but it’s something we live with.  
**Mei Yui Mei**: Yeah, because we’re just like you all.  
**Kisaragi Megumi**: Like, people who do the same kind of work every day — they get things like tendinitis, right?  
The same thing happens to us.  
**Mei Yui Mei**: Yeah.

A fragment of a dialogue from the stream.

>I’m *still* in Zenbu Kimi no Sei da.  
I’m *still* performing here.  
   
And I want to *keep* doing it.  
No matter what anyone says, there’s a part of me that wants to stay.  
A part of me that wants to have fun with you.  
   
So during our performances, I’m going to bring you as much fun as I can possibly share with you right now.  
I’ll be waiting for you.  
At our concerts.

⭑⭑⭑

>We’ve experienced firsthand (a few years ago) that each individual concert is by no means something to be taken for granted.  
And if you’ve been to ""Zenkimi"" shows, you probably already know how unpredictable each concert is — and how much fun it is.  
In short — come have fun with us.  
Putting our lives on the line, giving everything we’ve got — that’s normal for us, because this is how we live and earn our bread.  
But it’s not only about that.  
   
With all seriousness, we fool around; with all seriousness, we play around; and with all seriousness, we strive to reach you—the one and only in this world—with our singing.  
No matter how everything changes, that’s the one thing that remains unchanged — and that is “Zenkimi.”  
Let’s meet again, over and over.

⭑⭑⭑

>Even among so many other moments like this, this \[*FlashBack NightMare*\] is one of the albums I recorded while thinking, ""Another end has come.""  
   
This album was really tough for me.  
When I was recording ""Insomnia,"" I was simply pouring everything out desperately.  
But when it came time to record the songs for this album, an awareness started to come over me—  
the awareness that they were no longer here, the awareness of the changes that had occurred,  
and the awareness of my own pain — but I couldn’t express it, and I didn’t want to. Because I want you to keep your eyes fixed on the present.  
   
""Although there's no right answer, and it's not needed, I want you to keep your eyes fixed""—those are the feelings this album is overflowing with.  
   
Honestly, every album is so overflowing with feelings that it’s almost disgusting.  
I'm glad I became a part of Zenbu Kimi no Sei da.  
I'm truly glad there’s a place where I can let all this mess spill out.  
Thank you, truly.

From **Hino Hikari**’s Twitter.

On April 29th, **Muku**'s birthday show was held, which was attended by **Shinju** (ex-**Sumomo**).

>I went to the birthday show of a girl from the agency where I used to be an idol (*´꒳\`*)💕  
   
The girl who used to support me when I was an idol has now become an idol herself —  
I felt such a warm sense of nostalgia, it was so wonderful ✨  
   
I’m walking a different path now, but I’ll keep supporting her ☺️

⭑⭑⭑

>To be honest, it was the first time I met with the director and others since I left, so it became a great opportunity for me to finally say,  “I’m sorry that it happened so suddenly” — words I hadn’t been able to say until now.

⭑⭑⭑

>Honestly, before I went, I was really scared, nervous, and I cried.  
But since I had decided to go and take that step, I knew I couldn’t back out halfway —  
so I pulled myself together and went 🥲  
   
And in the end, they told me so many more kind words than I had expected, and I was truly happy about that 🥲  
   
And so that those words don’t go to waste, I’ll do my best on my new path 🔥

On May 3, **TOKYO TEFUTEFU** held their own final concert of the **NEO ROMANCE BUTTERFLY** tour. During the show, they performed a new song.

The group also announced a new tour titled **Killer Phase Tour**, which will consist of joint performances with other artists (to be revealed later). The tour will begin on June 12 and end on August 22.

You can find many fan photos from the concert under these hashtags:

Notably, **Nui** (ex-**Nonno**) was present in the audience that day. She even crowd-surfed, and that moment was captured in fan photos:

As promised during one of the livestreams, the group uploaded two live performance clips from their 4th anniversary show, which took place on December 31st at **club asia**:

“**rinbu**”

The fourth online concert in the **URTHANATOS** series took place, featuring performances by **KAQRIYOTERROR**, **TOKYO TEFUTEFU**, and **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da**.

Songs that were performed online for the first time by the current lineups of the groups:

* “**Drying Party?**” and “**USU USU**” by “**Kaqriyo**.”
* “**single use**” by “**Tefutefu**.”
* “**Heavenlyheaven**” and “**Tokobana**” by “**Zenkimi**.”

Additionally, **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da** performed in those very costumes made by **Fukumoto Emi**, something they also hadn't done before for a worldwide audience.

The livestream archive is still available for watching:

On May 1st and 2nd, codomomental returned to Shanghai to perform at two events. The first one featured all of the company's currently active groups, while the second one only featured **USOTSUKINAISHO**, **KAQRIYOTERROR**, and **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da**.

https://preview.redd.it/tizho41mj30f1.jpg?width=1477&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e17e4a034c1c930e887e611c96aa86fc7469369

On May 5th, during Japan’s Children’s Day holiday (*Kodomo no Hi*), a special event was held celebrating the 10th anniversary of codomomental. The event stood out most for an unexpected performance of **milcboy**/**Shounen ga Milc**, as well as the debut of the new iteration of **akugi** — which had not been announced initially and was only revealed later.

Ahead of the concert, **Nobuhide Imamura** held a livestream, from which I've compiled the most interesting facts below:

* **Imamura-san** once again expressed that he is currently having an incredible amount of fun both observing and working on new things for ""**Zenkimi**."" According to him, we can expect the group to challenge themselves at many things they’ve never challenged before.
* He also noted the growth of **KAQRIYOTERROR** and stated that he plans to personally take over their management soon, so it's safe to say the group's activities will enter a new phase.
* The director didn’t forget to praise the other groups either and announced that something exciting is being prepared for each of them. In particular, since mid-March, he has been actively working on a large number of different things, trying to get everything ready for the anniversary event.
* According to **Imamura-san**, there had been a chance that **NSLE** would perform a new song at the event, but unfortunately that didn’t happen.
* **futatsuna**'s activities are expected to ramp up in the near future.
* The director shared his desire to bring some element of **Seireki13ya** into **USOTSUKINAISHO**, since he still wants to express something in that vein.
* **USHIMITSU** also has a lot of interesting things in the works.
* Work on **MAOAⅡA**'s material is in full swing. Many different things are planned to be released this year and next.
* Regarding the debut of the new iteration of **akugi**, the director once again emphasized that this will be something different. He mentioned that he had long wanted to create a new version of **akugi**, changing the old concept of the group and starting to express something different, but along the way he got seriously involved with ""**Tefutefu**,"" then got absorbed in working on ""**Zenkimi**,"" then he took on reviving ""**Kaqriyo**""...  So only now did he finally get around to it. He wanted to create many new songs for the group, but unfortunately, didn’t manage to do so in time.
* Regarding the return of **Shounen ga Milc**, he said that, besides the small collab with ""**Zenkimi**"" at their tour finale on May 4th (which I mentioned above), it would most likely be a one-time act — at least at that point, no concrete plans had been made beyond it. And, since it was a very sudden decision, there was no time to prepare a band for **Milc**, so she sang to backing tracks.

https://preview.redd.it/515tvsjpj30f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=667218507d31257d68e60471fb24ebc90cd5292d

* **Imamura-san** also stated that following the anniversary event, many things behind the scenes — such as their management approach — would be changing.

And a couple more curious facts:

* At a recent **KAQRIYOTERROR** concert, the director met and talked with ex-**Kotetsu** (**Tapi-chan**). In case you didn’t know, she’ll be working as staff for [the new idol agency Hug&me](https://x.com/hugandme_).
* Until around 2017, **Megumi** managed to combine her work in ""**Zenkimi**"" with a full-time (!) job.

Speaking about the anniversary event itself, let's start with its main intrigue — the debut of the new iteration of **akugi**. Its frontwoman and only (at least for now) member is **Mary Lust**/**LUSTMARY**.

https://preview.redd.it/e4mf24frj30f1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78bde83fc5e5e74bd09e1fb71d2113cd518b4850

>I’m LUSTMARY of the reborn akugi.  
   
Thank you for sharing with me that moment when everything started moving again — at the very place where it all began, club asia.  
   
I’m full of determination to wholly embrace this music you’ve loved and carry it into the future.  
   
Look forward to what comes next🥱♡

It was also announced that work on new songs is already underway.

**MAOAⅡA** announced that their first release will come out on August 20.

By the way, did you know that **Komochi**, back in December 2021 (during the stream where **Mauru**'s departure from **Seireki13ya** was announced), expressed her desire to form her own band? As she has shared multiple times, she had a tough time when she was the only remaining member of the group, but at the same time, according to her, she also had some positive experiences from her solo performances, and so she wanted to create her own band “once things settled down with '**Seireki**.'"" But as we all know, in the end, **Komochi** joined **Zenbu Kimi no Sei da**, while remaining in **Seireki13ya**, and obviously, she physically wouldn’t have had time for a third project. However, with the disbandment of ""**Seireki**,"" she now had the time — and so, that wish was able to come true.

**KAQRIYOTERROR** announced two mini-albums featuring old songs re-recorded with the current lineup, set for release on July 23 and August 27, along with their first single since the group's revival, scheduled for September 17.

On May 10, **SPIRAL HERITAGE** — the first tour of the new “**Kaqriyo**” — came to an end.

https://preview.redd.it/y9n8xyfwj30f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51efc1581e43a9ed4cc6e0ac7e830d3e0f06c478

The group immediately announced their next tour, titled **混沌弐項純業〜嗚幽戯界〜** (I'll refrain from attempting to translate that for now). It's set to begin in July and run through December, featuring a variety of events and concerts. The tour finale will take place on December 21st and will commemorate the anniversary of **KAQRIYOTERROR**’s revival.

>We were able to visit many places together, and each time, I could feel them growing stronger.  
Watching them up close, I saw how much they thought, how much they worried—and that’s why, more than anything, seeing the happy faces of ""Kaqriyo"" and the ""Yomihito"" brought me the greatest joy.  
   
Keep growing stronger and stronger, and may KAQRIYOTERROR be loved by more and more people!

Unfortunately, **Tademaru Ichiren** sustained an injury halfway through the tour.

>Due to Tademaru Ichiren injuring her right heel during a concert, after consulting with a doctor and the member herself, it has been decided that she will perform with limited physical activity until she fully recovers. We appreciate your understanding.

Official statement.

I’m planning to translate the livestream where she talked about it in more detail later, but just so you understand the level of her workaholism multiplied by recklessness: she didn’t just injure her heel, but then ran around and jumped rope in that condition...

On her solo livestream on April 26, the girl shared that her injury is getting better.

**futatsuna** announced their second digital single, titled ""**泣啼嫌**"" (reading unknown for now), which will be released on June 18. They also performed a new song.

The first releases from **USOTSUKINAISHO** will be out soon: the digital single ""**音嘘恋**"" (reading unknown) is set to be released on June 25th, followed by ""**Close by**"" on July 30th. Also, **Ichiren**'s live repertoire has been expanded with another new song.

Meanwhile, the group has celebrated its first anniversary.

>I’m truly happy that we were able to celebrate this incredibly special day together — codomomental’s 10th anniversary, and USOTSUKINAISHO’s first.  
   
So much has happened over this past year, but the fact that I was able to meet you, that I can sing here, and that we can share smiles — it all makes me so happy.  
Let's continue to be together💭

Without running away from the rapid whirlwind of changes, Ichiren keeps moving forward with the power of love — and it’s just incredibly cool! 🪄❤️  
Keep showing us how you win over more and more hearts 👼🏻♡  
I’m really looking forward to the digital releases!

I love you so much.  
I hope to have your support from here on as well❣️

**Tademaru Ichiren**'s reply.

Something interesting from **Not Secured Loose Ends** is expected on August 6th.

From March 29 to April 1, **USHIMITSU** had to temporarily suspend activities due to one member’s health issues, who needed a period for recovery. Fortunately, that turned out to be enough, and the group resumed performing from April 2nd.

Shortly after, a mini-tour titled “**CRANK UP TOUR**” was announced, consisting of one show each in Tokyo and Osaka, and two in Nagoya. It began on May 5 and will conclude today — May 11.

Unfortunately, this is their final tour with **Aira** — she is leaving **USHIMITSU**. However, on May 31, the group will hold a solo concert where two new members will join them:

Also, on May 31, the group will open their own bar.

**Kurumi Sora**'s first digital single that was announced quite a while ago — ""[sanzen decoy](https://linkco.re/bypD8nTs)"" — has finally been released.

The music was composed by **syva**, and the lyrics were written by **GESSHIRUI**.

https://preview.redd.it/1ur9tjn3k30f1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd3d4a1518b9185d33c0a29f2273a6bc34241b34

>“Sanzen Decoy” (餐然囮) — a homage to the Three Thousand Worlds \[*Sanzen Sekai, from Buddhist cosmology*\].  
   
It means to consume (餐) the decoy (囮) that radiates supreme talent and beauty — psychedelic and multidimensional. The song’s lyrics express anger through social satire and a critique of modernity’s contradictions, with a touch of cuteness.  
   
The “decoy” = Kurumi Sora’s public image up to this point. Personally, I feel like I’ve just been living by instinct, doing things spontaneously and at my own pace — but all of that felt like a decoy. As if Kurumi Sora had been sowing deception in the eyes of society.  
   
I hope you’ll listen to it a lot 🩵

From **Kurumi Sora**’s Instagram.

I’ve already written about **Kurumi Sora** in these past bulletin entries:

I've translated a segment from a livestream in which **Nobuhide Imamura** and **Nene Komochi** explain in great detail the reasons behind the decision to disband **Seireki13ya**. The video also mentions various intriguing behind-the-scenes details — for example, you’ll learn about the reason for **Soani**’s departure, the group’s phantom music videos that never saw the light of day, the relationship between **Komochi** and **Ichiren** — who, like **Komochi** at one point, was left as the sole member of her group — and more:

I've also translated **GESSHIRUI**'s blog post, in which the lyricist talks about a song that unintentionally became a harbinger of the group’s disbandment — ""**Grim.**"":

>*""In doing this work, they are not always smiling.""*  
   
When you *want* to write something and when you *can* write something—those are two different things, aren’t they? There are times when I think, “I want to write about this song,” and I even create a draft with a title, but when my fingers start typing, I suddenly find myself writing about a completely different song. I’ve often wondered why that happens, but after giving it some thought, I realized: it’s because *works that are not completed by writing lyrics alone* continue to linger in my heart, making me want to write about them. That said, as songs, they are already fully finished, so it’s not dissatisfaction—rather, it’s simply a desire to talk about them.  
   
Good afternoon, this is GESSHIRUI. This morning, I was in the midst of an intense battle, so I barely got any sleep. Even though I wish every day to live calmly, I always end up gravitating toward a way of life that contradicts that. It’s a bit exhausting, but it’s a path I chose for myself. I have no regrets, but I often find myself sighing in exhaustion, “Ah, I’m a corpse...” Going off-topic for a moment—do you have breakfast before heading to work? I believe breakfast is something very important. For example, if you oversleep, rush to get ready, or just feel unsettled, there are always plenty of reasons to skip breakfast. However, taking just a little time for a cup of coffee or some toast is, in my humble opinion, *something quite significant*. Sometimes, when I struggle with writing and go on a journey, I find myself forced to have breakfast at my destination, so I make sure to set aside time for it. But at home, it doesn’t work that way. I keep putting breakfast off, thinking, “I’ll get to it later.” And when that happens, the day starts off feeling stale. I hope that someday, every one of my days will begin with a leisurely breakfast.  
   
Well, that was a long introduction, but today, I want to talk about the final song from Seireki13ya’s third album, *metonymy 13 parallel*—track number ten, ""Grim.""  
   
I’ve always felt that Seireki13ya occupies a rather unusual position, even among the so-called live idols of codomomental INC. The thing is, people who loved music, were captivated by it, pursued it from an early age, and continued to engage with it into adulthood—such people clearly draw upon their musical roots in their work. The musicians our company collaborates with are no exception—for the most part, they base their work on their own musical past...  
   
Please continue reading only if this truly interests you. Given the nature of the song, there may be some rather sharp expressions in the text...

In the continuation, you’ll learn how the process of writing these lyrics differed from others, the significant role **Yui Urari** played in making this song come to life, which iconic Japanese work inspired **GESSHIRUI** in writing “**Grim**.”, and you’ll also get a sense of the artistic nuances and intentions that embody “the suffering and pain that accompanied the members throughout their activities in the group,” which **GESSHIRUI** “had previously held back from allowing them to express openly.”

Just a reminder — [I've also translated the song's lyrics themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cndIKAanofU).

And [in this bulletin](http://www.codomofan.online/codomomental-bulletin-70/), you’ll find some more interesting information about it.

Other updates: since the publication of the previous bulletin, I have also made the following color-coded videos:

>“Will you admit me even though I am like this?”

The second original track by **Not Secured, Loose Ends** — “**VanilLament**” — whose lyrics, in my interpretation, express the same changes in the foundation of the group that **GESSHIRUI** discussed in one of his blog posts ([English translation](http://www.codomofan.online/gesshirui-we-wanted-to-change-the-foundation-of-the-group-august-2024/)).

>“The melting sunset envelops everything around,  
Stars twinkle, emerging through the sky with white radiance.  
Even if their light was born light-years ago,  
It travels to illuminate the present.”

The deep, melancholic mood characteristic of **Hayashi Takahiro**’s works, the beautiful performance by the members, and the distinctive style that **GESSHIRUI** often used in **Seireki13ya**’s songs—a lyrical narrative that seems simple to grasp but, in just a couple dozen lines, achieves such emotional depth that it feels as though an entire world lives within it.

>“If I am to cry, I must first become someone you can be proud of, otherwise it would be a lie.”

A song meant to express **TOKYO TEFUTEFU**'s determination to move forward after **Uine**'s departure — a song that, according to the girls themselves, helped them tremendously on an emotional level during that time and filled them with a firm resolve toward the future.

>Pain, joy, sadness, happiness.  
To take on all of these feelings, to accept them,  
And no matter what happens, to move forward without hesitation —  
This song is like a hand gently pushing you in the back when you're unsure.  
   
I hope you’ll enjoy it.

From **Yuzuriha Ouhi**'s Twitter.

>When performing this song, I try to pay careful attention to every single word,  
So that I can become a person of worth,  
So that I can convey everything to you firmly 🐈‍⬛♡  
I hope it reaches as many people as possible.  
   
“If I am to cry, I must first become someone you can be proud of, otherwise it would be a lie” — exactly like that!

⭑⭑⭑

>“Even if my body decays, I won't lose my way” — I’m truly proud that the five of us have become able to sing such words (՞ . .՞)੭  
And I sing it, taking it as a vow to myself as well.

From **Mary Lust**'s Twitter.

>All my feelings, my entire body — I will offer you everything, down to the very last part of me.  
A song that embodies our will and determination to continue living here.  
Even today, I will keep fighting. Listening to this song makes me stronger.

From **Chimura Shifumi**'s Twitter.

>A disc soaked with our resolve to soar higher and higher.  
“ash.” and “from lost” — both songs are beautiful, and I hope they reach your heart 🐩

From **Kagari Kohaku Sekai**'s Twitter.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efvuKFMlZxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efvuKFMlZxM)

>“Let me know why I keep fighting against my sins.”

A song from **Yukueshirezutsurezure**'s last album, with lyrics **GESSHIRUI** wrote with the intention of ""making it resonate with both *the present ""****Tsurezure***"" and *the past ""****Tsurezure***"" — to touch both of those worlds and express the essence of the **Yukueshirezutsurezure** world like nothing else."" (You can read more about that [here](http://www.codomofan.online/nobuhide-imamura-gesshirui-we-each-have-different-values-and-feelings-and-they-should-be-differentaugust-2020/)).  
I made videos for both the **NSLE** version and the original version (with my literal translation). I hope that this way you’ll be able to feel the lyrics of this song more deeply.

>I've decided that I want to become like you.  
What’s the name of this feeling?

Another incredibly vivid, sweet, and touching story, strongly imbued with the spirit of **Seireki13ya**.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJSIR16BTB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJSIR16BTB4)

>Still, I want to taste blood.

A song by **TOKYO TEFUTEFU** that embodies the spirit of youth. By the way, both “**ao**” and “**FLYASDUST**” include a word pronounced “Mukei” — but in “**ao**” it means “shapeless,” while in “**FLYASDUST**” it stands for “the shape of a dream.” This is an intentionally added narrative element.

In the meantime, the number of videos on [the codomofan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codomofan) has already surpassed a hundred! Interestingly, the ratio between talk videos and color-coded lyrics videos is almost exactly 50-50.  
A huge thank you to everyone who’s subscribed to the channel and engages with the videos! YouTube is definitely a crucial platform for the project’s growth, and lately I’ve been happy to see that both watch time and the number of new subscribers have been showing slightly higher figures than usual.  
And I’m also grateful to those who watched the translation of the two-hour **TOKYO TEFUTEFU** livestream. To be honest, I was expecting a much more modest result, but it's actually quite decent by the standards of my channel, which is heartening — because that video absolutely deserves it. And I’m already working on hours of new translated content, so stay tuned!",3,1746944955.0,AlternativeIdol,0,1.0,False

My partner and I are coming to your city in June and will stay for 4 days. I was wondering if you could recommend seeing some cool places that are not maybe the usual touristic spots. We've both been to Barcelona, though a while ago, and while we do want to see some must sees again (Sagrada...), I want to use this opportunity to explore the more off the beat places. So, we both like quirky, arts spots, cultural hubs, flee markets. We both enjoy contemporary art...It would be interested in seeing some local music gigs in cool smaller venues. We also love beautiful parks and squares to sip coffee and enjoy the vibe. And we also love to eat out a lot, so I'd like to explore food scene too :D 

Anything that gets us to feel the local vibe, respectfully of course, is more than welcome :)

And then I remember. And it doesn't hurt physically, that's not it. It's deeper. It's like a dull, viscous sadness that sticks to your soul before you can fully wake up. Sometimes I stay there, still, looking at the ceiling, feeling like a kind of echo of myself.

I miss things I never thought I would miss: standing in the shower, running up a flight of stairs because I'm late, putting on socks without it being a ridiculous effort. I miss having the option.
