1mouq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1mouq2y/tooth_concerns/,Tooth Concerns,"I don't really use Reddit all too much but just looking for some guidance and maybe some reassurance regarding my teeth.

I'm 17, and I've consistently struggled with dental hygiene growing up. I was more consistent as a kid but around maybe 12-13 I had a harder time keeping up with my oral hygiene due to depression and lack of motivation. I think my last dentist appointment was somewhere between 8th grade to freshman year. I don't really remember much but I think I had a crown put on, it was porcelain on what I think is one of my molars. My situation in terms of seeing health professionals and stuff is kinda hard because I live with my mom but my dad is in charge of my health stuff and he's in a different state so I only get to go if I'm with my dad which makes appointments kinda hard to manage.

Over the last 9 months I was in a bad situationship, stressed out from school work and stuff, and I was very exhausted when I'd get home from school so up until April I would very rarely brush my teeth. I finally got out of the situationship and have been dating a really sweet guy and I feel more motivated to do better for myself and for him. 

I'm mostly just concerned and would like some guidance as to what I can do to improve until I can get someone to take me to the dentist. I definitely see signs of staining on my teeth from soda and coffee and stuff. I don't know how I got it but I wanna say back in April/May I got a chip in my upper front tooth? Like on the top part, it doesn't hurt and I didn't even feel it whenever it happened I just looked in the mirror one day and saw it. I also have a brown line on the same front tooth thats been there for a while, also doesn't hurt or anything. I can try to provide pictures.

I've been trying to brush regularly at least before I go to bed and in the morning sometimes. Occasionally I fall asleep before I brush my teeth though. I'm less good with flossing, I have those floss pick things and try to get the front teeth at least but I have a hard time reaching the back comfortably. I have a pretty bad addiction to energy drinks and I know those are bad for your teeth. In terms of diet, I've been trying to eat least eat a meal a day but sometimes I just end up having junk food snacks as my ""lunch"" or ""dinner"" we don't have a ton of good stuff at the house all the time.

Sorry if that's a lot to write but I really do wanna improve my overall health for both myself and my future and for my boyfriend and my oral health has been causing me major anxiety as of recently. I can elaborate and answer any questions. Thank you!",1,1755058841.0,hygiene,0,1.0,False

I was wondering what some of your favorite high protein, low calorie snacks are? Not like a protein powder or Greek yogurt or any of the basic stuff, like actual snacks. I’ll put some of my favorites down below. 

Protein donuts: https://amzn.to/3JeBtqe 
Rating: 6/10 - they still taste like protein snacks but they’re honestly not bad. 22g of protein for 180 calories 

Protein sweet roll: https://amzn.to/41zs96A 
Rating: 6.5/10 - same company as the donuts with similar macros, slight proteiny taste but honestly pretty good. I haven’t microwaved them but I could see that making them way better

Coffee protein shake: https://amzn.to/45CQtG3
Rating: 8/10 - kind of a basic one but it’s replaced my morning coffee to get me the extra protein. It’s not a fancy coffee by any means but it’s caffeinated protein and doesn’t taste bad

Protein + caffeine strawberry milk: https://amzn.to/45wxtci
Rating: 10/10 - I love this stuff, it tastes so good and is only 90 calories for 20g of protein + some caffeine. I found these at a Kroger and tried them, they’re amazing


Pork Rinds/Chicharrones are also good, they’re basically protein chips and you can find cool flavors online

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **NC Dinos vs. Doosan Bears: A KBO Clash of Titans (and Some Jokes About Bears Hibernating)**

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real King of the KBO?**  
The numbers don’t lie (well, they might if they’re tired of math, but let’s assume they’re honest). The NC Dinos are the clear favorite here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **58-59%** based on decimal odds of \~1.70 (thanks, bettors!). The Doosan Bears, meanwhile, are sitting at **47-49%**, per their 2.10-2.17 odds. That’s a significant gap in a sport where a single inside-the-park home run can flip a game like a postseason network’s playoff bracket.

The spread tells an even starker story: NC Dinos are -1.5 run favorites, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by more than a typical coffee break. For Doosan to cover, they’d need to either A) magically teleport a run into existence or B) hope the Dinos’ star outfielder trips over first base and scores *themselves*. The total runs line is set at 7.5, with slightly better odds on the over. Let’s just say if this game has fewer than eight runs, it’ll be remembered as the day the KBO invented “small ball” and “nap time.”

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and Why Doosan’s Pitcher Looks Like He’s Been Eating Rocks**  
Unfortunately, we’re working with a news vacuum here—no press releases, no Twitter rants, no footage of a bear wearing a Doosan jersey trying to bunt a tennis ball. But let’s *assume* the Dinos are healthy, because they’re favored, and the Bears… well, let’s lean into the absurdity.

Is it possible Doosan’s ace pitcher is still recovering from a “victory dance” injury? Maybe he tried to moonwalk after a win and now his knees whisper “nope” every time he follows through. Or perhaps their cleanup hitter has been spendi

I read my cards to help you find an answer to your questions and to discover alternate solutions. I'm not selling you a happy ending only to make you feel better. While not every answer will be positive, I tell you the message the cards bring. I won’t sugarcoat negative messages, it's important to face them and look for the lesson they may have.

I believe that the answer you seek is inside of you and that my readings are an echo. If you’re avoiding something, it’s probably going to come up and I'm happy to help you to sort it out.

If it’s messy, we’ll look at the mess together and sort it out. Reading cards is a tool to connect with the subconscious, which holds our dreams, intuition, and imagination. The world is like one big oracle spread, full of patterns and coincidences, that's why readings are great for contemplating different scenarios and their possible outcomes.

**Readings for Tips in DM/life chat:**  
There is no fixed amount of money, you may think of it as buying me a coffee and a snack for the time I spend on reading your cards and interpreting them. Please send your tip via PayPal or Ko-fi (links are in my profile) before the reading. I'm on CET.

I won’t contact you first. Depending on your question, my reading sessions usually take up to 60 minutes, with no limit on the cards pulled or follow-up questions you ask. l choose from various decks (Tarot, Lenormand, Playing Cards, etc.) and interpret the cards with my knowledge and intuition relating to your question. Our conversations are always confidential.

**Free Readings:**  
I host  group exchanges on my subs, so check out [r/ExploringTarot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploringTarot/) and [r/DeepLenormand](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepLenormand/). Feel free to join us!

I'm an oracle, not a therapist. If the reading does not resonate with you, then I might not be the right reader for you. I'm not responsible for your actions and decisions, because what you do is your responsibility. My readings are about possibilities, not making promises of things to  come.

I open at my store and our vertica was down so we had to do pour overs and no iced coffee. 

One regular usually gets that so I let him now and he acted like I was wierd for even telling him we didn’t have any. So I asked if he wanted a cold brew or americano and after him telling me he didn’t care he chose cold brew. 

So I was already towards the end of 7 drinks total for uber and was working on his and another persons cold brew when he came up and said

‘Can I just get it without ice this is ridiculous’ and I handed him his drink I literally just lidded with ice and he’s like ‘oh’

Had another uber order for two hot coffees and I accidentally swiped the order off thinking the bag was already there waiting and someone came in and after realizing I let them know it’ll be a few minutes until it’s done because our machine is broken we have to do it by hand. 

Every minute she would show us her phone saying we’re taking to long and after the literal fourth time explaining I said ‘yes. We are working on it. Our machine is broken we can’t control how fast pour overs go’ 

Besides that I kept dropping things. I somehow knocked a steaming pitcher with milk into our sani bucket and it got everywhere. 

And when I tried asking people if they needed anything (stopper or whatever) they would rudely answer me, look at me like I had two heads or just completely ignore me. 

I don’t know what it was but everyone today was on one. I’ve had a couple bad customers since working here but it’s like they all decided to come in today. 

I was main bar my shift which I normally am. I don’t have problems with making drinks but like today was a very. Long. Day. 

On top of that my store had a ssv meeting and I’m assuming he’s our DM came in and I had made a sample tray and he told me we weren’t allowed to leave it on the counter. 

So our new guy had to go to the other businesses and offer it out to them.

I’ve tried my best to break it up but. DON’T GO SKIPPING TO ANY PART OF THIS AND IMMEDIATELY DOING STUFF WITHOUT READING EVERYTHING AND DOING RESEARCH. IM JUST A GIRL WITH CHATGPT PLUS WHO USED IT TO FIND A FIX *FOR HER*.  I’M STUPID, TRUST. 

____

This might be wordy and a little jumbled because I’ve been up until I crash for like a week and a half barely eating and only drinking coffee stressing over this. I know I did more than what was necessary. I did what I could do with absolutely nobody but an ai helping me.

(Disclaimer. I am not tech educated, just really wanted this to stop and was prepared to make things worse in an attempt to make it better, but that didn’t happen, and it seems to have worked out. This isn’t a tutorial more than this is like… a reference for anybody as desperate as I am to find any kind of information at all that might help them. A personal experience of how *I personally* managed to find a solution to this *for me*, *for my situation* that could possibly relate to other people in some form and help them as well. I am NOT saying “follow these steps and you’ll def have no issues”. This might not be a solution for everyone. Some people might not even wanna fw it. I was literally blindly following the steps of ChatGPT+ and fully was willing to risk everything going wrong. But it worked out and I ended up figuring out a solution *for me.*. So. But I hope this might help someone else as well somehow.)

I have an HP Pavilion Gaming Desktop PC with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Super, for specification sake. 

___

Contrary to some ppls belief, the coding error everyone talks ab that causes the black photo bug did NOT cause the black photo bug on *my* setup upon install and launch immediately, but until certain requirements were met. For me, ir was a mod. For some others, it’s the keepsake box, or something else. Not everybody meets this bug until there is certain requirements met.

I am NOT saying, in *any* way, that there is no default faulty coding that’s responsible for this mess. Not saying that *at all*.

But SOMETHING happened for that faulty coding to start the bug, and I literally watched it happen in real time as I was mod hunting. I didn’t even know this bug existed until last week. And now we’re here.

The reason that it looks like it’s **“just a bug that has nothing to do with special requirements or your computer and is all ea or sims and absolutely nothing else, and nothing you do will do anything to help so just give up completely until ea fixes it”** is because of how it fucks with your system in a way that fully nuking it doesn’t reach. Something about how the gpu itself reads whatevertf something with directx or another. I can ask the gpt to explain itself again and put the edit here (Ik we hate ai but this is what I got and it’s working for me for now ok):

Here it is:

____

“Your game was fine at first because the NVIDIA driver you were using handled Sims 4’s photo system without issue — it could store the photo textures in VRAM and correctly reload them when you traveled or reloaded the lot.

When you installed that mod, it changed how photos were stored/processed in-game — specifically increasing how often the game saved them in GPU memory and then reloaded them. That extra load pattern hit a flaw in your current NVIDIA driver branch (post-528.49), which failed to return the correct texture and instead gave the game an empty one.

Once the driver had cached and “learned” this bad handling pattern for Sims 4, simply removing the mod didn’t fix it — the driver was still running the same texture-reload logic, so the bug persisted. That’s why it felt “irreparable” until we rolled back to the last driver before NVIDIA introduced that change.

The driver’s texture-handling bug wasn’t something stored in the game’s files; it was baked into how that driver version handled GPU memory for Sims 4 after the mod triggered the faulty path. Once the driver’s code was the problem, no amount of changing in-game settings, verifying files, or reinstalling the game could fix it — those all kept using the same broken driver logic. The only way to stop it was to replace that driver with an older version that didn’t have the bug.”

-

Its memory is starting to break up pretty bad but I bullied it into refreshing itself a million fucking times so. Just cross reference this k? I don’t know anything in order to correct anything. Never done this before. But hopefully it lines up, but if it doesn’t, hopefully there’s enough to tell ppl who are smarter than me what it’s *trying* to mean. 

I will put it at the end too. 

____

So here’s the events that happened, and I genuinely do hope I’ve found something good, even if it’s not an actual FIX fix. 

(If this isn’t useful to you, or any of this information was already obvious to you, please don’t get mad at me. I went all over the internet trying to figure out a solution that was good enough for me that didn’t involve just pretending the bug wasn’t happening, so I figured out a different way that worked for me. It was very useful for me and I just hope it’ll be very useful to somebody else):

___

I literally nuked my entire system. I mean literally wiped everything, never reused any accounts to rule out cloud stuff, reinstalled windows offline so it would install a local account, got rid of OneDrive just in case, reseated my cmos, flashed vbios, reseated my cmos AGAIN and flashed the motherboard, reinstalled my drivers, all that shit.

None of it made the black photo crap go away. I wasn’t using any kind of old saves or nothin. 

What finally ended up working was this, after over a week with ChatGPT+:

___

(It didn’t tell me to do this and I had to do a bunch of bs but PAUSE WINDOWS UPDATES BEFORE DOING THIS.)

Now,


Plan A — Native Test (B1 → B2 → B4)

Goal: See if the black-photo bug can be fixed without wrappers, so you can play the game normally.

⸻

B1 — Repair DirectX & Windows system files


	1.	Run DirectX Web Installer
	•	Download: DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer
	•	Run it → Accept → Let it install any missing DX9/DX10/DX11 runtimes.
	2.	Open Command Prompt as Administrator
	•	Press Windows Key + S → type cmd → right-click Command Prompt → Run as administrator.
	3.	Run SFC and DISM
	•	In Command Prompt, type:

sfc /scannow

Let it finish (can take 10–15 minutes).

	•	Then run:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Wait until it reaches 100% and says it’s completed.

⸻

B2 — Install a known-good NVIDIA driver


	1.	Download NVIDIA 528.49 (Feb 2023, pre-bug reports):
	•	Official archive: NVIDIA Driver Search
	•	~~Search for your GPU model → select 528.49 → Download.~~ I had to google this specific driver, this is the link that worked for me: 

——

https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/199655/en-us/Thisisthelatest,notsurewhenthenextwillreleasebutkeepaneyeoutasNvidiawillgoodimprovements/

(Not running it, just downloading it because afterwards I have to completely disconnect from the internet uninstall the driver I do have via DDU.)

——

	2.	Use DDU to remove your current driver:

(DDU PULLS UP AN OPTION BOX THIS IS WHAT I HAD PUT: okay it’s not letting me add an image through the Reddit app it’s cool I’ll put an Imgur link here when I’m done.)

	•	Download DDU: Wagnardsoft DDU
	•	Boot into Safe Mode → Run DDU → Select GPU: NVIDIA → Clean and restart.
	3.	Install 528.49:
	•	Choose Custom install
	•	Uncheck GeForce Experience
	•	Check “Perform a clean installation”

⸻

B4 — Disable Fullscreen Optimizations
	1.	Go to Sims 4’s install folder:
	•	EA App default: C:\Program Files\EA Games\The Sims 4\Game\Bin
	•	Steam default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Sims 4\Game\Bin

*(I have EA. I did not test this with Steam)*

	2.	Right-click TS4_x64.exe → Properties → Compatibility tab.
	3.	Check Disable fullscreen optimizations.

( note- the game still loads in full screen. This tripped me up but apparently that option doesn’t stop your game from being *in* full screen, it does something else lol)


	4.	Click Change high DPI settings → Check Override high DPI scaling → Set to Application.

⸻

Test
	1.	Reboot your PC.
	2.	Launch Sims 4 clean (no mods, no wrapper).
	3.	Take a photo, store it, travel, reload — see if the bug happens.

Then it had me disable automatic driver updates so the windows updates wouldn’t undo this, then told me how to get the things I do need automatically updated individually when it’s time.

-

Heres the explanation again:

____

“Your game was fine at first because the NVIDIA driver you were using handled Sims 4’s photo system without issue — it could store the photo textures in VRAM and correctly reload them when you traveled or reloaded the lot.

When you installed that mod, it changed how photos were stored/processed in-game — specifically increasing how often the game saved them in GPU memory and then reloaded them. That extra load pattern hit a flaw in your current NVIDIA driver branch (post-528.49), which failed to return the correct texture and instead gave the game an empty one.

The only way to stop it was to replace that driver with an older version that didn’t have the bug.”

I did this and did a few different save tests and everything seems all clear. However 

I don’t plan on singing into my old ea or Microsoft account. I’m too scared to and I’m not really in a position to where I have to. I don’t know anything about any of this I just didn’t have anything to lose diving into it. 

I *tried* saving my old files but they were eaten by a corrupted usb, great timing. So I don’t know if it’s safe to reintroduce saves that have already been effected by the bug. I don’t think I would recommend it. 

When the bug first hit, I tried to save the lot to my gallery in case I lost the file trying to fix it, but it threw up a system error, so this might be another sign to just not reintroduce that stuff.

I haven’t played this long term yet. Idk if anything will happen down the line or if this specific setup will be safe from bs. So im gonna keep the files I need in a driver so I can repeat this fix again. If it’ll still work again. Hopefully. If anything goes wrong I’ll put it here. 

Basically, i don’t know if this will be a fix for all situations and I don’t know if this fix allows for you to keep playing your legacy and keep all your accounts the same. I had already lost everything before the fix and I really don’t want to recreate this on my only computer in order to find out. 

Those final instructions that actually fixed the problem tho were very easy to follow and I’m keeping a backup of all the files I used. 

I don’t know anything about anything that isn’t related to my setup. I only know what little I do know from being stupid and digging around into things like this.

The gpt kinda hyper focused on the gpu part once I said that dxvk and dgvoodoo were able to prevent the black photo bug for one singular sequence (made it work for once save but the but reappeared after the second). That info might be more helpful to somebody else than it was for me. It helped pinpoint a sort of bandaid solution that doesn’t feel like a bandaid solution… but I won’t be able to upgrade my gpu driver now, so…. I wouldn’t call it a TRUE fix. Hopefully I can figure something out before i *have* to update it. But for now, I don’t have to do a bunch of s4s shit every time I want a photo on the wall. So. Idk.


Also I don’t have any games that will be super affected by rolling back my gpu but you might. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were a lot of reasons not to do this. I did it because I could and wasn’t losing anything.

So. Remember. I’m just a person. I’m not that smart in this particular context. Just a sad no lifer who copes by playing the sims. 
___

Hope this helps. Even if what I did to help myself doesn’t help you, I think there’s some valuable info here. 

I hope yall have a good day. Please don’t bully me if any of this is wrong or stupid. Thank you ❤️ ",0,1755058479.0,LowSodiumSimmers,0,0.5,False

1. I use [https://www.lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com) to print my own- be careful though because it automatically puts the books to a coffee table size (way too big for everyday)

\- it was around 20-30$!

2. If you want to print a specific size or if it wont let you change to a smaller planner option use a pdf resizer. [https://www.pdf2go.com/resize-pdf](https://www.pdf2go.com/resize-pdf)

3. When creating the initial pdf google docs sucks, especially for files as big as a daily planner and can mess up the format. Do periodic checks on whatever platform you use to make sure the format isnt getting messed up in the transition from document to PDF.

This time with an unethical request but you guys need to understand it’s a life or death matter!! :c

So, call me old but i’ve tried baristas for the first time like a month ago, everytime i see my colleagues order coffee for like 12dt + delivery fee i just laugh at them in my head like tf? These people are crazy for spending that much on a COFFEE? Embarrassing 
But karma bit me so hard in the ass when i was having period cravings the other day, caved in and ordered the stupid coffee 😔
The rest is history.
Now my wallet is empty, that shi is so addictive like???? WHAT KINDA DRUGS ARE THEY PUTTING IN THOSE COFFEES?? (Im just on the spectrum and once i like a new food i’ll eat/drink it autistically, religiously and repeatedly for days and months on end until the thought of it becomes repulsive to me)

ANYWAY, not to pull a Plankton on y’all but does any former barista want to leak the recipe to help a girl out, pretty please with cherry on top?please put an end to my suffering 
🥺
👉🏽👈🏽
By recipe i mean the kind of coffee the use and most importantly that laced caramel syrup they use, i looked up a few options but they all looked so liquid-ish?? The one they use at baristas is so thick like🫦 unmatched flavor
I wanna get one as close as possible to the one they use or the same one of if anyone knows please please PLEASEEE leak the recipe 😔🙏🏽tysm 🫶🏽",2,1755058130.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

I ended up in the ER and was diagnosed with inflamed small intestine. 

I got diagnosed with ureaplasma again. This time super mild. Literally took 10 days. They gave me 100 mg doxy + one dose of azi. It worked after like 2 doses.

I take doxy after the meal and drink ridiculous amount of water. In general, during the day, i drink insane amount of water and coconut water. So, I take one doxy after breakfast and one after dinner. No coffee no tea. I take Align extra strength probiotic mid-day, literally get it at target. At least 4 hours away from each doxy.

I’ve been trialling dexamphetamine for ADHD and noticed something interesting, wondering if anyone has experienced this or knows why it happens.

Quick timeline:

* Day 1–4: Low doses (2.5–5 mg ×3/day) with my usual \~2 coffees over the day → not much noticeable effect.
* Day 5: 7.5 mg ×2/day with my usual \~2 coffees over the day → first dose felt great: super motivated, focused, mood lift. Second dose a bit weaker.
* Day 6–7: 7.5 mg ×3/day with zero coffee → felt much less noticeable than Day 5, closer to baseline.

It seems like my first day on 7.5 mg felt like it was working partly because I also had caffeine, but when I cut coffee completely, the meds felt flatter and almost unnoticeable. Could caffeine withdrawal be muting the effects? Or is there an actual synergy between caffeine and dexamphetamine that makes them feel stronger together, despite the reccomendation i have heard to avoid caffeine?

I’ve never done a full day of fasting before, so I wasn’t sure how my body would respond. I am currently 48 hours in on a 72 hour water fast. I have been taking electrolyte supplements and drinking plenty of water, with about one cup of coffee and herbal tea as well. 

I am kind of surprised how well my body is handling everything. I have the occasional hunger, but it’s pretty mild and passes shortly, especially with the volume of water I’m drinking. What I’m really amazed at is just how calm I feel. I thought I would be hangry and irritable, but instead I just feel this inner peace and calmness. Hoping this continues into my third day of fasting.

On top of feeling calm, I have this sense of empowerment. I am not sure how to explain it, but I guess I just feel in control of my body and the decisions I make every day. Has anyone else felt this way?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mhce3m/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_husbands_daughter/): **August 4, 2025**

Hi Reddit. I already know this is going to sound harsh, but I really need some perspective.

I (37F) have been married to my husband Mark (45M) for almost five years. He has a daughter, Emily (17F), from a previous relationship. I have no children of my own, though I always wanted them, and Emily lives with her mom across the state.

Let’s just say Emily and I have never gotten along. I’ve tried—truly—but from day one, she made it clear she didn’t want anything to do with me. She’s polite around her dad but cold toward me. I accepted that, gave her space, and tried not to take it personally.

Then about two years ago, things escalated. She came to stay with us for a week during summer break. During that time: My wedding ring went missing. We later found it in her backpack. had a bottle of prescription anxiety meds disappear. Turns out she was using them “to help her sleep.” My expensive makeup, skincare, and even underwear (!!) mysteriously vanished.

When I confronted her gently (and yes, I mean gently), she flat-out denied everything and sobbed to Mark that I was accusing her because “she’s not really my kid.” He took her side. Claimed she was “acting out” due to divorce trauma and that I should be more understanding.

After that visit, I told him: I am setting a hard boundary. I don’t want her unsupervised in our home.

Now fast forward to last week. Emily’s mom is apparently moving to another country with her new husband, and Emily doesn’t want to go. She asked if she could move in with us full-time for her last year of high school.

I said no.

I know that makes me sound heartless. But I told Mark I wasn’t comfortable having someone under my roof who has stolen from me, disrespected me, and clearly doesn’t like me. I said I’d support him finding a solution, even renting a small place nearby if he wanted to live with her there, but I won’t share my space with her.

Mark was silent for hours. Then he told me he was “disappointed,” that I “never truly accepted her,” and that I was “punishing a teenager for mistakes she made at fifteen.”

Now he’s been sleeping on the couch and barely speaking to me. His sister even messaged me and called me a “wicked stepmother.”

I don’t think I’m wrong for protecting my peace and my space, but now that everyone is calling me the villain, I’m second-guessing.

So… **AITA for refusing to let my husband’s daughter move in with us?**

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions**

**Relevant Comments**

**Downvoted Commenter:** You married a man with a kid. Kids go through phases, act out, test boundaries. You’re an ass because you are acting on old information. She’s part of your family. Petty theft (and yes what you have described is petty teenage nonsense) is not worth banishing her for. You need to grow up.

> **OOP:** I doubt stealing my underwear and my wedding ring is petty theft.

**Commenter 1:** How did your dumbass husband explain your meds and ring in her backpack then?  NTA and if your loser of a parent husband wants to blow up your marriage over it then that’s his prerogative, when that brat is living with you full time her stealing will likely be the least of your problems.

> **OOP:** She claimed to have bipolar disorder, which I am not sure if I believe because I've never seen any actual documents proving that statement. But she claimed to have bipolar disorder, which caused her to steal my stuff.

**Downvoted Commenter 2:** When you married him you knew he had a child. There is always a possibility that a child could move in with him. What if her mother would have died?

I would have a serious conversation with her father. Explain yourself and you make sure you have common household rules and boundaries. And then talk with Emily. She may have grown up. If she apologises and is truely sorry I would reconsider. You may as well lose your husband if you deny him the possibility to have his daughter living with him just one year?

> **OOP:** I actually found out that he had a child a couple months after the marriage which caused an argument. I just don't feel comfortable with a teen in my home that doesn't like me, never actually apologized for her behavior and previously stole my ring.

**Commenter 2:** Stealing prescription meds and a wedding ring isn't just ""acting out""

Your husband is the one who let this fester by not dealing with it two years ago. Now he's mad at you for the consequences of his own inaction. NTA
> 
> **Commenter 3:** Anyone want to point out that stealing/wearing your father's wife's underwear is a bit disturbed? I couldn't share my space with a drug addict and a thief either. Who owns the property?
> > 
> > **OOP:** The property is mine. Thank you for talking about this because that part disturbed me a bit more then when she stole my wedding ring.

**OOP needs to get her husband in family therapy**

> **OOP:** I've been trying to get him to agree to family therapy but he refused.

**Has Emily been treated for the possible disorder?** 

> **OOP:** From what I've known so far, I don't think she's been treated. I don't even know if she actually HAS BP

**What was OOP's husband's response after they found the ring in Emily's bag?**

> **OOP:** Yes, my husband and I found it. He was angry at first but dismissed her behavior because she didnt know better..

**Downvoted Commenter 3:** YTA - you are refusing to provide shelter for a child just because they behaved poorly. And you are putting your husband in the position of choosing between his wife and his daughter.

> **OOP:** If she learns to apologize, acknowledge her behaviour and return me my items then I'll CONSIDER letting her stay. I'm protecting my peace. I offered an alternative that was good enough

**Is OOP's husband unemployed or not? Is she financially supporting him because of the house in her name?**

> **OOP:** No he has a stable job.

**OOP responds to multiple comments about her husband not having her back on this decision**

> **OOP:** Honestly. So many comments have been telling me the same thing and I'm starting to believe they are right. I think I will consider divorce.

**Downvoted Commenter 4:** YTA. She is his child, his responsibility, if you marry him, you marry his responsibilities, obligations etc... saying you wont allow YOUR TEENAGE STEPDAUGHTER to live in your home is wrong. He should divorce you and take care of his kid. Being with you is a choice, taking care of his child is not a choice. Yes you are absolutely the asshole.

> **OOP:** You're right she *is* his responsibility. Which makes it even more concerning that he hid her existence from me until *after* we were married, refused therapy, and let her steal from me without consequence or apology.

I didn’t say she shouldn’t be taken care of. I said I’m not willing to share my home with someone who’s disrespected me, lied, and made me feel unsafe—especially while her father enables it.

Being married doesn’t mean forfeiting the right to personal boundaries. If he chooses to leave and finally prioritize his daughter, that’s long overdue. But I won’t stay in a situation where I’m expected to accept mistreatment just because she’s family. I hope you get well.

**How old is Emily now and she needs to know the right from wrong** 

> **OOP:** She's 17 now. She knows her right from wrong. I'm open to have a relationship but like I said until she apologizes and learns from her behaviour, and stops excusing it, then we can move on.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/hxLE1AyHfb): **August 6, 2025 (two days later)**

Hi again. I want to thank everyone who commented. Some of you guys had some interesting takes but I respect them. I posted an ETA addressing a few things people kept asking, so just to clarify again:

The house is mine.

I didn’t know about Emily until a few months after the wedding.

She has never apologized or taken accountability for stealing from me.

I suggested therapy both she and my husband refused.

A lot of people told me this isn’t just about Emily, and they were right. This is also about the fact that Mark lied to me about his life. Mark lied to me from the start by hiding his daughter, and when the situation got hard, he chose to ignore it. He let me doubt myself, made excuses for her behaviour, and called me selfish when I finally put my foot down. Frankly, I think that this relationship is over. I thank everyone who kindly helped me to wake the fuck up.

Since the last post, I spoke to a lawyer. I’m not filing for divorce right now, but I needed to understand what my options are. I’ve started protecting my finances and getting my documents in order. I have gotten messages from his family and Emily's friends. They were harassing me for my boundaries. Thankfully, I have an amazing family and amazing friends to defend me and help me through this situation.

Now, with Mark. I talked to him and we got into an argument. I ultimately decided to kick him out and I think he's living with his sister, who called me a witch🤦 I don't know what will happen now with Emily because I do not know if she was the one who sent her friends to harass me.

I am considering reaching out to talk to her and possibly get coffee. I really want to just muddle everything down with her. Mark has also been an absolute deadbeat because he has not taken in his daughter when he literally berated me for not letting her in our home. And the Irony is crazy. This is all the information I have right now. I will give an update if anything happens and if Emily accepts my offer for coffee.

Edit: Hello everyone, this is just a quick message. I’ve been receiving a lot of messages in my DMs asking for and rushing me about an update. Please note that I am still human with a life, and I am not obligated to give another update if I do not feel like it. Thank you.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** DO NOT! Why can't Emily stay with his sister? She's a thief. Why would SIL want someone who is a ""witch"" to house their niece and not to it herself? Emily is a liar and a thief and if this coffee thing is a must record the interaction.

> **OOP:** She has refused to take her in due to the child's history.

**Commenter 2:** Why even ask her for coffee? It doesn’t sound like you had any sort of positive relationship with Emily. The only connection you had was her dad, who you are ending your relationship with. My advice would be a clean break all around, so you can move on with your life.

**Commenter 3:** Do not meet her for coffee. You will never get what you want from that conversation. Nothing good will come from you having any more communication with any of them.

**Commenter 4:** Don’t meet Emily - she will twist it and make you out to be the villain. There’s no point. If you must meet with her, I’d either be recording it (assuming it’s a one party consent) or bring someone with you to sit at the table with you in a public place.

Nobody did anything besides tell me I am a pediatric female and girls my age do not hallucinate.  Eventually (3ish years after I first reported the hallucinations) I became so desperate to talk about them I stopped saying “hallucination” because I would be told that “it’s just anxiety” so I had to describe an auditory command hallucination without saying hallucination.

At 22 I stopped my meds cold turkey after serious health complications against my doctors advice and for the withdrawals it was horrible but after a year I realized I stopped having a majority of what I now know to be side effects. But I feel pain now, pain that feels like it’s is filling up my chest and throat and I can’t breath anymore. I didn’t know being alive was so painful. Pain being sexually abused as a child by my biological father, pain for my step dad dying and leaving us homeless in elementary, pain from the medical neglect that left me disabled, getting repeatedly raped and trafficked while on the meds, misdiagnosed at 20 and put on more meds that made my health worse and then to top it all off.. those new meds had so many side effects my doctors couldn’t tell I was pregnant. And my baby died because the meds I had been in since 13 were not approved for use in minors, nor safe for pregnancy. 6 months of my my doctors telling me I’m not pregnant I’m just having medication side effects, I’m just fat and lazy. To have my unviable daughter inside me. I stopped cold turkey two months after losing my pregnancy because my doctors refused to taper me off those fucking meds.

I never could feel the pain before and it hurts so much. I hate what medical neglect did to my body and brain. I hate that it stole so much time from me. Time and my baby, that I can never get back.

Nobody cares either. Medical commission wouldn’t investigate (too long ago for the first prescriber, and the prescriber that gave me antipsychotics wasn’t a psychiatrist but an assistant which was not what I was told. I was told I had seen a psychiatrist). Nobody seems to believe me even though this ALL is in my medical records, as suspiciously sparse as they are.

I keep wondering why is it wrong to give someone antifreeze in their coffee but a doctors can choose to not believe you (a literal child) reporting black box label side effects, refuse to taper you off the med and it’s just.. the risk you take of seeing a doctor? Oopsie, making your brain have a toxic amount of serotonin and norepinephrine is not our fault since you didn’t stop taking the meds you can’t stop without severe withdrawls, and that your doctors told you (a child) to keep taking otherwise you’d get worse. What is worse than fucking auditory command hallucinations? Honestly, next time just shoot me like a lame horse and skip the decade of trying to not listen to the voice in my head telling me to bludgeon my brains out with a brick, thank you.

Yep so that’s all 13 of my reasons right there. Thanks for reading, screaming for help but nobody hearing me is wearing thin. ",1,1755057479.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of a ripped hat lies in its carefully crafted imperfections. Key features contribute to the overall aesthetic and functionality of these popular accessories.

**Material Quality and Durability**

The choice of material significantly impacts the longevity and appearance of a ripped hat. High-quality cotton twill or denim are commonly used for their durability and ability to withstand the distressing process.

A durable material ensures that the rips and tears do not further degrade the hat over time, maintaining its intended aesthetic. Look for hats with reinforced stitching around stressed areas to prevent excessive fraying and extend the lifespan of the product. The best ripped hats are made to last, even with their pre-worn appearance.

**Distressing Techniques and Aesthetics**

The artistry of a ripped hat lies in the distressing techniques employed. Different methods, such as sanding, enzyme washing, and strategic tearing, create a variety of textures and visual effects.

Some hats feature subtle distressing, with minor fraying around the brim and edges, while others showcase more pronounced rips and tears for a bolder statement. The key is to find a hat where the distressing appears natural and intentional, rather than haphazard or poorly executed. Quality distressing enhances the character of the hat without compromising its structural integrity.

**Adjustability and Fit**

A comfortable and secure fit is essential for any hat, and ripped hats are no exception. Adjustable straps, buckles, or hook-and-loop closures allow for a customizable fit that accommodates different head sizes.

Look for hats with breathable linings or ventilation holes to enhance comfort, especially during warmer weather. The adjustability feature ensures that the hat stays securely in place, regardless of activity level, while maintaining a comfortable fit throughout the day.

**Color Options and Versatility**

Ripped hats are available in a wide range of colors, from classic neutrals like black, gray, and navy to bolder shades like olive green, burgundy, and even pastel hues. The versatility of a ripped hat depends on its color and overall design.

Neutral colors offer greater flexibility in pairing with various outfits, while brighter colors can add a pop of personality to a more subdued ensemble. Consider your existing wardrobe and personal style when selecting a color that complements your overall aesthetic.

**Branding and Design Elements**

While the focus is on the distressed aesthetic, subtle branding and design elements can add a unique touch to a ripped hat. Embroidered logos, patches, or graphic prints can enhance the hat's visual appeal without detracting from its rugged charm.

Minimalist designs often feature understated branding, while more expressive styles may incorporate bold graphics or eye-catching details. The branding and design elements should complement the overall aesthetic of the hat, adding a touch of personality without overwhelming its distressed character.

## Core Benefits

Ripped hats offer several practical and stylistic benefits that contribute to their widespread popularity.

**Effortless Style and Individuality**

The pre-worn and distressed look of a ripped hat instantly adds a touch of effortless cool to any outfit. It exudes a sense of individuality and rebellion, allowing wearers to express their unique style without trying too hard.

The ripped and torn details suggest a history and character that a brand-new hat simply cannot replicate. This allows individuals to showcase a more relaxed and authentic version of themselves.

**Comfort and Breathability**

Many ripped hats are made from soft, breathable materials that provide exceptional comfort, especially during warmer months. The distressing process often softens the fabric, creating a more comfortable and broken-in feel.

Ventilation holes or mesh panels further enhance breathability, preventing overheating and ensuring all-day comfort. This makes ripped hats a practical choice for outdoor activities, casual outings, or simply lounging around.

**Versatility and Adaptability**

Ripped hats can be effortlessly paired with a wide range of outfits, from casual streetwear to more refined ensembles. They complement jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and even dresses, adding a touch of edgy charm to any look.

Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any wardrobe, allowing for endless styling possibilities. Whether you're heading to a concert, a coffee shop, or a casual date, a ripped hat can elevate your style and complete your look.

**Cost-Effective Fashion Statement**

Ripped hats offer a cost-effective way to make a bold fashion statement. Compared to other accessories or clothing items, they are relatively affordable, making them accessible to a wide range of consumers.

Their durability and timeless appeal ensure that they remain a stylish and relevant accessory for years to come. This makes them a smart investment for those seeking to enhance their wardrobe without breaking the bank.

## FAQs Section

**Are ripped hats suitable for all ages?**

Yes, ripped hats can be worn by individuals of all ages, although their popularity tends to be higher among younger demographics. The key is to choose a style that complements your personal aesthetic and overall look.

While some ripped hats may feature more aggressive distressing that appeals to a younger, edgier crowd, others offer a more subtle and refined distressed look that is suitable for older individuals. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal preference and style.

**How do I care for a ripped hat?**

Caring for a ripped hat requires a gentle approach to preserve its distressed aesthetic and prevent further damage. Hand washing is generally recommended, using mild detergent and cold water.

Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach, as these can damage the fabric and alter the color. Air drying is preferred over machine drying to prevent shrinkage or distortion. Spot cleaning can be used to address minor stains or dirt.

**Will the rips and tears get worse over time?**

While some fraying and wear are natural over time, excessive degradation can be prevented by proper care and handling. Avoid pulling or stretching the distressed areas, as this can cause them to tear further.

Reinforced stitching around stressed areas can also help to prevent excessive fraying. Storing the hat properly, away from direct sunlight and moisture, can also extend its lifespan.

I had already made a post for this position a couple months back but the person that had joined the team cannot commit the required amount of hours to meaningfully advance the project.

My name is Margaux I live in Japan and I'm the designer of Galaxy Chef, a solo life-sim cooking game set in a solarpunk sci-fi world.

In Galaxy Chef, players live their lives in a small community managing the local restaurant. The core feature of the game is a data-driven in-depth cooking system which allows the player to substitute any ingredient in any recipe.

I was inspired by gmaes like Harvest Moon, ANimal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Sandrock, Overcooked and Coffee Talk to just name a few.

[Feel free to check out our pitch document here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYPP60CRqlUNQEaORK7brK1jwyTZwTcx/view?usp=sharing)

Currently, I'm the only one working full-tim on this project (game design and social media marketing) and I've hired 2 part-time 2D artists to help with concepts.

I've been working on the design document for over a year and need to put together a vertical slice as soon as possible to look into getting investors/editors to help us fund this game so everyone on the team can live from this project.

I personally have 6 years of experience in the industry as a designer generalists between doing game design, level design, UI and some narrative design as well.

I'm looking for someone serious that can do a weekly call on Discord to discuss progress, has a strong foundaction in C++ and UE5, can create technical documentation for others to use their tools and is pleasant to work with. I'm expecting a minimum of 10 hours commitment on the project, ideally 20. 

I don't have a lot of budget and would prefer revshare (% TBD) or retroactive pay. This may change in the coming months as I have started posting on social media in hopes to eventually generate some income to help support the game's development.

The team is diverse. It is comprised of myself from France (designer, project lead), an environment artist from Brazil and a character concept artist from Malaysia.

We have a clear vision for a prototype by Christmas (ambitious) or February (conservative). At which point I will aggressively network and fund raise. 

If that sounds exciting to you, please reach out!

Please send:  
\- A link to your LinkedIn or resume  
\- A link to your portfolio  
\- A short introduction and why the project interests you

1mou7ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mou7ge/im_so_far_removed_from_this_mindset_that_i/,I’m so far removed from this mindset that I honestly don’t know if this will be offensive or not.,"Even though I was “born in the covenant,” I didn’t grow up in Morridor or even the west (southerner here). In high school, study dates happened at Starbucks and my friends all ordered coffees. Parties generally included alcohol. I even spent time as a young kid playing in houses where the parents smoked. 

I didn’t partake in any of the above mentioned things, but I was surrounded by it, and never found it offensive. A good majority of my friends were NeverMos but they all knew I was Mormon and completely respected my beliefs and never pressured me to try anything that went outside my values. But now I’m headed out on a girl’s trip where 95% of the girls are active Utah/Idaho born-and-raised TBMs and the other 5% are Utah/Idaho born-and-raised half-exmos (still deconstructing).

We’re staying in an Airbnb in the middle of the woods and damn it—I want to wake up, make an early morning cup of coffee, and go sit out on the deck and watch the sunrise. 

BUT AM I GOING TO OFFEND SOMEONE AND RUIN THE WEEKEND?!

Everyone in this girls group knows I’ve left, and those I’m really close with (about half) wouldn’t be bothered if they woke up to the smell of a fresh pot. The other half . . . it’s dicey. They are TBM in ways I’m not exactly fond of. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just make the damn pot of coffee? I’m open about my beliefs (or lack thereof), and to my exmo mind it is LUDICROUS that someone would be offended simply by *smelling* something, but I’ve seen the “family is visiting, I have to hide the espresso machine” posts on this sub and I need some additional insight here to help me make a decision. 

*Note: If there was a coffee shop nearby, I wouldn’t think twice about grabbing a cup, bringing it back, and drinking it in front of everyone. This is specifically about waking up the whole house with the smell of freshly brewed beans. ",15,1755057194.0,exmormon,19,1.0,False

She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

TL;DR Dated a girl who constantly gave mixed signals  canceled plans last minute, avoided introducing me to her family, blocked/unblocked me, played jealousy games, pushed me away but got upset when I didn’t chase her, and was hot-and-cold with affection. She’d refuse emotional closeness, hide her phone, suggest I date others, then cry and say I “ruined her happiness” when I ended things. Even after breakups she’d reappear, invite me to events, and then block me again. I finally refused to go back, and now she says I abandoned her",0,1755056935.0,tifu,8,0.43,False

So I headed into the Coach store in NYC on 5th Ave and 53rd st with my Loved Leather Empire 40, that I’d purchased online last week, to get my bag tag customized. I soon learned that the tag that comes with the bag can’t be customized. So I offered to buy a tag. The helpful lad who was working the custom counter wasn’t sure if I could purchase a tag so he asked the salty associate in the nearby men’s department and Salty gruffly told me if you don’t buy the bag in store and ask for the tag on the day you bought the bag you can’t get one later without buying something. Now I thought I’d seen this mentioned here but I didn’t take it seriously because I figured this rule couldn’t apply to someone who’d spent $800 on one of their bags. Well the salty gruff associate was quick to let me know it most certainly did apply. So I asked to speak to the manager. The manager appeared, and I got him to explain how this policy was put in place to stop people from buying up tags without buying bags and using them on other bags or buying them as gifts. I saw some logic in this but if you come in with your bag and you can prove you recently bought it, I think the policy can be amended. Well the manager asked for my email, confirmed I’d bought my bag recently and allowed me to purchase a tag and have it customized . I thanked him and tipped the nice young man who customized my tag. I’m happy I stood my ground. But I will think twice before buying a bag in that particular store. That sales associate’s manner was rude, off putting and not worthy of a brand of Coach’s stature. I swear I saw her roll her eyes when the manager agreed to the purchase. I was like “ REALLY Mamm?” I can’t ever imagine buying anything from her. I’ve had wonderful experiences with the associates in other departments in that store so this was really disappointing. In the end I’m just happy I got my tag! ",2,1755056577.0,Coach,0,0.67,False

These are all heavy on plot, and steamy on everything else lol. I know some are really well known, such as the Tal Bauer and John Wiltshire, but I bet there's a few lesser-known titles that you will enjoy;

The \[Temptation Series by Ella Frank\] (6 books) A promiscuous, commitment-phobic, lawyer sets his sights on a straight bartender and gets more than he asked for. (It's love. He gets love, lol.)

The \[Prime Time Series by Ella Frank\] (3 books). I'm only 2 books in but it's so good. A gay national news anchor hires his best friend's straight older cop brother to protect him from a stalker. Your boy doesn't stay straight for long!

The \[Fight for Survival Series by H.L. Day\] (2 of 3 books): A regular guy working in a coffee shop in Northeast England meets a really, really, weird guy. A relationship ensues (weirdly). Three years later, the world ends. This series is about their journey to safety, and no it's not zombies! But it is really good. I can’t wait for the last book, but they seem to be spaced out so there is no ETA. I still think it's worth it.

The \[Expedition 63 Series by T.A. Creech\] (2 of 3 books): Six male astronauts on the Space Station. Two of them are already in a (secret) relationship. Bam, the world ends (but in a different way than the other book lol). What do they do? Each book is about a couple, as well as how they survive, how they get along, etc., as well as some nail-biting near death stuff. I can’t wait for this last book, either.

The \[More Heat Than the Sun Series by John Wiltshire\] (9 books) and the continuation \[The Winds of Fortune Series by John Wiltshire\] (5 books): A very dark and mysterious Danish diplomat spy boss in England hires a straight ex-SAS officer to work for him, but really just to get in his pants. There's lots of world travel and plot, and the two men are very much in love, but it's also full of rough (hot) sex, lots of murdering, and mentions of past CSA. If you can deal with that you will love these men and the found family they build.

The \[Executive Office Series by Tal Bauer\] (3 books) and its spinoff, the \[Executive Power Series by Tal Bauer\] (2 books). A gay Secret Service agent falls for the straight, widowed President. They fall in love and proceed to save the world, literally. A lot of plot and world travel.",6,1755056570.0,MM_RomanceBooks,0,0.87,False

Didn’t help, went to him again, prescribed the same thing, but told me to take it 5x a day for a week this time. In the same week, I went to my dentist, along with two other dentists in the clinic, they all said this is not oral thrush. One said it was geographical tongue, the other two weren’t sure what it was, but were sure it wasn’t oral thrush. They also told me to stop the nystatin because it’s unnecessary. They also asked if I eat almonds, I rarely do. For context, I do like spicy and sour food, but I don’t eat crazy amounts, and I don’t eat it often, I know my limits. I drink my coffee cold, and for my teas I wait for them to get warm. The spots don’t really hurt, they irritate me a bit when I brush my teeth, or when I eat something with a rough texture. I attached two pictures of them and I would really appreciate it someone could please help me. I’m been very anxious about this issue and I’m overthinking it maybe idk.

I am melting at the thought of your dark gaze touching mine. And anyone would: Your big brown eyes are full of intelligence and endless depths.
Your smallest smirk fills the room with radiance, and that DIMPLE. WOW.
I can’t even find words for how cute and handsome you are. 
I can guess that you don’t like how you look, but just so you know, the rest of us enjoy looking at you. Really.
To say your intelligence surpasses your cuteness is really quite a high compliment, given how cute you are. I don’t even know how you do the things you do. Your mind is like an enchanting, obscured, masterfully made puzzle that turns coal into diamonds and rusted locks into butter. I wish I knew your story, and then maybe I could solve the puzzle, but for now you’re astonishing me nearly daily and I eagerly await every glimpse I get of how your mind works.

To be gifted with both good looks and intelligence is already too much, and it would make many people turn inward and care less about others, but somehow your kindness surpasses both your good looks and intelligence.

Nobody would blame me for having a crush on you. I hope you don’t. I don’t think you can be ignorant of it. I know you don’t want to be with me, and I know a million reasons that it can’t happen. But if those reasons ever evaporate, even though it’s futile, I hope you’ll forgive me for asking you to get coffee, and soaking up your gaze and your smile, like sunshine, as long as you let me. I think you will not hold it against me - but I doubt I will get to find out any time soon. The many reasons remain in place, and become more solid every day.

So until then - I’m on your side, pretty much no matter what. It doesn’t make sense, but I’m only human, and you are special.

You have the voice of a heartthrob. You should use it in future videos. I know viewers would fall in love with it too, like my boo thang, Markiplier :) And that laugh. Fucking adorable and even more so in person. You always covered your mouth with your hand from your silly insecurities. I’d like to think it more as your attempt at appearing relatable to those who are imperfect. I hold tightly to the memory of you sitting across from me at that coffee shop’s patio. You were perfect and I was hooked.

Your eyes could take my breath away. But it was the way you looked at me with them. The admiration in them that made them double in size like a puppy's all encompassing unconditional love. To visually explain in words what I felt in my heart in those moments, would be an exact reflection. An invisible connection like no other. You felt me, I saw you.

You once told me the unconditional love of a pet is the reason you prefer animals over people. Your aura when you were around pets was blinding. I've never seen anything in my life quite like that. It doesn’t seem possible on this level of existence. You’ll be happy to know, I rub the white patch on her chest every night and make kissy sounds in her ears, just like you asked me to.

I can take my medication and go right back to sleep no problem, but I can do the same thing with half a pot of coffee, it just doesn’t phase me and I’m afraid I’ll get a look or something and questioned, but my doctor isn’t asking any questions at all besides “how’s the medicine doing?” and i usually say, idk, idk what I’m supposed to feel, then she just usually keeps it the same I guess till I speak up, but she doesn’t ask anything else about me or how I’m feeling besides what I could think of on the spot, idk what I’m looking for with the words other than “it doesn’t work like it used to to.”

She’s in and out super fast and I’m like “okay.. maybe next month I’ll write down some things and questions to say and ask, but I’m busy and jjst forget because I tell myself “oh I’ll think of the words in the session” but I don’t, I’m just kinda pissed she’s in and out and asks zero comparison questions, so I’m typing this for tomm cause I’m speaking up finally. I’ve not felt normal and good since about march anyways.

So how does a kicker work? Would I ask for increase alone or ask about an adderall kicker midday or an extra pill? When I take the pill in the morning even if I eat protein with it I barely feel the mental assistance and if I do feel happy it wears off about 5 hours later.

I exercise and have a fast metabolism, I eat a lot and have regular bowel movements like clockwork, so I’m thinking maybe I metabolize things fast?

When I was an alcoholic and addict I could do a lot and lots of substances and handle my own, I partied a lot as a musician in my 20s, been clean and sober a good while now and was diagnosed adhd last August as well as Asperger’s in October of last year.

So, what’s a kicker and what should I say when I’m in the office tomm? What’s an okay way to ask for more? 

Thanks and take care, have a great week!

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and flavor of hazelnut coffee pods are determined by several key features. These include the type of coffee beans used, the intensity of the hazelnut flavor, the pod compatibility with various coffee machines, and the overall brewing experience.

**Bean Quality:** The type of coffee beans used significantly impacts the final flavor of the hazelnut coffee.

Arabica beans are generally preferred for their smoother, more aromatic profiles, while Robusta beans offer a bolder, more intense flavor with higher caffeine content. The best hazelnut coffee pods often use a blend of both to achieve a balanced and nuanced taste. The origin of the beans also plays a crucial role, with beans from regions like South America and Africa offering distinct flavor characteristics that complement the hazelnut flavor.

**Hazelnut Flavor Intensity:** The strength and authenticity of the hazelnut flavor are crucial for a satisfying experience.

Some pods use natural hazelnut extracts, while others rely on artificial flavorings. Natural extracts tend to provide a more subtle and authentic taste, while artificial flavorings can sometimes come across as overly sweet or artificial. The intensity of the hazelnut flavor should be balanced, complementing the coffee without overpowering it. A well-balanced hazelnut coffee pod offers a harmonious blend of coffee and hazelnut notes.

**Pod Compatibility:** Compatibility with various coffee machines is essential for convenience and usability.

Most hazelnut coffee pods are designed to be compatible with Keurig or Nespresso machines, but it's crucial to check the specific compatibility before purchasing. Some pods are also designed for universal compatibility, working with a wider range of single-serve coffee makers. Ensuring compatibility prevents frustration and ensures a seamless brewing experience.

**Roast Type:** The roast level of the coffee beans significantly influences the overall flavor profile.

Light roasts tend to be brighter and more acidic, highlighting the natural flavors of the beans, while dark roasts offer a bolder, more robust flavor with a hint of bitterness. Medium roasts strike a balance between the two, providing a smooth and well-rounded flavor. The ideal roast level for hazelnut coffee pods depends on personal preference, but a medium roast is often recommended for its balanced flavor profile that complements the hazelnut flavor well.

**Environmental Considerations:** Sustainability and ethical sourcing are becoming increasingly important to consumers.

Many brands are now offering recyclable or compostable coffee pods to reduce their environmental impact. Look for pods made from sustainable materials or brands that prioritize ethical sourcing practices, ensuring that the coffee beans are harvested and processed in a responsible and environmentally friendly manner.

## Core Benefits

Hazelnut coffee pods offer several core benefits that make them a popular choice for coffee lovers. These include convenience, consistent flavor, and variety.

**Convenience:** Hazelnut coffee pods provide a quick and easy way to enjoy a delicious cup of hazelnut coffee without the need for grinding beans or measuring coffee grounds.

Simply pop a pod into your coffee machine and brew for a consistently flavored cup of coffee in seconds. This convenience is particularly appealing for busy individuals who want a hassle-free coffee experience. The ease of use and minimal cleanup make hazelnut coffee pods an ideal option for everyday enjoyment.

**Consistent Flavor:** Each hazelnut coffee pod is pre-portioned with the perfect amount of coffee and hazelnut flavoring, ensuring a consistent and balanced flavor in every cup.

This eliminates the guesswork involved in measuring coffee and flavoring, guaranteeing a consistently delicious and satisfying coffee experience. The pre-portioned design also helps to maintain the freshness of the coffee, as each pod is individually sealed to preserve the flavor and aroma.

**Variety:** Hazelnut coffee pods are available in a wide variety of brands, blends, and roast levels, offering something for every taste preference.

Whether you prefer a light and delicate hazelnut flavor or a bold and intense one, you can find a hazelnut coffee pod that suits your individual taste. The variety of options allows you to explore different flavor profiles and discover your favorite hazelnut coffee blend. From classic hazelnut to more exotic variations, the possibilities are endless.

## FAQs Section

**Are hazelnut coffee pods compatible with all Keurig machines?**

Most hazelnut coffee pods are designed to be compatible with Keurig 2.0 and newer models. However, it's always a good idea to check the packaging or product description to ensure compatibility with your specific Keurig machine. Some older Keurig models may not be compatible with all types of coffee pods.

**Do hazelnut coffee pods contain real hazelnuts?**

Most hazelnut coffee pods contain natural or artificial hazelnut flavoring rather than actual hazelnuts. This is because using real hazelnuts in the pods could clog the coffee machine and affect the brewing process. The hazelnut flavoring is carefully formulated to replicate the taste and aroma of real hazelnuts, providing a delicious and authentic hazelnut coffee experience.

**How long do hazelnut coffee pods stay fresh?**

Hazelnut coffee pods typically have a shelf life of 6-12 months from the date of manufacture. To maintain freshness, store the pods in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Once a pod is opened, it should be used immediately to prevent the coffee from losing its flavor and aroma.

**Are there any decaf hazelnut coffee pod options available?**

Yes, many brands offer decaf hazelnut coffee pod options for those who want to enjoy the taste of hazelnut coffee without the caffeine. These decaf pods are made using the same high-quality coffee beans and hazelnut flavoring as their caffeinated counterparts, ensuring a delicious and satisfying coffee experience without the stimulating effects of caffeine.

1motlb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1motlb1/back_when_i_was_accused_of_being_racist_to_myself/,Back when I was accused of being racist to myself,"Figured some of you would find this funny, this took place back in 2019 when I was working at a car rental agency. 

So I'm an Irish/Siksika native mix but most think I'm Mexican. I've been wearing a bone choker necklace since '89, I really enjoyed the native vibe with it. 

We get a new hire who has a stick up her butt about everything,  from asking if I really needed a 4th cup of coffee or asking why I took so long in the bathroom.

She points to my neck and asks why I'm wearing that. I asked if she meant my Indian choker necklace.  She tells me its cultural appropriation and that the correct term is First Nations individual. I ask if she thinks I'm Mexican or something and that ""first nations"" is a Canadian term.  If you want to go P.C then as I'm American it would be ""native American"". She let's me know that Indian is an ethnic slur and I rebut with my dad was Siksika and he used that all his life,  so do I. (Even mentioning the old joke is that we pronounce it like the letters N D N). She let's me know that I'm making her uncomfortable.... a bit later she actually goes and complains to our boss about my hostility and blatant racism.

So yeah, I got to speak to some corporate HR butthole a few days later. Bringing up how Indian is still a recognized and legal term that many of us use,  that no one gets to tell me how I should identify. He just listened and said that this was just a cultural misunderstanding and that no further action would be taken. Though she was off desk duty and on car clean up after that, didn't last another month before quitting.

They’re bold, they’re timeless, and honestly… they’re the kind of manicure that makes you feel like you can conquer the world—or at least survive Monday.

I’ve been obsessed with cherry red since my first “grown-up” manicure in my early 20s. I walked out of the salon feeling like a completely new person. My outfit didn’t change, my hair didn’t change, but my nails? Instant attitude boost. If you know, you know.

Today, I’m sharing **my favorite cherry red nail art ideas** plus the **best cherry red nail polishes you can grab on Amazon**. Whether you want sleek and minimal or over-the-top glam, I’ve got you covered.

# Why Cherry Red Nails Are Always in Style

Fashion trends come and go, but cherry red nails? They’ve been holding it down since the Marilyn Monroe era. The shade is versatile enough for a black-tie event or a weekend coffee run.

Cherry red is also **universally flattering**. Whether you have fair, medium, or deep skin tones, there’s a cherry red shade that will make your nails pop. Plus, it works for every nail shape—square, almond, stiletto, or even short and natural.

Ever notice how red nails just *photograph better*? That’s not an accident. The color naturally draws attention without screaming for it.

# Cherry Red Nail Art Ideas to Try

# 1. Classic Glossy Cherry Red

You can’t go wrong with a glossy red manicure. It’s the ultimate “power nail.” Keep the shape neat, use a high-shine top coat, and you’re set.

**Pro tip:** Two thin coats look way better than one thick coat. Thick coats = streaks and chips.

# 2. Cherry Red with Gold Accents

Gold and red are basically soulmates. Add a thin gold stripe down the middle of each nail, or do a gold foil effect on one or two accent nails. Perfect for the holidays—or any day you want to feel a little extra.

# 3. French Tips with a Twist

Instead of the classic white, swap it for cherry red tips. Keep the base nude or sheer pink for a fresh, modern look. Bonus points if you make the tips slightly curved for that “almond French” vibe.

# 4. Cherry Red Ombre

Blend cherry red into a softer pink or even a deep burgundy for a subtle gradient. It looks stunning on long nails but works on short ones too if you keep the fade smooth.

# 5. Matte Cherry Red

Matte nails always make people look twice. Pair a matte cherry red with glossy tips or a single glossy accent nail for contrast.

# 6. Cherry & Leopard Print

This one’s a little wild but trust me—it’s gorgeous. Alternate cherry red nails with nude nails featuring black and brown leopard spots. It’s like mixing business and party in the best way.

# 7. Cherry Red with Minimalist Line Art

If you’re into modern, clean designs, add thin white or black lines over your cherry red base. It’s chic, simple, and way easier to DIY than it looks.

# 8. Rhinestone Accents

Want drama? Add small rhinestones at the base of each nail or go full glam with a blinged-out accent nail. Cherry red is the perfect backdrop for sparkle.

# 9. Half Moon Manicure

Paint your nails cherry red but leave a small half-moon near the cuticle bare or painted in a contrasting color like silver or gold. It’s retro, classy, and instantly eye-catching.

# 10. Cherry Nail Stickers

Yes, literal cherries. A glossy cherry red base with tiny cherry decals = the cutest summer nails ever.

# The Best Cherry Red Nail Polishes on Amazon

I’ve tried a lot of red polishes over the years—some chipped within a day, others stayed perfect for a week. Here are my tried-and-true favorites you can order right now:

# 2. [Essie Nail Polish in Forever Yummy](https://amzn.to/41yKW1S)

* **Why I love it:** This one’s slightly deeper than a true cherry red, which makes it super flattering for cooler skin tones.

# 3. [Sally Hansen Miracle Gel in Red Eye](https://amzn.to/3JbbNuI)

* **Finish:** Gel-like shine
* **Why I love it:** No UV lamp needed and it legit lasts a full week on me. Great for busy people who can’t deal with constant touch-ups.

# 4. [Revlon Super Lustrous Nail Enamel in Revlon Red](https://amzn.to/4fwM2B0)

* **Finish:** Glitter

# Tips for the Perfect Cherry Red Manicure

* **Always start with a base coat.** Red pigments can stain your nails, and the base coat helps your manicure last longer.
* **Wrap your tips.** When applying polish, swipe across the very edge of your nail to seal it in. This helps prevent chips.
* **Use thin layers.** Two or three thin coats beat one thick coat every time.
* **Finish with a top coat.** This adds shine and keeps your color from fading.
* **Touch up chips quickly.** A quick dab can save your manicure for a few more days.

# Cherry Red for Every Season

Cherry red isn’t just for Christmas or Valentine’s Day. It’s a year-round power color:

* **Winter:** Pair with gold or silver accents.
* **Spring:** Combine with floral designs or pastel tips.
* **Summer:** Go glossy with cherry nail stickers for a playful vibe.
* **Fall:** Try matte cherry with black line art or deep burgundy ombre.

# DIY vs. Salon

I love a good salon visit (free coffee, someone else dealing with my cuticles—yes please), but cherry red is easy to DIY if you have the right polish. If you’re doing it at home, make sure you:

* Work in good lighting.
* Take your time with each coat.
* Let each layer dry before adding the next.

For salon visits, bring your favorite bottle of cherry red polish just in case they don’t have your exact shade.

# Final Thoughts

Cherry red nails are timeless for a reason—they make a statement without trying too hard. Whether you keep it simple with a glossy finish or go bold with glitter, rhinestones, or nail art, this shade will always look fresh.

So, what’s stopping you? Grab one of the **best cherry red polishes on Amazon**, pick your favorite nail art idea, and treat yourself to a confidence boost. Your future self will thank you every time you glance at your hands.

I have direct contact with multiple people in HRDC staff, the city of Bozeman, and actual people living on the streets that are already feeling this impact as policy is rapidly changing with no direction on what the hell to do.

The homeless shelter is kicking everyone out for a week during the transition to the new building. Its great that there is a new facility that is going to work for the homeless community here, but are they really working for the people?

They say they will provide tents for shelter, but where do you pitch them? It is crimillaly illegal to camp in the public right of way.

Violence is spiking on the north end of town especially, and after ordinance 2172 is going to sunset in October, further putting another few hundred people into no viable option to have a place to rest and be a contributing member of this community, they will either be jailed or involuntarily put into detention for mental health issues or addiction.

I understand there are bad actors, but if you want to meet the dozens of working members that check you into your hotel room, hand you your coffee during rush, or serve you a clean plate of food at your favorite restaurant moving forward, please be kind 🙏.

HRDC, City of Bozeman, Code Enforcement. I have calls made to you. I am not going away. I will go public with any and all news I have gathered tomorrow without an appropriate response from you to the appropriate local news organizations. 

This is completely fucked, we are tired of your lack of leadership, and we need answers. You don't get to keep your secrets from the public that don't live this hell living on the streets everyday anymore. Literally call me.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a charcoal water filter hinges on several key features that determine its filtration capacity, compatibility, and longevity.

**Material Composition:** The quality of the charcoal used in the filter is paramount. Premium filters typically utilize activated coconut shell charcoal,known for its high porosity and extraordinary ability to absorb impurities. This type of charcoal has a larger surface area than other types, allowing it to trap more contaminants.

A Filter using high-quality charcoal helps remove chlorine, odors, calcium, and other impurities from water before brewing, significantly improving the taste of the finished coffee. The housing material is also critically important; it should be BPA-free and food-grade to ensure safety and prevent leaching of harmful chemicals into the water.

**Filtration Capacity:** Filtration capacity refers to the amount of water a filter can effectively purify before needing replacement. This is usually measured in gallons or the number of brewing cycles. A higher capacity filter offers convenience and cost savings over time.

Look for filters with a capacity of at least 30 gallons or, in the case of filters marketed for Cuisinart machines, which target a 30-day lifespan. A filter effective even after extended use guarantees consistent water filtration and flavor.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring the filter is compatible with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model is critical. Most aftermarket filters are designed to fit a wide range of Cuisinart models, but it is important to verify compatibility before purchasing.

Review the product description and compatibility chart provided by the manufacturer to confirm that the filter is designed to fit your machine. Choosing a filter specifically crafted for your Cuisinart ensures a secure fit and optimal performance.

**Filter Life Indicator:** Some higher-end Cuisinart coffee makers and compatible filters incorporate a filter life indicator.This feature alerts you to replace the filter after a certain period or number of uses, preventing the deterioration of water quality and ensuring optimal machine performance.

If your Cuisinart coffee maker has a filter life indicator,ensure the replacement filter is compatible with this feature. This indicator provides a valuable reminder to replace the filter, maintaining the highest water quality levels.

**Flow Rate:** A good charcoal water filter needs to have an excellent flow rate, which is notably important for drip coffee makers. if the flow rate isn't efficient, your coffee maker might take longer than usual to brew a pot.

The best charcoal filters will allow water to flow consistently and evenly,ensuring uniform saturation of the coffee grounds. This directly affects the brew strength and overall extraction.

**Certifications:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations, such as NSF International. These certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets specific safety and performance standards.

Certification offers assurance of the filter's quality and integrity, ensuring it effectively removes contaminants without adding harmful substances to the water.

Key features of charcoal water filters for Cuisinart coffee makers include:

*   Activated coconut shell charcoal
*   High filtration capacity
*   Model compatibility
*   Filter life indicator compatibility
*   Efficient Flow Rate
*   NSF Certification

## Core Benefits

Using a charcoal water filter in your Cuisinart coffee maker offers several core benefits that directly impact the taste, quality, and longevity of your coffee brewing experiance.

**Improved Coffee Taste:** The most obvious benefit is the improved taste of your coffee. Chlorine and other impurities in tap water can negatively affect coffee's flavor. Charcoal filters effectively remove these unwanted substances, resulting in a cleaner, smoother, and more flavorful cup of coffee.

A Filter helps to eliminate off-flavors, allowing the natural aromas and tastes of the coffee beans to shine through. This is particularly noticeable when using high-quality coffee beans, as the filter allows their subtle nuances to be fully appreciated.

**Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan:** Mineral buildup from hard water can damage your Cuisinart coffee maker over time,leading to reduced performance and eventual failure. Charcoal filters help prevent this buildup by removing calcium and other minerals from the water.

By using filtered water, you are protecting your coffee maker from scale buildup, which can clog internal components and reduce its efficiency. This extends the machine's lifespan and saves you money on repairs or replacements.

**Healthier Coffee:** Charcoal filters not only improve the taste of your coffee but also contribute to its overall healthiness. By removing chlorine and other contaminants, these filters reduce your exposure to perhaps harmful substances.

Drinking coffee made with filtered water ensures you are consuming a cleaner and purer beverage, free from unwanted chemicals and impurities. This can be particularly important for individuals concerned about their health and well-being.

**Reduced Maintenance:** By preventing mineral buildup, charcoal filters can significantly reduce the need for descaling your Cuisinart coffee maker. Descaling is a time-consuming and sometimes messy process.

Using a charcoal filter minimizes the frequency of descaling, saving you time and effort. It helps maintain the machine's cleanliness and keeps it running smoothly.

Core benefits of using charcoal water filters for Cuisinart coffee makers:

* Improved Coffee Taste
* Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan
* Healthier Coffee
* Reduced Maintenance

Turns out grinding yourself into the ground isn't success, it's stupidity.

At 23, I had the resume of someone twice my age. Top of my class, fast-tracked through promotions, working on projects people with decades of experience were jealous of. Everyone kept telling me I was killing it.

Funny thing about killing it - sometimes you're the one dying.

The hair loss started slowly. First just a few extra strands on my pillow. Then chunks in the shower drain. Then actual bald spots. At twenty fucking three. My barber asked if I was going through chemo.

But I kept pushing. That's what you do, right? Success requires sacrifice. Sleep is for the weak. Burnout is just an excuse. I lived on this toxic positivity that hard work cures everything. Feeling exhausted? Work harder. Body falling apart? That's just weakness leaving.

I was religious about discipline. Up at 5am every day. No social media. No Netflix. No fun, really. Just work. I thought I was better than everyone else because I was suffering more efficiently.

Then one morning I sat at my desk and couldn't remember why I was there. Not like forgot a meeting - I mean I couldn't remember why any of it mattered. My hands were shaking from my fourth coffee and it was only 9am. I looked at my reflection in my laptop screen and didn't recognize the person staring back.

That's when it hit me. I'd been so disciplined about achieving that I'd never asked what I was achieving FOR. I was climbing a ladder so fast I'd never looked where it led.

Took me months to unfuck my relationship with work. Had to rebuild from scratch. Started asking dangerous questions like ""what do I actually enjoy?"" and ""what would I do if nobody was watching?""

Here's what pisses people off when I say it: passion matters more than discipline.

Everyone wants to believe that pure willpower is enough. That you can hate what you do and still succeed through sheer grit. But that's how you end up bald at 23, staring at a laptop screen wondering where your life went.

When you actually give a shit about your work, discipline happens naturally. You don't need motivational quotes or productivity hacks. The work itself pulls you forward.

These days I still work hard, but it's different. I'm building things I care about. Actually ended up creating Dialed, an app that helps people reset their minds in moments of stress because I needed it myself back then. Funny how your biggest struggles become your best ideas.

My hair grew back, mostly. More importantly, I stopped measuring success by how much I was willing to suffer.

The real tragedy isn't that I pushed too hard at 23. It's that I thought pushing hard was the point. Success without purpose is just expensive failure.

1mot2y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1mot2y2/orthodox_extremism_fragmented_my_family_and_i/,Orthodox extremism fragmented my family and I resent this cult.,"My mother one day out of nowhere, as if she became possessed by something dark, became addicted to the Orthodox Church and has never been the same. It’s been 15 years. Shes a workaholic and only spends any free time she has at all going on pilgrimages to st Anthony’s monastery in Arizona. For 15 years. Doesn’t go for a walk on the beach or any kind of self care, no holidays, nothing at all. She ONLY spends every second of her free time at the monastery. A form of sacrifice… for what exactly ? She tried to get the entire family on the same page as her but every time she managed to drag us to this place, toxic events would ensue like clockwork. I consider myself deeply spiritual, yet I have never encountered any form of the divine in this place , even though I have been open to it. Time and time again. I’m still waiting. She became brainwashed by the apocalypse fear porn rampant within their cult and one day without having any discussion with the family at all, she decided to relocate everyone there. She has 5 dependents on her. Not a single discussion with anyone about this decision whatsoever. Everyone resents her and tries to spend as much time away as possible. Any sort of holiday she tries to only celebrate … at the monastery. Which is of interest to no one except her but she refuses to take part in any other activity. 

Since she relocated to this grim apocalypse waiting room , she still has to operate in the real world to sustain her family , but now she has doubled down on monastery attendance as you can imagine. She goes to the 3am liturgy most nights of the week after staying up until 1-2am working. After the liturgy is over … she goes back to work. REGULARLY. Since she began this toxic pattern, her cognitive functions have started to decline rapidly. She loses clients at work because she can’t operate in a functional way at her job anymore because of operating in perpetual exhaustion like this. 

We’ve tried to explain to her that she can either choose to live a monastic life or operate in the real world, that it’s not possible to do both. She refuses to accept this. 

The saddest part is that she does it all out of fear. Not love. 

I asked her what she feels attending these never ending liturgies … she can never answer the question. 

It’s as if she believes god will only “have mercy” on her soul based on a numbers game of how much one can attend church. 

Not a single real work or application in the real world. 

She and her comrades cannot make a single decision for their life without first consulting the geronda of the monastery. They won’t even take a shit on the toilet or purchase a coffee table before asking for his blessing. Yes it has really gotten this bad. 

She only accepts people as friends if they are orthodox and they are nearly always the worst people I have ever dealt with ever in my life. Without fail. 

The family has become fractured because she tries to pull everyone into monastic activities. Nobody wants to participate because it’s not a welcoming environment there. As a result everyone goes their own way. It’s sad. 

The fruits of this religion are otherwise not far from her or this behavior. 

I’ve had enough of anyone and everyone a part of this cult. 

It’s no coincidence that the only other notable place in the town where the monastery stands is a prison—one confining bodies, the other confining souls.

My wife loves coffee, and to her, finding a decent coffee bean with general grind and throwing it into a pour-over metal filter over some ice was the pinnacle of home-brewed iced coffee, but I thought she could do better.

I myself am normally partial to Korean instant coffee, or a nice latté if I do drink, but mostly stick with water.

So it's safe to say neither of us had any extensive knowledge of what constitutes a good coffee or extraction.

But since her birthday was coming up, I wanted to find a replacement that could be better than her pour-over, and landed on Moka pots. I'd seen one used only once before, as my old roommate had one, but never made a single cup prior to this.

So first things first, I did some research to figure out what good brands were and settled on Bialetti for my target price range. After some shopping around I landed on:

***Moka Pot:*** Brikka 4-Cup, Induction Version 

***Grinder:*** Roastmaster (Korean)

***Extras:*** 

* Bialetti 13cm Induction Plate 
* Aeropress 60mm filters 
* E&B Competition 3-cup Filter

We have a gas range at home, and lots of family and events, so these tools seemed to fit our situation the best. The extras I'd grabbed were based on recommendations from various YouTube coffee gurus talking about ways to improve the brew, and provided a few different preparation methods.

After 5 days of experimentation and Reddit scrolling, I found that there wasn't much data available on the Brikka 4-Cup induction or not, so I wanted to share my short journey and results! Spoiler alert: I think I've done it.

Note, my grinder has its own measurement for grind size in ""clicks"", correlating to the amount of clicks needed to dial in the grinder starting from fine (0) to course (24):

Espresso: 0-6 (Fine) 

Moka Pot: 7-10 (Medium-Fine) 

Pour Over: 11-17 (Medium-Course) 

French Press: 18-24 (Course)

OK, onto results!



***Day 1:***

This was mostly just breaking things in and getting everything ready for use, but actually got a decent cappuccino from my first brew. So first one was throwaway to get my 3 cups in. I actually got confused and used a course grind this day, but I still got really good results!

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 15. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Not Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low-Medium, Direct Gas 

***Yield:*** \~150ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~3 minutes

The first throwaway batch, I actually had heat temp too high, and both coffee and steam VIOLENTLY shot out the valve and scared the heck outta me, so for actual drinkable first batch, I went way lower than I thought I should.

The first drinkable batch started spurting steam mid brew, so I was concerned it'd be too bitter, but it actually came out decent. Full-bodied, and naturally a bit bitter, my wife likes more sharp tasting coffee, usually just drinks black or ""Americano"" style, which is just watered down black. No sourness whatsoever, so extraction went well, no burn taste, even though it was at a rolling boil for a moment before I removed from heat. Since it was in a cappuccino, the milk reduced a lot of the harshness and was a very mellow drink. But I wanted to get the expected ""smooth"" flow and crema that was supposed to come from the Brikka, but couldn't capture it this round. Had to remove and reinsert into flame to get full yield, but all in all good first run.



***Day 2:***

This day, wanted to show wifey how to use it, but she got overwhelmed by exact measurements so I went a much more general route, and the results showed. Very, VERY bitter and yielded a bit more but not very nice.

***Water:*** 200ml, Cold 

***Beans*****:** Local Roast, 20g, Medium, Bitter Bias 

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 9. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~160ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~1 minutes

Very sharp, very harsh taste, lots of steam and that could've been for so many reasons, but this batch came out very VERY bitter.



***Day 3:***

Rolled back some changes, but tried a new bean!

***Water:*** 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Cafe Olé (H-E-B) Texas Pecan 22g, Medium

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, ground again @ 0, then 8. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~140ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2 minutes

This gave me really good results! Full-bodied taste, no graininess, however yield was a bit lower due to me accidentally starting grind at 0 for maybe 1-2g, then correcting to 8. The unevenness of the grind and fine particles potentially soaking up water and clogging most likely contributed to the yield loss.



***Day 4:***

Sorted out grind size, and got great results!

**Water:** 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Cafe Olé (H-E-B) Texas Pecan 22g, Medium, Soft, Hazelnutty 

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 9. 

***Main Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~120ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2 minutes

This gave me really good results! Best taste that I'd had thus far, maybe partially due to the more mellow bean and lower heat temp. But felt I could get it even better, though this was a great batch. Timing wise though, again, had sputtering mid-brew, and yield was super low so I thought it might be a heating issue. The body is 4-cup, so it needs a bit more heat to get a consistent flow.



***Day 5:***

AYOOOOOO, DO I LIKE COFFEE NOW?

***Water****:* 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Gute Leute Normal Roast 22g, Medium 

***Grind:*** Ground @ 10. 

***Main Filter:*** E&B Competition Filter 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low-Medium, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~150ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2.5 minutes

I just had this this morning, and HOOO boy, was this it. Firstly, swapped out the stock filter for the E&B 3-Cup Competition Filter. The filter size itself is the same, but the outer diameter and included gasket are smaller than needed for the 4-cup, so I used both the original gasket and the included E&B gasket to buffer the space. I was concerned that the extra height wouldn't allow for it to shut and seal properly, but no leaks, proper seal, just requires a bit more tightening than I normally had to with the stock filter. No leaks, no pressure drops so far. We'll see how it performs over time. I included some pictures so you can see how it looks. Definitely looks dodgy lol but seals like the best of them! Doesn't move or shift or pop out of place at all, just higher than you'd expect.

And starting with full coffee beans finally gave me the chance to get the proper grind settings locked in. Bean taste is also inherently fresher since it's fresh bough and ground.

So started batch with medium heat and let more pressure build up, then cut off heat as soon as coffee came out since I'm using the induction plate to carry it all the way through. This time, sputtering didn't come until the very end, which was perfect! I'm assuming the filter switch, grind update and heat switch fixed that issue!

**Bonus: I got crema!!**

Taste wise: Most balanced and complex taste I've extracted to date, for several reasons, but all elements at play here produced an amazing cup of stovetop espresso and an iced latté! Espresso taste really captured the full notes of the beans, and the latté gave me a perfect blend between lightness and body!

Also interesting note, the water below was the least muddied it's been thus far.

I haven't yet tried the Aeropress filters in conjunction with either the standard or competition filter, but I have a feeling I won't need it!

So final recommendations for Brikka 4-cup:

* Definitely lock in the right grind size, and fill up the basket as full as you can without tamping!
* Definitely upgrade to competition filter!!
* Definitely give the Brikka a bit more heat to account for the pressure valve!
* Use pre-warmed water (60°-70°) to reduce time!
* Use an induction plate if you want more consistent heating control!

Marty and I are roommates and we’ve known each other since we were toddlers. We’re always playing video games and drinking soda together, so I wanted to do something special. I got us 2 tickets to the opening night of this new horror movie we’ve been talking about. 

When I gave them to Marty, this man says he can’t go because he got tickets for some chick flick. And not even the good kind! I saw the preview. They're just gonna sit around talking about their feelings, fully clothed. 

Turns out he actually got them for him and Maggie (23F, fake name). Maggie is a barista at a coffee shop we’re regulars at. Marty has the biggest crush on Maggie but can never seem to make a move, though Marty said he was “finally gonna ask her out.” with the tickets.

When Maggie came to our table, the ONLY thing he could say was “Um, I was wondering, uh, would you, uh, like to, uh, you know, uh...” and I’m NOT exaggerating. I was still annoyed with Marty flaking on me with the movie, so I butted in the conversation and said “You’ll have to excuse Marty. He has a hard time ‘espresso’ himself.” Maggie laughed at my joke, and Marty immediately gets jealous but won’t admit it. Maggie leaves and he tells me to stay out of his way when we see her next.

We go to Maggie’s house later to help her move, and I’m cracking jokes the whole time making her laugh again. Marty pulls me aside and tells me to stop ruining his chances. I tell him that he can’t even make a move on her, and he’s just jealous that I can talk to chicks and he can’t. So Marty tries asking Maggie out again, but fails epically. 

Finally, I’m like, “Maggie, wanna see something cool?” I take out my movie tickets and I ask Maggie out right then and there. And she says yes. She even invites Marty, but I only have two tickets. So obviously, it’s me and her.

Now this man has been acting salty all day, saying I “ruined his chances.”But he had multiple opportunities to ask her out and didn’t. He wants me to cancel with her so he can try again, but that would be rude to Maggie, and I don’t want to be rude to the ladies.

Like I said before, he’s jealous that I can talk to women and he can’t. I just wanted to see a movie with my bro, who flaked on me, for some girl who doesn’t even know he exists! I only have 20 minutes until my date, and I know exactly how it’s gonna go down.

I'm a 37-year-old Italian woman who's lived in Los Angeles for almost eight years. I'd love to find someone older and more mature to connect with and share my thoughts and dreams.

I moved to Los Angeles from Rome partly for work (I own a OnePlus studio and have a deep love for art and design), and partly for the sunshine and diverse culture here. After all, sipping a hot coffee on a rainy day while admiring ancient architecture in Rome is a completely different experience than skateboarding through Venice Beach in the LA sun.

My weekend activities are quite varied: I go to the Huntington Library to look at plants (I'll tell you the bamboo forest there reminds me of the scenery I saw at my grandmother's house in Tuscany as a child), bake pizza at home (San Marzano tomatoes are a must for Margherita pizza!), and occasionally go to a quirky livehouse in Silver Lake with friends to listen to jazz. Oh, by the way, I've been learning yoga lately and am currently working on planks, which I think is worth the price of admission.

I've met so many lovely people since coming to LA, but I always feel like I could find more people to talk to. Whether we want to rant about LA traffic, share hidden gems, or just chat about cultural differences (like, I still don't understand why Americans serve ranch sauce on pizza, haha), everyone's welcome!

Age and background don't matter; just be genuine and share your life. If you're looking for someone who can make pasta and occasionally burst with Italian humor, feel free to reach out!

NAME: Glendronach Cask Bottling - Distilled 17/Sep/2008 Bottled 30/Jan/2020 - 11 Years in Oloroso Puncheon Cask - Selected by K&L Wine - 60.1% ABV

Neck pour went into a 2oz bottle. This is the first pour. About 1oz. Rested 10 minutes.

COLOR: Copper / Dark Gold

NOSE: Honey, Plums, Cherries, Raisins

TASTE: More Honey, Lots of Raisins & Cherries, Prunes, and heavy Sherry sweetness. Some coffee sneaks up, similar to Glenmorangie Signet Reserve. High ABV is strongly felt. Doesn't feel young at all.

AFTERTASTE: Here it gets more interesting, the cherries and coffee are gone, the Raisins and Prunes come forth stronger, and a somewhat-oily sweetness remains, like a mixture of grape juice and honey. The high ABV is felt.

OVERALL: Phenomenal. I don't know how to score between 8.7523 and 9.7523 on a 1to10 scale, but definitely very high up there. Would buy another bottle if found... but this one will probably last a while, since the sips have to be taken slowly.

P.S.: If I were to advise Macallan, I would tell them to take this (and some CS sherried Glenfarclas) as an example how a Phenomenal Sherried Whisky should taste.",3,1755052420.0,Scotch,1,0.8,False

## Key Features Analysis

The 45 Watt USB C charger market is diverse, with each model offering a unique set of features. Understanding these technical specifications is crucial for selecting the charger that best suits your needs.

**Power Delivery (PD) 3.0 Compliance:**

The vast majority of high-quality 45-watt USB C chargers will adhere to the Power Delivery 3.0 standard. this compliance ensures smart power negotiation between the charger and the connected device, optimizing charging speed and safety.

Power Delivery 3.0 also supports Programmable power Supply (PPS) for even finer control over voltage and current,further enhancing charging efficiency and device compatibility.

**Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology:**

Many of the most advanced 45 Watt USB C chargers now leverage Gallium Nitride (GaN) semiconductors. GaN technology offers several key advantages over customary silicon-based chargers. It is more energy-efficient, generating less heat and allowing for a substantially smaller and more compact design. This improved efficiency also translates to faster charging speeds and a longer lifespan for the charger. Furthermore, GaN chargers are generally more durable and resistant to wear and tear, making them ideal for travel and everyday use.**Multiple Charging Ports:**

A significant feature found in some 45 Watt USB C chargers is the inclusion of multiple charging ports. Frequently enough, this includes a USB C port capable of delivering the full 45 watts, along with a USB A port for charging older devices or accessories. The power distribution is then intelligently managed to ensure that each connected device receives the optimal charging current. This makes these chargers incredibly versatile, allowing you to concurrently charge your laptop, phone, and other devices without sacrificing charging speed.

**Comprehensive Safety Protections:**

Modern 45 Watt USB C chargers integrate multiple layers of safety protections to safeguard both the charger and the connected devices. These protections typically include over-voltage protection (OVP), over-current protection (OCP), over-temperature protection (OTP), and short-circuit protection (SCP). These safeguards actively monitor the charging process and automatically cut off the power supply in the event of any anomalies, preventing potential damage from power surges, overheating, or other electrical faults. Having these safety features provides peace of mind, knowing your devices are charged safely.

**Foldable Plug Design:**

Portability is a key consideration for many users, and a foldable plug design is an important feature for enhancing the charger's portability. This allows the prongs of the charger to fold flat against the body, making it more compact and easier to store in a bag or pocket. It also reduces the risk of damaging other items in your bag by preventing the prongs from scratching or puncturing them. This simple yet effective design significantly improves the user experience for those who frequently travel or need to carry their charger with them on the go.

I need some suggestions on what I can do/eat to get more energy before my evening workout. I am on a low calorie diet and I’ve been working out 5 days a week for 3 months. My metabolism has kicked up a notch because after eating, I’m really hungry not too long after. So I’ve been trying to stretch my 1200 calories out so that I don’t get too hungry during the day. This includes a small snack before my workout. Where it does help with the hunger, I have zero energy and my workouts sometimes suck! I can’t get motivated or keep going at the same pace. 

I can’t workout in the morning after breakfast and coffee because I have to go straight to work, kid stuff etc. I don’t want to drink low calorie energy drinks, and I also want to keep my calories in line. I take regular vitamins, drink/eat protein with a balance of carbs and fiber and plenty of water. What can I do that will give me some energy pre-workout, that’s still low calorie?

I gained almost 8.5kg in 90 days (about 12kg in ~9m) and I knew it wasn’t fat as even on OMAD I was leaving half my dinner uneaten. Half my family was away for a week and this made it easier.

Within 24hrs, my fave suit jacket was comfortable in the arms again. I have lost 5.3kg (11.7lb), 9cm off my waist, 4cm off my hips and 2cm off my chest. I still have water weight to go, my belly still has clear inflammation. For the “it’s just water weight” people - yes I KNOW, that’s literally the point of my fast.

I started at 87.2kg, currently 81.9. F46, menopausal, 166cm.

I am not hungry, not even a little bit, although that may change when my family returns and we go back to proper dinners.

I haven’t had the magic pain reduction this time, or the incredible mental clarity, but I certainly don’t feel worse than when I started.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.
