These issues include some abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant as well as the very lower back. It goes away after eating. I also get gassy as times as well. I also noticed the pain got way worse if I drank coffee or some sort of energy drink. This has been going on for about a month now. Some days worse than others. At first I thought it was maybe my liver/pancreas but I just did a metabolic panel and everything was normal. 

I am pretty regular in terms of bowel movements going about every 2 to 3 days and I've noticed the pain gets worse towards the 3rd day of not going. So I am thinking it could be irritatable bowel or ulcerative colitis.

I just wanted to see if anyone has had similar issues and what you did to fix the issue.",1,1761379830.0,KratomKorner,0,1.0,False

I started taking it out of curiosity after hearing it was used by students, entrepreneurs, and even soldiers for alertness. I expected a stimulant-type buzz but it’s not like that at all. It’s clean, calm, and powerful. You just zone in on your work without distractions, and hours fly by without that drained feeling caffeine gives you.

It’s weird how natural it feels no crash, no mood swings, just consistent mental clarity and drive. You don’t feel “high,” you just feel like your brain is finally cooperating.

Some quick takeaways from my experience:
•Great for long study or work sessions.
•Way smoother than coffee or Adderall.
•Minimal side effects (if you hydrate and don’t take it too late).
•Makes multitasking and deep work effortless.


Honestly, Modafinil feels like giving your brain the upgrade it was meant to have. Curious what’s everyone’s experience been with it? Do you use it daily, or only for high-focus days?

1ofm0zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ofm0zt/i_was_losing_340month_on_international_payment/,I was losing $340/month on international payment fees without realizing it,"I'm 28, work as a freelance graphic designer with clients in 6 different countries. Been doing this for 3 years, making around $65k/year. Thought I had my finances pretty dialed in-tracking expenses, maxing my Roth IRA, building emergency fund. Then I had a conversation with another freelancer at a coffee shop that made me realize I'd been hemorrhaging money.

The Wake-Up Call:

She mentioned she saves about $300/month by optimizing how she receives international payments. I laughed it off-""I use PayPal, it's fine."" But that night, I couldn't sleep. I decided to actually calculate what I was paying in fees.

The Brutal Math:

Pulled up 12 months of statements. Here's what I found:

Monthly incoming payments: \~$5,400 PayPal fees: 2.9% + $0.49 per transaction (avg 8 transactions) = \~$161/month Currency conversion: PayPal's rate vs. mid-market = hidden \~2.8% = \~$151/month Wire transfer fees from one client who insists on bank transfers: $25/month.Total monthly cost: $337

I literally sat there staring at my screen. That's $4,044 per year. That's more than I contribute to my Roth IRA annually ($3,500 because I can't max it yet).

Why I Never Noticed:

1. PayPal doesn't show you the FX markup separately-it's just baked into the exchange rate
2. The percentage fees felt ""normal"" because everyone uses PayPal
3. I was focused on growing income, not optimizing what I already had

What I Changed:

Spent a weekend researching alternatives. Needed something that:

* Accepts payments from US, EU, and Asia clients
* Lower fees than PayPal
* Doesn't require my clients to change much

Found Kea Banking which handles both traditional bank payments and crypto. Set up took 4 days (one KYB process for everything).

New Setup:

* US clients: ACH direct (free)
* EU clients: SEPA (€0.50 per transaction)
* Asia clients: option of SWIFT or USDT/USDC (I was skeptical about crypto but stablecoins = $1.00, no volatility)
* FX rates: transparent mid-market rates vs PayPal's markup

The Results (6 months later):

New monthly cost: \~$45

* SEPA fees: \~$15
* SWIFT occasionally: \~$20
* Stablecoin settlements: \~$10 (gas fees when converting to USD)

Monthly savings: $292 Annual savings: $3,504

What I Did With The Savings:

* Increased Roth IRA to full $7,000 (I'm under 50)
* Built emergency fund from 3 months to 6 months
* Honestly just felt less stressed about money

Lessons Learned:

1. Audit your recurring costs. I was so focused on cutting Netflix and coffee that I missed the elephant in the room.
2. ""Industry standard"" doesn't mean optimal. Everyone uses PayPal for freelancing, but that doesn't make it the best option.
3. Small percentages add up. 2.9% seemed tiny until I multiplied it by $5,400 every single month for 36 months.
4. Crypto isn't just for speculation. I avoided crypto because I thought it was all Bitcoin and gambling. Stablecoins are just a payment rail-boring but effective. Turns out some clients actually prefer paying in crypto (lower fees on their end) + modern platform auto-convert: client sends BTC → I receive USD in my account. I never even touch the crypto part

For Other Freelancers:

If you're doing international work, take 30 minutes to:

* Calculate your actual payment processing costs (including hidden FX markups)
* Research alternatives-there are more options now than 5 years ago
* Test with one client before switching everyone over

I'm genuinely angry at myself for not doing this sooner, but at least I'm fixing it now.

Anyone else have payment optimization stories? What am I still missing?

TL;DR: Freelancer losing $340/month ($4,044/year) on international payment fees without realizing it. Switched from PayPal to a service with transparent pricing, now saving $292/month. That's basically a free Roth IRA contribution.",4,1761379684.0,personalfinance,0,0.83,False
1ofm0c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1ofm0c9/twilight_zone/,twilight zone.,"it's the long sigh drawn after the fits of laughter until my friends' tummies ached. the silence that comes as soon as i step inside the apartment and shut the door behind me. it's the once hot cup of coffee that turned lukewarm from being left alone the entire day sitting on top of my work desk. it's the gray area that my brain couldn't quite wrapped itself around on why you couldn't look at me.

  
your gaze is ever-shifting, always anxiously looking around us eventhough i'm standing right in front of you. it's almost as if you're hiding something from me. are you, though? are you scared that i can see right through you? or are you scared that you will fall apart into my arms?

the answer is sitting just right at the tip of my tongue but i was quick to bit it down. i just want to end this day peacefully, without the sound of my voice cracking and car door slamming shut violently under the pouring rain. i don't even want the sorry's that will come after in form of soft kisses down the column of my throat and the caresses that are tender enough to make me weak in the knees all over again. because at the back of my mind, i know damn well you're not sorry. you just need to confirm how tight you still got me in chokehold and see how far the leash you're holding have taken me in the moment of anger. all just so you can yank me back.

i'm tired. of the constant mind games, of the chase, of the uncertainty... of us.

""how much do you know about them?"" that question might be out of genuine curiosity but it didn’t make the impact any less painful. when that question slipped past my friend’s lips, it was quickly followed by another punch to the gut when she added, ""what’s the real score between the two of you?"" i was quick to rack my brain for an answer. sure, i know a lot of things about you. wait, let me just recall... let me... jog up my... memory... a bit. only to come up with nothing but silence. heavy, thick, and painfully awkward.

a small smile graced my lips and i can feel the shame that dusted my cheeks in tinge of pink. realization hit me harder than a freight train. because truth is, i barely know you.

the nights we spent together that i thought was endless is anything but fleeting. the secrets you shared to me were just part of a much-needed “pillow talk” as we both lull each other with our synced heartbeats. was any of it even real? god, i don’t even want to know. i don’t think you have to respond anyway because the answer if just right at the tip of my tongue that i keep swallowing down no matter how bitter it is. anything to keep you around. is it even possible to know someone so well yet know nothing about them all at the same time? this time i can confidently answer this question... yes, it is.

it’s the tendrils of smoke on top of my head after taking a long drag from the cigarette. the unsettling and bitter aftertaste i hated the most after chugging down a canned cold beer. it’s the silent hum of the fan echoing in a warm afternoon as i lay on the floor and staring up at the ceiling, left to wonder why you still haven’t texted me. you’re the undefined part of my life that i can’t quite debunk no matter how much i reach for, no matter how hard i try.

and it’s almost laughable how i spent countless dusks coming up with ways to finally put an end to this seemingly addictive cycle. only for me to fall back onto your bed later that night… all because i’ll always find comfort in these familiar aches. and you’re just another outlet, a vice to my addiction of never having what i wanted, a much-needed escape from the truth that it’ll be a game over once i have you wrapped around my fingers. so game, i will play.

how addicting. different faces, same aches. different souls, same cycles. in the depth of my own misery, i’ll continue to drown because it’s all i have ever known.",2,1761379613.0,AlasFeels,2,1.0,False

Trying to wrap my head around current subscription trends and would love some opinions from this group.

For context, one of my own apps (Mindful Coffee - a caffeine/cortisol tracker: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindful-coffee-tracks-caffeine/id6742878005?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindful-coffee-tracks-caffeine/id6742878005?platform=iphone)) currently offers monthly, annual (with a 7-day trial), and lifetime options. Pretty standard stuff.

Lately, though, I'm seeing more and more apps, especially in the utility/wellness space, ditching the monthly option entirely and going straight for weekly/annual. Often, the trials are either non-existent or super short (like 3 days).

It makes me wonder:

* Is the trend really shifting away from monthly subs towards weekly/annual?
* Do users actually *prefer* weekly billing for certain types of apps, or is it just perceived as a way to get higher ARPU?
* Is a 7-day trial considered too generous nowadays? Should trials be shorter or gated differently?

Just looking for some general takes on where things are heading and what strategies you're seeing work (or not work). What's your experience been?

Appreciate any insights!",1,1761379387.0,AppStoreOptimization,1,1.0,False

On the day I married Logan, he eloped with his childhood sweetheart, Yohana. 

Every time he arrived at a new place, he’d send me a photo of him and Yohana together. 

When I received the 9999th photo he sent, I was sitting in the Quinn residence’s garden, sipping the coffee that Alyssa, Logan’s mother, had sent from Farronia. 

Then, after six years of absence, Logan returned with Yohana. 

He pointed at a photo of me and my daughter and shouted, “You’ve been fooling around with another man when I was away. Even your daughter is this old now. 

“I don’t need a woman like you. You’d better let Yohana take your place as Mrs. Quinn, pack your things, and get out of here, or else I’ll have to make you.” 

I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Mrs. Quinn? You don’t actually think you’re still the successor to the Quinn family, do you?” 

Logan shot me a look and let out a mocking laugh, his eyes full of scorn. 

He said, “What else do you expect? Grandpa said it himself. The Quinn family heir can only be me. 

“Vivian, enough with your drama. I’m not here to get your opinion, just giving you a heads-up: whether you want it or not, I’m marrying Yohana.” 

Yohana Sampson came closer, standing right next to him, put on that sweetly innocent act and tugged at his arm. “Logan, please don’t argue with Vivian. Maybe we’re just destined to be apart. Send me home, Logan.” 

Even as she said she wanted to leave, her grip just got tighter, and she shot me a look with provocation. 

Logan’s eyes instantly went gentle. “Yohana, you promised you’d be with me forever. Don’t worry. Vivian’s totally obsessed with me and always does whatever I say. We are getting married for sure.” 

After six years, Logan’s shamelessness had somehow reached new heights. 

Before I could say a word, he glared at me and spat, “You’ve enjoyed being Mrs. Quinn for six years. It’s time to hand that over to Yohana. She’s suffered enough, and I’ll never let you bully her.” 

A mocking smirk tugged at my lips. “I didn’t do anything. Don’t try to smear me.” 

Logan’s face darkened. “Who do you think you are? If it weren’t for the fact that you waited for me for six years, I would’ve kicked you out of the Quinn family a long time ago. Why would I waste my breath talking to you?” 

Kick me out? Like he’d ever have that right. 

And it was laughable that he thought I’d waited for him for six years. 

The day he ditched me, I gave up on him for good. 

Six years ago, the wedding was filled to the brim with friends and family from both the Quinn and James sides, but Logan ditched me at the altar right in front of everyone. 

My father had gone through hell and high water to secure this marriage. Logan could humiliate the James family, but I couldn’t let that happen. 

1/2 

Besides, Logan wasn’t the only man in the Quinn family. 

For the past six years, I had a husband and a kid. If he hadn’t shown up out of nowhere, I would’ve forgotten all about him. 

I said, “Logan, let me set the record straight: we never got married. There was no paperwork, no ceremony, 

“As far as the law is concerned, we’re not husband and wife. So whoever you choose to marry now is none of my concern.” 

Logan let out a scornful snort. “I’m glad you finally figured it out. If you hadn’t clung to me so shamelessly back then, would I have fled to a foreign country and lay low for six years?” 

At that moment, the butler happened to arrive and overheard everything. 

The butler quickly cut in, “Mr. Quinn, you really shouldn’t say that. She’s the wife of the Quinn Group’s CEO.” 

“The wife of the Quinn Group’s CEO?” Yohana’s asked. 

Her eyes sparkled with a calculating glint as she put on her innocent act. “Logan, didn’t you say your grandpa would only leave the Quinn Group to you?” 

Logan froze for a moment and then looked at me, saying, “I’m my father’s only son. Who else is gonna inherit the Quinn Group besides me?” 

I locked my gaze on Logan. Maybe he forgot to bring his brain back from abroad. 

He looked like a total cretin. 

The butler, visibly flustered, wiped his sweat on his forehead. “Mr. Quinn, what are you even saying? Mrs. Quinn married Julian, and now Julian is the CEO of the Quinn Group. Did you forget? He’s your cousin.” ",1,1761379153.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

The butler quickly cut in, “Mr. Quinn, you really shouldn’t say that. She’s the wife of the Quinn Group’s CEO.” 

“The wife of the Quinn Group’s CEO?” Yohana’s asked. 

Her eyes sparkled with a calculating glint as she put on her innocent act. “Logan, didn’t you say your grandpa would only leave the Quinn Group to you?” 

Logan froze for a moment and then looked at me, saying, “I’m my father’s only son. Who else is gonna inherit the Quinn Group besides me?” 

I locked my gaze on Logan. Maybe he forgot to bring his brain back from abroad. 

He looked like a total cretin. 

The butler, visibly flustered, wiped his sweat on his forehead. “Mr. Quinn, what are you even saying? Mrs. Quinn married Julian, and now Julian is the CEO of the Quinn Group. Did you forget? He’s your cousin.” ",1,1761379146.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I’ve built teams, failed gracefully, led responsibly, and learned that stability is not the absence of chaos — it’s the ability to hold space for it.

What I offer isn’t a fairytale or a fling disguised as depth. It’s presence, mentorship, and partnership — the kind that makes room for both ambition and softness. I’ve been the guy people call when they’re stuck on career crossroads, mental burnout, or startup dilemmas, and I’ve found meaning in being the calm in other people’s storms.

I’m deeply feminist — not as a label, but as a lens. I want a partner who believes in shared growth, equal agency, and conversations that challenge both of us. Someone curious, grounded, emotionally literate, and confident in her contradictions — who can talk strategy one moment and stare at the stars the next.

I find joy in teaching, long drives at dusk, a clean room after chaos, and building things that last. I don’t mind being the stable one; I just hope you value it too.

What we can do: walk through a flea market, brainstorm your next idea over coffee, or simply talk about what ""balance"" means to you. I won’t rush connection — but I’ll respect your time and energy like they’re gold.

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
Let’s start with the numbers. Girona is the bookmakers’ darling, with a win odds of **1.8**, translating to an implied probability of **55.5%**. That’s like a coffee addict’s chance of surviving the day without caffeine—unlikely but not impossible. Oviedo, meanwhile, is priced at **4.8 to 5.1**, implying a **20.8% to 21.2%** chance. If you’re betting on Oviedo, you might as well try to predict when your boss will finally notice you’ve been working from bed. The draw sits at **3.4 to 3.58**, or roughly **27.9% to 28.6%**—a middle ground where hope and despair collide.

**Digesting the News: Phoenix Rising vs. Promotion Regret**  
Girona’s story is one of redemption. After a *glorious collapse* last season—finishing just one point above Leganés in a heart-stopping relegation battle—they’ve shown signs of life this term. A 2-1 win over Valencia? Check. Draws against Celta Vigo and Athletic Bilbao? Check. Even their loss to Barcelona was a valiant effort, surviving an early goal and a late *Araújo* dagger. New signing **Vanat(a)** (depending on which article you read) has added some sparkle to their attack, like a new app that finally works on the first try.

Oviedo, however, is the sports equivalent of a “limited-time offer” that expires in 10 minutes. Promoted in 2024 via a playoff final *loss*, they’ve since managed just two wins (against Real Sociedad and Valencia—teams not exactly known for handing out participation trophies). Their current form? A relegation-zone slump that’s making their 2024 playoff run feel like a mirage. A 0-2 defeat to Levante? A 1-2 drubbing by Espanyol? Oviedo’s season read

1oflpbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1oflpbr/finally_meeting_her_longterm_lover_who_she_might/,Finally meeting her long-term lover who she might have feelings for,"My gf and I have been in an open relationship for years. I have a strong cuckold fetish so I almost never go on dates while my gf has regular solo dates. After her initial excitement phase where she went out with lots of different guys she eventually calmed down and has started seeing one guy regularly. They've known each other for years and this year started seeing each other more regularly, about twice a month. They also started spending nights with each other. Because of the regular dates he also has ""figured her body out"" (her words) and makes her cum many times during their dates to the point of her squirting and crying from the intensity.

I've never met the guy and always felt there was some sort of reluctance (especially from him) to introduce us. I felt like this is getting more serious. My gf is speaking more and more about him and has suggested even inviting him to social events like her birthday party. Additionally she has emphasized in the past that she thinks that she thinks she ""could do poly"" but I've always excluded that possibility for us. So I've voiced my concerns and feelings with her and told her that I would need to get to know the guy going forward before I could consent to any more dates. My girlfriend was very understanding and we scheduled a meeting between the three of us this Friday. I was nervous because I was somewhat worried that my concerns would be verified.

Before Friday my girlfriend and I had also some great talks. We discussed a lot of our feelings and triggers on the matter and actually figured out some new things. First of all my triggers, the reason why I've excluded poly as an option, are the fear of feeling left out and not feeling like a priority. A new relationship would obviously come with new rights (take privacy for example, a partner could change their mind on his consent to my gf telling me everything about their dates) and we would have to address our couple privileges to give a healthy room to the new relationship. Such things I'm simply unable to do. Poly is just not for me. Interestingly during our talk my girlfriend told me that she wasn't willing to do that either. In her words ""fuck no, we're way to close, there is no way we could fit another relationship into our lives, I wouldn't want that at all"". Turns out what she meant when she said she ""could do poly"" she meant feeling love for multiple people but not having multiple relationships.

Once we figured out that distinction, that feeling don't necessarily are synonymous with a relationship, a lot of concerns and triggers resolved themselves. The ""worst case"" moved from my girlfriend having an additional relationship to my girlfriend feeling additional love in her heart. The issue moved from something that affects our relationship to something that affects her. Still it's a complicated issue, the potential heartbreak that is inevitable when feelings are involved, especially when a relationship is not on the table (let's say it's not acceptable for him to fall in love but not be ""together"") but it got significantly less triggering for me. 

During our talk my girlfriend also had told me that she felt like that while feeling we're possible with this particular lover she had not let herself get close enough for that. They mutually had maintained a ""wall"" to not reach such a point. She told me for example, that their conversations outside of sex were always very casual and didn't involve ""deep"" topics. While she felt like she could love that wall if I gave concent, she also wasn't sure if that was something he even wanted.

So after all these conversations I went with way less worries into our meet up on Friday. We had invited him over for coffee in the early afternoon and also had prepared everything for a dinner together later. He was very polite towards me. He wasn't my type attraction wise but I could still see why my girlfriend liked him. At first he was nervous, acting a bit stiff towards me and my girlfriend but slowly warmed up as time went on. (Naturally, so many cuckold couples are so toxic... I would have been nervous too.) He had been to our place many times before and moved around the flat naturally. 

We all sat down on our couch and my girlfriend sat down next to him. We had talked about that before. She would naturally give him way more attention than me, so I could witness their energy. He did look over worried when she did that as if he was afraid of offending me but I think he eventually realised that I wasn't the kind of cuck that got into a weird competitive behaviour upon meeting the bull/lover. We talked and talked and talked. I feel like he also needed to hear a lot of things out of my mouth. Being reassured that I was really okay and happy with him and my girlfriend sleeping with each other and it wasn't stemming from some sort of toxic power dynamic. I knew from my girlfriend that he had made some bad experiences in that regard and therefore gave him lots of reassurance and ""approval"".

With him getting more comfortable he also got noticeably more affectionate towards my girlfriend. It started with them holding hands and eventually she cuddled up to him and he had his arms around her. When I came back from the toilet they were making out. At first he looked guilty and even apologized but I just laughed and told him ""What for? You're her lover."" I guess he was kind of encouraged by that and they made out some more. It seemed to have been some sort of ice breaker for both of them because afterwards their affection towards each other skyrocketed.

I noticed that my girlfriends eyes were practically glued to his his lips. Nodding to everything he said. She seemed more submissive. At the same time he got more confident. Still polite and kind but his body language was much more dominant towards my girlfriend. The way he held her, kissed her from time to time, his hand resting on her ass. It started to show that these two people had been sharing a lot of intimate moments together.

We had a really nice dinner. During the evening I could notice many moments of intimacy between them. Him kissing her neck while she was pouring wine in the kitchen, her resting her head in his lap on the couch, them laughing about jokes in sync. The energy between them was very obvious. However during the entire time I didn't feel left out or uncomfortable. Possibly because of the conversations my girlfriend and I had before but I never felt triggered or worried. Not during the evening or now having slept over it.

We didn't talk with him about the whole feelings thing as my girlfriend and I had agreed that would be way too soon on his first time meeting me. She would have that conversation with him in private. What we did talk about was logistics. Generally they wanted the frequency of their dates to increase (to about once a week) as well as the three of us to hang out more. I think he had a way different idea of me and the relationship between my gf and me before and felt really relieved now. Him and I also realised that we had very similar interests and could talk for hours.

After he left my girlfriend and I had an hours long debrief where she made sure I felt alright and asked how I would want her to behave in the future. I told her she could discuss lowering the emotional ""wall"" she had with him (I realised during the meet up that it really wasn't a sturdy wall. More like a line in the sand than a wall...) and if he was okay with this kind of arrangement she could carefully and slowly give it at try. He had talked about his current/ideal relationships during dinner and he labeled it ""relationship anarchy"" himself. Without knowing to much about that, it somewhat sounded very closely to the kind of arrangement we were thinking about so we were carefully optimistic. My girlfriend tried really hard to not show too much enthusiasm but knowing her for such a long time it was obvious that she was ready to fall deeply in love with this guy. I feel like she has already a little but it didn't bother me anymore.

Funny, I asked to meet him, fearing I might sense feelings between the two and went out of the meet up consenting and encouraging exactly that...

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of footballing proportions: the No. 2 Indiana Hoosiers (7-0) vs. the UCLA Bruins (3-4). This isn’t just a game—it’s a math problem, a Greek tragedy, and a circus all rolled into one. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the flair of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffee shots.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Indiana’s Line Looks Like a Tax Audit

Indiana is favored by **25.5 points** (-5000 moneyline), a spread so lopsided it makes a one-legged man look balanced. To put that in perspective, the implied probability of UCLA winning is roughly **6.25%** (thanks to that +1500 line). That’s statistically less likely than me finally learning how to parallel park.

The Hoosiers’ offense is a well-oiled machine: **43.9 points per game** (4th in FBS), **226 rushing yards per game** (1st), and Fernando Mendoza, who’s throwing touchdowns like confetti at a parade (21 TDs, 73.5% completion rate). Their defense? A fortress against the run (85 rushing yards allowed per game, 7th-best) but a slightly leaky umbrella against the pass.

UCLA, meanwhile, is the football equivalent of a slow-moving toaster. Their offense ranks **90th in total yards** (364.6 YPG), and their defense allows **364.9 yards per game**—a statistical mirroring so perfect, it’s like they copied homework. Their QB, Nico Iamaleava, is a dual-threat (10 TDs passing, 4 rushing), but even a circus elephant could probably outgain UCLA’s offense.

---

### Digest the News: Bruin Up, Hoosier Down

UCLA’s recent 3-game winning streak is as sustainable as a house of cards in a hurricane. Their “upset” over Penn State? A 24.5-point underdog win that required the Nittany Lions to fumble like a toddler with a Rubik’s Cube. Credit to the Bruins—they’ve clawed out wins, but their schedule has been softer than a down comforter.

Indiana, meanwhile, is riding a **13-game home winning streak**

1ofljqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1ofljqg/celiac_and_gastritis/,Celiac and Gastritis,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here.

I guess I will ask my questions first then get into a little bit of my history.

My first question is how long after you stopped consuming gluten did your symptoms improve? If you also have gastritis, did it improve as well and how quickly?

I’ve have been dealing with gastritis for a little over 7 years (yes I know that’s a long time) after being diagnosed with an h pylori infection through a blood test. I have most of the symptoms of gastritis: burning stomach, tightness, full feeling with little food, dull pain when I wake up etc. Sometimes I get nauseous but it’s rare for me.I also cannot touch coffee, tea, or anything spicy without getting a bad flair that can last for days or even a week. Gastritis is literally a living hell and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone!

With a little bit of my history in mind, I’m beginning to suspect I may have gluten issues that could be connected to my stomach and why I have been dealing with gastritis for so long other than the h pylori issue. From time to time I get itchy rashes on my left elbow, my upper shins, and now I have a new one in my groin area. I’m also partially starting a rash on my other elbow. I’ve read that celiacs get rashes in these areas when they have consumed or come into contact with gluten. I’ve also read that celiacs can have gastritis as well which is why with my symptoms I’m starting to connect the two.

I currently am hunting for a GI in my area, but I’m tempted to stop or severely cut down on any gluten I consume to see if my symptoms improve, mainly my upper stomach issues. I figured why not since it may be awhile before I can see a doc as I also don’t have health insurance to immediately go see one. This would be easy for me to do as well because I have a fairly healthy diet thanks to the stomach issue and do not eat out at all and haven’t for years.

Again, I just wanted to ask those questions and get some other peoples’ experiences, and of course I’m not looking for any kind of diagnosis. Just trying to ease my mind a little bit.",2,1761377772.0,Celiac,1,1.0,False

Then saying, I will let you know the details on Friday (yesterday) and then, you probably guessed it, nothing. People just casually cancel appointments, don't reply anymore. I am just sad about it, I was looking forward to having a nice meetup today. I will make other plans for sure, but sometimes I am just so tired of always having to do that I guess, being dependent on people like this for my social life (being single living alone), people cancelling last minute on me and not to be careful or respectful of my time like I try to be with theirs.

With me it's: when I tell you I will show up, I show up. When I tell you I want to see you, I do, and I make an effort to actually do. When I say I will call you, I do, and if on the rare occasion I can't suddenly, I will let you know or at least apologise afterwards. But I feel I will never get over all the people who aren't like that - and sometimes I feel I'm an exception? Well that's irrational because I do have friends who are similar, and with who I never have to doubt. I guess it's been happening a lot lately again, hence the frustration this weekend.

Do any of you have advice on dealing with this? At least I've learnt not to chase them, or let my own plans depend on their presence, so I will plan something fun today just by myself, but still.",6,1761377698.0,AskWomenOver40,5,1.0,False

Hi everyone, I started this space because I couldn’t find a community that spoke honestly about what it’s like to grow older and stay active in real life.

Not in the “run a marathon at 70” sense (unless that’s your thing), but in the small, practical ways we keep ourselves moving, thinking, and connected — especially once life gets fuller and bodies get louder.

🌿 Why We’re Here

This isn’t a company page or a programme.
It’s a community for anyone 40+ who’s figuring out how to age well, body, mind, and attitude.

Here we focus on micro-actions — small shifts that add up:

Taking the stairs after lunch
Swapping the doom scroll for a two-minute stretch
Eating protein before coffee
Remembering to breathe before reacting

Each of those tiny things counts more than we realise.

💬 What You Can Expect

Info and threads to keep things easy and real on strength, flexibility, balance, nutrition and anything that helps us to age better.

Share your own reflections anytime, stories, tips, questions, or even memes that make you smile about this whole process.

Have a read of the rules to make this a good community.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

**Steps:**
* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link (**[here](https://app.costa.co.uk/PsbT/t3v6u7lz)**).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

Al Zahia Sharjah has become one of the [most sought-after residential destinations in the UAE](https://keyspacerealty.com/real-estate/al-zahia-sharjah-community/), where modern architecture and comfortable living come together in perfect harmony. Developed by Majid Al Futtaim, this master-planned community redefines the concept of modern living by combining sophistication, convenience, and a strong sense of belonging. Every corner of Al Zahia Sharjah is designed to make daily life effortless, with green parks, wide walkways, and a mix of retail and leisure spaces that keep residents connected and inspired. More than just a housing development, Al Zahia Sharjah is a vibrant neighborhood built around people, families, and the simple joy of feeling at home.

**A Family-Oriented Lifestyle Hub**

What truly sets Al Zahia Sharjah apart from other communities is its focus on family and connection. The Al Zahia community Sharjah has been carefully designed to promote togetherness, with lush green spaces, shaded walkways, and gathering areas that encourage residents to spend time outdoors. Families can enjoy weekend picnics under the trees, children can safely play in one of the many parks, and neighbors often meet during community events that bring everyone closer. The entire area feels peaceful and welcoming, which is why many families choose to make Al Zahia their long-term home.

Daily life in Al Zahia Sharjah is made easier by its thoughtful layout. Educational institutions, supermarkets, and medical centers are all nearby, ensuring that essential services are always within reach. One of the biggest advantages of living here is the proximity to City Centre Al Zahia, one of Sharjah’s premier retail and entertainment destinations. Residents can easily spend the afternoon shopping, enjoy dinner at a family-friendly restaurant, or watch a movie without having to travel far. This seamless blend of practicality and leisure creates a lifestyle that’s both relaxing and dynamic.

**Types of Properties in Al Zahia**

Al Zahia Sharjah offers a diverse selection of properties designed to meet different needs and preferences. The community features everything from stylish apartments to spacious townhouses and luxurious villas. Each home has been built with modern architecture, high-quality finishes, and layouts that maximize natural light. Whether you’re a young professional looking for a comfortable apartment or a family wanting extra space, the Al Zahia community Sharjah has something for everyone.

For those looking for luxury and privacy, a villa for sale in Al Zahia Sharjah is an ideal choice. These villas are known for their generous layouts, elegant interiors, and outdoor spaces such as gardens and terraces. Many of them include private pools, allowing residents to unwind in a serene setting after a long day. The design focuses on open-plan living areas that create a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor spaces. A villa for sale in Al Zahia Sharjah isn’t just about owning property, it’s about embracing a lifestyle built around comfort, elegance, and quality.

Apartments in Al Zahia Sharjah are equally appealing. They are modern, efficient, and perfect for those who value convenience and style. Many apartment buildings overlook green parks or landscaped courtyards, offering residents a calming view and a refreshing atmosphere. The interiors are sleek yet warm, with open kitchens, large windows, and functional layouts that make the most of every square meter. For young couples or professionals, these apartments strike the right balance between affordability and modern living.

For larger families, a villa for sale in Al Zahia Sharjah provides the perfect combination of space, comfort, and community. With multiple bedrooms, expansive living areas, and eco-friendly features, these homes are designed to accommodate long-term living. Many villas are equipped with smart home systems and energy-saving technologies, reflecting Sharjah’s commitment to sustainable development. This thoughtful approach to design ensures that residents can enjoy modern comforts while minimizing their environmental footprint.

**Amenities and Accessibility**

Al Zahia Sharjah is renowned for its exceptional amenities that enhance everyday life. The community includes swimming pools, fitness centers, jogging tracks, and dedicated leisure zones for both adults and children. The Clubhouse serves as a social hub where residents can work out, relax, or catch up with friends over coffee. Parks and open-air areas scattered throughout the neighborhood offer peaceful spots to unwind or enjoy a morning walk. These shared spaces encourage a sense of belonging and make it easy for residents to connect with one another.

Accessibility is another major strength of the Al Zahia community Sharjah. Conveniently located near Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, the community provides quick connections to Dubai, Ajman, and other parts of Sharjah. The Sharjah International Airport and University City are just a short drive away, making it a prime location for professionals, students, and frequent travelers. Whether you’re heading to work, school, or a weekend getaway, the central position of Al Zahia ensures smooth and stress-free commutes.

For those who plan to settle down long-term, owning a villa for sale in Al Zahia Sharjah offers the ideal combination of luxury, location, and lifestyle. You can enjoy the benefits of living in a well-connected neighborhood while maintaining the tranquility of a private home. The careful balance between urban convenience and residential peace makes Al Zahia Sharjah one of the top choices for families across the UAE.

**Why Al Zahia Stands Out**

What makes Al Zahia Sharjah truly special is its ability to create a living environment that feels both contemporary and personal. The architecture is modern yet timeless, the amenities are world-class, and the community spirit is genuine. Whether you’re drawn to the scenic parks, the vibrant retail scene, or the safe, family-oriented atmosphere, the Al Zahia community Sharjah offers something that resonates with every resident. It’s a place where modern living meets everyday comfort, creating a lifestyle that feels both luxurious and natural.

I got hella mad. Everyone kept saying it wasn’t a big deal, she didn't mean it, and that I should just go home, change, and it’d be fine.

Then one time, my friend spilled coffee on another classmate, and she didn’t even react the way I did, she just laughed it off and said she’d change when she got home.
At that moment, I thought I was a bad person and she was the good one.
But years later, I realized I wasn’t actually the bad one, I was valid. When that juice got spilled on me, I still had to commute home with everyone staring at my dirty, sticky uniform. I had to ride two jeepneys and one bus for almost two hours in traffic. And when I finally got home, my mom scolded me for “spilling” juice on my uniform because it meant extra effort for her to wash it.
Meanwhile, the other girl who got coffee on her uniform didn’t have to commute because her family had a car. And I’m guessing washing her clothes was as easy as tossing them in a washing machine.

Now I realize it’s easy to be kind when you’re privileged. It’s harder when you’re not.

# I  have always been a lover of knowledge and wisdom. I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* Mathematics - I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* Programming - I love participating in programming contests
* Chess - I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* Reading - I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* Sports Trivia - The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

There are various other topics I am interested in - even if I am not an expert in them like psychology, history, international affairs and so on.

Mediums I like to keep track of information from

* Podcasts - I do love listening to podcasts. I recently heard a podcast about the differences between natural an lab made diamonds and learnt about the economics of the jewellery industry. I listen to podcasts about science outreach, international affairs an a few fictional ones too in my native language.
* Books
* Blogs - I follow some blogs like Quanta
* Magazines - I have subscriptions to MIT Technology Review, Wired and New in Chess. I also follow some free magazines like IEEE Spectrum and Resonance.
* Reddit - I try to curate my feed to get new bits of information now and then. I have found out about things as esoteric as a world coffee championship through Reddit.

I love organising things I learn in notes in beautiful ways. I maintain notes about it - though I am not always regular in updating it. I would love to know about different systems other people have and learn more.

I am a FTM to our wonderful 9 week old son. I had to undergo an emergency c-section, we came close to losing our baby, I later developed c-section incision dehiscence and a superimposed infection at 8 weeks pp so have been on reduced lifting once again. I am also on medication for PPA. I'm hoping someone could provide either advice or reassurance around how much I am able to do for my son currently.

A summary of relevant circumstances are:
- My lovely husband is a doctor and works quite far away so I am effectively a single parent most days of the week. He helps with meal prep and housework when he's at home and helps with son as much as he is able to.
- We live rurally. There is private farmyard around us so there is nowhere to walk outside safely apart from our small garden. (country road is dangerous, no reliable or close by buses and I do not drive). I should add where we live is cold and often raining/generally unpleasant want-to-stay-inside-and-cozy weather
- There are no local shops, cafés, libraries or mum and baby groups that I can access.
- I have a couple of friends, but they all live either abroad or a 5/6 hour drive away so I do not have much social contact. We don't have contact with any neighbours 
-  My family all live abroad and for a number of reasons cannot visit more than once/twice a year. They haven't met baby yet. Husband's family is not in the picture for unrelated reasons. 

My days currently look a little like this:
~05:30 wake up with baby, cuddle, breastfeed, diaper change, tummy time on my chest, chit chat and look at colourful mobiles, chew on teething toys, practice holding/swatting at a toy or two, look at a rattle.
~06:40 bounce baby off for a nap on yoga ball. We contact nap for every one of his daytime naps as he sleeps better this way and I can savour him and keep him warm
~ for the rest of the day until 18:00 bedtime we repeat as per morning routine with naps roughly every 1.5 hours +/- some singing, occasional swaying together, laying on my legs and talking, maybe 5-10mins/ day of time on a playgym mat, 5-10mins in a bouncer while mum makes coffee and chomps down some spaghetti bolognese, look at a contrast book, do some tummy/leg/arm exercises, occasional massage or a bath. Mostly we spend the day in our bedroom as it's the warmest room, but I make an effort to open curtains/light during wake windows and dim the room for nap time, show him different areas of our home. He doesn't really tolerate watching me do house tasks or being baby worn while I attempt these so I don't generally do any housework or shower on days that dad's at work.

I pretty much have never left his side, make an effort to narrate the day, follow his cues. My worry is he is not getting enough from me and may feel the effects of a lack of social interaction / variety in his days fairly soon as I am the only person he sees 90% of the time. 

On dads days off we try to go for walks in nearby towns, the beach, forest, maybe accompany dad for a quick food shop, but all these outings are fairly short and we still mostly end up spending those days inside.  We've probably only been out about 8 times, including doctors visits. It is not so much of a problem for me because I'm very introverted, but I worry I am letting my son down. 

P.s. we have looked into moving, but money is tight and we rent with pets so it is difficult to find a suitable property. 

Any advice or reassurance would be so appreciated, thank you.

Merges them

I am single with two dependents (4yo cat and a 3yo NFT) have saved $17k and have an income of $48k in a fully WFH role, full time with 25 hours a week.

I’m looking to buy a freestanding house on a decent sized block, doesn’t have to be massive but at least enough to have the option to sub divide later.

I’m happy to look anywhere but it just can’t be outside of the eastern suburbs for personal reasons. And by that I mean Woollahra or Waverley LGAs, south of there isn’t really an option for me. If the right place came up I could potentially look at Randwick LGA (Clovelly or Coogee only), as I know I have to start somewhere.

Based on recent sold data and online calculators, I’m starting to lose hope

I really don’t want to have to buy an apartment as I know I won’t get as much capital growth. I want to make sure I’m buying something that will go up in value more than the market on average as well, I want to make sure I’m making a smart financial decision to set up my future.

I feel like the system is failing me. All the old people bought houses decades ago and now they cost more. I still can’t understand how we let this happen and worse, we let it continue? It makes me physically sick. But anyway…

The only other option I can see would be looking for a different job to increase my income but this would likely require going into an office which obviously I refuse to do. 

I have circumstances that make this impossible anyway. My cat has autism and I have an ongoing coffee/beach/yoga commitment between 10am and 3pm every weekday. I’m only able to maintain this as it perfectly matches my current role’s work hours (also 10am to 3pm mon-fri). If I lost the support I receive there, my mental health would definitely suffer. I really worry I would be at risk of becoming sad or even tired.

I’m also really uncomfortable becoming a debt slave for 30 years, it just seems like such a stupid thing to do, such an obvious trap the banks and John Howard set for us. So I want to avoid that.

1ofl22k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1ofl22k/the_girl_i_like_is_dating_another_guy_but_she_is/,"The girl I like is dating another guy , but she is not trying to distance herself from me instead she is getting me more attached.","So there’s this girl I really, really like. We have good chemistry .... same humor, same energy, same vibe. I met her in my college and we sit next to each other during lectures.

Now, she started dating another guy (its been like a month and a half) . That obviously hurt like hell, but I’ve been trying to stay chill and keep things normal. The thing is ,she’s *still* just as friendly and close with me as she was before. We talk in class, we sit next to each other, and it all feels so natural… almost too natural considering the situation.

Here’s where it really messes with my head , Yesterday I had a conversation with A mutual friend , and she told me that she knows I like her. Apparently, everyone knows it’s that obvious. And according to that same friend, she said that I give her “friend vibes only.”

But if that’s true, why the hell is she still acting like this?  
We even text a lot a few nights ago, we were chatting on Instagram until 1 a.m., laughing so much that her mom literally woke up. Like… what girl who’s already dating someone does that with a guy she knows likes her?  
The other day she came alone to take coffee with me while my other friends refused to come with me. (of our group) , okay maybe she did this because she just wanted to be a ""nice"" friend, but if she knows I like her then is'nt it weird to come alone with me for getting coffee.

Well, until yesterday, I believed she didn’t know I liked her ,cause the way she acts around me is too normal. I am not saying she should not be normal but if she has a dude, why does she talk so much with me too , its reciprocated , we bond so much in class that people had started to take notice and rumors were spreading. The mutual friend also told me that she got a call from one of the guys from our class , who just called her to ask whats going on between me and the girl I like and thats just one incident. Another girl from our class asked a friend of mine if something is going on between me and the girl I like.  
This all has happened WHEN she has been dating.

It’s confusing as hell. She’s not giving me “back off” or “I’m not interested” energy. She’s just being super chill, like nothing’s changed and I don’t know what to make of it anymore.

To make things worse, I can’t even avoid her, because we sit next to each other , and that's become ""my spot"" and changing my place suddenly would be weird not only for her but the whole class is going to start questioning why I randomly changed my place.

I’m not trying to accuse her of anything, maybe she’s just being nice. But I can’t tell if she’s being clueless or if she actually enjoys the attention.  
Has anyone been through something like this?  
Why would she act so normal if she knows I like her and already has a boyfriend?  
And how the hell do I protect my peace while still having to see and talk to her every day?

And I missed a key detail  
she is the girl who helped me get over the girl I was obsessed with for 6 years(my bestfriend) . I just liked my best friend but I never loved her , It took me 6 years cause I couldnt find a girl , who I could really connect to, someone who matches my energy , my humor. Until I found this girl, and I actually love this girl , talking with her makes me happy . Her smile gives me comfort , laughing with her is like my drugs man, the feeling it gives.... (it all sounds cringey but I never felt all this when I liked my best friend for 6 years , and she dated quite a few times , and I was never jealous , never , but watching this girl with another guy , its killing me from the inside.

TL;DR:

I’m in college and really like this girl I have amazing chemistry with. She’s been dating another guy for about a month and a half, but still acts super close to me, we talk a lot, sit together, even chat late at night. A mutual friend told me she *knows* I like her and only sees me as a friend, but her behavior doesn’t match that. It’s confusing as hell, and seeing her with her boyfriend while she’s still this close to me is eating me alive. I don’t know if she’s being nice, clueless, or actually enjoys the attention, but I’m stuck seeing her every day and don’t know how to protect my peace anymore.",1,1761375852.0,TeenIndia,6,1.0,False

TW: mentions of self harm, sex, and possible addiction. (I'm not looking for advice in regards to his mental health, I'm just asking overall how I should behave as a partner when this is all that has been going on.)

I should start by mentioning that I have no intention of leaving him- I am willing to put in extra work, I just don't know what to do and it's weighing on me really heavily. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and I love him so much. He's my first and only serious relationship and things have been really good... for the most part. 

The first two years of our relationship were fantastic! We argued a bit towards the beginning but quickly got over that and fell into a really good rhythm. We started dating freshman year of college, but junior year things got really strange. I got very busy with my major and it was very stressful to me, so my interest in sex decreased and I wanted to shower alone to destress and have a bit of me time at the end of the day after being out from 8am to 10pm. Meanwhile I noticed he was a bit down but didn't think anything of it. 

Finally, as things had cleared up, I offered up sex and after I noticed he had some self harm scars on him that he had been hiding. When I initially asked what it was in shock, he lied to me, but I knew he was lying and called him out on it. I was so confused and felt like it was my fault. 

I told him he needed to see a therapist and he did, where he was diagnosed with bpd. 

The rest of junior year was fine, and senior year came into effect. 

Ever since being told he has bpd, he's been having very clear high's and lows that he didnt have before. We had a trip that we had planned I was really looking forward to, but he was in a low the entire trip, and even though I tried to cheer him up and bring up the mood, it sort of ruined the trip. He later self harmed again in a different way while we were on the trip. I was devastated and again blamed myself for letting this happen. I told him that I felt like I didn't know who he was anymore, that he was so different from who I started dating and that I was scared that I was going to loose him. He apologized and promised he would try and have things get better.

They did get better again, for a little bit, but there is another thing. He notoriously overdoes substances... will get too drunk and throw up every time he drinks, or gets too high and throws up, etc. He's never mean to me or anything, I just worry about him. When he turned 21 this year it just got worse. He just overdoes it so often and will do things like drinking an entire bottle of wine in one sitting. Maybe I'm a prude because I don't like drinking, but it makes me really worried. 

He then came home one day and told me he bought a vape- which he knows I have an issue with him smoking cigarettes (because my mom is a smoker as well). I don't have an issue with him vaping. He lost his drivers license though and said he lost it at a coffee shop- I had believed him because he had got me a coffee that day.

She woke up on an ancient building in the center of the city
The brush felt sorry for not changing her hair
The make up set on the counter, helpless in trying to cover up her heartbeats of disgust 
And the pop up of love that nurtures her voice,
which haunts the waitress when the coffee comes cold.
The pop up that portraits her evil as charming to man in distress 
Cause its not disrespectful if its opened enough to fit all that comes her way.
The pop up that slips in a higher tone while painting his face,
Covered in her wishes he now looks like someone else. 
In touches of skin, she convinces herself that on the sharp of the night the air doesn’t feel empty,
Yet it doesn’t linger the movement of an endless dance
As it does for us who stare at the ceiling wondering if their thoughts will manifest 
But those other faces that are scared of getting wrinkles at fifteen and drink green tea cause its darker to eat will never understand the fever dream of falling for the .untouchable. They ll never have the grip. The challenge. The begging for a change. The curse of being conflicted but never empty.

1ofkqmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ofkqmq/my_little_brother_16m_is_morbidly_obese_and_i/,My little brother (16m) is morbidly obese and I don’t know what to do about it.,"Pretty much the title. I’m one of six kids and everyone in my family is of a relatively healthy weight aside from the youngest. My brother (16m) has always been a little chubby as a kid but we all went through a chubby kid phase so it never seemed concerning. He was always a great eater, never picky with anything and always finished his plate including veggies. 

Growing up we had a good relationship with food. Everyone got to eat their fill of healthy balanced meals but we also got the occasional pizza and junky snack. My parents never forced us to finish food as we could always save it to eat later. 

About five years ago we started to notice that he was rapidly gaining weight, which was strange because he wasn’t eating anymore than before. Turns out he was sneaking food from the kitchen at night. I caught him drinking coffee creamer straight from the bottle and my parents and him had a discussion about it. They took him to a doctor who said he’d probably grow out of it because he was only 11 so he still had a lot of time to grow. 

Fast forward to now, I have adhd and my medicine makes me forget to eat so I frequently weigh myself to make sure I am eating enough to maintain my weight because counting calories stresses me out. While I was weighing myself the other day he came into the room to ask how much I weighed, I told him and he said he wanted a turn with the scale. He is 5’9” and weighed in at 278lbs, which is morbidly obese on the bmi scale. 

I found this concerning because the last time he had weighed himself with me was a few months ago and he was around 255, meaning in the last 2-3 months he gained around 23lbs. He doesn’t see a problem with his weight and likes being a big guy but my family already has a history of diabetes and obesity would make him more likely to develop it. My uncle is also obese and he was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in his 20s and full blown diabetes in his 30s. 

My parents and I spoke with him about this and he said he wants to go to the gym and get really buff, which he has started doing but not consistently. The major problem is that he eats like crazy. He eats multiple dinners and then DoorDash food at 11pm when he thinks we are all asleep and hides the bags in the outdoor can. 

I brought this up with my boyfriend who is also a bigger guy at 5’10” 210lbs and he suggested that my family must have somehow given my brother an eating disorder growing up. I was shocked to hear this as I didn’t think we ever portrayed food negatively to my brother. 

I’m worried about my brother but I don’t know if I’m overthinking it because he still has a lot of growing to do in the next few years but it seems unlikely he’ll grow out of it. 

How do I approach this topic with him without sounding like I’m attacking him? Is it possible he developed an eating disorder as a young child? How would we go about getting him help for something like that? Any advice is appreciated.",1,1761374679.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1ofkq1b,https://i.redd.it/51i5knh1f7xf1.jpeg,[Geek Alert] Comandante C40 vs 1Zpresso K-Ultra,"I’ve been using both the Comandante C40 and the 1Zpresso K-Ultra for a while now. Both are excellent hand grinders with their own strengths, and the difference isn’t about which one is “better,” but about what kind of cup each one produces.

⸻

Build and Ergonomics

Both grinders are built to last but have different design philosophies.

	•	K-Ultra:
It’s a precision tool. The aluminum body feels solid, the bearings are smooth, and the top adjustment dial is easy to use. Switching between grind sizes is fast and accurate. The handle locks firmly in place and the wooden knob fits naturally in hand. The wide body gives a secure grip even during longer grinding sessions. 1Zpresso rates the burr set for around 1,000 kg of coffee, which is a lot for home use, but it’s still a defined lifespan.

	•	C40:
The Comandante feels like an artisanal piece of engineering. The wooden veneer adds warmth, and the stainless-steel core gives it weight and durability. The bottom adjustment system is simple once you get used to it, though less convenient if you switch brews often. The click feedback is crisp but one needs to remember the count of clicks after every use. So if you have a fish memory then you might need to make notes like Ghajini lmao. That said, there’s no stated wear limit, and in real use, the C40’s burrs will outlast most users by a wide margin. 

⸻

Workflow and Usability

If you care about workflow, this is where they diverge.

	•	C40:
The grind speed is slower, but the torque feels much more consistent. Even with dense, light-roasted beans, the handle turns smoothly without needing much force. It doesn’t fight back the way some high-torque grinders do. The motion feels balanced from start to finish, and that stability makes longer grinding sessions comfortable. Static is minimal, and retention is very low. The bottom-adjust dial isn’t ideal for frequent grind changes, but once set, it stays predictable and accurate.

	•	K-Ultra:
The Ultra grinds faster, but it demands more torque when crushing dense beans. You feel a pulse of resistance at the start of each rotation, especially on light roasts. Once you get going, it’s efficient and quick, but the experience feels more mechanical. Static is minimal, and retention is very low. The top dial adjustment is intuitive and easy to track, which helps if you often switch between recipes or brewing styles.

⸻

Cup Profile and Taste Differences

This is the most noticeable contrast between them.

	•	Comandante C40:
The cups are lighter in body with more sweetness and a gentle, rounded character. Acidity feels softer and integrated rather than sharp. You get a sense of calm clarity. Notes in washed coffees and anaerobics come through cleanly, and texture leans toward silky rather than dense.

	•	1Zpresso K-Ultra:
The cups are brighter and more assertive. Acidity has more presence, and the mouthfeel is richer and heavier. Sweetness takes a small step back compared to the C40, but the flavor feels vivid and full. Some cups show more sparkle and tactile structure, especially with light or fruity naturals.

In short:
	•	C40 = clarity, balance, and sweetness
	•	K-Ultra = brightness, liveliness, and texture

⸻

Coffee Pairings from Real Use

Over time, I’ve noticed certain coffees align naturally with each grinder. Also YMMV. So take this with a grain of salt. 

Coffees that shine with the K-Ultra:

	•	Grey Soul Mogra – floral, aromatic, and benefits from the added liveliness.
	•	Attikan Ultra Light – the K-Ultra brings its acidity forward without making it thin.
	•	Fruit naturals – gain depth and structure; flavors feel more layered.

Coffees that taste better with the C40:

	•	Kapi Kottai Bahar – turns softer and sweeter; the C40 keeps the body balanced.
	•	Rosette Tuensang Peaberry – smoother, more polished cup with calm acidity.
	•	Anaerobics in general – shine on the C40. The K-Ultra tends to make them too sharp for my taste, pushing fermentation notes a bit far forward.

⸻

Grind Character and Consistency

Both grinders are precise but tuned differently.

	•	The C40 uses conical burrs with a narrower edge angle, producing a clean particle distribution and slightly fewer fines. This translates into smoother extraction and more even sweetness.

	•	The K-Ultra burrs lean toward a broader particle spread, giving more tactile depth in the cup. You get a perception of stronger presence, especially in immersion brews like Switch or Clever.

If you mostly brew pour-overs and prefer clarity and tea like brews, you’ll likely gravitate toward the C40. If you brew immersion or hybrid styles(think Hario switch, clever), the K-Ultra offers a thicker, more satisfying mouthfeel.

⸻

Daily Use Impressions
	•	The K-Ultra grinds faster and feels more forgiving with coarser settings. It’s practical for people who brew multiple times a day.
	•	The C40 has slower workflow but feels more stable across brew ratios. It rewards patience and consistent technique.

Both grinders have very low retention and stable alignment. Noise levels are similar in loudness but I much prefer the sound of C40 over K Ultra. It sounds like the rain. 


Both are end-game grinders in their own right.
The C40 feels like listening to a well-recorded acoustic set — clean, intimate, controlled.
The K-Ultra feels like a live jazz performance — bright, energetic, and full of movement.

I keep both because they complement each other. Depending on the coffee, the C40 brings balance while the K-Ultra brings excitement. The difference isn’t dramatic, but once you tune your palate to it, you’ll notice it every single time.

1ofkoa2,https://i.redd.it/l6l0cbcie7xf1.jpeg,First fast going better than expected,"Just started my first fast, was aiming for 16 hours to try it out, felt good an decided to keep going. Been drinking some black coffee and electrolytes and whenever I've experienced some discomfort (light headaches)I've visited the wiki page, especially the electrolytes one, found my symptom and added some extra salt. Headache went away immediately.

I'll end this fast later today since i have a lunch date with my niece. She has some issues with food and I don't want to risk affecting that by not eating when Im with her. (For the future for any extended fasts I would love some advice or insights on how to talk about around other people who may or may not have food issues? I really don't want to risk affecting them in a negative way )

Mainly wanna share in case someone else feels intimidated to start their first fast. For me it really helped starting with a smaller goal that felt attainable. Not feeling fear of failure really helped to get started. Also reading about the different levels and the health benefits is really motivational. I want to lose weight but my end goal in that department is very far away and will probably take months if not over a year to achieve.

1ofkmj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ofkmj8/how_we_conquered_japan_in_the_summer_with_5_kids/,How we conquered Japan in the Summer with 5 kids!,"Prior to our Japan trip I found this subreddit to be extremely informational and I wanted to help contribute to the knowledge. I am married in my early 40s with 5 children ages 18, 16, 12, 9, and 6. We had planned to go to Japan in 2020 but then the pandemic  occurred and life got in the way so we finally decided to make the plunge as our eldest son was graduating high school and this could be our last big family trip with him. Our family is pretty easy going and we have independently traveled to Turkey and Scotland and Belize as a family with our own planning for everything. In preparation for the trip I used [booking.com](http://booking.com) for all our rentals and hotels and I reserved a car through toyota rent-a-car for our time between tokyo and kyoto.



Our simplified itinerary was Tokyo for 3 nights, the 4th day we would pick up rental and drive to matsumoto for one night, 1 night in mountain guesthouse between matsumoto and Takayama , 2 nights in Takayama, 3 nights in Kanazawa, one night in Gifu prefecture (to go to Seki City), then 3 nights in Kyoto with us taking the shinkansen back to Tokyo for our flight back.



The only time we could realistically go was in June and July due to scheduling and I know that is not peak tourist season but we found that there were many benefits to it especially as we got out of the main city centers.  Japan has many good advancements to help deal with the sun such as UV umbrellas and clothing such as the Uniqlo apparel  and affordable sunscreen. We didn't use them but we saw many locals utilizing those u shaped neck coolers that you fill with water and freeze and of course there are electronic hand fans. That and there are always plenty of convenience stores and vending machines to sell cool drinks; of note some of the vending machines sell hot drinks (pay attention to color surrounding the indicated price on the machine) as well so when you think you might be buying an iced coffee and out comes a hot coffee and your wife is left sadly standing with a piping hot coffee on a 97 degree day.



Was the heat intense?  Yes. Was it life ending and completely ruining of a trip?  No.  We had a vehicle with AC and we just planned activities that didn’t require extensive outdoor time while in the big cities.  That and it was an excuse to try more and different drinks and green teas!  I love how in America we have a wall of energy drinks while in Japan you have an entire wall of unsweetened teas from which to choose from.Once we were in the mountains of the Japanese Alps it was considerably cooler and approachable.



Dealing with misconceptions we had about Japan we were told that there was little soap and water or drying in the bathrooms but we did not find this to be the case at all. Pretty much 95% of every bathroom we used had the ability to wash your hands with soap and there was some form of drying either through air dryer or paper towel so no need to bring any sort of hand towel or anything with you; plus you are going to run into tons of souvenir shops that sell cool little handkerchiefs or towels that you will want to purchase anyways. I got a little one of Sumo Wrestlers doing yoga. 



Secondly, there really are no garbage cans for the most part but convenient stores for the most place will have them so we would tend to eat there (make sure you tell attendant you are eating there the tax is slightly higher for purchases made) and throw stuff out there and certain bathrooms will have them as well but we did end up carrying around some plastic baggies for inevitable trash that would accumulate and then would get in the habit of leaving them at hotel trash areas where we stayed or in the houses we rented.



Lastly, there seems to be a pervasive idea that taxis are quite expensive.  Relative cost compared to buses and trains yes but they were still much cheaper than any taxi you have taken in Chicago or New York. We found that most average taxi trips to get somewhere 15 minutes away was around $10 if that gives you an idea. Uber worked just fine using the taxi component. Uber eats also is very affordable and works just fine in Japan as well.



**Travel Tips** 

Bring a coin purse.  You will be using yen coins a lot. Or have something to organize your coins.



Another thing we did was bring a number of small gifts that we could have on hand to thank either our lodgers or any pleasant interactions we had. Since we are from Michigan we brought dried Traverse City Cherries and some gift bags and let me tell you they were a huge hit and all we gave them to were very appreciative and would usually return a small gift in return (as is very customary in Japan). It was so nice to bring  a small amount of joy to others and I think it helped make up for the fact that we were a large group of noisy Americans!



Another cultural tip that is appreciated in Japan is to buy a round of drinks for the wait and kitchen staff. This was always a big hit and usually wasn't more than 20$ USD



Some of the most pleasant surprises for me in Japan was just how sensible things are. It was very easy to download the suica app and load it through Apple pay to pay for public transportation and vending purchases. We had to deal with 6 suica cards because of all the kids but otherwise it was pretty straightforward.  Parking in Japan was very easy even in big cities and was usually quite affordable. In japan most parking lots or structures either take a photo of your license which you enter at the kiosk to pay for the allotted time or whichever spot you park in senses your car and raises a little barrier.  To leave you enter your spot number, pay for the allotted time, then drive off within 3 minutes.  Super easy.  



**Renting a car** was extremely easy as we rented a car through Toyota Rent-A-Car and it was a seamless process.  The vehicles come all set up with a credit card that records highway tolls and you will pay for at the end of the trip. I do suggest that everyone get the full insurance coverage otherwise you can pay some hefty fines for damage come the end of the trip and most insurance does not cover rental car damage in Japan. If you do have damage to your rental car even if it is a scrape that was your own fault you are supposed to call the police and file a police report exactly where it happened. We ran into this problem when I accidentally scraped the side of our Toyota Noah on a small cement wall and did not realize that we had to file a police report at the location where it occurred so when I went to turn it in I had to explain that I’m a dumb American and that is not how it works in America. It worked out okay but it was a little bit anxious as they tried to figure out how to handle the situation. 



One interesting thing regarding cars in Japan is I couldn’t figure out why everyone seemed to be driving a brand-new car. My brother-in-law explained that the registration fees for new cars are very affordable and the older cars get the more exponentially those fees increase. This was deliberate on the part of the Japanese government to encourage people to purchase newer vehicles and the price of an average new car in Japan is $15-$30,000.



Driving throughout Japan was very easy and their main highways are well laid out and signage tends to be both in Japanese and English.  Google maps worked great and our vehicle had Carplay which was excellent.  We felt that having a vehicle really allowed us to plan our own schedule and have the freedom to stop at random locations and stores and restaurants.  Some of our favorite meals were based on just pulling over and trying out a good looking restaurant we found on google maps. 

That being said, in rural towns and even within kyoto and tokyo there can be some very narrow tight streets and passages and parking situations. Also, everyone in Japan backs into their parking spots so if you are not confident with your parking skills or driving with about 6 inches of clearance on either side,  renting a vehicle may not be for you.



I thought I would list highlights that stood out from each city and locale we visit.  There is just simply to much to see and do and eat in Japan and we found ourselves just going with the flow and not worrying if we missed out on any “essential” Japan elements.  It’s vacation!! Sometimes restaurants are too crowded or venues are closed or whatever.  The exploration is what makes the adventure.



**Tokyo**\-We stayed in Asakusa which was quiet and wonderful and felt a bit more local.  There has been tons written on Toko so I will list some of the small highlights that we found in our short time there.  We did do Team Labs Planets with the kids which was fun but I wouldn’t say it is a must do.

Also on our drive we made a stop at the [Okaya Silk Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Okaya+Silk+Museum+(Silk+Fact+Okaya)/@35.9575923,138.2977708,9.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d0028b0c2dd45:0xea27e71c2fb56bd1!8m2!3d36.0699832!4d138.04948!16s%2Fg%2F12116tx6?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which is both a museum and a working silk factory!  It was really cool if you do go make sure to get there before the workers are finished at 4pm.  The museum stays open till 5 but the workers are there and you can watch them work in person throughout the day!  Also, at the other end of the building from the museum part they have actual silkworm caterpillars eating leaves and building cocoons.  



[Ishii Miso](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ishii+Miso/@36.2309063,137.9633801,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d0eeb8b5bb8df:0x970757828a0e207f!8m2!3d36.2286!4d137.9763615!16s%2Fg%2F1tcz8d8v?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)\- We love trying [unique local food](https://ishiimiso.com/english) and Ishii Miso is a 150yo Miso brewer that still makes miso in traditional cedar barrel and they have tours twice a day at at 11am and 1:30.  The tour was given by the 7th generation owner of the establishment and ends with a sample of free miso soup!  I would recommend staying for lunch (11-2pm) because their pork miso soup was the best we had on our trip. Our kids compared every other miso we had to the “excellent 3 year aged miso” we had here and found almost all lacking.



[Matsumoto-jō Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Matsumoto-j%C5%8D+Castle/@36.2360625,137.9702072,16.5z/data=!3m1!5s0x601d0e850aee05ff:0xded05408b7f5b2a5!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d0e850a9a5999:0x902d0e20fabcf654!8m2!3d36.238653!4d137.9688674!16zL20vMDM5cXE2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)\-Really cool 5 story castle that you can tour.  I would recommend taking a walk around the grounds at night as they are all lit up and quite enchanting.  Kids loved this castle and they routinely have people walking around in traditional soldier gear to take photos with.

**Japanese Alps**  On our way to Takayama I really wanted to stay at this Japanese hotsprings [Guesthouse Raicho](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Japanese+hotsprings+Guesthouse+Raicho/@36.1195278,137.6220364,13.75z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x601d39bf3d11d6bd:0x395882face59c4e2!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d36.1185813!4d137.6254031!16s%2Fg%2F12xq2dnwx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) as it looked so cool and it was!  It is more of a backpackers lodge but it has two indoor and one outdoor reservable private onsens and the facility has a full kitchen you can use and you even get your choice of free bagel in the morning!  We chose this place as it was located near several waterfalls and hikes and while there are minimal dining options around there was still simple fair and even a [public day use onsen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norikura+Kogen+Onsen+-+Yukemurikan/@36.1194763,137.6241799,16.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d39b8b200dd81:0x819ab342f2b6990f!8m2!3d36.1210912!4d137.626572!16s%2Fg%2F11btt7lm9g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). The outdoor onsen was white and sulferous and wonderful at night in the cool night air.  They have some cozy public areas and the kids set up the macbook to watch Spirited Away and after a day driving through the mountain tunnels it was the perfect movie to watch. 



Within a short drive was a wonderful waterfall with river spanning bridges called [Bandokoro Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bandokoro+Falls/@36.1179336,137.6034819,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d15c0124638c1:0x8bc08f5f079a195f!8m2!3d36.1279908!4d137.6578433!16s%2Fg%2F1hc0hdsd7?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was simply magical but the real treat was doing the hike to [Sanbondaki Falls](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sanbondaki+Falls+Parking+Lot/@36.1179336,137.6034819,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d377a99377f8f:0x1f513d606c864bfc!8m2!3d36.1136631!4d137.5966738!16s%2Fg%2F11g6_db_fh?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). You park at what appears to be an abandoned ski hill and the trail is to the right of the lodge.  It is a 20 min walk to the falls and you will find a simply magical spot where three different rivers converge into one.  We spent the whole afternoon exploring and reading and enjoying the cool mist from the falls. There were lots of signs warning of bears and murder hornets but there were multiple bells along the trail to ring. Japan’s [bear population](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/JAPAN-BEARS/dwpkkldkapm/) has reportedly tripled in the past decade.



**Takayama** After our time enjoying the mountain streams we went on to stay at the [Wat Hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wat+Hotel+%26+Spa+Hida+Takayama/@36.1371226,137.250411,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x6002bbefcc3119b9:0x81199aca7b1af0ed!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d36.1371183!4d137.2529859!16s%2Fg%2F11f5q8fzbs?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Takayama. This was very affordable and there are two large public onsens (mens and womens) with saunas as well as 4 private onsens that are first come. There are even little popsicles after you onsen that are free.  There is also a small parlor with an “all you can drink” package for 2000 yen but I ended up just buying sake cups from the vending machine. 



In Takayama the highlights were the morning market for treats and souvenirs but the real hit with us all was the [Takayama Shōwa-kan Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Takayama+Sh%C5%8Dwa-kan+Museum/@36.1430879,137.2595787,16.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002bad09cac0001:0x3e465398237cce40!8m2!3d36.1439748!4d137.2599215!16s%2Fg%2F1vvyx_dx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). This is a wonderful little museum showing the transition of post war Japan to modern day. It is full of kitch and in a sense is just a large antique store but we had so fun exploring the displays, trying out cassette Karoake, sitting in the little theater watching classic Japanese movie clips, and having the kids play in the model Japanese school room.  The candy and kitsch for sale in the gift store is wonderful and we filled up an entire bag of Japanese candy to bring home. 



[Kiyo Musubi Riceball](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyo+Musubi+Riceball/@36.140836,137.2604215,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002bbcd7344c827:0xd5b3d90bea75a81f!8m2!3d36.1416351!4d137.2613263!16s%2Fg%2F11g4d7hnrg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) Amazing rice ball walk in shop run by a sweet elderly lady.  Once she sells out she sells out!  We bought here out for the day with our large group!

We ordered takeaway and all agreed it was the best we have had in a while. Slightly pricey compared to other options but kids were hungry for pizza!

They offer tax free and there are 5% off coupons in local flyers for the shop



[Hida no Sato Open Air Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hida+no+Sato+Open+Air+Museum/@36.1324895,137.2117665,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002bb39afd86499:0xd6a4b260c226fc44!8m2!3d36.1324902!4d137.2350898!16zL20vMGNxZjhq?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) An open air museum featuring traditional houses with thatched roofs with displays on traditional ways of lifes and crafts.  Most interior buildings do take your shoes off so wear easy on/off shoes.  It is pretty inexpensive but it was a bit disappointing in that I was led to believe that there would be a lot more character actors or craftsmen making it more of a living village.  This may have been because we are in the off season tourism wise but displays were lacking in information and kids got bored after a while. While still informational and enjoyable I wouldn’t spend more than 2 hours there.



[Daio Wasabi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E5%A4%A7%E7%8E%8B%E3%82%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%B3%E8%BE%B2%E5%A0%B4/@36.3930183,137.6978388,11.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x601d6da35d71bd7d:0xd8adcf7ab2065700!8m2!3d36.3392598!4d137.9084423!16zL20vMGNndmNj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) An active wasabi farm with several food options and a gift store.  This place was so cool!  It is free to walk around the grounds and



After spending hot days in Takayama the kids wanted to cool down so I found another local waterfall on google maps and it was a huge hit. [ Ōkura falls ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C5%8Ckura+falls+trailhead/@36.1042133,137.1181949,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002998171645ca5:0xee607b25c29c42a4!8m2!3d36.1042789!4d137.1177059!16s%2Fg%2F11rcq3y4r0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)was an easy drive just outside of town with a short hike and multiple cool pools to dip you feet in. Kids found giant spiders, frogs, salamanders, and even some small fish in the cool waters while the adults read and drank sake!  It was magical and felt like something out of a Studio Ghibli film.



On our way to Kanazawa we had planned to grab lunch at 7/11 but missed the exit and just happened to stumble upon [Yaemo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yaemo/@36.1385893,137.0761161,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x6002993613ded5df:0xb89814d6f1e6869e!8m2!3d36.138585!4d137.078691!16s%2Fg%2F1v96lq6z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), a moderately sized restaurant run by a Husband/Wife team and this ended up being one of our favorite meals of the trip!  They specialize in Yakiniku or grilled meats and they have Hida beef which rivals Kobe in its marbling and taste.  We mostly ordered the yakiniku but my eldest ordered the curry and it was his favorite curry of the trip.  



**Kanazawa**



In Kanazawa we stayed at a traditional[ Japanese house ](https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/hisago.en-us.html?label=en-us-booking-desktop-r6BYLzzA87pIc7rvz1yRCAS755854803286%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atikwd-65526620%3Alp9222663%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm&sid=2dc929085b5ffdecc3372736dfec920d&aid=2311236)as we wanted to try and change up our lodgings throughout the trip and we had a wonderful time having a whole place to ourselves.  



Kanazawa is yet another wonderful place with lots to do both in the surrounding area and within town.  It felt more quaint and indicative of normal life for how most of Japan operates. We did get some questions from locals as to why we wanted to visit Kanazawa as it seems it has only recently become more popular for foreign tourists.



[Nagamachi Samurai Disctrict](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nagamachi+Samurai+District/@36.5620326,136.6583925,16.04z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x34674e0fd77f192f:0xf54275d47c665244!2sJapan!3b1!8m2!3d36.204824!4d138.252924!16zL20vMDNfM2Q!3m5!1s0x5ff833d6260e2787:0x9dfeba31690b9e3b!8m2!3d36.5637725!4d136.6510988!16s%2Fg%2F120n36hh?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) was wonderful to wander around to find little souvenir shops and admire the historic district.  We grabbed a snack at an american themed hot dog restaurant called [Street Vendor](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Street+Vendor/@36.56379,136.6486461,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff8337e359d0889:0x3c29e8c92aa1972d!8m2!3d36.56379!4d136.651221!16s%2Fg%2F11b8z6qkk9?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and I recommend the kimchi curry dog!  This was one of the more hot and humid days we encountered but we soldiered through and toured the grounds of [Kanazawa Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kanazawa+Castle+Park/@36.5652635,136.6561241,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff833823df14795:0xa827189e97e61e4a!8m2!3d36.5659458!4d136.6588451!16s%2Fg%2F1tfct25g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which is quite impressive.  We skipped the inside tour as it seems it is more of building structure and not the interesting lodging and beauty that once existed when the feudal lord called the place home. 



The real treat was touring [Kenroku-en](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kenroku-en/@36.5629429,136.6593399,16.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff83383f9b25905:0x970a7b3df003f2e4!8m2!3d36.5621278!4d136.6626515!16zL20vMDJsNnZ4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) gardens. It is a simply beautiful garden with multiples paths to wander and explore.  There is a small “tea house” restaurant within the gardens as well to grab a drink or treat and cool down in the AC.  We spent 2+ hours in the gardens and it was the highlight of the day.



[Kanazawa Music Bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kanazawa+Music+Bar/@36.5621687,136.6544291,15.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff8347f142692fd:0xe38cac933d14388d!8m2!3d36.5596607!4d136.6544366!16s%2Fg%2F11dxr_wl0n?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) While seemingly aimed at tourists we still enjoyed this bar that features a live DJ changing tunes on vinyl although drinks and food were pricey for Japan standards.



After a day in the city we were itching for the countryside again and drove up the coastline north of Kanazawa to explore the peninsula.  There is a large section of beach that one is[ allowed to drive](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chirihama+Nagisa+Drive+Way+Imahama+Gate/@36.8798976,136.6824763,11.17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff76560839b6dd5:0x2d72278f035583a9!8m2!3d36.8390428!4d136.7493641!16s%2Fg%2F11n0111k6x?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) on which was fun but one thing we found interesting was that Japan’s beaches are filthy!  There are piles and piles of nets, buoys, boot, and debris that litter the coastline but regardless we had fun driving by the nuclear power plant and visiting the[ oldest wooden lighthouse](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Fukura+Lighthouse+-+Oldest+Wooden+Lighthouse+in+Japan/@37.1248998,136.6910801,12.67z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff7379770cf8663:0xc34878057d49a931!8m2!3d37.0832038!4d136.7230963!16s%2Fg%2F1227d3y2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Japan.

Prior to setting up a beach spot we went to the local supermarket that had wonderful premade sushi packs that we grabbed along with affordable squirt guns and googles for the kids.  We had a simply wonderful day letting the kids snorkel around the rock formations and exploring the beach.  My kids think I am crazy but one of my favorite souvenirs from japan was a [welded aluminum fishing float](https://www.ebay.com/itm/388585807296?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28&google_free_listing_action=view_item) I found looking through the debris. I was hoping for a glass float but had no luck.  But we did find about 18 rubber boots!





We next drove to Gifu as I wished to visit Seki City and we stopped at the [Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fukui+Prefectural+Dinosaur+Museum/@35.977586,135.3216319,8.38z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x5ff89af3546bd879:0x55d1ff4a7646b4e1!8m2!3d36.0824428!4d136.5065904!16s%2Fm%2F04f4ltr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which we all quite enjoyed.  They had these wonderful little notebooks with gold embossed lettering in the giftshop that I picked up and their cafeteria was all dinosaur themed meals which was cute.  Worth a stop if it's on your way.



In Seki city the plan was to visit the multiple knife shops and blacksmiths in the region but sadly we visited on a Saturday and most of the stores were closed!  I did go to [Blacksmith Japan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blacksmith+Japan+%E5%8C%85%E4%B8%81%E3%81%A8%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E5%88%80%E8%B2%A9%E5%A3%B2/@35.4818549,136.9165544,19z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x6003043dea7ba5df:0xb88094cdce501761!2sSeki+Swordsmith+Museum!8m2!3d35.4818101!4d136.9164444!16s%2Fg%2F121gzx98!3m5!1s0x600305c55075ea23:0xf21a82916e05bfe1!8m2!3d35.4814608!4d136.9160635!16s%2Fg%2F11y6pf_5bk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was open with a very helpful salesmen that helped me find a locally forged kitchen knife that has been my favorite go to knife since we have been home.  We did find some good deals at the [Gifu Cutlery Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gifu+Cutlery+Hall/@35.4821893,136.9055503,16z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sknife+shop!3m6!1s0x60030417d1e1a1f3:0x4bd9d1ddb55df1aa!8m2!3d35.4821893!4d136.9150775!15sCgprbmlmZSBzaG9wWgwiCmtuaWZlIHNob3CSAQ1jdXRsZXJ5X3N0b3JlmgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJVY1ZCVFQybDNSUkFCqgFNCggvbS8wNGN0eBABKg4iCmtuaWZlIHNob3AoADIfEAEiG_D_t-bQZAEDeWP2Kf8VeCT6YHbLbNynInNdKjIOEAIiCmtuaWZlIHNob3DgAQD6AQQIABBD!16s%2Fg%2F1238mcjj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which luckily had a lot of the knives from the local producers although I suspect I may have paid a bit more but it was the only shop really open. That being siad they had a great selection for every budget as well as gardening tools, scissors, and other small metal implements.



Another stop in Seki city was the [Feather Razor Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Feather+Razor+Museum/@35.4829306,136.9195152,16.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x600304164a7dc103:0x1633e051b2744b80!8m2!3d35.4835472!4d136.9150861!16s%2Fg%2F122pl6t5?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). My brother in law introduced my to wet shaving about a decade ago and his favorite razor blades are feathers so we had to visit since we were in the area!  It is a free museum outlining the history and achievements of the Feather company and was a wonderful hour long visit. 



We ended our trip with several nights in Kyoto staying at the [Hotel Imagine Kyoto](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HOTEL+IMAGINE+KYOTO/@34.981715,135.7581944,17z/data=!4m11!3m10!1s0x600108ad23243af9:0xb545f0a07b37ac39!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.9817106!4d135.7607693!16s%2Fg%2F11gxsf_48f?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and really enjoyed Kyoto although I would have liked to have had a couple more days to explore the surrounding area. We did get the chance to go to the [Osaka Aquarium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Osaka+Aquarium+Kaiyukan/@34.6545225,135.4240936,16z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e8f48fa243ff:0x25fc1f29292f7889!4m11!3m10!1s0x6000e8f48c0da9cd:0x6f83c520ae082ccc!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.6545182!4d135.4289645!16zL20vMDJjeW13?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which I wanted to visit solely to see the whalesharks.  They have two of them! The aquarium itself was a 7/10 I would say and be forewarned that entrances are timed so prepurchasing your tickets is advisable.  We got their late for the 11am entrance but there is a nice little mall right next door we spent time shopping at while we waited.  We also had the chance to see the Orix Buffaloes at the [Kyocera Dome](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kyocera+Dome+%C5%8Csaka/@34.6692848,135.4735678,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e7b18b4362e7:0xf49415dccf44dbc0!4m11!3m10!1s0x6000e7b24b87684b:0x535f75f9161484f1!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.6692804!4d135.4761427!16s%2Fg%2F12xqz5chj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and it was one of our favorite experiences during our trip!  It is a bit confusing how seating works but once we found our seats it was a blas seeing all the different chants and songs from the fan sections for both fans and then trying all the awesome snacks and drinks which were much more affordable than any MLB game!  Within the whole stadium there are women with mini kegs on their backs that you can flag down for a fresh draft beer which was a blast.  The kids were less enthused than wife and I but everyone had a good time. Also, the merch for teams and players is hilarious and worth checking out after the game.



We had been promising the 6 year old all trip to go to a train museum since we had skipped one in Tokyo so we went to the [Kyoto Railway Museum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kyoto+Railway+Museum/@34.987103,135.7396983,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m11!3m10!1s0x6001061746adc243:0x899ffa889ace79ed!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.9870986!4d135.7422732!16s%2Fm%2F07kc9qj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) which was wonderful experience outside of the fast that everything was in Japanese!  We only had one iphone for google translate which frustrated things but overall it was a great museum.  They have huge roundhouse outside with a vintage steam locomotive that I believe you can book rides one.



We ended our last full day in Japan visiting the [GEAR](https://www.google.com/maps/place/GEAR+%2FNon-Verbal+theatre/@35.0085287,135.7639592,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60010892296a9855:0x442d026d94b8cd2e!4m11!3m10!1s0x60010892296800d1:0x833920b059ebecf!5m4!1s2025-09-19!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d35.0085243!4d135.7665341!16s%2Fg%2F1230_6tg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) non verbal theater to watch their production. It is a “non-verbal” theater in that the story is laid out through an amazing show of lights, theatrics, an interactive stage and 5 talented actors. I actually don’t want to explain more than that because the show is totally worth it going in blind and I guarantee you will enjoy the 90 min performance.  Just be warned you may become part of the show as some part of the night!



The next day we finally had the chance to ride the Shinkansen back to Tokyo to catch our flight and it was everything everyone says.  Just be sure that if you have luggage you purchase the tickets that allow the “oversized” baggage etc. 



Japan is an amazing country and while we did not do all the traditional sights we tried to balance the trip between town and country while looking for our own unique adventures.  I fully plan on returning to Japan in the future and hope to visit the northern prefectures at some point in my life. Overall Japan is very easy to travel in, the food is amazing, the people are reserved but always helpful and respectful.

this post is really just going to be reminiscing. 

our first date. we walked around the lake. we talked just because. i thought i screwed it up. i thought i wasn't talking as much as i should, but i was scared and nervous. we went to eat, we split our plates. i remember driving us back, i was so scared that i screwed it up. that i was going to be ghosted. but when i was driving back, i saw that text that just made me so happy - ""i had great time <3"" you said... and we called and talked even more. i was so happy.

our next date, we went to a cafe. i ordered hot chocolate, much to the teasing of you. you got coffee, we drew stuff together, and we ate dinner together... as we walked around after our dinner, you said something that i don't think  realized held so much weight to me... ""do you want to hold hands?"" i said of course, and then you said... ""i really like spending time with you"" and i was... shocked... that someone felt that way about me. i said the same thing... and we held hands as i drove you back to your place....

we went to the state fair after, we didn't get any crazy foods but i was happy to be there with you. we went on a ferris wheel and we held each other... i was so happy.

our next one, we grabbed dinner, and as we waited for our food, you held my hand... and i looked up at you, and you smiled at me. to say that i felt true happiness then would be an understatement. we walked around random stores because you wanted to, and i was just happy to spend time with you.

i asked if you wanted to accompany me to buy presents for my dad, and you said yes. we shopped, and we just talked and vibed... as i drove you back, we reached your place, and you said something i didn't think i'd ever hear... ""i want to kiss you."" and so we did... and i held you afterwards... and i said, ""you make me so happy..."" you had to go back inside because you needed to use the bathrooom, but i blasted so much happy songs on my way back. i was beyond happy, i was... just happy. so happy...

you asked to come over to my place, and so we did, we watched the show you wanted to watch, and we cuddled... we walked, and talked... but i felt you growing distant...

then... on the next one... you said you weren't ready for all of this... and that's when everything changed. i was destroyed. i knew what was coming... i wanted to work out your problems with you... but it was over.

i just miss you so much, and it destroys me. because i know you're not thinking about me as much as i think about you. and i just... it makes me feel insignificant. nothing more than a footnote in your story. 

i just hope you're doing okay. and i hope... i just hope you're okay. you're an amzing person. and i miss you. you'll never read this. but i hope you know that no mattter what, someone out there cares about you.",1,1761374061.0,venting,1,1.0,False

This isn’t a get-rich-quick plan. I’m a young guy who wants to build multiple income streams over the next few years and learn the business side properly.

How do you structure your team of drivers or operators? What does your average weekly time commitment look like once the business is up and running? What software or systems do you use to track sales, restocking, and routes?

If you started small, how did you scale to multiple trucks while maintaining consistency and quality?

Also, are there any legitimate courses or mentors you’d recommend for learning this business model? I’d be open to paying for mentorship from someone who has real experience in it.",0,1761374025.0,foodtrucks,1,0.5,False

Most sites I've found that sell their accessories are located in Canada and either not shipping to the US right now or charging an insane amount to do so not including potential additional and unknown tariff costs. It's a simular case for other international sellers (200 plus dollars to ship from singalore!) Prima coffee seems US based but are out of stock of almost all the stuff.

1ofkftc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKoernerOffice/comments/1ofkftc/the_2word_framework_that_helped_me_avoid/,The 2-Word Framework That Helped Me Avoid Life-Sucking Businesses,"I've started over 20 companies that have generated well over $100M in revenue.  
  
I now use 1 system to identify what business to start.  
  
The BO framework:  
  
Everyone knows to start businesses that have:

* High margins
* Growing market
* Low competition
* Low startup costs

But how do you know if it's worth the headache to start a certain business or not?  
  
I have a battle-tested framework I call BO - binary outcomes.  
  
It helps you identify business ideas that are much easier to run, so you can get more reviews, more referrals and not hate your life.  
  
Remember, just because a business idea COULD work doesn't mean you should do it!  
  
Which business is more straightforward:

1. Stump grinding
2. House painting

**Stump grinding** \- ""My stump is now gone. 5 star review""  
  
**House painting** \- ""You missed a spot. How many layers of primer did you use? When will you be done? We have guests coming tomorrow.""  
  
Another example:

1. **Homebuilding** \- ""You said you'd be done by February. Our landlord is kicking us out next week. Is the driveway supposed to look like that? That's not the light fixture I chose.""
2. **Low SKU eCommerce** \- ""I ordered a widget and it arrived on time. Thank you, I'll tell my friends.""

Would you rather have an event planning business or own a building that others host events in?  
  
A restaurant with a Cheesecake factory menu or an In-n-Out menu?

Can all 4 of those businesses above be very profitable?  
Of course!  
  
But it rarely makes sense to start the harder ones.  
  
See what I mean?  
  
There's no shortage of business ideas.  
  
Pick 1 that most easily creates a clear, binary outcome.

1ofke00,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ofke00/question/,Question,"I’ve tried to read through as much info in this group as possible but am seeking guidance for what I feel is my unique situation. I understand the strict carnivore but I also understand there are various iterations as well as combination ketovore or just plain keto, the last two I understand are outside the scope of this group. It seems that several of y’all have tried different variations so I’m hoping for someone to share personal experiences.

After my divorce and other unhealthy/stressful life experiences, I started at 365 pounds in Feb/24. I now weigh 290 today. The plateaus are becoming more frequent and longer lasting. I might lose 3-5 pounds and then nothing for additional 3, 4 or 5 weeks. Then I’ll begin to lose again only to plateau again. In my younger days, when I’d set my mind to weight loss, there’d be weeks I could lose 13-17 pounds one week and maybe only 3-5 the next week but then follow up with another big week after. I fully acknowledge that I didn’t get this way over night so it won’t come off overnight. And I celebrate the small victories. But why do I see stories of people older than me losing 30 pounds in a month or 40 pounds by Christmas?

When I started, it was red meat, chicken, salmon, tuna, bacon, sausage, eggs, cheese and water. A friend at work (who led me to carnivore) says he’s had success while also including aspartame drinks rather than coffee (since I’ve never been a coffee drinker). But I also live with chronic pain. I work midnights in a domestic auto factory and, while I no longer work the assembly line, the injuries I’ve accrued through almost 30 years are adding up. I see people asserting that carnivore has healed their acne, their auto-immune issues, inflammation and joint pain, to name just a few. I’ve eliminated the aspartame, bacon and sausage because some say they CAN lead to increased inflammation. Even after elimination my inflammation and pain level has not improved, not even slightly. And it’s been a year-and-a-half. Elimination also hasn’t improved plateaus.

So here’s the second part of my question. Since eliminating foods suspected of increasing inflammation and joint pain hasn’t worked, what do y’all recommend about reintroducing leafy greens? Because Doctor has suggested that (mostly because people who haven’t tried carnivore are skeptical, and therefore non-supportive, and it seems research is still lagging). Would that be ketovore or straight keto? Has anybody with joint pain and inflammation has similar experiences? 

I thought losing 75 pounds would help the inflammation but so far no joy. I can overcome my anxiousness for the weight loss increase a bit, as long as the scale continues moving south. But the pain is unbearable. So I don’t know what to do. I’ve read other suggestions of simply moving more but my pain is so severe that I feel 30 years older and more movement equals more pain (I’ve tried!). I acknowledge that age, working midnights, having numerous injuries, etc all can affect my journey, but I’ve seen other people’s journeys seemingly resolve all these issues. 

So I’m open to suggestions. Thanks in advance!",2,1761373376.0,carnivorediet,15,1.0,False

Brielle  
  
  
My lab was my safe place. All the familiar rows of shiny beakers, medical testing equipment—well loved, if a little dated—and my desk, shoved off to the side and so buried under brightly colored Post-its and scientific journals that the dented surface of the wood hadn’t been seen in ages. It was quiet, serene, and—  
  
  
“Oh my God, Brielle!” Leigh’s urgent tone as she burst through my lab door—without knocking, as usual—shattered my blissful concentration. I spun around, turning my back to the bank of machinery to take in her outraged appearance. She was in her exercise gear, blonde hair falling out of a messy bun, and her cheeks were hot red. “You’re never going to believe this! Please tell me you checked your pack mail this morning?”  
  
  
“Umm, no. I visited Mr. Coffee and came straight to my lab to check the results of last night’s test run.”  
  
  
“Of course you did,” she snarled as Shay, the much quieter leg of our best-friend trio, knocked softly and pushed through the door to stand behind her.  
  
  
“Don’t snap at her, Leigh. It’s not her fault.”  
  
  
Leigh spun on Shay, eyes narrowed. “Don’t act like you’re happy about this—you won’t even talk to any of the men in the pack! This is an outrage! A travesty! A violation of our twenty-first century suffragette rights! It’s, it’s—”  
  
  
“A mandate from the high alpha,” Shay finished succinctly, though a deep flush stained her cheeks from Leigh’s frank assessment.  
  
  
“A mandate? What does it say?” I stepped forward anxiously. Mandates were never good news, and they always shook things up. I’ve been shaken enough in my twenty-seven years of life, thanks. I liked my little lab and my best friends and my sleepy, backwater-Texas pack.  
  
  
“It says that shifters are cavemen who think they can drag us around by our hair at a whim! Well, I won’t stand for it. Alpha Todd is about to get his pelt shaved, and I expect you two hussies to hold him down while I use the clippers, capiche?”  
  
  
Her nostrils flared as she looked back and forth between me and Shay.  
  
  
“Can I actually see the mandate, please?” I addressed the question to Shay, since she was keeping a calm head. She silently proffered the letter clutched in her hands.  
  
  
The paper was thick and creamy, heavier than expected—almost like a fancy wedding invitation. The high alpha’s seal was stamped on it with dripping purple wax. I unfolded the letter, and my hands started to shake as I read the first few lines.  
  
  
By decree of High Alpha Kosta, son of Konstantin, son of Kasmiro, ruler of the nine great packs, a great pack gathering has been called. The alphas of each pack, along with their seconds and thirds, are hereby ordered to report to Pack Blackwater grounds within two weeks of the date of this summons. They shall accompany all unmated pack mates over the age of twenty, who are to participate in a series of matching activities.",1,1761373339.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I can see that Angry turtle ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8fWQENkjI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8fWQENkjI)) is using a similar setup and doing 5k on crits, but he is also using food which I am not.

Also, why can he sustain his AP in VATS? AFAICT he is not using coffee. I run out of AP in a few seconds.

I can just barely finish and then I die.

Thanks for your feedback.

EDIT: Yes, I am also using Taking One For the Team

Extra edit: I changed my build. I am no longer using vats and crits. I do about the same damage, but now without crits. I really must be missing something essential.

I'm from The Philippines, and I've been in Canada for three years now. I'm a 30 year old gay man. I find it hard to make friends, and I miss my parents everyday. I wish they were with me in Toronto.

I've improved a lot since I came here, but the homesickness would never go away. But I manage, so that's why I exercise every day by going to the gym and by swimming. I also wanted to make new friends, and hopefully become part of a healthy and loving community. I just miss talking to people about whatever. I oftentimes do things on my own here. I've gotten used to it, but it would be nice to have some company from time to time. I'm also single, btw. 😅

I want to make art. I want to frolick. I want to talk about the cosmos. I want to hug and be hugged whenever and wherever, and as tightly as we want to. I want to explore coffee shops. I want to experience the sun and the snow. I want to cry and have someone wipe my tears away.

First time poster with a medication question.

Some context: I have type 2 Bipolar disorder that I take Lamotrigine for the last decade, I just started taking sertraline 6 weeks ago for anxiety and I'm experiencing bad side effects for the first time.

Has anyone had a reaction to caffeine while taking sertraline? I've found that drinking regular tea in particular leads to horrible stomach issues soon afterwards if I've recently taken my medication. I love tea and coffee so this is quite depressing. I've also been waking up drenched in sweat which is driving me insane. If anyone can suggest ways to help this, that would be great! I'm planning to call my doctor when they're open again next week.

1ofkbrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1ofkbrk/the_girl_i_like_is_dating_another_guy_but_she_is/,"The girl I like is dating another guy , but she is not trying to distance herself from me instead she is getting me more attached.","So there’s this girl I really, really like. We have good chemistry .... same humor, same energy, same vibe. I met her in my college and we sit next to each other during lectures.

Now, she started dating another guy (its been like a month and a half) . That obviously hurt like hell, but I’ve been trying to stay chill and keep things normal. The thing is ,she’s *still* just as friendly and close with me as she was before. We talk in class, we sit next to each other, and it all feels so natural… almost too natural considering the situation.

Here’s where it really messes with my head , Yesterday I had a conversation with A mutual friend , and she told me that she knows I like her. Apparently, everyone knows it’s that obvious. And according to that same friend, she said that I give her “friend vibes only.”

But if that’s true, why the hell is she still acting like this?  
We even text a lot a few nights ago, we were chatting on Instagram until 1 a.m., laughing so much that her mom literally woke up. Like… what girl who’s already dating someone does that with a guy she knows likes her?  
The other day she came alone to take coffee with me while my other friends refused to come with me. (of our group) , okay maybe she did this because she just wanted to be a ""nice"" friend, but if she knows I like her then is'nt it weird to come alone with me for getting coffee.

Well, until yesterday, I believed she didn’t know I liked her ,cause the way she acts around me is too normal. I am not saying she should not be normal but if she has a dude, why does she talk so much with me too , its reciprocated , we bond so much in class that people had started to take notice and rumors were spreading. The mutual friend also told me that she got a call from one of the guys from our class , who just called her to ask whats going on between me and the girl I like and thats just one incident. Another girl from our class asked a friend of mine if something is going on between me and the girl I like.  
This all has happened WHEN she has been dating.

It’s confusing as hell. She’s not giving me “back off” or “I’m not interested” energy. She’s just being super chill, like nothing’s changed and I don’t know what to make of it anymore.

To make things worse, I can’t even avoid her, because we sit next to each other , and that's become ""my spot"" and changing my place suddenly would be weird not only for her but the whole class is going to start questioning why I randomly changed my place.

I’m not trying to accuse her of anything, maybe she’s just being nice. But I can’t tell if she’s being clueless or if she actually enjoys the attention.  
Has anyone been through something like this?  
Why would she act so normal if she knows I like her and already has a boyfriend?  
And how the hell do I protect my peace while still having to see and talk to her every day?

And I missed a key detail  
she is the girl who helped me get over the girl I was obsessed with for 6 years(my bestfriend) . I just liked my best friend but I never loved her , It took me 6 years cause I couldnt find a girl , who I could really connect to, someone who matches my energy , my humor. Until I found this girl, and I actually love this girl , talking with her makes me happy . Her smile gives me comfort , laughing with her is like my drugs man, the feeling it gives.... (it all sounds cringey but I never felt all this when I liked my best friend for 6 years , and she dated quite a few times , and I was never jealous , never , but watching this girl with another guy , its killing me from the inside.

TL;DR:

I’m in college and really like this girl I have amazing chemistry with. She’s been dating another guy for about a month and a half, but still acts super close to me, we talk a lot, sit together, even chat late at night. A mutual friend told me she *knows* I like her and only sees me as a friend, but her behavior doesn’t match that. It’s confusing as hell, and seeing her with her boyfriend while she’s still this close to me is eating me alive. I don’t know if she’s being nice, clueless, or actually enjoys the attention, but I’m stuck seeing her every day and don’t know how to protect my peace anymore.
