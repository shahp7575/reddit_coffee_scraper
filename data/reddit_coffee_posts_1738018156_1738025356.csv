1ibp7zb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibp7zb,Where should my runner start?,"Please don't judge the disarray, literally moved in a week ago.

So here's my dilemma: we have either a super long hallway or a stumpy one, depending on how much we want to section off the living area. My heart wants a long runner (slide 2 teal rectangle) no matter how open we keep the living room, but my i-like-rules brain is thinking I'm ""supposed to"" only have the runner in the hall area proper (slide 2 pink). The white rug is moving elsewhere and being replaced with another similarly-sized. Fuzzy rug is just there to de-crease, please disregard that. Ottoman stays somewhere in this room (it's the cat's, I have no choice in the matter) and terrible coffee table will be replaced with something more fitting as soon as something speaks to me.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while drinking tea and having a smoke I’m watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )** 

Does that sound good to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyway ;)) ",0,1738025152.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.33,False

1ibp5cv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibp5cv,"Review #5: Larceny Barrel Proof, Batch B524","It's Monday, and you know what that means: a wheated bourbon review!!!  Larceny barrel proof is one of the most recommended bourbons on here, so it was one of the first bottles I picked up when I decided to rebuild my collection.  Personally I'm still skeptical of the whole batch thing, where one batch or the other or something is good and another one is not so much. To me, if there's no change in the actual ingredients or aging, it feels like a way to fuel people's FOMO and get us to buy as much as possible. Then again, that's mostly speculation since I haven't been collecting multiple batches of the same thing to compare. 

Price: $64.99

Proof: 125.4

Age: around 6 years?

Nose: Cinnamon candy, leather, dark cherry, some faint citrus. I can smell the influence of the wheat but not sure how to quantify it. Low ethanol for the proof, oak is pretty faint. Some herbal cinnamon (as in the spice) as well. As the glass gets closer to empty, there's more of a woody and citrusy scent that I like, with an oddly milky element to it.

Taste: Medium body, thinner than I'd expect. Cinnamon candy/Red Hots is the first thing that comes to mind. Again with what comes across as leather, maybe some sweet coffee or latte at the end. I definitely detect what I think of as ""youthful notes"" in this, there's a sharpness to it and it's very drying, almost uncomfortably so. It doesn't stick around long after the sip aside from some dry tannins and slight bitterness, which seems odd for a 6 year old product, but what do I know.

Overall: 6.5 (Very good). This is a weird one for me, there's a lot to like but at the same time it doesn't really stand out as anything amazing or otherwise notable. Part of this is undoubtedly due to my expectations coming in, with so many people calling it a top 10 of the year I'm left thinking ""it's good, but really?"" THEN AGAIN, that could be where the batches come into play. Maybe there really is a significant difference? In any case, this bottle is the closest to empty in my current collection, so it's not like I don't enjoy it. I just can't help but feel that it's overrated a bit.

Buy again: normally I'd say no, but with all the talk of different batch numbers, I think I'm going to give it another chance. I might wait til one comes out that has everyone raving and compare the two. Otherwise, it's good, but I wouldn't get it again at $65. For $40-50, sure!

I've been doing my best to go through the grieving process and deal with the reality that for half my days (when my ex has our kid), I am alone unless I put effort into making plans. Although I have lots of friends and a great community, most of them are coupled up and have kids. I need more single friends to hang out and go to events with on my kid-free days. I'm on dating apps, but that hasn't shown to be a good way to make friends.

I live in Nob Hill and work at UNM. I'm very far left politically and am not interested in spending time with anyone even close to center. Age/gender doesn't matter as long as you're kind, compassionate, and are willing to reciprocate in a meaningful friendship.

Things I enjoy: 
-Riding bicycles (faster, longer rides)
-Hikes and urban walks
-Live music (esp. punk/indie/alternative)
-Dancing (upbeat/EDM)
-Billiards (please be good) 
-Pub games (like darts) 
-Board and card games
-Karaoke
-Art shows
-Crochet
-Camping
-Baking
-Overly involved discussions about the complexity of existence
-Coffee
-Craft beer and fancy cocktails
-Dogs (I'm sadly allergic to cats)
-Community organizing

My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metalhead vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",1,1738024160.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1ibottb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ibottb/officially_gallbladderless/,Officially Gallbladderless!!!,"Just got home from my surgery and it went great! Literally the hardest part was just waiting around to go back. I have hospital trauma and I’m very anxious but this was so easy and I was ready to get that sucker out!

Stomach is a bit sore but they gave me some pain meds when I woke up in recovery so I’m feeling okay now. Just a bit itchy cause I have a little bit of an allergy to opiates so I’m gonna take a Benadryl and have a nice little nap. 

Doc said to only have clear fluids today, then keep it low fast for about a week before I start incorporating a regular diet. Which is great cause I already prepped some soup and mashed potatoes yesterday. I’m shocked I don’t have any nausea yet but I did get the scopalamine patch cause I asked for it. 

My surgeon wouldn’t take a pic of it for me which I was a little bummed about lol he did say I can have caffeine tomorrow and I’m stoked to finally have some coffee as it’s been like 6 months of not being able to have any, not even decaf. 

No gas pains yet and I’m not even that bloated which is amazing cause that was another concern. Obviously I just got out and I’m a little floaty on meds but I just wanted to share my experience so far so it can hopefully ease some peoples anxiety about going under for the first time. It was a piece of cake! Last thing I remember was them pushing the meds into my IV after I scooted onto the operating table. 

Oh and I asked them for hospital underwear when they had me change into the gown and they gave me some. It made me so much more comfortable knowing my ass wasn’t just out there and that I was all covered. So if you’re nervous about that kind of thing, just ask. 

Last little thing, my throat/mouth were insanely dry when I woke up from the intubation tube. First thing I asked the nurse for was water, my chapstick, and a cough drop. Huge thank you to everyone who recommended buying cough drops! I also brought my little dry mouth travel spray and probably used half of it to cure the cottonmouth lol",3,1738024116.0,gallbladders,3,1.0,False

(Im 33F now) I was just a young kid, thinking I was doing myself right. It was a huge milestone for me to be the first female to join the service. And honestly, I had no aspirations. No goals in life. And wouldn’t you know it… I fucking got stuck in open general to Security Forces. 

For all of my fellow SF people, you already know. To those who don’t know, SF is just a military cop. You work the gate scanning ID cards, fake a smile. Drink monsters like they’re going out of style and eat tornadoes for dinner from the Shoppette gas station. 

It really wasn’t a bad job, it was fairly easy. But being in a male dominate career field, guys usually didn’t take you seriously. I was also married at the time. My husband was also AF, different career field, so it was nice to have him by myself to show me how this new life was. 

2 years in, I had goals to go K9. But I was stuck in an abusive relationship. I had to lie about how I injured my back, of which he pushed me down the stairs. I had to lie about how I was scared to go home. And later found out he was fooling around with one of his troops on a TDY assignment. Then I got noticed I was going to deploy. Honestly, I was so fucking excited to get away. 

A few weeks into pre deployment, I was physically abused and it showed on my face. I went and talked to my Shirt and just laid everything out to him. Later I was on a “Do not arm” list. And being a cop, you arm every single day. Which then meant I couldn’t deploy…. I was forced to work the gate everyday. And everyone would come through and ask me “why I’m here all the time” and “why don’t I have a gun”? Did I get in trouble for something? 

I was so depressed as my life was literally just crumbling around me. I finally decided to seek therapy on base. My leadership officially gave up on me. Saying I was a lost cause and should be discharged. My husband was a piece of shit. I went home and grabbed my concealed carry. 

I wrote a note and I wrote the same thing on Facebook. How no one even cared. We talk so much about mental health in the military but I didn’t have anyone. All of my peers looked at me like I was just faking things. Making up stories so I didn’t have to do training. I was at the end of my rope. 

But then this fellow SF girl I haven’t met came back from deployment, we will call her “B”. B saw me in the office doing paperwork and pulled me to the side, and said you ever need to talk, I’m here. 

I talked to her for hours about everything going on in my life. She instantly became my best friend I didn’t even think would exist in this world. She would come bring me coffee or lunch while I was on post. Called me every night to see how I was. Took me out for drinks and would just treat me like a person. 

I suckered it for 4 more years while still being SF. And was honorably discharged after my 6 year enlistment. Even made E5 on my first try. I divorced my husband and finally moved on with my life. 

All I can say is, there is always someone there for you when you least expect it. And if there are any vets struggling. Please reach out. It’s never easy to talk about things we struggle with.

Is there something better for me?,"So I’ve been looking for a backpack to be my daily driver for work. This Raven 20 is almost perfect, but it’s not quite there and I’m hoping someone can find me one that it. 

The things I like about this bag are first the aesthetic. I absolutely love the kind of square but kind of round look. The color I absolutely adore. I love that. It seems like there are two outside pockets for water bottles. I usually carry one water bottle and one mug of coffee, so that is perfect for me. I also really love how it seems like it would stand on its own.

Now, what’s not perfect are the pockets. Ideally, my bag would only have one pocket. I typically carry a 13 inch laptop, a 12.9 inch iPad, a couple of pens, a medium size notebook, typically a reference book, and then I like to put my keys and wallet in there. The bag I use right now, which is a Northface bag, Meet all these needs very well, except it does it through three different pockets. I hate having to open and close three pockets every time. So ideally, there would only be one pocket that would be able to contain everything I’ve mentioned. I like things to be neat and tidy in there, so I don’t want just a compartment where I can toss everything in there.

Any suggestions for something that would meet that list? Ideally, I’d like to stay right around $100. Thanks!",4,1738023947.0,ManyBaggers,2,1.0,False

1ibopie,https://www.reddit.com/r/onionheadlines/comments/1ibopie/with_the_anticipated_completion_of_rto_employees/,"With The Anticipated Completion Of RTO, Employees Will Once Again Become The Least Valued Asset That Leaves The Company Daily","""It's not that we don’t value them—it's that we value their desks more,"" says HR manager.

  
As businesses across the country scramble to reinstate mandatory Return-to-Office (RTO) policies, employees are once again being reminded of their true worth—namely, as expendable commodities that leave the office at 5 p.m. sharp, just like they did before the pandemic.

According to sources inside a mid-sized tech firm, the long-awaited completion of RTO is expected to return the company to its pre-pandemic status quo, where employees were no longer seen as the driving force behind success, but rather as interchangeable units leaving the premises every evening.

""It's been tough, you know? The pandemic made us rethink how much we *need* people,"" said Diane White, the company's HR director. ""But once we get everyone back in the office full time, we can go back to what really matters: the furniture, the snacks, and of course, the *productivity*—whatever that is.""

As employees slowly trickle back into cubicles, management is reportedly overjoyed by the return of their prized ""assets""—primarily their ergonomic chairs and the bottomless supply of pens that employees often take for granted.

“We've missed seeing people in person, sure, but more importantly, we missed the *visuals*,” White continued. “It’s just not the same when the coffee machine is empty and no one's physically here to refill it. That’s a *team effort* we can get behind.”

The shift is a long-awaited triumph for executives who were eager to replace the chaotic flexibility of remote work with the calm predictability of seeing their workers physically in front of them—sometimes even for hours without taking a break.

Employees, on the other hand, have been less enthusiastic about returning. Several employees, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, expressed frustration that their value at the company seemed to decrease proportionally with their ability to contribute from the comfort of their own homes.

""I was doing my best work remotely, but now I have to be here just so someone can see me walk out at the end of the day,"" said a senior developer, rolling his eyes. ""It's like, ‘congratulations, you’re back in the office. Now leave.’""

Despite this, experts say the future is bright for the corporate structure, with predictions that RTO will restore the powerful, but often overlooked, concept of the ""butts-in-seats"" economy.

""Remember, it’s not about how employees *feel* when they leave for the day—it’s about how much space their chair occupies in the office when they’re not there,"" said Linda Simmons, a corporate productivity consultant. “We need to make sure the office is stocked with enough plants and seating arrangements for the workday. Employees can leave, but their *space* should always feel alive.”

As the company's HR department gears up for the return of daily commuting, the next major initiative will focus on how to improve the overall *work-life blend*—also known as ""working while we actively don’t care if you’re having a breakdown.""

In the meantime, employees are encouraged to leave their emotions at the door as they file out of the office at 5:01 p.m., just as they were always meant to.",1,1738023770.0,onionheadlines,0,1.0,False

1iboofw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1iboofw/tomtvideo_early_gamer_parody_video_of_a_kid/,[TOMT][Video] Early gamer parody video of a kid playing Counter-Strike (possibly),"I’m trying to find an old video I remember seeing online in the early 2000s, likely from the Counter-Strike 1.6 days. It was a short parody video (not FPS\_Doug) about the life of a gamer, and it was pretty low-budget. Here’s everything I remember:

1. The video starts with **""Morning Mood""** (by Edvard Grieg) playing as the gamer wakes up.
2. The kid is in his bedroom, which I believe had a **tilted roof**, and it looks like an attic-style room.
3. He closes the window after waking up, then immediately sits down to game.
4. I think he was playing **Counter-Strike** (but I could be wrong).
5. He’s drinking a specific drink, possibly **caffeinated** or **iced coffee/tea**. I think the can was **yellowish**, and you can see a pile of empty cans on his desk. I remember you could see him grabbing multiple cans throughout the video
6. At some point, he gets frustrated and **throws some computer stuff (like a keyboard) out the window**. Then he calmly opens a drawer, grabs a new keyboard, plugs it in, and continues gaming.
7. There wasn’t much (or any) dialogue in the video, and the humor was very exaggerated.

It feels like it might’ve been a niche or viral video shared in the *CS 1.6* community or on sites like eBaum’s World or Newgrounds. I’ve had no luck finding it—anyone remember this?

I also have this vague memory that the kid was possibly german or swedish. 

I'm on a nostalgia trip and I suddenly remembered this, hope someone can help.

So i'm 23 i live in belgium and i have a long history with panic attack due to traumatic events and my child's history. During my teenage year i start having a lot of panic attacks (like everyday, and multiples times a day), i went to a lot of doctors who couldn't find why does i was having this much attacks (and i think also that at the time poeple and even doctors didn't care much about those since it was not something as documented as today).

 I try everything. Putting what was helping me on paper, looking online for videos, blog, articles ect who could help. (Some technique help a bit, like talking to poeple who care about you, naming things you see/feel, saying out loud that you're okay, putting water on your face) but nothing of what i knew stop the panic immediatly (beside strong calming meditation but i din't want to become addict to those) 

i didn't try drugs either because everytime i try it make things worse. And my mother didn't  help a lot at the time since i was having troubles with her and when i told her i was having a panic attack she would even sometimes yell at me instead of comforting me. 

So i went to a lot of psychiatrics ect... and one day i discovered by trying to stop drinking caffeinated drink (coffee too) that i was drinking to stay awake for school that THAT was the problem, after i stopped these types of drink by replacing them by tee (sometimes before or after the end of my scolarity like in 2020 or something).Since then i pratically never again experienced what was making my life a hell. Until today (i promise that i  ill get to the interesting part now). 

You see now i work at a job that i truly love and i think that it also help me cope with my anxiety sometimes but today at work i start feeling aches and not feeling well at the head, so i went home.

 There's this flu that's been going viral in my country and i think that that can be it, so today  when i went home i run in my bed, put a movie (spider-man across the spiderverse and up) i try to sleep or at least relax with the pain, however at 11pm when i took my 3rd medicine of the day to stop the pain i felt a bit weird sometimes after. And it felt really quickly like a panic attack i had at the time, but like it's been years i didn't had one of those i didn't quiet remember what i had to do( also i lost the paper with instructions).

 So i, at first try to remember by head,  then i try to rewrite on a new paper all the techniques i used before, all of this kind of work but i realised something... now that we are in 2025 we have more advanced tool than back then (plus my knowledge to these types of attack) i try for the first time to use something i never was able to try back then for these types of situations : using an artifical intelligence.

 You see i love stories about near future were robots can help you deal with a lot of problems and before (even if we got internet) there was, i think, no real tool to stop panic attack immediatly, at least for me. And since i know that talking to caring poeple helped me by the past i try to use the tool to try to replace those kind of poeple who are not around me if this kind of attack happens. 

So i opened chatgpt (that i was using more and more with time since it cames out) open the discussion button (that i didn't really a lot use but i knew how it worked) and i talk to her.

 It worked instantly ! because i was so much i my panic i didn't separate the algorythm with the real world, so to me it was like a real poeple try to calm me down with the right words and all and i loved it !

So after this i needed to share my experiments with those who experience the same or similarous experienced as me to help them too try to cope with those. Hoping that i could help someone who live with these today and who did'nt think about using AI for those kinds of situations. I know i talked a lot but if you wanna know after this attack (and with the medications i think) it feels like i smoked something so i dont know if anything i say is even coherent lmaoo.

I’m talking seed oils, any ingredient that doesn’t sounds natural, all ultra processed food, went from drinking 2-3 energy drinks a day to drinking a cup of coffee. 

I’m now eating lots of ground beef, ground turkey, steak, white rice, avocado, larabars, chicken, anything that is actually natural food. Then I stopped drinking energy drinks but now feel so out of it, unfocused, I drink coffee but it just makes me stay up no feel focused.  I just hit the 30 day mark by the way. 

I’m asking if anyone has experienced anything or if there’s anything I can do. I’m not tracking calories or anything and I don’t want to go back to the unhealthy food, but I have a business and the loss of focus has been horrible lol.

So i'm 23 i live in belgium and i have a long history with panic attack due to traumatic events and my child's history. During my teenage year i start having a lot of panic attacks (like everyday, and multiples times a day), i went to a lot of doctors who couldn't find why does i was having this much attacks (and i think also that at the time poeple and even doctors didn't care much about those since it was not something as documented as today).

 I try everything. Putting what was helping me on paper, looking online for videos, blog, articles ect who could help. (Some technique help a bit, like talking to poeple who care about you, naming things you see/feel, saying out loud that you're okay, putting water on your face) but nothing of what i knew stop the panic immediatly (beside strong calming meditation but i din't want to become addict to those) 

i didn't try drugs either because everytime i try it make things worse. And my mother didn't  help a lot at the time since i was having troubles with her and when i told her i was having a panic attack she would even sometimes yell at me instead of comforting me. 

So i went to a lot of psychiatrics ect... and one day i discovered by trying to stop drinking caffeinated drink (coffee too) that i was drinking to stay awake for school that THAT was the problem, after i stopped these types of drink by replacing them by tee (sometimes before or after the end of my scolarity like in 2020 or something).Since then i pratically never again experienced what was making my life a hell. Until today (i promise that i  ill get to the interesting part now). 

You see now i work at a job that i truly love and i think that it also help me cope with my anxiety sometimes but today at work i start feeling aches and not feeling well at the head, so i went home.

 There's this flu that's been going viral in my country and i think that that can be it, so today  when i went home i run in my bed, put a movie (spider-man across the spiderverse and up) i try to sleep or at least relax with the pain, however at 11pm when i took my 3rd medicine of the day to stop the pain i felt a bit weird sometimes after. And it felt really quickly like a panic attack i had at the time, but like it's been years i didn't had one of those i didn't quiet remember what i had to do( also i lost the paper with instructions).

 So i, at first try to remember by head,  then i try to rewrite on a new paper all the techniques i used before, all of this kind of work but i realised something... now that we are in 2025 we have more advanced tool than back then (plus my knowledge to these types of attack) i try for the first time to use something i never was able to try back then for these types of situations : using an artifical intelligence.

 You see i love stories about near future were robots can help you deal with a lot of problems and before (even if we got internet) there was, i think, no real tool to stop panic attack immediatly, at least for me. And since i know that talking to caring poeple helped me by the past i try to use the tool to try to replace those kind of poeple who are not around me if this kind of attack happens. 

So i opened chatgpt (that i was using more and more with time since it cames out) open the discussion button (that i didn't really a lot use but i knew how it worked) and i talk to her.

 It worked instantly ! because i was so much i my panic i didn't separate the algorythm with the real world, so to me it was like a real poeple try to calm me down with the right words and all and i loved it !

So after this i needed to share my experiments with those who experience the same or similarous experienced as me to help them too try to cope with those. Hoping that i could help someone who live with these today and who did'nt think about using AI for those kinds of situations. I know i talked a lot but if you wanna know after this attack (and with the medications i think) it feels like i smoked something so i dont know if anything i say is even coherent lmaoo.

I need your help, because for the life of me I cannot seem to find this fanfic I read a few months back. I remember certain scenes and things said in the fic, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the actual story written.

  
Ok here's what I remember:

* Kurt is living his best life in NYADA with Rachel (who is dating Brody). He gets asked out by Adam. They start dating, all the cute tings (meeting the family over videocall and helping Adams dad with car issues and his mom with fashion stuff) and eventually he asks him to go home with him because theirs a wedding or something (i think Burt and Carol's)
* Throughout their trip home Blaine continues to try and get back with Kurt to no avail
* Sebastian and David are living together and somehow end up becoming friends with Santana.
* One day while their all hanging out, Sebastian tells Kurt the truth...about how he would purposely egg on Blaine on to see if he would protect Kurt and expressed how Blaine would send him smexy messages and whatnot
* Tina for some reason is hanging around Blaine, as if he wanted to date him...Kurt eventually corners her in the bathroom and she confesses that she can get him to eventually love her (the girl is traumatized and depressed because she lost a baby and Mike doesnt know (she broke up with him because of it))
* They all eventually reconvene at a bar, Blaine tries to touch Adam while spouting some snarky nonsense, and he slams him into the bar. Kurt pulls him back and Blaine tries to swing on Adam with his back turned. Kurt's not having it and punches him, threatens him and Blaine runs away
* Adam/Kurt happy times and right as he's falling asleep the next morning, Santana bangs on the door stating that David/Sebastian had reunited and she needs a place to sleep
* Their drinking coffee and both decide to call Mike to let him know whats going on with Tina, and Mike jokes about the hickes on Kurts neck before he hangs up. Adam walks in asking whats wrong before they both start laughing

This is all I remember....if anyone has this fic I will forever be in your debt 🫣

Nvidia led the sell-off, plunging 17% and erasing $589 billion in market value, as fears mounted over the sustainability of U.S. dominance in AI. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 slid 1.5%, weighed down by Big Tech’s struggles.
* Not all was doom and gloom—the Dow Jones eked out a 0.7% gain, due to its limited tech exposure and a rotation into defensive stocks. As investors scrambled for stability, the market’s broader performance showed resilience, even as AI-related names bore the brunt of the fallout.

# Winners & Losers

# What’s up 📈

* **Akero Therapeutics** soared 97.52% after Phase 2 trials of its liver disease treatment efruxifermin showed positive results. ($AKRO)
* **Titan Machinery** surged 10.41% following a Baird upgrade to outperform, citing shrinking inventories as a key catalyst. ($TITN)
* **AT&T** climbed 6.25% on the back of a robust fourth-quarter earnings report that exceeded Wall Street expectations, with a 70% increase in net income. ($T)
* **D.R. Horton** added 3.04% despite a downgrade from Bank of America, as the homebuilder navigates a challenging housing market backdrop. ($DHI)
* **Travel + Leisure** rose just over 2.13% after Bank of America upgraded the company to buy, expecting double-digit EPS growth amid resilient leisure travel trends. ($TNL)
* **Apple** advanced 3.18%, standing out among big tech names as it sidestepped the broader AI selloff. Investors cited the company’s minimal AI exposure as a stabilizing factor. ($AAPL)

# What’s down 📉

* **Vertiv Holdings** sank 29.88% as the DeepSeek AI developments cast doubt on future AI infrastructure spending, which could hurt datacenter services demand. ($VRT)
* **Nvidia** tumbled 16.97%, experiencing its worst day since 2020, as the performance of DeepSeek's AI model raised concerns about the future value of high-performance chips. ($NVDA)
* **Broadcom** fell 17.40%, dragged down alongside Nvidia, as semiconductor names faced scrutiny over their role in AI infrastructure. ($AVGO)
* **SoFi Technologies** dropped 10.27% despite better-than-expected earnings, as weak fiscal guidance disappointed investors. ($SOFI)
* **Walgreens Boots Alliance** fell 4.51% following reports that an acquisition by Sycamore Partners may no longer proceed. ($WBA)

# DeepSeek Just Pulled a Fast One on Silicon Valley

What happens when a scrappy startup from China pulls off a David-vs.-Goliath upset? U.S. tech stocks lose a cool $1 trillion, and Nvidia logs the biggest single-day market cap wipeout in history. Enter DeepSeek, the new kid on the AI block, proving you don’t need billion-dollar budgets or cutting-edge chips to shake up the industry.

**AI’s New MVP**

DeepSeek’s latest AI model, R1, developed in just two months for under $6 million, is outperforming its American counterparts in benchmarks. Even more jaw-dropping? The startup used Nvidia’s less-powerful H800 chips—ones deemed “safe” by U.S. export controls. Their secret? An open-source strategy and efficient training methods that make Meta, OpenAI, and Google look like big spenders at an overhyped auction.

**The Fallout**

Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing $589 billion in market cap. Microsoft, Meta, and other tech darlings also tumbled. The Nasdaq 100 sank 3%—its worst drop in six weeks—while energy and infrastructure stocks tied to AI, like Constellation Energy, saw double-digit losses. But some, like Salesforce, could benefit if DeepSeek’s approach makes AI cheaper for end users.

**The Bigger Question**

DeepSeek isn’t just a shock to valuations; it’s a wake-up call for Silicon Valley. With China proving it can play the AI game on a shoestring budget, the days of unquestioned U.S. dominance may be numbered. Nvidia, Meta, and others might want to rethink their big-spending strategies, especially as investors start asking whether the AI boom has gone a little too... bubbly.

**What’s Next?** DeepSeek’s success could rewire the AI race, challenging the notion that throwing money at problems equals better results. But don’t count U.S. tech out yet—earnings reports from Nvidia, Microsoft, and others this week will reveal whether they’ve got what it takes to weather the storm. For now, though, DeepSeek has reminded the giants that every disruptor starts somewhere.

# Fed Faces 2025 with Rates on Lock

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of 2025 this week, and despite Trump’s not-so-subtle nudging, don’t hold your breath for any rate cuts. Jerome Powell and his crew are expected to keep the key rate at 4.3%, marking a cautious pause after last year’s three consecutive reductions.

**Why the Pause?**

Inflation is cooling—but not enough. Prices are hovering at 2.4%, just above the Fed’s 2% sweet spot, and the job market remains stubbornly strong, with unemployment at a low 4.1%. For Powell, the challenge is threading the needle: holding rates high enough to keep inflation in check without tipping the economy into a recession. With Trump’s proposed tariffs lurking in the background, inflation risks aren’t exactly taking a back seat.

**Trump vs. The Fed: The Rematch**

Trump has made it clear he’s not a fan of waiting. Last week at Davos, he said he’d “demand” lower rates, calling out Powell by name (again) and claiming he knows interest rates “better than they do.” For now, Powell isn’t taking the bait, but the tension between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Marriner S. Eccles Building is palpable.

**The Stakes**

Fed officials are divided. Some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, think inflation will keep easing, justifying future cuts. Others, like Cleveland’s Beth Hammack, argue that the Fed needs to keep rates elevated to fight stubborn price pressures. Add Trump’s tariffs and potential labor market disruptions into the mix, and it’s a recipe for uncertainty.

**What’s Next?** The Fed is signaling a cautious approach, with a “wait and see” stance likely to dominate this week. But don’t expect Trump to stay quiet—he’s already hinted at future clashes with Powell, whose term runs until 2026. Whether rates hold, drop, or—brace yourself—rise, the stage is set for a high-stakes game of monetary policy tug-of-war.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup is stacked with economic updates: the consumer confidence index, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index, and durable goods orders are all on deck. Plus, the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day FOMC meeting. While we’ll have to wait until Wednesday for any rate decision, expect plenty of chatter about what Jerome Powell and team are cooking up.

Earnings season stays busy with names like Boeing ($BA), Lockheed Martin ($LMT), General Motors ($GM), Royal Caribbean ($RCL), Kimberly-Clark ($KMB), and Chubb ($CB) taking the stage. JetBlue Airways ($JBLU) will test the airline sector’s hot streak, while Starbucks ($SBUX) looks to reverse three straight quarters of declining sales under its new CEO. Shareholders in both will be watching closely to see if they can deliver—or disappoint.

# Before Market Open:

* **JetBlue Airways** ($JBLU) is flying into turbulence ahead of its earnings report. Despite a banner earnings season for airlines, analysts aren’t feeling optimistic—six say “hold” and four say “sell.” The skepticism centers on JetBlue’s towering debt-to-equity ratio, dwindling cash flow, and mounting operating losses. Investors are crossing their fingers that robust consumer demand and the broader industry’s momentum can carry the airline higher. Expectations are set at -$0.31 EPS on $2.26 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Starbucks** ($SBUX) is brewing more than coffee—it’s trying to find its identity under CEO Brian Niccol. With three consecutive quarters of declining sales and sliding customer transactions, shareholders are banking on Niccol to deliver a turnaround. The chain is grappling with balancing its corporate behemoth status with its neighborhood-friendly vibe. Anything short of a rebound could send the stock steeply lower.

# DeepSeek Just Pulled a Fast One on Silicon Valley

What happens when a scrappy startup from China pulls off a David-vs.-Goliath upset? U.S. tech stocks lose a cool $1 trillion, and Nvidia logs the biggest single-day market cap wipeout in history. Enter DeepSeek, the new kid on the AI block, proving you don’t need billion-dollar budgets or cutting-edge chips to shake up the industry.

**AI’s New MVP**  
  
DeepSeek’s latest AI model, R1, developed in just two months for under $6 million, is outperforming its American counterparts in benchmarks. Even more jaw-dropping? The startup used Nvidia’s less-powerful H800 chips—ones deemed “safe” by U.S. export controls. Their secret? An open-source strategy and efficient training methods that make Meta, OpenAI, and Google look like big spenders at an overhyped auction.

**The Fallout**  
  
Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing $589 billion in market cap. Microsoft, Meta, and other tech darlings also tumbled. The Nasdaq 100 sank 3%—its worst drop in six weeks—while energy and infrastructure stocks tied to AI, like Constellation Energy, saw double-digit losses. But some, like Salesforce, could benefit if DeepSeek’s approach makes AI cheaper for end users.

**The Bigger Question**  
  
DeepSeek isn’t just a shock to valuations; it’s a wake-up call for Silicon Valley. With China proving it can play the AI game on a shoestring budget, the days of unquestioned U.S. dominance may be numbered. Nvidia, Meta, and others might want to rethink their big-spending strategies, especially as investors start asking whether the AI boom has gone a little too... bubbly.

**What’s Next?** DeepSeek’s success could rewire the AI race, challenging the notion that throwing money at problems equals better results. But don’t count U.S. tech out yet—earnings reports from Nvidia, Microsoft, and others this week will reveal whether they’ve got what it takes to weather the storm. For now, though, DeepSeek has reminded the giants that every disruptor starts somewhere.

A life within the MC and Jesse's betrayal to the club. I can only recommend you guys do the same. I couldn't stop reading and want more. Here's a snipped - mind you it's a fictional story.

# Chapter 1: Brotherhood Before the Storm

The morning sun filtered through the towering pines that lined Highway 97, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt. Deacon St. John slowed his bike to a stop just outside the Mongrels MC clubhouse, the low growl of the engine fading as he kicked down the stand.

The clubhouse, an old converted garage on the outskirts of Farewell, Oregon, had seen better days. Faded paint peeled off the walls, and a tattered American flag hung limply over the bar inside. To Deacon, it was more than a building—it was home.

Inside, the smell of stale beer and motor oil mixed with the faint aroma of bacon frying on a greasy griddle. Boozer, his best friend and fellow MC member, was leaning against the bar with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

“About time you showed up,” Boozer said, nodding toward Deacon as he walked in. “Thought maybe you decided to ditch us for Sarah’s fancy science lab.”

Deacon smirked and grabbed a cup of coffee from the pot on the counter. “Nah, man. She’s out in the field today. Some hike up Crazy Pete’s Ridge. You know how she is—plants over people.”

Boozer chuckled. “At least she keeps you in line. Someone’s gotta.”

The door swung open, and Jack, the club president, strode in. His leather vest bore the faded Mongrels insignia—a snarling wolf’s head encircled by flames. Jack was older than most of the guys, his graying beard and weathered face a testament to decades of riding the open road.

“Morning, boys,” Jack said, his voice gruff but warm. “We’ve got some business to discuss. Church in ten.”

Deacon and Boozer exchanged a glance. “Business” could mean anything—from settling a bar fight to running supplies for a local mechanic. Either way, it was never dull.

Fifteen minutes later, the guys were gathered around the long wooden table in the back room of the clubhouse. Jack sat at the head, flanked by the club’s enforcer, Dogg, a burly man with a scar running down the side of his face, and Roach, the club’s resident mechanic.

“All right,” Jack began, tapping his fingers on the table. “We’ve got a delivery to make up near Marion Forks. Just some spare parts for that old coot, Crazy Willie. Nothing major.”

Dogg snorted. “Crazy Willie still running that junkyard? Thought he’d have blown himself up by now.”

Jack ignored the comment. “Deacon, Boozer, you two handle the run. Shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours.”

Deacon nodded, already thinking about the route they’d take. The ride would be a nice distraction, a chance to clear his head.

As the meeting wrapped up, Boozer clapped him on the shoulder. “Guess it’s just you and me, brother. Let’s hit the road before Jack decides to send Dogg with us.”

The ride to Marion Forks was peaceful, the roar of their bikes the only sound cutting through the quiet of the forest. Deacon felt the familiar rush of freedom as the wind whipped past him. Beside him, Boozer was grinning, clearly enjoying the ride just as much.

They pulled into Crazy Willie’s junkyard a little after noon. The place was as much of a mess as Deacon remembered—rusted cars piled haphazardly, the faint smell of oil and burnt rubber hanging in the air. Willie himself was waiting for them, a wiry man with wild hair and a permanent smirk.

“Got those parts you wanted,” Deacon said, unloading a crate from the back of his bike.

Willie nodded, inspecting the contents. “Good, good. Appreciate it, boys. Say, you two wanna stick around for a drink? Just got a fresh case of beer.”

“Tempting,” Boozer said, “but we’ve got places to be.”

Deacon smirked. “Besides, last time we drank with you, Willie, Boozer ended up passed out in a wheelbarrow.”

Willie laughed, waving them off. “Suit yourselves. Ride safe, boys.”

As they headed back toward Farewell, the sun began to dip lower in the sky, casting the road in shades of gold and orange. Deacon glanced over at Boozer, who seemed lost in thought.

“What’s on your mind?” Deacon asked.

“Nothing, man,” Boozer replied, then paused. “Just thinking how things change, you know? Used to be, we didn’t have to worry about anything but the next ride, the next party. Now it’s like… everyone’s growing up.”

Deacon frowned but didn’t reply. He knew what Boozer meant. Things had been shifting lately—Jack talking about “settling down,” Roach spending more time at the shop than on his bike, and even Deacon himself, with Sarah and her world pulling him in a different direction.

“Change isn’t always bad,” Deacon said finally.

Boozer snorted. “Yeah, well, I’ll drink to that.”

They rode the rest of the way in silence, the hum of their engines a comforting constant in a world that was about to turn upside down.

# Chapter 2: Ashes of Brotherhood

The Mongrels MC clubhouse was alive with its usual chaos—booming laughter, clinking bottles, and the steady hum of patched brothers swapping stories about bad runs and good fights. Jesse Williamson sat alone at the edge of the pool table, nursing a beer like it was his only friend. His usual smirk was gone, replaced by a twitchy unease that had followed him for weeks now.

Deacon St. John leaned against the bar, watching him out of the corner of his eye. “You notice how Jesse’s been acting lately?” he muttered to Boozer, who was busy digging through a basket of peanuts.

Boozer cracked a shell between his fingers. “Acting like a bigger jackass than usual? Yeah. You think it’s the steroids, or is his face just stuck that way?”

Deacon snorted, but his face quickly grew serious. “No, man. Something’s off. He’s been disappearing for days. Heard he skipped out on the last supply run.”

“Shit,” Boozer said, popping a peanut into his mouth. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”

“That he’s up to something stupid?” Deacon frowned. “Yeah. Let’s find out how stupid.”

The truth came out faster than anyone expected—and it was worse than anyone feared.

Two days later, Deacon and Boozer pulled into the clubhouse lot, the low growl of their bikes cutting through the stillness of the night. The first thing they noticed was the blood. It streaked across the pavement in front of the garage, pooling in a dark red smear.

“What the hell…” Boozer said, hopping off his bike.

Deacon’s stomach tightened. “Where’s Tony?”

Tony was one of the club’s youngest members, a smart-mouthed kid who barely earned his patch last year. He was supposed to be watching the lot that night.

Inside the garage, they found him—sprawled on the floor, eyes wide open, blood still oozing from a knife wound in his gut. The smell of copper and oil hung heavy in the air.

“Jesus Christ,” Boozer muttered, backing up a step. “Who the hell—?”

Deacon already knew. He knelt beside Tony’s body, his jaw clenching as he spotted something on the floor. A small baggie of white powder. He stood, fury building in his chest. “It was Jesse.”

Boozer looked at him, stunned. “Jesse? You sure?”

Deacon nodded, his voice low and steady. “This is his mess. He’s been dealing. Tony must’ve found out.”

“Son of a bitch.” Boozer ran a hand over his shaved head. “Jack’s gonna lose his goddamn mind.”

The emergency meeting was held that same night. The mood in the clubhouse was tense, the air thick with anger and betrayal. Jesse was dragged in by two patched members, his face bruised and bloody from resisting. He spat blood onto the floor, his cocky smirk still intact.

Jack stood at the head of the table, his presence commanding as ever. His leather cut caught the dim light, the Mongrels MC patch gleaming like a warning. He stared down at Jesse with a cold fury that could melt steel.

“Tell me it ain’t true,” Jack growled. “Tell me you didn’t kill Tony over some goddamn drug deal.”

Jesse laughed, a bitter sound that echoed through the room. “Tony was in my way. Kid didn’t know when to back off.”

“Back off?” Jack’s voice rose, his fists slamming the table. “You gutted a brother! Over this?” He held up the baggie of powder, shaking it like it was poison. “We don’t touch drugs. That’s the goddamn rule. You broke the code.”

Jesse leaned back in his chair, his smirk growing wider. “Rules? That’s rich coming from you, Jack. How many lines have you crossed to keep this club alive?”

“Enough!” Jack barked, his voice cutting through the room like a blade. “You crossed the line, Jesse. You didn’t just betray me—you betrayed all of us.”

“Betrayed?” Jesse scoffed. “You think this brotherhood means something? It’s just a business, Jack. And I’m better at business than you’ll ever be.”

The room erupted. Members shouted, fists slammed on the table, and more than one chair was kicked over. Deacon stayed silent, standing against the wall with his arms crossed. His eyes were locked on Jesse, cold and unforgiving.

Jack raised a hand, silencing the chaos. “Jesse Williamson,” he said, his voice steady and final. “You’re out. You’re no brother of mine. No brother of *ours*.”

Jesse’s smirk faltered, his cockiness cracking for the first time. “You can’t just kick me out. I built this club as much as you did.”

Jack stepped closer, his face inches from Jesse’s. “Oh, we’re not just kicking you out. We’re making sure you never forget what happens to traitors.”

Jesse screamed louder than anyone thought possible as the branding iron hit his back. The red-hot metal seared into his skin, erasing the Mongrels MC patch tattooed there. Jack held the iron steady, his expression a mask of grim satisfaction.

The other members watched in silence, their faces hard. Boozer turned away, muttering under his breath. Deacon stood with his arms crossed, his jaw tight.

When it was over, Jesse lay in the dirt, his back raw and blistered. The smell of burned flesh hung in the air. Jack tossed Jesse’s vest down beside him. “You’re no longer one of us. Don’t come back.”

Jesse struggled to his feet, his face twisted in pain and rage. He looked at each of them in turn, his eyes burning with hatred. “You’ll regret this,” he hissed. “Every last one of you.”

He staggered toward his bike, leaving a trail of blood and ash behind him. The roar of his engine faded into the night, leaving the club in heavy silence.

Deacon finally spoke, his voice low. “You think he’ll come back?”

Jack lit a cigarette, exhaling a plume of smoke. “Oh, he’ll come back,” he said. “But he won’t be Jesse anymore.”",3,1738022768.0,DaysGone,1,1.0,False

How to navigate things with him?,"He flirts with me, he gets possessive when I talk to other guys, he gets jealous, he gets offended when I cut our conversation short, he checks me out a lot, he buys me lots of things like coffees and food and doesn’t do it for anyone else. 

I asked him last week why he is so nice to me. He got hurt and offended, told me he is not nice to me and is just “acting normal.” He asked what I meant by “nice.” I said “you go out of your way to talk to me and you buy me all these things.” He said “ I didn’t realize that was such a huge problem for you. I guess you would rather someone else do those things for you instead.” He refused to talk to me the rest of the night and was very grumpy. As I left, I told him that I really didn’t mind him being nice, I was just questioning what was going on and trying not to make things weird. He just rolled his eyes. He’s told me in the past that he likes situations explained to him, so I messaged him that night “I liked how you were acting: buying me things and talking. You told me you liked having situations explained, so. It felt nice. And it was a little hot.”

He didn’t open my message at all, and when I saw him the next day, he greeted me with a huge smile and said “ you gave yourself away! I promise, I won’t pay for any of your drinks!” I just laughed along and was nice and a little flirty with him. I didn’t want him to feel bad when he read the message. Sure enough, he read the messages that night. I saw him again a few days later, and he was so supremely awkward around me. He was a little bit pissed off, he would not wave at me or acknowledge my presence at all. He was clearly very nervous. He even waited in a back room for me to leave.

He’s very easily offended and very sensitive to rejection. I was trying to be helpful by explaining where I was coming from. But now Im feeling very….rejected and unsure of what’s going on.

Why would he be so supremely nervous around me all of a sudden, when last week he had been winking at me and holding doors open? What can I do to make him comfortable?",1,1738022661.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1ibo90a,https://i.redd.it/0lq7bua9lmfe1.png,The Number 23 [PART 1],"I've always been a night owl, but in the most extreme sense of the term. Even insomniac felt inaccurate. I would like to blame it on the graveyard shift at the bar. The neon sign outside flickers in a way that's oddly comforting, casting an eerie glow into the booths and bartop that's as consistent as my “insomnia”. The smell of grease, cheap vodka, and a hint of vomit fills the air, a constant reminder that it's 3 AM but this city never sleeps. Just like me. 

Being removed but still adjacent to the Vegas strip, we get a lot of interesting characters wandering in outside of our loyal regulars. Granted, our regulars were quite the cast themselves-- we had one guy who somehow always shit on the bathroom floor, Alice who was seventy but flirted like a teenager, someone I called Pirate Dan because he always wore a pirate hat and ordered rum
My personal favorite was an old fuck named Desi who had nicknamed me Piss because of the apparent smell of my bar. She's here every night, always tips well, and is always mean as hell to me. I've learned to love it. 

A new regular started coming in a few weeks ago. A girl who was always dressed in dirty clothes. She'd sit at the counter, nibble on an order of fries, sip a drink, and stare at me with eyes that held…something? It was a deeply intense gaze. At first, I thought she was just another Vegas night crawler, lost and seeking refuge from the night's shadows in the sanctum of an almost 24-hour bar. But her visits grew more frequent, and she began leaving notes scribbled on napkins with cryptic messages about meeting God and chosen peoples and obscure Bible verses and always, somewhere in the middle, the number 23. I threw them out at first, figuring her for a harmless nutter, but recently, the behavior was getting much more intense. 

One night, she didn't bother with the usual song and dance. She slid onto the barstool across from me, her eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and drug use. ""You're one of us,"" she said, her voice a low, urgent whisper. ""You don't know it yet, but you're special."" My first thought was to laugh in her face, but there was something in her gaze that stopped me. She was so sincere about it. It was creepy but intriguing. I set down the glass I was polishing and decided to humor her.

“That so? Because Desi thinks I smell like piss.” The old woman at the end of the bar cackled.

This girl ignored my joke. ""Your parents,"" she continued, leaning closer, ""they knew things. They were part of something that could change everything."" I felt a chill run down my spine, not from the cold, but from a memory I couldn't quite grasp. Parents? The word was as alien to me as the concept of needing sleep. I hadn't seen my parents since they lost custody of me when I was very young. I couldn't remember a thing about them, though, outside of them being arrested and me being shipped off to live with an uncle I hadn't even known existed. But she talked of them with such fervor and familiarity, her eyes shining with a fanatical light that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. ""They understood the 23s of the world,"" she murmured, her voice barely audible over the hum of the fridge. ""It's your age, you know. The age you stopped aging.""

I wasn't sure if I should laugh or not. 

""They were the most devout of followers,"" she said, her voice gaining strength. ""They sought the secret to the problem of age, so we could all meet God in the end. And they found it."" 

Now, I had to laugh. “You're fucking nuts,” I said, taking her half drank whiskey. “And you're cut off.”

“You don't believe me.”

I repeated myself. “You're fucking nuts.”

“You haven't aged since 23. Don't you wanna know why?” 

“Lady, I'm 28. And based on my daily aches and pains, I've been aging just fine.” Sure, I looked young for my age, I always had, but that could so easily be genetics or my lack of sunshine.

“They found it,” she said again. “They were the most devout amongst us and they succeeded.”

“Lady, you're in a cult. Get out while you can.”

“It's not a cult, it's a group of people who know the truth, and you're the proof!”

I had to roll my eyes at this point. “Every cult says they're not a cult. But sure, humor me, what did they find?”

“They found it,” she repeated once more with conviction. “The solution. But it came at a price.” Her eyes never left mine. ""They had to give something up."" My heart skipped a beat, only because she was practically staring into my inner being at this point. She looked like she was gonna cannibalize me. “A soul. Yours. For the gift!”

I studied her face, looking for any sign of a joke, but she was dead serious. She said her name was Lila at first, and she claimed to be part of the same cult that my parents had been in. The same cult that had sold my soul to find the secret to living forever, so they could “meet God”. ""They wanted to be the chosen ones,"" she said, her eyes wide with a mix of awe and horror. ""To live as long as the earth itself, to meet God at the end of the world."" The absurdity of it all was laughable, but the way she talked about it, with such confidence, almost made me feel like I was missing something crucial.

""Look,"" I sighed, “I don't know what game you're playing, but I've got to get back to work."" She reached out and placed her hand on mine, her grip surprisingly firm, and yanked me nearly over the bartop with shocking force. ""They want you to join us,"" she whispered, her breath hot against my skin. ""You're the proof that it worked. You're their legacy."" I pulled my hand away, wiping it on my apron. Legacy? All I felt was a cold emptiness where my soul would be. Should be. Is, no fucking shot was she telling the truth.

Lila didn't take the hint. She started showing up at my apartment after work, her dark eyes boring into me like she could see through to the void inside. I'd find her sitting on the stoop, her back against the peeling paint, her hands wrapped around a cup of coffee that flies floated in. She talked of rituals and prophecies, of how I could help the group grow, how we could all be chosen if we did it right. But I wasn't buying it, it was the ramblings of a freak. 

And yet, it was kind of getting to me. It was easily the lack of sleep-- all I wanted was to fucking sleep-- and it was making me question a lot about myself. Like, why couldn't I sleep? Anyone who slept as little as I did should be dead. The only times I slept were those once a month episodes where it was like my physical form got sick of my shit and just collapsed. I'd pass out, be out for a solid day or so, and then start the cycle all over again. I was also surprisingly hardy for someone who took so little care of himself. I ate like shit, when I did eat, and drank like a sailor. I never drank water because water is gross. I'd got hit by a car walking home from work once and spent only two hours in the ER, despite doctors telling me I should have died. I could not remember the last time I'd gotten even a head cold. I guess, if I was some immortal being, it would explain a lot. And yet, my life was so fucking lame.

No, no, she was just some nutter at the bar who'd grown obsessed with me. When I told my uncle about her, keeping some details vague, his only advice was to tell her to fuck off and that I swung for the other team. 

“Oh please,” I scoffed. “I don't think she wants to bang me.”

“Aw come on, emo pretty boys like you are all the rage again. Better get a boyfriend fast or break her heart, kid.”

“Rudie, you're not fucking listening. She's batshit, she's pretending like she knows who mom and dad are and is obsessed with the number 23-- she even has a fucking tattoo with it-- and telling me about all this cult shit. She’s shown up everywhere. For what reason? Like, what if she's right? What if she did know mom? And da--”

Uncle Rudie snapped at me. “Go. To. Bed. You're fucking delusional.”

“Go to bed? And what, sleep?” I laughed. “I'd fucking love to. But here I am coming to you with a real problem and you're dismissing me, you always fucking do this.” We had a lot of nights like this, and admittedly, my lack of sleep probably contributed to a lot of it. I could act like a shitty teenager sometimes. But Uncle Rudie was always more like a roommate than a father figure. Sure, he had my best interest at heart, but he knew shit about parenting and never knew how to help me with anything. 

“And what makes you think I know what to do!? Call the cops if you're that fucking worried, I don't know what you want from me. You work at a 24 hour bar in Las Vegas, what are you expecting? Normal fucking people? If you're scared of her, call the cops. But don't buy into her bullshit, have some sense.”

Maybe he was right, but… “Actually, we're a 23 hour bar, we close for an hour at lunch-- 23! That number keeps popping up, you don't think that's weird? Like, at all?”

“Shut up and go to bed, don't let this dumb broad convert you into some weird sex cult because you have mommy and daddy issues.” He dismissed me with a wave, taking a big swig of his Scotch as he did so. 

I held my tongue. He was right, I should sleep, but damn did I get sick of his dismissive attitude. Still, I reminded myself to be grateful to the fact he took me in again after an abusive relationship left me homeless. Funny, that happened and landed me back here when I was 23…

No, I wasn't ready to let it go yet. I bolted out of my room with vigor.

“Tell me about dad. You never say shit about him!” I shut the TV to force him to listen.

“I don't know shit! He left home to go live on some hippie commune when I was still a brat, shit, you know I was only fifteen fucking years old when you were born, right? And I didn't even know who the fuck you were till those social workers dropped your scrawny ass on my doorstep.”

“Hippie commune?” He'd never mentioned that before. “You never told me that! Why don't you ever tell me shit?” 

“Because my brother was an ass and ditched all of us. Didn't say shit to me, or mom or dad, we never knew he met a woman or had a kid. Just acted all high and mighty one day, said he had all the answers and told us all to fuck off. I'm glad you don't remember that prick, why should you?”

I had to concede defeat. I had really thought he was keeping secrets. That stalker girl with her weird words was getting to me. But it seemed he didn't really know anything. 

“I just… I don't know man. It's hard not knowing anything about myself. I'm not normal, I know I'm not, and it'd be nice to know why, yanno? Even if it's, I don't know, weird ass cult shit.”

“Trust me,” Rudie sighed. “The last time I saw your dad, he was not well. Got super righteous and churchy and just disappeared. And if this weird chick does know your folks, you don't want any of that. Yeah, you're a weird fucking kid, but there ain't no shame in that. You live in Las Vegas, weird fucking kids are a dime a dozen. Get over it.”

I sighed. “She's just…got me all on edge. I guess if I do see her again, I'll, I don't know, call the police or whatever.”

Well, I did see her again. But the police didn't do shit. They laughed me off, really. So I was stuck with my weird culty stalker. The more she came around, the less she freaked me out, though. She went from a genuine creep to just a nuisance. 

One night, Lila caught me at my most vulnerable—exhausted and fresh out of a fight with a patron I had to throw out. I'm genuinely a huge pussy, so when he swung, I froze and got myself a nice shiner.

Lila told me she knew how to give me back what I'd “lost"". I just sighed and thought to myself here we go again, I'm not in the mood tonight. I was rattled, but not from her, not anymore. I began to just get used to her popping up and starting with “Remember me? I'm--” followed by some name akin to Lila or Lena or Leelu or whatever. 

“That fight?,” I said with a snarky sigh, earning a slight snicker from Desi at the end of the bar. “Is that what I've lost?”

“Your soul,” she said feverishly. “But what if you could get back what you've lost with your condition?”

I just raised a brow and poured Desi another drink. 

""You don't want to live like this,"" she said, her voice soothing. ""Alone, forever. It's a prison, not a prison, not a gift.”

“What's a prison?,” I asked, confused at what she meant. 

“You're able to live forever,” she hummed. “You get to meet God! But at what price? You don't sleep, do you? That's a side effect I bet. And you'll have to watch everyone you love die. Come with me and we can fix it?”

“No fucking shot,” I said, trying not to fall in.

“Hey, Piss, make the next one a double!” Desi was great at killing the tension and keeping me grounded here, to this bar, not to some weird immortality cult shit.

I took Lila Luna Leela’s glass away from her. “You're cut off. Actually, you're banned. I'm sick of seeing you.”

“But you don't want answers? A hundred years from now, you'll be all alone as you wait to meet God. Do you want that, Nero?”

“You don't even know my name, and you want me to believe you knew my parents? Get lost.”

“Names are irrelevant in the grand scheme of time, which you have all of in the world. But I do know! I know you're a Capricorn, you were born on New Years, in a California desert town called--”

This time I took her fries away and loudly threw them in the waste bin. “Get out, you freak.” 

That kept her away for maybe three weeks. I thought maybe I was rid of her. But in truth, she was laying low, watching out of sight, and waiting for me to be just vulnerable enough. 

I was trying to find someone, anyone to cover the rest of my shift. I could feel it coming, the collapse. I had passed out in the cooler at work once and that was not a day I wanted to repeat. Thank God for Dahlia. She assured me she'd be there in five. 

I must have looked worse for wear, because even Desi was showing me pity. “Son, why not sit down after you pour that?” Of course, she wanted her drink first. I nearly dropped it as I gave it to her, I was starting to feel so dazed. 

Dragging my feet, I slumped into an empty booth seat and tried to wait for Dahlia to show up. But I didn't make it, within minutes I was out cold. Ordinarily, any one of my coworkers would call Rudie, but apparently, someone said they knew me and I ended up in the back of some strangers' car.

Well, she wasn't a stranger. I'd gotten to know her uncomfortably well at this point. By the time I came to, it had to have been close to four hours. I was still terribly groggy, not having slept nearly enough, but something within me told me shit wasn't right, and I jolted awake. The scenery outside was both familiar and not. It was the desert, but not the desert I was used to. A sign reading “Zzyxx” gave me an idea of where we were. 

“You're fucking kidnapping me!?” Lula had me in her backseat. I wondered how she even managed that when I'd told everyone at the bar what a weirdo she was. She tossed a wig in the back. 

“Said I was your sis and they bought it! I'm very sorry, this isn't how I wanted to show you, but you have to! You have to see it!” 

I genuinely did not want to see shit. I tried to open the door, ready to throw myself onto the asphalt to avoid her and wherever she was taking me, but she had child locked the doors. “You're. Insane.”

“You're the one! The Child of the Void, you need to see it!”

I kicked the back of her seat as hard as I could. Somehow, she was unphased. I tried the windows, but again, child lock. 

I wasn't ready to give in though. I calmly crawled into the front seat, slumping down like I was giving up. As soon as she opened her mouth to spew nonsensical babble once more, I lunged over and fought her for the wheel. We veered about the road, skidding on and off it. Lucky for us, these desert side roads were pretty barren. 

“You just don't get it yet!,” she cried out. 

“I don't wanna get it!”

“But you're proof, proof of the new religion--”

“Eat shit and die,” I spat.

The car spiraled a minute, unceremoniously tipping side to side before stopping in the sand. Lana and I were both dizzied, but I had adrenaline on my side. I kicked the driver side door open and stepped on her as I barrelled out. I hoped it hurt. 

My face met sand and dazed me a moment before I scrambled back to my feet and took off running. Where? Anywhere at this point.

“You won't make it far!” I heard Liza shout. “You need me!” Strange, she wasn't following me, as if she knew something I didn't. 

“YOU need help!,” I shouted, flipping her off as I did so.

The sun scorched the land, making the horizon warbled and the air stale. Every breath I sucked in felt like I was giving head to a blow dryer. It had to have been over 100°, easily. But hey, if I was this so called immortal being like this nutjob claimed, I guess this was a good way to test it. 

I had no way of knowing where I was or where the nearest highway was. She'd either taken my phone or I left it in the car; either way, I was completely stranded on all fronts. No wallet either. Being alone with my thoughts, they naturally bounced back to my past. Memories I was sure I had forgotten were starting to bubble through, as if the grueling climate was forcing me into a vision quest. 

In Joshua trees, I saw my parents, in the distant windmills, I saw crosses. That's right, our house was full of crosses, adorned with the number 23. I remembered, for the first time in my life, my parents' faces. They were so cold looking. They were gaunt and placid, as if they'd been malnourished. Only my mother smiled, but never at me. She was always pulling me away from the windows and doors, telling me I wasn't needed out there. I remember only being allowed to eat soup…

The only one who left the little shack we lived in was my father. When he did, he always had a backpack full of books and papers and what not. He only left like, once a month, and would be gone for days. 

At this point, the sun was high in the sky, frying me like an egg. This was the most sunshine I had gotten probably ever, and I felt like it was affecting my psyche. Who said sunshine was good for you? This sucked. I was sweaty and sticky and I wanted to vomit. I did vomit. I couldn't see a road, couldn't see a car, and I wondered if I had really fucked up with my escape plan. 

Lack thereof.

“I'm gonna fucking die,” I laughed. I should have made a plan. But I didn't. So I sat down and gave up, ready for the desert sands, or a snake, or a gila monster to take me. 

But none did. I watched the sun climb up, and down, until the cooler night air began to settle in. This time, I was fighting sleep, still on edge. Sure, I'd said I was ready to die, but I wasn't quite ready to confront that. I found myself mindlessly drawing 23s in the sand, still thinking about my youth and probably losing brain cells. 

Between the blips of memory, something stuck out. It was the one time we'd had guests over. If they were part of this cult, I suppose these were the other cultists. They ooo'd and aww'd over me for awhile, congratulating my parents for bearing the “first child”. Did none of the other cultists have kids? I remembered the mood shifting sharply all at once, and pain. Such pain. And then, business as usual for at least a year or so, before police came and arrested my parents (and possibly everyone else). I remember the social worker's face better than my parents. She was a nice lady, but she always looked confused. I probably said weird shit to her. 

It came and went, until I tasted sand as I collapsed once more.

So she did know something I didn't, because when I woke up again some time later, I was on a bed in some dingy windowless room. 

“I watched you sleep.” It was Linda, smiling frantically.

“You knew I was gonna…” My voice trailed off.

“I assured you you would not go far. But that is ok. I'll forgive all the resistance because we made it. Now I can show you, and you'll finally get it.”

“No.”

“No?”

“No,” I repeated. 

“We’ll help you understand. Sorry for this.” 

She promptly got up and exited, locking the door behind her. I was sure she'd come back with some bodyguards or something to beat me into submission, but it was kind of worse than that. She left me alone for God knows how long. Hours and hours and hours and hours with me and all of my thoughts, a buzzing light that wouldn't turn off, and no windows to even guess how long I'd been alone. It was maddening. No new memories resurfaced, just those same glimpses over and over, like a horribly edited movie. None of it made sense. The first couple of hours were annoying, but the longer it dragged on, the more dreadful it became. I ripped up the paint on the door I clawed at it so desperately. I banged myself up trying to tackle it. I just wanted to break out. When I was sure it wasn't happening, though, I laid down and gave up. I tried to smother myself with the pillow, but nothing happened. Maybe it really was all true.

I should feel happy and excited but I’m so terrified of completely losing myself and my youth. I’m in great shape and am honestly pretty vain about my appearance. I love to drink wine and coffee so much it’s part of my personality. I like to dress “young” - crop tops, short shorts, crazy makeup, you get the idea.

And everyone just tells me how awful pregnancy and parenting is and how I’ll be a slave to motherhood. I know I’m great with kids because I babysat my whole life and work in EMS now so I still deal with kiddos. I love being around them.

Cognitive decline took a scarier turn after a night of lack of sleep but still went to work. My cognition has remained at scary levels since this (extreme derealization/always living in a dream, slow processing speed, occasional delirium, extreme fatigue). Levels that do not feel safe for my job. I had an EEG on Friday which was normal. I had a repeat MRI of my brain, cervical and thoracic spine to assess any changes from the June 2024 scan ~7 months ago. There were the changes/abnormalities noted in my brain:

Volumetric analysis:
1. Abnormal low 13th percentile.
2. Inferior lateral ventricular volume within normal limits, superior lateral ventricular volume reported as elevated, 88th percentile however this may be confounded due to the presence of cavum septum pellucidum.
3. Hippocampal volume borderline abnormal low 20th percentile.
4. Cerebral White matter volume abnormal low 21st percentile.
5. Cortical gray matter volume borderline abnormal low 29th percentile.

My current neurologist told me there was nothing concerning for her on the report. She said will refer me to psychiatric care given all my normal labs and suspects depression for all my symptoms. I reached out requesting if she can elaborate on this section since everything else was normal prior and I am still having a difficult time understanding how my symptoms get triggered by things that wouldn’t make sense with depression/stress (such as my full body tingling the moment I take a sip or two of alcohol, feet go numb on a run or hike, hand goes numb when I grab a hot cup of coffee, etc). I tried anxiety meds to give them the benefit of the doubt a few months ago and it did not alleviate any symptoms. 

I have been doing all the things to relieve any stress/anxiety that I can. I live a healthy lifestyle; I workout 5x/week involving weightlifting or intense CrossFit-style workouts, I go running and hiking, I switched to a Mediterranean diet at the beginning of all this, I have a healthy social life, I’ve been reading and journaling more and listening to self-help podcasts.. It was difficult for me to believe the doctors but now after my third neurologist suggesting it after this MRI, I am becoming more open to it. My symptoms just feel too scary and extreme for it to be that. I don’t understand. I genuinely did not feel depressed at the onset of any of this. Depression only hit once the cognitive portion took a nose dive in November. 

Given the MRI results noted, is this indicative of a depressed brain? This has been a journey of hell, so finally just putting this out there for some thoughts.

1ibo3f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/phadvice/comments/1ibo3f4/dating_advice_please/,Dating advice please,"Omg, bakit pasok na pasok sa banga yung mga reels sa ig ko ngayon. Need inputs nadin sana

Just got out of a 4years relationship and after 2months nagchat yung crush\[26F\] ko this December 2024 and ako\[31M\] naman siyempre nagreciprocate kasi namimiss ko yung feeling na may sinesendan ka ng reels and to be loved and may constant na kausap about anything and everything lang. Btw, single na siya ng 4months dahil sugarol yung ex niya? Anyway

**(December 8-14  Highlights)**

\-1st date namin nag brunch lang kami then usap about exes ganon, inaya ko siya the day before. Then hinatid niya ko sa sakayan ng UV(Ako nagsabi) since out of the way na yung house niya and also I don't want to bother her masyado na para dun pa sa terminal ng trike magpahatid.

\-Message message kami sa messenger, sinasabihan pa ko ng ""Bilis mo naman magreply kahit nagggym ka, why would i settle for less hahaha"" parang ganon, so kinilig ako then usap usap.

\-2nd date namin dinner na, nag-aya ako(ako din pala nag-aya sa 1st date) ng dinner, which is 1hr before niya mag out and ganun ulit sinundo niya ko sa terminal then nag dinner sa katips tapos nag coffee after, ang kaibahan lang, sa mejo walking distance na ng house niya ko hinatid tapos nilamas ko yung suso niya tapos kiniss sa cheeks

\-Message message sabi ko ""*I'm sorry sa ginawa ko with \*umiiyak na emoji*"", sabi niya ""*it's okay gusto ko din naman \*with laughing emoji*""

**(December 15-21 Highlights)**

\-3rd date namin is inaya ko siya mag hotel para makipag kantutan pero with the premise lang na ""hangout"", pumayag agad siya kahit kinabukasan na yung date. And ayon, sinundo niya ko sa SM then punta sa hotel, kahit may work kami parehas(9pm-5am ako, siya 1pm-10pm)\[\[Flexi time ako kaya nakakatakas ako sa mga unang dates namin\]\], ayon konting netflix tapos nagkantutan na kami. Confident naman ako sa kama gaming ko but anyway usap usap about life. One thing that struck me the most is habang binabayo ko siya, sabi niya ""*Pag nabuntis mo ko anong gagawin mo*"", habang binabayo ko siya sabi ko ""*Kaya kitang panagutan at pakasalan*"". Then ayon, tambay sa hotel hanggang sa umuwi kami.



**(December 22, 2024-January 18, 2025 Highlights)\*3weeks**

\-4th date namin is dinner ulit pero napapansin kong parang tamad na tamad siya. Lagi ng nasa phone nung kumakain kami. ayon hinatid niya na ko ng mas malapit pa sa walking distance sa bahay.

\-Naging cold na yung mga replies niya? Laging sinasabing ""*I just need to fix my shit"", ""I don't want to burden you with my problem"", ""Walang gas"", ""Parang ayaw mo ipakita kung sino ka kaya naiilang ako*"".

\-Never na siya nag spark ng conversation, hirap na hirap na kong buhatin yung convo.

\-Kada mag-aaya ako lumabas sa 3weeks na yan lagi niyang sasabihin cannot be daw kasi busy ganon, family time, pupuntahan daw bestfriend niya.

\-Ramdam ko na mukha na kong tanga talaga.

\-Nung new year binati ako na ""thank you for being always there for me"" keme

\-Feeling anxious nadin and di makawork ng maayos(Dev ako)

\-Sinabihan ako bigla ng ""*Slow burn*"" daw ang gusto niya, which in my book translates to ""Let's take it slow"" or in tagalog ""Makaramdam ka naman ayoko sayo""

\-Sinabihan ko siya na ""*Ano ba tayo? Kasi nahihirapan na ko alamin where I stand eh""* humirit siya ng long message na ""*blah blah blah... I know I'm treating you shitty this past few days I will understand if you decide to talk to other girls*"" siyempre inassure ko siya na once okay na yung ""shits"" niya nandito padin ako for her.

\-Pag may pressing questions ako laging ""HAHAHAHA"" yung reply

\-Kada aya ko sasabihin lang niya oo tapos biglang bbackout mga 12hrs before kasi daw biglang may errands



(**January 19-25**)

\-This time din pala I decided na bawas bawasan yung pagka clingy ko

\-Biglang nagbago ang simoy ng hangin, naguupdate na siya, nagssend ng selfie and everything, sinesend niya pic ng pusa niyang persian, video ng pusa niyang persian.

\-Bigla niya naopen-up na parang na ppressure siya gusto na niya magka-pamilya, then nagsend ng pic ng pregnancy test na negative(Oks lang naman mabuntis ko siya pero wag sana ngayon) tapos sabi niya ""*wala negative eh try again nalang lol*"" sabi ko nappressure siya sa mga ka batch niya and social media then nag-agree siya

  
**(January 26-27)**

\-Hindi na cold yung replies niya

\-Inaya ko siya maghotel ulit kasi baka kantot lang pala hanap niya sakin, chine-check ko kung papayag, kasi dun sa nakaraan pag date brunch/dinner ayaw eh. Ayon parang ayaw din kasi sinegueyan niya lang ako. I said ""*sorry if I'm acting weird kakabasa ng memes kasi na memes na kita"".* Bigla na niyang sinabing ""*Ihahatid ko si kuya sa airport. Daanan kita? Gutom ka ba or something?*""



**(Today)**

\-Nakatulog daw siya at nag grab nalang yung kuya niya, pero g daw siya today brunch date ng 9am.

\-Ano na gagawin ko, wala pa kong tulog pero oks lang naman

\-How should I act, nawala na yung pagka cool ko dati.

\-Please remember yung sinabi niyang ""Slow burn"" daw. 4times ko ata siyang kinukulit at yun lagi ang sagot niya with the naiiratang tone sa message. So maybe it's out of the table na?",1,1738022106.0,phadvice,0,1.0,False

For context I M26 have just got into a relationship (its very fresh) with Beth (fake name) F21. Hear me out here, me and Beth have been seeing each other casually for 2 or 3 months. This has been my friskiest relationship ever - Beth is open minded and into exploring everything lets just say we've been around the globe ;). 2 weeks ago Beth sent me an article regarding polyamory which is a new (and exciting) topic for me. That weekend we went to a bar we've never tried. After a couple of drinks and ogling hot women as a couple we approach Rachel (fake name). My girlfriend and I were on the same page and after a few more drinks with Rachel we invited her home with us. Rachel joined us in our uber - I suddenly felt nervous as this is all new to me but before I could say anything I heard some heavy breathing and turned to see Beth with her hand up Rachel's skirt. Once the uber dropped us off at my apartment I can't lie my nerves turned into excitement and we headed pretty much straight to the bedroom. Most of my night was spent giving and not receiving and I began to feel neglected. Over the next week and a half my Gf invites Rachel over and the situation repeats itself again and again. I feel pent up and I read more on polyamory and realised I could have my own ""play partner"". After making a tinder I meet Jenny F24 (again fake name). She was my first match and we met soon after lots of frisky texts. I was so tense from my nights with Beth and Rachel that we didn't make it home before things heated up. We couldn't help but make use of that coffee shop bathroom haha. Jenny and I continued to see eachother after my nights with Beth and Rachel (I felt guilty seeing her otherwise). However 2 days ago Beth texted me saying she was going for coffee with Rachel. This set me off as my gf loves making use of public bathrooms too. I felt left out and pent up, so I invited Jenny over. I didn't want to invite my ""play partner"" into our ""love space"" (I had read this online). So Jenny and I started to hook up on the couch - we were in a very explicit position when Beth using her spare key came through the door. She immediately screamed and burst into a hysterical fit kicking Jenny out. Beth locked herself in the bathroom and would not listen to my explanation or anything I have said. She won't reply to my texts and stands by the idea that I was cheating. However I didn't intend to deceive Beth I assumed it was ok to have a private ""play partner"" after everything I had read. I explained all of this to Beth and how I felt neglected and like a slave to her and Rachel - and I thought she had 'play partners' of her own. So aita for ""cheating"" in a polyamorous relationship when all the rules are new to me and I was following what was mentioned in the article?",0,1738022075.0,AITAH,8,0.25,False

1ibo1pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1ibo1pt/why_did_you_decide_to_quit_smoking/,Why did you decide to quit smoking?,"I’m 27f and I’m on my 7th day of cold turkey quitting, because quitting gradually just didn’t work…

Reason 1: I have to say I only smoked when I drank (or so I thought at first), this meant that I started to drink more often and seek out other opportunities to go out a find correct environment for a cig, to justify having a cig, like to have a cuppa coffee at a local bar, which then would end up with a pint, which would lead to chain smoking… so I ended up spending 3-4 nights a week drinking, I’d go to pub at 5pm and the rest of the evening:night would be gone, only 2-3 pints would get me tipsy cuz I’m light weight and then I’d feel hangover the next day and waste half a day feeling a bit unwell (which could do cuz I’m self employed). FYI I have no addiction to alcohol, I purely would do it to justify social smoking. 

Reason 2: I am paranoid about my health, I had wheezing in my lungs for a year. My grandad never smoked in his life and sadly passed away from lung cancer which makes me really paranoid. I am on a pill, and smoking on a pill increases risk of blood clots times and times. 

Reason 3: I felt so pity for myself, I hated feeling groggy, wasting my days either being hangover and groggy or craving looking forward to going out. Like I was loosing control of life to this object, this paper/plant stick, what on earthy?! Im a human with a brain and my life is going down hill due to this little paper stick?!

Anyways I’m struggling… I fucking love smoking, and I hate it too, I love the ritual how relaxing it is , I love sitting bitching with my friend Bridget jones style and chain smoking, but also it’s ruining my life… I guess I would’ve been okay if I just smoked without having to link it to drinking or “correct situation/environment” for smoking, but then I’d have way higher anxiety about health… 


Share your stories and reasons why you decided to quit? 

I feel like being able to relate to other people or even hearing other people’s stories would really help me through this…

I’ve found what I can only describe as “droplets” or like someone spilled coffee/coke. But neither myself, nor my daughter drink coffee or coke.

I’m considering breaking up with her,"To those who were worried my ex-girlfriend would trash my place, nothing like that happened.

I talked to her in person. She said I was misunderstanding everything. She began to cry, which was difficult for me. There was a moment where I wanted to forget all of it so I could hug her. I held back because something felt different.

She asked me if I hate her. Obviously, I don't. I said I am tired of feeling like the person I love is not who I thought they were. Ever since she introduced me to her parents (and close friends circle, which I didn't talk about) I have seen a side of her I don't recognize.

After meeting her parents for the first time and the strange behavior started to add up, I gave her an opportunity to come clean. I asked her to tell me everything. I told her I can't help you if you leave me in the dark. I even warned her if I find out later, it's over. Because of the way she chose to answer me during this conversation... every action I took, I held back.

All she had to do was tell me what was going on. I would have helped her take on everything. Instead, she chose to trick me in cruel ways while acting helpless and innocent when I questioned her about it. I shielded her all this time. She manipulated everyone around her, including me.

Everything is confusing now. I look back at all of our time together and feel crazy. I can't differentiate anymore... her true feelings about anything.

She tried to explain the stress of pleasing her friends and family made her act this way but she doesn't share their views or doubts about me. She said she's never loved anyone the way she loves me and her feelings scare her. I wish she would just admit she had too much fucking pride.

I understand she is the way she is probably due to how she was raised. But some of the things she has said and done are unforgivable. The conversation went on but everything was still other people's fault. She wasn't taking any accountability.

So I stood by my decision (to stay broken up).

To be honest.. by hesitating for even that singular moment when I wanted to hold her, she showed me the side of her that comes out when she doesn't get her way. For the first time, I felt like what I was seeing is actually her true self.

We were having this conversation while walking outside. We had stopped walking and she was wiping her tears. When she realized I wasn't going to comfort her, she started to say degrading things about me. She also brought it up again that my life is easier than hers because I grew up with no parents. This comment was so fucked up it made me laugh. I told her she's so privileged she has no idea what it even means to have a hard life.

Because I laughed, I could tell she wanted to throw her coffee at me (she didn't). Instead, she said some more things about me and I realized I don't care anymore because I don't even recognize this woman who is yapping in front of me.

Since then, she has emailed me an excel spreadsheet of all the money I owe. The things she has itemized are things like ...  all the times she upgraded me on a flight, luxury gifts she has bought me on birthdays, Christmas etc. She also included ridiculous things like estimated cost of gas x amount of times when she was my designated driver. And pregnancy tests ( I think she added this just to mess with me). I'm not going to bother explaining my contributions. This email made me sick.

I packed her things that were in my apartment.

I had a friend come over when she came to collect them. She didn't know this. I answered the door and she pushed against me and tried to initiate. I didn't return her advance and she got angry and scratched me. I think maybe she was trying to slap me but couldn't reach. I'm not really sure because it happened too fast and I restrained her.

My friend came out and began calling her on it. He made a show of taking a video and threatened her with assault. I think it embarrassed her so she probably won't do something like this again. The only downside to his presence was.. I think she will try to convince herself I rejected her in that moment because he was there.

For people asking about my dog. He's happy and comfortable (and still alive). He eats well unlike his age. My priorities are to improve the quality of his life, not unnecessarily prolong it. But every night I check on him before I fall asleep. And every morning I wake up with this feeling of dread. He has Cushing's disease and chronic pancreatitis. He is high risk for developing cancer. The medication routine is a bit complex but I am learning everything so l can for him. Take care of your pets and check them often for lumps. A lot of animals hide their pain. I guess we have that in common. Ah... maybe I shouldn't have ended the post like this.

Anyway. I'm really okay.  I posted this 'update' because I got a lot of messages and it's easier than answering them separately.

In case I don't feel like answering comments, I will just leave this here:

There is a lot I haven't shared. There is a lot I haven't even admit to my self yet. I am not saying I am perfect. It's not about being right or wrong anymore. I have a lot of flaws too. I'm sure I handled some things poorly. And I know I was a fool.

I.. also still experience moments where my heart aches and I question if I’m wrong about everything, wanting to just get back together. Hopefully this will get easier with time. Anyway. Writing here counts as therapy right?

* Horror in general

For lunar new year my dad made homemade dumplings. My mom got off work and just started going off on him. She's annoyed, she hates that he did this. She was scoffing and rolling her eyes and pointing out all the things he did wrong. My dad said he was going to make dumpling soup for dinner and she just rolled her eyes and went to her office. Later she made her own dinner, and then when my dad came down and finished making the soup, she gets up and goes downstairs, slams the door. 

This is the least worst thing she does. But I was sitting watching the whole thing, and normally if she's in her cold bitch mode it's directed to me, but seeing her do that to my dad really messed with me. I was sobbing into my soup and  hyperventilating. I didn't expect to have such a physical reaction to it all, you know?

  
This woman laughed in my face and yelled across the room to ask my rapist if he did, in fact, rape me. She told me I was a liar and looked at me with disgust. Years later when she discovered the truth, she cried and cried, and her first words to me was that I was supposed to stay pure until marriage. I think that's when I just totally disconnected from her. Even in 5th grade I knew that was some disgusting priorities she had. Now I'm 27, jobless, no education, living with my parents. my rapist is living a successful life, and I just want everything to end. I can't believe I'm crying over dumplings, but here I am. 

  
I have a soft spot for my dad. I have empathy for my mom, she had to live amongst such misogyny and had to feel so alone being a foreign country with just my dad's family. But my dad was the one who took me out for a drive after a screaming match with mom, get me some coffee or ice cream and just let me cry in the car without judging me. 

I just don't get it. The biggest problem in their lives is me, the freeloading adult child. But they ignore this huge issue, and have this petty fight over soup. Idk. I still really think I love my mom, I send her gifs and we act like we love each other. But when I'm alone in my thoughts, I feel pure rage. Just a pure hatred for my rapist and even MORE rage to my mom for enabling it. She's worse in my eyes. yet, I want to protect her, I want to be rich so I can provide for her, and make her happy. It's all just so fucked. I want her to be fucking proud of me, but she doesn't DESERVE to see my success or reap any benefits. I'm finding myself hating her so much that I am denying myself happiness to be spiteful. 

And I'm realizing I'm too much like her now. Petty, spiteful, like she is to my father  over fucking dumpling soup",1,1738021503.0,NarcissisticMothers,1,1.0,False

1ibntlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ibntlm/i_despise_my_overindulgent_mom/,I despise my overindulgent mom,"I'm sorry for the length of this. I don't quite know what to do with these feelings anymore. 

I absolutely, violently, despise my mother. The feelings are way, way, way out of proportion - it's proper, seething hate. I've been repressing it for fifteen years. I haven't even a microsecond of patience left in me, and it's not fair on her. It must all look very strange.

It's a problem of misrecognition. I'm 27 - minimally employed, chronically ill-disciplined, immature, spoiled, and with a real streak of pride and cruelty running in me. My younger brother is much the same. We have our virtues, but we're highly flawed people. 
And the problem is this: our mom adores us. She doesn't love us - she adores us. Adores us beyond all recognition. And I mean this quite literally: she found God by giving birth to me. She's repeatedly said I'm the only reason she's not killed herself. I'm all she's got to live for, the only solace she's found an awful world. I'm not human, or even her son: I'm a saint.

If I make her a coffee; if I call the electricity company for her; if I text her - I am not just thanked, I am told (every time, at great length, as she either cries or is on the verge of crying) that I'm wonderful. I'm so smart and so talented, so brave, so put-upon. I've had such a hard life. The world's treated us so badly; everyone else has had it easy. She wishes, quite often, that I'd had cancer; my life would have been easier. A childhood friend of mine did in fact have cancer, and he later confided in me that he'd grown up believing, through speaking to my mom, that I was suffering so much worse than he was. My friend's infant daughter has recently developed cancer; in private conversation, my Mom has literally spat at me with fury that she's been given cheap housing, that my friend's community has rallied around her. 

My younger brother (26) is a drug addict. He is schizophrenic, but the drugs, violence, lying and stealing all came long before the schizophrenia did. He has repeatedly assaulted Mom (and myself, and my dad, cops, neighbours, retail workers) stolen from her, kicked down her bedroom door in rage. When he takes drugs - he needed the emotional relief. When he steals to buy drugs - well his testosterone levels are way out of whack, sweety. When he says he's not taken drugs (as powder clings to his nose), she believes him. When he's on release from the psych ward, he's allowed to drink. Every outburst is forgiven, every court appearance explained away: it's all the predestined outcome of a medical, chemical imbalance (which only she, and no doctor, can ever fully understand). Neither he or I are capable of unkindness or sin. We are capital V Victims: faulty bundles of chemicals that only she can fix.

This isn't love; it's not even kindness. 

I need to stress that mom's indulgence long preceeded my brother's illness. And part of my anger is guilt: I helped to foster this. I was ill as a child (with a condition that was comparatively minor). It became Mom's obsession; she literally left her job for 10 years to deal with it. At 19 I was diagnosed and treated, but I didn't get my life together and she didn't go back to work. I stayed in bed, locked up in my room; she stayed printing out research papers from Google, harassing my doctors, lying to social security, screaming over the phone at consultants, buying needles and injecting me, buying pills to crush up and hide in my food. This all sounds melodramatic written down, but it's true. Five years ago I got out, got a job, and I thought this was over. But the same shit is happening again. 

My family - all of us - have been given so much. We've been so, so, unspeakably lucky. Our childhood had wealth, comfort; we were sent away to school. And I feel physically sick at this greasy excess of pity, the adulation we receive, the endless excuses. It's an obscenity. It's an obscenity. It was killing us spiritually, but now it's genuinely at risk of killing us physically. There's no physical violence Mom won't excuse.

There is no reaching her: any protest I make at this 'love' is diagnosed as self-loathing, a depletion in oxytocin. Any anger I express is mulled over for signs of vitamin deficiencies. 

And worst of all, actually: this special-little-boy bullshit has cut us off from the rest of the entire human race. Because we're not like you. We're not like everyone else. Secretly, secretly, deep down in our hearts: we know we're special. ",1,1738021344.0,family,2,1.0,False

I am 24 and growing up, me and my dad had a lot of relationship issues. I felt that he was extremely strict in some areas but then not in others. So I could never predict what would piss him off, what would be the trigger to set off his rage. He also has a history of going from 0 to 100 in seconds so if he gets angry or overwhelmed, it's very fast and sudden. 

There was a recent incident where my parents were fighting and my dad was being very unreasonable to my mom. My mom get's frustrated fighting with him because you can't reason or communicate with him. So my mom kept trying to talk to my dad but he was getting frustrated and would tell her too ""shut the fuck up and do what your told"". My mom got sick of tired of him saying this so she defended herself but he got so incredibly angry. He got up with clenched fists and was screaming ""shut the fuck up"" over and over again, looking like was trying to find something to break so he grabbed the dinning room chair and smashed it over the coffee table. It was very traumatizing and scary. He gets like this though and he blames everyone else for his outburst and anger issues, saying that people shouldn't push him.

He also needs everything to be in his control, and I mean everything. So I think the reason for the outburst and fight with my mom, was because he couldn't control my mom that time, he couldn't get her to shut up. It's like this with a lot of other things like everything in the house has to be clean, like sterile clean and if it's not, he starts to slam things, ignores you, or just starts acting very aggressive. One time, I forgot to wipe the counter after making myself food and this triggered my dad and he started to aggressively scrub the counters, slamming dishes and cupboards, and when I asked what was wrong, he very aggressively says ""nothing"". It feels like he is punishing me sometimes, punishing me for not cleaning the counter this one time. I only then find out after what the actual issue was and it's usually my mom telling me.

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step—this could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. 😊",1,1738021162.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

But before we sprint, let’s talk about not dying in the process, yeah?



Here’s the survival guide:

	•	Eat a proper breakfast. Coffee is not a food group. Neither is that stale biscuit you found in the cupboard. Actual food. Eggs, toast NOT hagelslag, whatever—just eat like a functional human.

	•	Sleep, for the love of all things holy. You’re not a robot, no matter how much Red Bull you drink. If your body shuts down mid-project, I’m not dragging you to the finish line. Rest up.

	•	Hydrate. Fix that.

	•	Take a break. No, staring at your laptop while crying doesn’t count. Step outside, take a walk, scream into the void—whatever works.

	•	Stress is normal, but don’t let it win. If you’re about to throw your laptop out the window, maybe tell someone before you actually do it. Laptops are expensive.

1ibnnnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ibnnnq/3_lessons_ive_learned_from_living_in_new_york/,3 lessons I’ve learned from living in New York City for one year,"After living in New York City for a year, I’ve come to live by these 3 rules religiously. Read and absorb. 







1. Move to NYC

Listen, I know what you’re thinking. I’m going to say something like: NeW YORk CiTY iS tHE beST citY iN tHe woRlD blah blah blah. I won’t say that, but it’s true. New York is a melting pot of all the good and ugly things in life. It will test you, or it will break you. It will expose your greatest weaknesses. It is a place that has no mercy for you. Because it doesn’t care at all about you. But if you embrace it. It can be the most rewarding place to live. It sounds scary and sometimes it can be. Sometimes it’s like playing a game of poker. Nobody at the table was dealt the same hands. But the outcome of the game isn’t dependent on your hand. It’s how you play it. 

Regardless, everyone that can should live in New York City at least once in their life. They say “if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere”. But I also think if you can’t make it in New York, you can still make it anywhere. Because the skills you will learn trying to make it in New York are transferrable to all things in life. And so are my next 2 pieces of advice.

2. Master being a social

I can’t stress enough how important it is to have social skills. We are social beings. It is the hierarchy by which the foundation of life is built upon. And if you’re an introvert. That’s okay. Not everybody is born a social butterfly. Luckily for you, it doesn’t matter. You can learn. Practice every chance you get. If you’re waiting for the elevator, strike up a conversation with anybody waiting with you. If you’re standing in line to order a coffee, introduce yourself to the person in-front of you. Practice. Practice. Practice. It makes perfect. I’m not saying you need to unload your life story to the next person you see. Just make small talk. Say “Hi”. Try making light hearted jokes. Warm yourself up to being good at making conversation. It won’t feel natural at first. But if you practice, sooner or later it will. You might even cringe at yourself a couple times when it’s awkward or you say the wrong thing. That’s good. Embrace the uncomfortable feelings. And more importantly, get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It is a recurring theme in life that will visit you often. 

In New York City, relationships are currency. Who you know and how well you know them will determine your success. It will determine if you get that referral, and if you get the job, and if you get the promotion, etc. Like it or not, this is law. So you better embrace it or you will be a nobody. Because nobody will remember you. 

3. Find what makes you happy. EARLY.

This is the final and most important advice. And it will make 1 and 2 a hell of a lot easier. Because if you are chasing something for the wrong reasons there’s a solid chance you won’t realize it, until it’s too late. Why do I say that? Because I too was once a fresh graduate that wanted to do the first thing that was going to make me money. And it might seem silly to some. Like duh. Of course you shouldn’t make a career of out doing something you hate.

But New York City is one of the most expensive places to live in the world, and all who come will do whatever it takes to earn their slice of the cake. So more likely than not, that involves taking a job that you aren’t passionate about. But this is the trap. One that is incredibly difficult to get out of. And to do that, you have to pivot. And in New York City, a pivot is fucking hard. You don’t want to pivot. Coming to a realization in your mid 30s that you’ve wasted 10 or some years of your life doing something you actually don’t want to do is not fun. And it happens often. And when it does, 99% of these people realize they want to do something they actually enjoy. But it cost them a lot to learn that lesson. Don’t be them. By discovering what makes you happy. Early. And becoming the best at it.

If you can become the best at it, you can monetize it. Then you’re really living. And it doesn’t matter what it is. Be a writer. Be an artist. Be a consultant. Be an architect. I don’t care if you’re a fucking dog walker. Just do what makes you happy. Do what you’re passionate about. If you aren’t and you’re trying to “fake it till you make it”, it won’t work. People will see it. They will know you are bullshitting. You can’t bullshit people in New York City because everybody here has been a bullshitter once in their life or still is. Only true passion will shine through. It will get you into doors that otherwise would be closed off. They will see it in your eyes when you speak. So find it in yourself and lock it down. It is the only way. ",2,1738020915.0,self,3,0.75,False

In college, all those girls moved away except for one, Maya who was not one of my childhood bullies. Over time, we became close friends—spending time together regularly and even transferring schools together. I thought we were best friends, especially when she seemed to grow apart from the others. I personally never noticed a change in those bullies and had grown apart from them after years of never being ‘good enough’, so I had no issue not being around them. 

But, when the others moved back, start of last year after graduation, Maya became distant, stopped responding to texts, and overall was not a good ‘best’ friend. 
•	On my birthday, I invited her to dinner, and she didn’t even realize it was my birthday. She has had partners nearly break up with her over not remembering bdays, we have been friends for 10+ years but she never could be bothered to PUT IT IN HER PHONE! Days later, she dropped off random lotions and candles from Trader Joe’s as a gift, which hey I appreciate! but she then said, “I just grabbed whatever lol! hope
you like them :) .” …. Meanwhile, for her birthday, I planned a party with all those friends, baked her a cake, took her out to a nice dinner on a separate night just us 2 (which I paid for), and ordered her a custom book embosser with her name.
•	Months later, after never saying anything to her about my birthday, she went on a trip with those girls and ignored me when I innocently asked where she was going after she vaguely said she’d be ‘out of town’ and couldn’t hang out. Months after that, again after barely seeing her, she had a little party at her house, me and their group of 4. I put 2 and 2 together because all night they had hush-hush conversations about the trip, openly talking about how “the four of them” were a group—while I was the only other person there aside from one of the boyfriends lol. Not a great feeling to find out I had been excluded behind my back while being excluded to my face :( 
•	A few weeks later I shared how I felt while we were grabbing some food and she claimed I was a “one-on-one friend” and she didn’t mean to hurt me but promised to include me in their … book club. It turned out there was a book club, that was months in the making, and wasn’t just those girls but other friends too—all except for me. I thought our convo went well enough though, and I know I can be sensative, so I let it go and things were good… but then she never added me. 

After about 2 weeks of contemplating whether or not to text her to remind her (which felt like begging to be included to me) I sent her a long emotional text (I know, not the best move), and then we didn’t speak for six months. When we finally met for coffee recently, it was awkward. When I asked if we could hang out for a little and talk in her car after coffee, she said she didn’t have time because she had to go see another one of her friends, but added “I hoped enough time had passed that we wouldn’t need to talk about it.” Ouch. 

On the way home to drop me off, about 10 minute drive, I tried explaining myself—that I wasn’t upset she had other friends, but it hurt being lied to and treated like an afterthought. That those specific girls trigger something in me about being bullied as a kid, but that maybe my dislike for them was mine to get over and that maybe I need to warm back up to them etc - Before I even got to have a well rounded mature conversation where I took some blame for being sensative and could explain that I held no anger towards her - she got angry, clearly did not want to talk about it, and said “I dont even remember what I did that hurt you” “I’ve already given you all I could so maybe we shouldn’t be friends”, That she had ‘added several people’, in the time we didn’t speak, to the book club and never added me because I got mad at her before she could. Just endlessly telling me she didn’t care in various ways. 

So I got out of the car at my house and stopped the conversation when she said “maybe we shouldn’t be friends’ because I realized 6 months of space wasn’t about respecting my feelings—it was her trying to calm down about angry she was that I was ‘hurt’ and needed to talk about it because god forbid ‘best friends’ to talk about their feelings. 

Its been a few days and we have not talked since. 

Should I keep trying with this friendship, or is it time to let go?

No. Well if you seek conversation, connection or the like maybe we can introduce each other to our inner worlds","Sitting here late at night, after a long work day managing multiple workstreams and a short workout I’ve still got a mind that’s wide awake and wants engagement.

Unlike most people I suppose I have oodles of energy. It hasn’t really gone down as I’ve gotten older though I can say high intensity sports 3-4 days a week does require one to chill down with lighter and easier creative activities. Tonight is more of a prosaic night rather than one where I sketch or draw - sculpting and wood working have to be left for other days and not this late at night anyway. Is this a ramble? Perhaps. Not quite a stream of consciousness though.


I’d like to meet someone who’s still got their whimsy and wonderment in their lives or isn’t willing to lose it. If you do, then cherish it even if we do not speak. It’s rare in a world where things do want to tear down the ground you’re standing on. It’s an interesting week with everything about deep seek but that’s a different story altogether.


I have a lot of gigs planned for this year, lots of travel too (If you’re in Japan, CZ, Slovenia, East Coast, Norway, Sweden feel free to hmu and I might get you a coffee or some beverage of your choice. We could treat it like the cafe at the end of the world and discuss some deep existential topic or something so mundane like what’s the next game you want to play/show you want to binge/etc. 


I’m living a life where I probably will just continue to amass skills and accumulate information. I would like to make sure that people are properly educated so they understand what the impacts of their actions and even apathy can get them.  But it has to start a lot earlier. I’m mentoring and working on things but that’s a different story.


I’m not really stating here that I’m looking for a relationship because there’s got to me someone who I have to care enough to want to have in my life. That hasn’t happened in a while but my circles of friends seem to be getting firmer and I’ve a collection of acquaintances at this point through all the things I do. If someone says it’s hard to make friends as an adult, it really isn’t - I could show you how. Perhaps it comes to me naturally since my life has meant that I grew up in so many different countries, went to different schools that meeting people and talking to them about stuff has been easy IRL. Online is a different story since this is like a weird shopping cart where the whims of your momentary emotions and delusions and even energy levels help you find connection or lose people you could have formed amazing bonds with.


For me? What am I looking for - oh just humans with passions, vulnerability, compassion, humanity (yeah this often rests on those who want to forge forward which happens to be left leaning at the least. There’s a reason we have the saying ‘a rising tide raises all ships’ and if the baseline is raised everyone’s, even your lives are improved. Unless you’re a dragon hoarding wealth and assets haha.


About me? I think you’ve got enough to go there. But if you some other stats I’m tall, successful, yeah there’s some cognitive dissonance in that I’m very successful in a very capitalistic corporate role that puts me in a comfortable spot. But I wonder how much of this was determined way before I was born. I mean check Sapolsky’s determined. I think people misunderstand what true free will is since it doesn’t exist - then again who we think we are isn’t even who we are but just a tiny fraction, the reactive segment.


If you actually read this, apologies, since I suppose I ended up rambling a bit. But yeah it’s night and I’m in an existential mood and not really here to market myself as some amazing person but looking for REAL conversations. If you’re interested on a romantic level - I’ll say a few things. I’m a demisexual and I typically vibe with high energy people so they tend to normally be younger than me but it’s not a set in stone rule or any such nonsense. I’d like a person who keeps up regardless of whatever.

Signing off.

1ibnjrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ibnjrk/ive_seen_some_weird_stuff_in_the_woods/,I've seen some weird stuff in the woods...,"Here’s the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent—that’s what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they’d run like me. They won’t. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.

I posted this with a perfectly curated flat lay of my gear, a trophy positioned in the corner for motivation, and my lucky blue Brooks hat front and center. I hit “share,” exited the app, and waited for the notifications to start chirping. I knew they would. I’ve been trail running’s poster child for years—living proof that grit and glory don’t always come without a side of ego.

You know the type—those of us (and sometimes the ladies—let’s not be judgmental) who act like ultra trail running isn’t just a lifestyle but a higher calling. Not everyone can handle it. And let’s be honest: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, we’re out grinding through miles of wilderness, proving we’re tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn’t just about running—it’s about domination. It’s about people like me—people who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And what better way to let the world know than to post about it?

So, I did—daily. Actually, multiple times a day. My feed was a mix of clothes, supplements, and medals. I stood tall and proud in the center of every photo, smiling wide, surrounded by my so-called minions. There were ambassador-branded salutes, a couple of posts supporting efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and plenty of coffee cheers sprinkled in for good measure. My feed was a science, and I had it perfected.

I was training for a 100-mile trail race—the MadMan 100. As egotistical, politically narrow-minded, and attention-seeking as some might say I am, people started to take notice when I posted about it. The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped into my comments, showering me with likes and invites to podcasts. My fanbase on Insta and Strava started to soar. Training for an ultra is grueling, but I was thriving. By February, I had my routine locked in. Winter landscapes made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That’s the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie—breath fogging the air, beard already dripping with icicles—I set off on a trail I’d run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers: upcoming events, missing people notices, and hunting guide advertisements. I didn’t bother reading them—why would I? I knew the races coming up, and they made for lousy selfie backdrops anyway.

That morning felt like any other—until I saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved with an impossibly fluid gait, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequent these woods, but there was something about her—the way she seemed to vanish just as I thought I’d catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer’s. Her ponytail bobbed like a rabbit’s tail, always disappearing just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn’t stop looking for her. Every few days, I’d catch a glimpse of this phantom runner—her pink hat bouncing through the brush. Each time, she stayed just beyond my grasp. I never saw her car in the lot, so she must’ve been using another access point. I started parking at different trailheads, running at odd hours, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for me, it—or she—became all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and relentless miles took their toll. My times slowed. My body ached—shin splints, blisters, frostbite. My beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and my eyes—wild, desperate—stared back at me in the rearview mirror.

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and it was time to taper my training. Less time on the trails, unless I wanted to die trying.

Then, in early March, I saw her again. This time, she was closer, her form more defined. She stopped, waved, and disappeared into the trees. My heart pounded as I slammed my truck into park, leaving the keys inside. I knew these trails like the back of my hand. I sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest, muffling my footsteps as I closed the distance. The closer I got, the more uneasy I felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny—shifting and unnatural. As I moved, I noticed a creeping darkness on the trail. The bare limbs of the trees seemed to reach out toward me. High above, large black birds perched, watching my every step.

At the cutoff, I finally closed in. Just ahead, on the bridge, was my trophy—the runner. Her whole figure was visible now, moving swiftly, her feet barely touching the ground. But as I approached, her form shifted unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn’t a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew me in and filled me with dread. Suddenly, she flickered, like a poor TV signal, and then she was gone.

When I reached the spot where she’d been, the truth hit me like a blow. She wasn’t alive. She wasn’t even human anymore. What I saw was a decayed corpse grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. Her bright clothing was dulled by moss and dirt, the pink hat still clinging to her skull. She’d been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement was the gentle swaying of her hair in the cold breeze.

I stumbled back, my breath hitching. The woods were silent, except for the pounding of my heart and the groaning of the trees in the wind. I turned and bolted toward my truck, my mind racing. Had this woman—this runner—ever really been there? Who had I been chasing all this time?

I couldn’t shake these thoughts as I tried to make sense of what I’d seen. Moving swiftly, I began to repeat the same words over and over in my head: Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now the trails felt darker. The paths were overgrown, unfamiliar. Trees I didn’t remember blocked my way. Mile markers were distorted, the numbers no longer logical. The woods stretched on forever. More than once, I turned a corner and saw her again—her sun-bleached hair still caught in the branches of that ancient tree. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound came out. All I could hear was the cawing of the crows watching from above.

I pressed on as night fell around me.

Those who followed me saw the final post: a picture of me, huddled in a clearing of brambles, clutching my phone like a lifeline. The caption read:

""I’ve been running forever. No end. She’s still here. I’m still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops. Maybe I never will. #LostForever #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever.""

- I'll mostly be in either office, hotel, or restaurant/coffee shop.

- I have a long, wool blend pea coat I purchased from amazon. It's also have a columbia fleece jacket and a northface raincoat. I do have a blazer I could use to layer. 
- I don't have any nice footwear like a boot, hence I thought of blundstones but am open to other options. I don't think I need AWD-equivalent footwear. 

I hope that helps clarify my initial request. Thank you so much ladies!

Hey ladies! 

I’ve always struggled with styling myself so here I am asking for help. 

I have a work trip next month and I’ll be visiting a northern state that gets REALLY cold. I’m from a mild climate area. 

Any recommendations on coats and shoes? I was thinking of getting some blundstone boots (there are some cute ones with small heels). 

ETA: my first draft I only mention shoes and coats but im also open to any accessories. Thanks. 

The expected temp this time of year ranges from 5 to 30 degrees F. 

Appreciate any recommendations. I don’t mind spending extra on shoes but would like to be mindful on the amount of money spent on a coat, especially since I don’t really need one typically in my winter. 

Oh I have a long peacoat that I could use to layer as well. It’s just not thick enough for somewhere this cold. 

We will mostly be inside as this is a corporate office type of job.

We first started dating spring semester freshman year and it was all going well until our sophomore year summer. She broke up with me because I wasn't there enough emotionally when a person in her immediate family passed away do to cancer. And after that I tried everything to get her back but we live polar opposites sides of the country and after a week I stopped. Then when school started again(now junior year) she randomly texts me one asking to talk and we have a long conversation about how we both felt, and she explained that she wasn't too happy with herself and what was going on in her life, and I also explained the same. And we both realized that it was draining our relationship. And to be fair, I wasn't the best boyfriend at that time, I never cheated on her or did anything to make her upset. We didn't even argue. But I forgot in that time about all the little things and planning dates and all that. But we continued talking and agreed to try again, and agreed that if the spark wasn't there it wasn't meant to be. Which I still fully agree with. So we do 1 or 2 small dates a week. Like getting coffee together, doing a puzzle, going on walks to the parks. All that, and big dates too like I took her out to dinner multiple times and I was doing all the little stuff that matters. Like getting her flowers after we finally gotten comfortable enough and I could tell it would be okay to do. And everything was going so well for 2 months. And before we left for christmas break, I asked her out again and she said yes. And we walked for hours about how happy we have been and how much we have been enjoying the time we have spending with eachother. And winter break goes well, we call and talk all the time and plan all these dates for when we get back. And when we do the, the first week we make plans to go this nice award winning place on friday. But a day before that on that thursday, she sent me a text while I was in class about how another family member got diagnosed with the same cancer. And I didn't respond to it in the right way and I regret it. I acted nonchlant and I said ""oooooo no thats not fun, lets get some food and talk about it"". I didn't say I'm sorry and I deeply regret that. I have no explantion for why I did it. But I knew the next day we had a dinner date and I was going to get her flowers and a card and talk about more with her. But she ended up getting sick and post poned it for Saturday, and then again for sunday. But instead of dinner we decided to just grab coffee. And during this time I didn't ask how she was or how she was feeling. Instead I just tried to be normal and try to cheer her up with things. Also I felt weird bringing up to her because I didn't want to bring her down even more when shes sick. But on saturday at night tells me that she didn't like the way I responded and I totally get that. And I said back to her like I totally get I am so sorry, I am trying my best, I know i am not perfect but I will keep working on it and blah blah blah. But I am geniuely being sincere when i text her this and she says thank you and all that and that she appreciates it. Now sunday happens and we go get bagels. and i immediately knew that things were off and i didn't bring up anything and we just caught up and stuff. And when we were done she asked if we could go back to her place and talk. And i know what this means, and she explains that everything I did and the person I am was perfect. That I was the perfect boyfriend, but I am just not there emotinally for her when she needs me to be again. And I totally get that. And I begged and begged, and the next day I had a little freak out and tried calling her but she didn't answer. And after I sent this whole long text explaining things like how much i care about her and love her. but she didn't respond to. And I get it because just wants space and I respect that now and haven't reached out to her and its been 2 weeks. But I am having so many regrets for not being there when she needed me the most and I feel so shitty about. So I was thinking of just dropping off flowers and a letter. With the letter saying this(FAKE NAMES BTW):  
Dear Jane,

First, I want to say that this letter, and the flowers that come with it, are not meant to disrupt your life in any way or to try to “win you back.” I respect your space, just as I’m trying to recognize that I need mine, too. That’s why I chose to simply leave this at your doorstep. I also want to apologize for my long text the other day, it might have hurt you or made you feel something I didn’t intend. I was confused and hurt, and I’m sorry for that. I got the flowers as a gesture of genuine support. I know that I’ve fallen short in the past when it comes to showing how much I care, but I hope the flowers serve as a small reminder that you’re not alone, that you have friends and family who are there for you. They’re meant to brighten your day, even if it’s just for a moment.

This letter is really about saying that I am truly sorry for everything you’re going through right now and for the times in the past when I didn’t offer the kind of support or care that you deserved. I know that emotional support isn’t my strong suit, and I know I’ve let you down before when you needed someone to lean on. But I want to be clear, this isn’t about trying to get you back. And I know I can’t make up for the words or actions I didn’t do the previous times, but realizing my mistakes and my regrets and doing this action can hopefully show you that I do genuinely care for you. It’s about being here for you in a way that’s meaningful and authentic, even if it’s just as someone who cares and wants to offer kindness during a tough time. I don’t expect anything from you in return. I just want you to know that no matter what, I will always care for you in some way or another. I will always appreciate the time we spent together and the memories we created, and I hope this reflects how much I genuinely value the connection we shared. Even though things are different now, my care for you hasn’t changed, and I want you to know that it comes from a place of sincerity.

I know we didn’t talk much about faith or spirituality or get into it very seriously, and honestly, I wasn’t very deep into religion or anything like that. But after everything that happened with my mom last summer, I found myself gaining a little bit of faith in something. It’s not that I’ve become super religious or anything, but I do feel like there’s something out there watching over us. Since then, I’ve started praying more than I used to. and ever since you told me about your family member, I’ve been praying for him too, that he finds the strength to fight and overcome this, and that your family finds the resilience and care you all deserve and I will keep doing that. The Johnsons are some of the strongest people I’ve ever had the privilege of knowing, and I hope you can all draw on that strength during this difficult time. I also hope your friends and loved ones can support you in ways I may not have been able to in the past. You and your family all deserve so much love and care.

Take care of yourself, Jane I will always hope for the best for you, now and in the future. You deserve nothing less than happiness and all the good things life has to offer.

Sincerely,

John

1ibndqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreatitis/comments/1ibndqf/dont_know_if_gastritis_or_pancreas/,Don't know if gastritis or Pancreas,"Had Covid two years ago, and around the same time developed what I was told was mild gastritis (""but so does everyone,"" my gastro shrugged). Not sure if Covid caused it or just coincidence. 

Convinced it wasn't gastritis, I went to a blood and cancer specialist. My dad died of pancreatic cancer in his early 50s (I'm 39). He had started experiencing stomach pain that they told him (for a long time) was ulcers. Then his pain got so bad, they opened him and found him 'riddled with cancer.'

Now I have pain in the same spot (where xyphoid process is, slightly below, middle of abdomen). And I'm increasingly worried and feeling alone. I don't know if its gastritis or pancreas, could use some feedback or clarity for those with experience. 

My Blood work showed elevated lipase (73) and amylase (126). (I know thats not THAT high but she said that was above normal). Had MRI scan on pancreas that showed ""no blockages, holes, tumors, masses. Completely clear, not an ounce of abnormality"". But the elevated lipase and amylase levels showed my pancreas and liver were inflamed by what I was putting in my body (a precursor, she claimed, to pancreatitis). 

I was drinking coffee and not eating great, alcohol once per week. Now I'm 5 days off coffee (still have Matcha latte 1X per day). 5 days in of eating cleaner. If nothing else works might have to ditch the caffeine (longest I've made it is a week).

The worst symptom by far is feeling my heart pounding where my aorta is (where xyphoid is), especially when I lay down. Happens when I get up and lay down. Movement triggers sometimes. Very disturbing. At its worst, it developed into 4 weeks of heart palps. Had heart tests and all was clear. It's less pain than a gnawing, heart slamming sensation these days, occasioning weakness and slight confusion. Coffee by far biggest trigger that causes extreme weakness and confusion.

However, I can run (avid runner) 4-8 miles with no issue, and my stomach and symptoms often drop by 70% after a run. very lost.

Not sure if Covid caused it or just coincidence. 

Convinced it wasn't gastritis, I went to a blood and cancer specialist. My dad died of pancreatic cancer in his early 50s (I'm 39). He had started experiencing stomach pain that they told him (for a long time) was ulcers. Then his pain got so bad, they opened him and found him 'riddled with cancer.'

Now I have pain in the same spot (where xyhoid process is, slightly below, middle of abdomen). And I'm increasingly worried and feeling alone. I don't know if its gastritis or pancreas, could use some feedback or clarity for those with experience. 

My Blood work showed elevated lipase (73) and amylase (126). (I know thats not THAT high but she said that was above normal). Had MRI scan on pancreas that showed ""no blockages, holes, tumors, masses. Completely clear, not an ounce of abnormality"". But the elevated lipase and amylase levels showed my pancreas and liver were inflamed by what I was putting in my body (a precursor, she claimed, to pancreatitis). 

I was drinking coffee and not eating great, alcohol once per week. Now I'm 5 days off coffee (still have Matcha latte 1X per day). 5 days in of eating cleaner. If nothing else works might have to ditch the caffeine (longest I've made it is a week).

I didn't feel better from a fitness standpoint (always was semi-athletic) but the GERD and Heartburn improvements were DRASTIC. 

I suffered significantly from side effects and would have sulfur burps, cramps, gas, diarrhea, vomitting, etc. 3 days after the shot, virtually every single week. 

However, now that I've weaned off, I want to go back on because I forgot the symptoms of binge eating. 

1. Constant GERD/Heart burn. Because i no longer know what it feels like to feel full, I just keep eating. The severe chest pain is my only indicator I have to stop eating. 

2. FOOD NOISE. I'm always looking to keep my mouth busy and my stomach working. It's like an anxious tick and I never realized I used to be like this all the time. I almost feel like a slave to my cravings and I keep eating and can't handle the feeling of my stomach not being full. 

3. ANXIETY. I totally forgot I had such bad anxiety. My face is constantly tingling, my jaw, my hands. I feel like I had 8 coffees all day everyday and it's because I can't stop eating. 

4. SLEEP. I literally can't sleep because the food is half way up my esophagus. I literally don't know when to stop eating and I always feel hungry. 

I'm afraid I'm stuck paying for this medication but knowing what I feel like, maybe I can make a case for my insurance. I genuinely can't comprehend how I forgot this is how I felt all the time and that it's 100% because I can't stop eating. It's been an eye opening perspective and I've learned so much about myself and how I handle my meals.

That’s the concept of Kathe Koja’s The Cipher. A dark and mysterious void has suddenly appeared in the storage room of a run down apartment building. Nicholas, a destitute VideoHut employee and Nakota, a waitress at some coffee shop, find it down the hall from Nicholas’s lurid apartment. It’s pitch black…and pulsating. It has a presence, a wicked presence. Yet, it radiates a sweet smell that entices. It promises pure pleasure. Sweet sexual relief. And all you have to do, is enter it. 

The Cipher is not for everyone. It is very very very gross. It is a book designed to make you feel as dirty as possible. It’s written in stream of consciousness, which means it comes off as the diary of an institutionalized maniac. With that being said, the horror in it is palpable. The writing creates a sense of urgency and panic. As you’ll read along, you’ll become increasingly disturbed by the salacious and filthy nature of the story. By the hole in the wall, the things it does, and what it does to the people around it. 

At its heart, The Cipher is a contaminated love story. Grief, hatred, depression, loneliness, and abuse. This is a story that delves into heavy themes and heavy topics. Again, it is not for everyone. But I urge you to take a chance with this story. When I finished it, I felt so sick to my stomach. I was utterly disgusted and exhausted. But the story is meant to evoke these violent emotions. It’s meant to make you feel what self hatred is. What it fully entails. If you find it to gross? I understand. There is ALLLLLLOTTT of Fluids in this story. But again, I implore you to take a shot with it. It’s only 217 pages. If you let the hole take root in your mind, maybe it can take you too.",2,1738019558.0,FLJaxBookish,0,1.0,False

I work in a nursing home kitchen and they like to feed their employees pretty well, there is usually lots of leftover breakfast for the workers to come in and get, everyone gets a free lunch, and there are tons of treats and snacks in the break room. For the first several months I never ate anything there. It wasn't really tempting bc it's just nursing home food so it's nothing special. I would either do omad or tmad, always after work. It was working pretty well for me, I found it easy to say no to food and I looked forward to my meal(s) after work, and I lost 72 lbs in 9 months.

I felt like had gained a lot of discipline doing this and started thinking maybe I could trust myself to eat somewhat normally without going overboard. So I stopped being so strict about my fasting and started having a snack while I was at work, e.g. a couple pieces of bacon after breakfast or a few butter cookies with a coffee. But when I started doing this, I slowely started wanting to eat more and more. One snack became several snacks, then I started having my employee lunch, then I started saying yes to breakfast. Sometimes I eat almost all of my daily calories before I even get home from work. When this happens I tell myself I will just not eat anthing when I get home, but I still end up eating my planned meal. Partly because it's just hard for me to not eat a meal after work, and partly because I know I got practically zero nutrition. None of that food is good for me, it's nothing but carbs and highly processed frozen junk. I feel bad for the residents who have to eat it, I think this to myself on a daily basis. So then why do I have a hard time turning it down when it doesn't even taste very good?

My weight loss has completely halted since November and I keep telling myself everyday that today is the day I get it together, but I'm struggling. I want to get back to the place I was in last year. I would have moments where I realized that food no longer had power over me, it was just food and I could turn it down easily. I miss that feeling so much. It's like my brain gets so hooked on the dopamine rush of eating that it begins to view every missed opportunity to eat as a crisis. I try to tell mysef it's just food for god's sake, and shitty food at that. I don't know why I'm like this but I think eating ""normally"" is just not something I can do. I tried to take that bullshit advice dietician influencers lecture about intuitive eating and ""honoring your cravings"". I tried eating things I craved in moderation like a normal person, but it will always end in the craving increasing until I once again reach the point where I can't go an hour without wanting to eat something. If I don't want to be morbidly obese then I need to have a plan and stick to it. I was so stupid for thinking otherwise.

My wife was hurt pretty severely during childbirth, there was a fourth-degree tear (google it if you're unfamiliar, two holes become one hole, its awful) as well as some pelvic floor damage. Only over the last two weeks has she been able to walk without the assistance of a walker. Honestly, her courage in the face of that pain is mind-blowing to me. 

  
We have had some pretty severe ups and downs. We both have struggled with co-dependency our entire lives. At a low point during a military deployment, I engaged in an emotional affair with someone I met online. I had felt hated by her for a while, and it seemed like our young marriage was ending, I just wanted to feel cared for by someone... I also hadn't completely gotten over my previous relationship and had some serious hangups going on that haunted me for a few years. I was not healed and emotionally ready for the next relationship (this one), but I didn't know that at the time. I own it, went to individual therapy, we did couples therapy for a year that helped us navigate a whole host of feelings.

My wife comes from a very troubled household. Her father was very abusive and an alcoholic. She, by her admission, has struggled with rage for her entire life. She says that in fights she feels ""pushed"" by me to act out physically. At first, it manifested as grabbing an object and cocking back like she wanted to strike me on the head with it. Several months later it was throwing a cell phone at a wall, which hit me in the leg on the way to the wall. After that, she smashed her phone against the driveway. About a year later she threw a glass against the wall. A few months after that, she threw a coffee mug in my direction during a fight. That one hit me in the thigh, and left a helluva bruise. At that moment I yelled at her that I wanted a divorce, and demanded that she leave the house. We lived separately for a month, resolved to actually try during our couples counseling, and got things back on track. During each of these incidents I was arguing with her, I never learned healthy conflict resolution until the last year or so. 

About six months after the coffee mug incident, she gets pregnant. Totally unplanned, but we swore that this was going to be a fresh start. And it was! We had some disagreements, especially over past wounds, but we always were able to work through them with time and understanding. I'd like to think that she would say that I was very supportive during every step of parenthood. I'm on my second of three months of paternity leave, and then I head out the door towards another 9-month deployment.

*Now we're at last night.* 

Our son woke up at about 12:30 last night. I rolled over to tell her that he broke out of his swaddle after being down for about four hours. She seemed frustrated and rolled away from me. I was nonplussed, and asked something to the effect of ""are you ignoring me?"". Before she had a chance to respond, I got out of bed to get him from the bassinet and bring him to the changing table. Per our routine, she changed his diaper while I prepared a bottle and got ready to feed him (I do most of the nighttime feeds). We had a few muffled but tense words about the miscommunication as I fed our son. When he was done with his bottle, and still hungry, I asked my wife to get him a top-up. As she prepared the bottle, I was trying to placate the screaming kid by offering him a pacifier, which he was struggling to put in his mouth. I muttered to him that he was putting the paci on the wrong side of his face ""wrong side, wrong side"", and my wife must have thought I was talking to her. She wheeled around, upset, and wanted to know what I was saying. I, also frustrated, told her I was talking to the baby. *At this time she picks up the top of the bottle and hurls it across the room at me, while I'm holding our son.* 

  
I'm astonished. I ask, repeatedly, ""what are you doing, what are you doing??"". She is clearly shame-ridden, and she goes to hide in the bathroom. I desperately want to see what's going on, if there's some kind of anxiety attack, some PPD that she didn't talk to me about, any reason why she would black out like that and do something as rash as throw something at her husband while he's holding the baby. I have told her in the past that I can look past arguing, but anything physical is a hard boundary for me. We talked about this in therapy, she knows its a huge deal, and she swore it would never happen again. Well, it did. 

  
When I finally convinced her to come out of the bathroom, she seemed immediately defensive. I had pushed her to throw something at me. I was left with no sense that she could take accountability for her actions. She could not muscle up so much as a simple ""I'm sorry"", though I'm sure she felt it. Shame, it seems, was too much weight to bear. 

  
After bringing her to a physical therapy appointment today, and with the baby in the care of grandparents, we tried yet again to talk about what was going on. We spent an hour in the car arguing in which it seemed she was doubling down on her claims. She saw red, she is feeling rage, she didn't want to throw anything at me - but if I hadn't pushed her buttons it would have never happened. I reassured her that I love her, but that I refuse to accept that my actions resulted in her physically lashing out. People may experience rage and ""see red"", but they are still responsible for their actions. If she picked up another coffee mug and hurled it last night, and instead of flying over my shoulder it connected with my son's head... Well, he'd be in the hospital and she would be in jail. No amount of ""post-partum rage"" (of which this was the first instance, apparently) or ""seeing red"" removes her culpability for her actions. Her inability to offer what I feel to be a genuinely heartfelt apology is certainly rooted in shame, magnified by parallels she must feel to her own childhood. *I yelled at her in the car, loud, that I will never tolerate physical violence - that it's a hard barrier for me and that I can not accept it.* Being yelled at was very triggering for her, and she screamed back at me labelling it as abuse - and abuse on the same level as throwing something at that.

  
Believe it or not, I love her very much. She is, at her core, a very kind and thoughtful human being capable of showing great love for those she cares about. Hell, she's a mental health therapist herself! But this rage scares me. I'm afraid of what could have happened last night. 

  
I do not see myself as abusing her. I recognize that I have done some shitty things in the past, but I have taken absolute ownership of them and we are trying our best to move on. I think her allegations of verbal abuse (yelling in the car) comes from a desire to assuage the guilt she feels for her physical outburst, but I'm trying to not make assumptions for how she is feeling. 

  
I have to draw a line in the sand. She wants me to accept that she feels rage and I need to accept that part about her, and be understanding when it comes out. She is working on it. She is in therapy herself. But the stakes are so much higher now. I feel like I have to set an absolute boundary that nothing physical is ever ok, and that if it continues we need to explore separating. 

  
AITAH for yelling at her? I know this relationship is a mess. But I want to believe it's worth cleaning up, because we had made so much damn progress and we were doing so great!",3,1738019380.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1ibmygx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ibmygx/aita_for_assuming_i_was_the_hot_one/,AITA for assuming I was the ‘hot one’?,"I (35M) was out with my partner of 4 months (37M), we’d grabbed some coffees and were sat outside drinking them when a few younger girls probably in their mid 20s set their phone up opposite a fountain and started filming what I assume was tik tok or some other social media post as they were doing a dance. 

It was the first time we’d ever seen tik tokers in the wild so we were sort of smirking and watching them film their video and they must have noticed as they came over and asked if one of us wanted to be in the video as they wanted a guy to feature in it. 

We’re both usually up for something different and a bit of a laugh so we said yes and asked who they wanted to be in it and one of the girls stood further back said ‘the hot one’, and the rest all nodded. So I instinctively stood up, not thinking anything of it at the time, to join them and went through learning their silly dance routine and filming the video. 

I could instantly tell something was wrong when I went back to my partner as he was sulky and not really saying anything, as we left the park it dawned on me what I’d done and I asked if it was about the ‘hot’ thing and he said yes but didn’t really say much else for the rest of our time together, and we said goodbye awkwardly and he left. He later said over text it was arrogant and cocky of me to automatically assume they meant me by ‘the hot one’ and that it made him feel worthless. 

I totally understand how that situation must have made him feel, but was I really an asshole for knowing they were referring to me when they said that? They were so it wasn’t a wrong assumption and I don’t feel like it would have been any less awkward or uncomfortable going through the charade of pretending not to know who they meant. I am the conventionally attractive one, I’m tall, I’ve got good facial features and I workout a lot. My partner isn’t really what most people would consider conventionally attractive and he’s a little overweight and awkward looking. I find him attractive in his own way and his personality, sense of humour and overall demeanour make him super hot in my eyes, but when the girls said ‘the hot one’ I did instinctively know they meant me. 

I have apologised for the situation, but at the same time I do feel like he probably ought to recognise the situation for what it was and not give me such a hard time for correctly assuming who they meant.

However, I wasn't expecting to see a photo of him on another girl’s phone.

*Tinder?* I thought, watching her swipe left with a snort.

“I should get to class.” Felix kissed me, but it didn't feel right. 

Everyone in the restaurant was on their phone—and everyone was swiping left. 

In the blink of an eye, my gaze flicked from the girl’s phone to Felix, who stepped outside. I got a bad feeling. 

“Wait.” I started toward him, before he was crushed by a falling sheet of glass. 

I didn't realize I was screaming until I was picking pieces of Felix’s skull from my dress. 

Casper was the emotional rebound who drowned in his pool. 

Sam, the FWB, died in a freak crash.

Adam, my childhood friend, bumped into me several weeks later. 

“Charlotte!” His smile was a little too wide. Dressed in a long trench coat and a scarf, he was… cuter than I remembered. 

His jawline was perfect, thick brown hair hanging in his eyes. 

He offered me an umbrella, but it wasn't raining. “Wanna go for coffee?”

All around us, people were on their phones swiping right.

“That's the new Love Interest!” one girl  squeaked. “Isn't he, like, soooo cute?!”

Pulling him away from them, I dragged the boy into a coffee shop, and then into a stall. Adam barely reacted, his eyes unblinking, lips spread in a wide grin.

“Tell me,” I whispered. “Is any of this real?”

Adam’s gaze searched the ceiling before he… broke. I watched him drop to his knees, clawing at his hair. “No.”

Something seemed to come undone in him, his lip curling in disgust.

“You're a psycho bastard,” he hissed, breaking into a sob. “What did you *do* to me?”

His eyes filled with tears, and it hit me that this boy wasn't talking to *me*. 

He reached out, gingerly stroking my cheek. “What did you do to *her*?”

“As we rehearsed, Adam Number 356,” a sudden voice droned. “Compliment my daughter.”

“But Penny isn't your—”

Adam screamed, his body contorting, like a puppet on strings.

His lips broke out into a horrific grin, something, almost mechanical, flickering in his eye. 

“We hurt you, *Charlotte*,” he said through his teeth, reaching forward, cradling my cheek.

“All of us broke your heart, and, just like your father promised…” A thin slither of red dripped from his nose, his head jolting violently, before turning to me. 

“We must face the consequences.” he held me close, his breath in my ear. 

“Just be Charlotte,” he whispered. “Whatever you do, *be* Charlotte.”

Adam grabbed my arm, pulling me from the stall. I could feel his nails stabbing into the flesh of my arm.

*I feel sick*, he whispered.

*I feel sick, I feel sick, I feel sick*—

“And m-might I say!” he spoke, this time to people, our *audience* around us, fingers hovering over their phones, ready to swipe left… or right.

I have been eating meat, eggs, and dairy only for 26 days. I have maybe had a few pieces of a carrot or a pear here and there but infrequent and it’s usually because I’m cleaning off my kids plate and forget and take a bite. I am around 5-15g of carbs daily. Some days a little more but it’s from full fat yogurt or nuts. I don’t have anything with sugar in it and drink only water, black coffee or coffee with whole milk, and sometimes BCAAs with creatine. 

Anyway…my question is that I’m usually able to crush CrossFit workouts and feel great. I started Carnivore in conjunction with 75 hard (which I’ve done before) so I’m doing 2 workouts a day. Sometimes two walks, sometimes CrossFit and a ruck. 

Since I started this way of eating I am completely exhausted after CrossFit. Like all day long I have no energy. Doesn’t matter how much I eat. Sometimes I’ll have electrolytes and I’ll feel better for an hour or two and then I feel like crap again. 

Am I doing something wrong? My fat goal is 150g per day but usually I get around 100-125g. Hard to eat that much fat.

Ever feel like your mojo's MIA, your energy's AWOL, or you're stuck in a funk you just can't shake? 🤔 You might want to check what's going on with your hydration and nutrition game because, believe it or not, they're totally tied to how confident you feel! 💪✨

First things first, let's talk H2O. 💧 Dehydration is the sneaky little foe that can mess with your mood and even your brain function! 😱 Imagine trying to fire up your inner rockstar while feeling sluggish. Not happening, right? Make sure you're drinking enough water, and yes, coffee and energy drinks don’t count! Your body's like a high-performance engine and water is your premium fuel. 🏎️💨 Pro tip: Carry a water bottle with you everywhere (#StayHydrated) and aim for those 8 glasses a day!

Now let's feast on the food for thought. 🥦🍎 Nutrition is pivotal for confidence—seriously! Junk food might give you that temporary high, but it’s the nutritional powerhouses like leafy greens, nuts, and fish packed with omega-3s that really set the stage for peak brain performance and a positive mood. 🧠🌟 Balanced meals help stabilize your energy and mood, keeping you from crash-landings that leave you feeling low and irritable. 

But what’s the link to confidence, you ask? When your body’s nourished, you perform better at work, in the gym, basically in life, and this naturally boosts your self-esteem. 🌟 It's like walking around with your very own spotlight. ✨

Here's where the magic happens: combine hydration and nutritious foods to support your 'confident you.' Think a smoothie packed with spinach, chia seeds, and a splash of almond milk. 🥤 Or a vibrant salad loaded with colorful veggies and a side of grilled salmon. Simple swaps can make a world of difference!

So you might be asking yourself, ""How do I make these changes stick?” Start small. 🚶‍♂️ Whether it’s drinking an extra glass of water a day or swapping your afternoon snack for a piece of fruit, these little victories add up. Setting achievable goals (say, trying a new healthy recipe each week) makes the journey fun and rewarding.

And remember, everyone's path to confidence looks different. Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. 🏆 You got this, MaximizeMe Crew! 💥

1ibmsgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FastingScience/comments/1ibmsgk/experienced_faster_profound_reset_after_illness/,"Experienced Faster, Profound Reset After Illness + Fasting","*Warning: I'm going to describe an experience that could be medically dangerous for many people. I'm not claiming this is advisable or safe, but I do think it is worth sharing.*

I've done a 7-day, 15-day, and numerous 3-5 day fasts in the past 7 years. Male, 40s, healthy, eat clean, lift weights / MMA, low alcohol consumption, rarely any other drugs/medicine, and other than the occasional stomach bug, I havent been actually fever/flu sick for 17 years or more.

A few weeks ago I came down hard with a fever ranging 102-106 for 3 days, and then reduced over the next 2 days. On the 2nd day, I realized I simply couldn't eat enough calories, and was vacillating in/out of keto flu on top of the fever symptoms. So I said, fine, I'll just fast (especially since I wanted to do a New Year's fast anyways).

After 5 days fasting, did a parasite cleanse (wormwood, black walnut hull, cloves, cinnamon, garlic, ginger), and then started refeeding. Immediately thereafter, I started sleeping 9-10 hours every night like I was 18 again. I had been having increasing brain fog for a year or more, and it's gone now. My friends noticed that my face/skin is significantly clearer. I look like I'm in my 30s again. Even my mental state has this kind of nostalgia like I'm in my early 20s. Almost like when you get a certain smell that takes you back. I've about 90% lost my taste/desire for coffee, but I have full smell and appetite for my normal diet. Even had a clogged left ear for a couple years that cleared up.

Never before in my life, or with any fast, including the 15-day fast, did I have effects this profound and this immediate. I haven't found much online of accountings or research in this regard; and neither have conversations with advanced AIs yielded much for similar experiences. I'm about 2 weeks into recovery, and the effects all seem to be continuing apace.

Claude AI speculated that regular sauna use might've conditioned my body to heat shock proteins, such that it was comfortable pumping my temps that high.

*[Aside - This is what I mean by potentially medically dangerous, and that I was taking a risk that is not advisable in a forum like this - but again - I'm just recounting what happened, not recommending anything. I never got delirious, vomitted, passed out, or showed symptoms of dangerously high fever, altho I was at the borderline of ""safe"". I occasionally used acetaminophen to pull it back down, but only after a few hours of letting my body do it's thing for awhile]*

Apparently at 104, proteins begin to denature, which is a double edged sword. Malformed proteins can be unfolded and reconstructed properly or cleared entirely. It can help senescent cells either repair or disassemble. And there's potential for enhanced neuroplasticity. Of course, if you're suffering under co-morbidities, your risk goes up significantly at temps this high. Nevertheless, I think these high temps combined with fasting did some kind of profound metabolic and neurological reset on my entire body, in a way that neither of them would've done alone. It wouldnt surprise me if we're all basically supposed to fast whenever we get the flu or cold or whatever.

Has anyone here had something similar? Or heard of something similar? Again, this goes far beyond anything I had with 5-day, 7-day, 15-day fast, which all had good effects, but nothing this profound.

*Request - Please go easy on the criticisms. I've included disclaimers in this post. I was being monitored (not alone), and made a calculate risk to allow my fever to remain elevated on the basis of my personal health factors and symptoms.*",1,1738018661.0,FastingScience,1,1.0,False

1. **Teaching/Training students more on self-care...**  Importance of enough sleep, proper nutrition, regular exercise cannot be overemphasized to establish habits.       Especially dormers who do not have their parents around to watch out and guide on all that. When I was a student I used to go without sleep for 3 days by taking so much coffee and tea especually during exams
2. **Review the readings lists...** maybe more positive and mentally constructive novels, i personally found some books we read a bit too shocking and dark... and if any spiritual/religious text, must be by proper/authorized teachers/experts of those religions/philosophies who knows what is age appropriate to talk about...
3. **Don't confuse students from the belief system they grew up with.  Early teens is not  the right age for spiritual exploration.**  **Hindi excuse yung sila naman bahala mag decide.  Sana may decision din yung student di ba if they want to hear out based on their readiness to think about which is true or not?**  Better if not part of the curriculum but just extracurricular or optional seminar/forum lang to gather experts for a healthy and harmonious and meaningful discussion hindi yung one sided opinion/interpretation lang ni social science/english teacher.  And only for students who are interested.  Enough adults should be there to make sure the discussion is not too heavy and questions are addressed properly.  Ang point lang naman dapat eh awareness, openness and acceptance of diversity.  **Madami naman other forms of cultural diversity, not necessarily the deep philosophies which need some degree of maturity and stability.**
4. **More strict to ban porn.**  Kamusta ba ang internet ng Pisay?  Noong panahon ko sa Pisay di pa uso internet.  Pero sa UP noon maski sa classroom at library free to access ang porn.
5. **Values/Ethics Education.** Noong panahon namin walk out lang classmates ko sa ValEd teacher.  Medyo wala talaga kwenta, maski yung readings.  Importante pa naman na foundation of peace of mind ang ethics.   And it should not have anything to do  about whether God exists.  Discussion on morals and ethics naman can be just more on the practical rational side of things.
6. **Early intervention.** Victims of abuse are >10 times more likely to become suicidal ([psychiatrist.com](https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/sexual-abuse-impact-suicidal-ideation-attempts-psychiatric-illness-children-adolescents-with-posttraumatic-stress-disorder/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,even%20after%20controlling%20for%20MDD.)). As high as 33% of Filipino kids and teens suffer from sexual abuse ([PNA, 2024](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1218938)) Even higher, 60% experience violent treatment ([PNA, 2024](https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/893-stop-violence-against-children)).  Cyberviolence is at 40% ([UNICEF, 2019](https://www.unicef.org/philippines/press-releases/online-bullying-remains-prevalent-philippines-other-countries)).   Bullying rates in the Philippines are not normal, 65% compared to only 20% in other nations ([EDCOM, 2024](https://edcom2.gov.ph/high-incidence-of-bullying-in-ph-public-schools-alarming-edcom-2/)).  Children typically do not know how to talk about the abuse or not even know the problem and the need for help.",3,1738018304.0,pisay,0,0.72,False
1ibmn71,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1ibmn71/what_are_some_versatile_items/,What are some versatile items?,"Been into minimalism for 7 years. This is my first time engaging with the community. I was wondering how I can further cut down on what I own while still being able to have multiple hobbies. I thought of this because I recently got back into calisthenics and got a french press and realized how versatile rings are for calisthenic workouts and that a french press can do cold brew, coffee and Tea. I was also wondering for what solution I can do for my Pc in the future. I enjoy gaming and being able to customize it but if I were to get a laptop I wouldn't be able to customize it and it would cost more to reach the performance I have on my current Pc.

1ibmmzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ibmmzr/cant_stop_overly_fixating_on_this_one_thing_so/,"cant stop overly fixating on this one thing, so ykw, ik what im going to do","Maybe. Well I keep getting into some rabbit hole on a specific topic, any topic doesn't actually matter... like seriously doesnt matter, but its sorta negative in a way (mostly been scams but then shifted) 

SO 

idk what i'm going to do but I just need to shut everything down at least for a minute and mentally catch my breath, yk? like i'm on the path to mentally just splotching out. idk what im doing or why but i need to do something to reset the hyperfocus on some dumb topic.  too much sugar was a mistake (maybe), listening to way too many upbeat songs even when i felt sick of it was a mistake. (absolutely). 

Well i'm close to having late homework the first week of class again so I need to do something safeish. siteblockers, uh offline mode on my internet, idk wtf im doing i'm going in 50 directions at once again and everything (even the fan in the other room or just absolute silence poses as a distraction for my mind to wander). Unless, of course, I'm just focusing on one thing and somehow i'm like able to push it around a bit? but not really. 

yeah... so in the past i probs wouldve been a bit impulsive and had 1-3 cups of coffee, at least one of those cups being at night (hey not the worst but whatever, i could do alot worse but theres some things i'm not going to ever do for lots of reasons)

Goh so i was going to just not listen to any music or play any games or scroll anywhere, but i failed on all counts... so now what idk. Idk at all. Its fine.  For the next 3 hours then tomorrow I NEED to have some things done that I have barely even started on and these courses ain't a breeze. (math heavy courseload)
