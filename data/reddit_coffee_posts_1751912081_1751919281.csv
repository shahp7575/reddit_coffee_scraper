1lu4l9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1lu4l9h/vendor_wants_deposit_before_contract_signing/,Vendor wants deposit before contract signing/ review?,"Hi all! Just wanted to run something through here to see if I’m crazy. 

My fiancé and I decided we wanted to have a coffee cart at our wedding; coffee is HUGE for both our families and us, but our catering package unfortunately does not include coffee, so we needed to source it elsewhere. 
Luckily our venue does have a preferred vendor who runs a coffee cart, and a well stocked one too that does both hot and iced coffee/espresso in a variety of flavors. This vendor has also worked with our DOC, so I know it’s legit. Total cost for unlimited coffee for 2 hours is $650; steep for 45 people but shit I’ll take a coffee to go in the getaway car if I have to lol. 

Now most of my communication with this vendor has been over email, until yesterday when I received a text from an unknown number that stated they were the vendor, and the deposit for the cart was $100, to be sent through Zelle to secure our date. Except they never sent ANY contract details at all, just their menu and basic service details. I sat on the text for a bit to verify the phone number was what was listed on their website, and everything checked out. I texted them back to ask if they had maybe sent over a contract and I had just missed it, but they informed me that they typically send contract details over AFTER receiving the deposit.

Am I crazy to feel like that’s a huge red flag? Every other vendor we’ve worked with has sent contracts before we’ve sent the deposit. I check these contracts religiously, because I have caught oversights in contracts with other vendors before, and I like to know exactly what I’m paying for. Technically, if I send a deposit without a contract the vendor could literally just take the money and ghost, and I would have no recourse. Especially through Zelle.

I feel torn because on one hand, this is a known vendor who I have strong recommendations for. On the other, this puts us in a vulnerable position if this vendor turns out to be skeevey. I know it’s only $100, but shit, every cent counts. We also tried reaching out to another coffee cart vendor recently, but never heard back, so if we drop this vendor we’re back to square one on the coffee front.

Should I move forward at this point? Or is it too much of a red flag and should we either ask again to have the contract sent before deposit, or just ghost the vendor altogether? 

tldr; Venue/DOC recommended coffee cart vendor wants us to send over a $100 deposit through Zelle to secure our date but never sent us a contract. Not sure if we should move forward or not.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months now and as we consider this both of our first legitimate relationship, we decided to take it slow. Since we first started going on dates, I've told my now girlfriend that I would never force her into a situation if she feels uncomfortable or doesn't want to be there; that all she has to do is tell me, and we can find something else to do, even if she wanted to do nothing, I'm happy if she's happy. 

This coming week, my family and I are going on holiday to the US, we would be staying in a hotel-waterpark mix, and spend the week there to just relax and have fun before college would start again. I asked my girlfriend if she would feel comfortable going with us and she said yes. We got everything booked and I decided it would be a good idea for my girlfriend and I to go out, grab a coffee, come back to my flat, and have a chat: what we're both comfortable with on this trip, what our worries are, what we expect, and etc. The conclusion was that we both wanted to sleep in the same bed and take this as an opportunity to get to know each other even better, which was great. But I couldn't help but think that we were missing an important topic of this conversation: sex. We've both talked about sex before, when we were first talking of taking this slow. I felt it was important to check in on her feelings, and asked if she continues to feel that she wouldn't want to have sex while we were on this trip. She told me that as of right now she can see us exploring that aspect more of the relationship, but she has a low sex drive, so she can't be 100%. I said that was fine, that we didn't have to do anything. This is when she told me that she was a virgin and I was even her first kiss, so this would be a completely new experience entirely. I explained that she didn't have to do anything if she didn't want to, to just say the word. This is when she asked me if I've done anything before, I told her that I'm not a virgin. Last summer, a girl a year older than me had a bit of a fling, but that I broke it off when I finally realized that she didn't want anything more. She simply replied with an okay and asked if I've said everything I've needed to. We ended up ending the night with a movie before I drove her back to her flat. I was hanging with my friends the next day, and one of them said it was an asshole move of me to bring up sex when she told me before that she wasn't ready. 

I thought I had done the right thing by checking in on how she felt as It would be our first holiday together. That it can often be hard for my girlfriend to bring up topics on our relationship as she has anxiety and is on the spectrum and can have trouble finding the right space and time, therefore never brings it up. 

Did I handle this the wrong way? I could use some perspectives on this...Am I the asshole?",2,1751918927.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I found out through shared friends, not from her at all. She reached out to me about 2 months later, crying and apologizing for everything, saying she would do anything to make it right. She said she went through a dark time mentally, and made bad choices. I told her I wanted some time.

So here is the problem, She has been dealing with some addiction issues and her family contacted me, saying I'm the only person she trusts. They are pleading for me to forgive her because she's really in a downward spiral, and is constantly saying losing me was the final straw.

I ended up saying yes to having coffee with her. She seemed sincere and remorseful, and said she would get help. We have been rebuilding our friendship slowly for the last month.

Now everyone is harassing me. My sister thinks I am being a doormat. Other friends are questioning my judgment and telling me I'm giving her the wrong message.

I feel like I believe she is sincere, and she is actually going through the steps to get help. But, maybe I am just being naive?

I have an appointment with my doc tomorrow. He's a good guy, but he frankly doesn't seem to understand ADHD meds very well.

Just looking for some input from the Reddit experts who obviously know more than him ;) (jk)... I know there's a million similar posts, but everyone's story is a little different.

In the last 7 days, my meds (Vyvanse 50m) suddenly stopped working. Not only did they stop working, but when I take them, I actually feel *worse*. brain fog, can't think straight, super irritable, lethargy, no energy in my muscles. Prior to this, they've been a God-send.

I also have Vyvanse 70 mg from a previous prescription. I tried it again, and It's still way too much for me.

The only 2 things I can think of that have changed are:

* exactly one week ago as of my writing this, I had a 24hr stomach bug, puking and diarrhea. After that, my meds tanked.
* In the last 4 days, I also started eating low carb, approximately 50-ish grams of carbs per day.

I eat lots of protein.  
I probably don't drink enough water or get enough sleep. I do drink a bit of coffee... but those things never mattered before.

[Memory Journal entry: 03]

The time is 3:28pm and the date is Wednesday, March 12th, 2177

Sup, it's ya boy, Ross.

Been a bit since I done this, but remembering that war brings back some tough memories. Although you'd think after 48 years I'd be better at handling that trauma, suppose that just shows I'm still somewhat human.

But enough about that.

So, after my last entry, I went and got me the strongest Skalgan alcohol there was at the convenience store down the road. Grenelka's Mercy is a nice little red and grey store, about half the size of a Fred's or Dollar general, ran by a Yulpa named Chimalli, he's in his early 20s, alright dude, can be a little intense sometimes though. 

Apparently his parents fled here after some incident on Grenelka, anyway, after his parents got here they settled down and had him, named him Chimalli because he was born on the planet that shielded them from great wrath.

He's been in New Hope for about 7 years now, even got a  little slogan, ""we sacrifice our prices, so you can spare your time."" 

So, I got me the strongest Skalgan alcohol he had, 190-proof whiskey, Called Skalga's fang. I downed the entire 1.75 liter bottle, mistakes were made and regrets were had, and I blacked out. Woke up by my toilet with a little bit of a headache, not too bad considering, and a plunger on my face.

As one would imagine, I was a little grossed out by having a poop pusher on my face. Not the grossest thing I've had on my face, but it was gross either way. 

So, I washed up in boiling hot water, can't really feel anything on my skin other than pressure, The shower head is like a pressure washer. After my shower I got dressed in some comfy but presentable clothes and headed for work, I'm a ""target retrieval personnel"" under Crimson Sun Industries. 

Crimson Sun Industries is a mercenary/bounty hunter business housed in a warehouse building with basic office space. It's got cubicles, coffee machine, water cooler, a few standing terminals, and 5 sound proof rooms for confidential meetings. The back wall has two doors, the one on the right leads to a small cafeteria and the one on the left leads to an armory attached to a garage.

I'm more of a bounty hunter but I won't shy away from more violent jobs, assuming the pay is good enough. 

Usually I ain't got to kill anyone, although sometimes there'll be someone who thinks they're built different. Usually they're not and it doesn't end well for them, but I have had the misfortune of running into a gen3 before.

Gen3s are the 3rd generation of enhanced humans, although there have been rumors that some skalgans are being enhanced as well, their around 6"" have better all-around senses and reaction time then a gen1 or gen2, have better adaptability, shape alteration, regeneration, speed, and agility then a gen1 or gen2 and can just about instantly learn and master any weapon or fighting style they see. 

This particular gen3 was trained by General Jones her self, the Woman that with the help of 20 soldiers, held the New Hampshire safe zone for 11 months straight while under constant bombardment during the Kahruskan war. Not to mention she was battlefield promoted to colonial in under 2 year of service. She is legendary, and this gen3 was trained by her. Suffice to say it was a one sided curb stomping and not in my favor.

From what I could gather from the counsel it was a test for the gen3, for what I don't know, but I ain't never felt so out matched before I tell you what.

I never did learn their name, probably wouldn't be alive right now if I did. Anything involving general Jones or any other active military official is always blacked out and kept quiet.

Anyway I was heading into work hoping I'd get something off planet. Sometimes the Shadow Cast will hire our services, usually for something they either don't want to or don't care to handle. Whoever gets the gig gets a pretty sizable bonus, usually between 900K-10M depending on what the job is.

Of course for obvious reasons jobs that involve the Federation to any degree are kept quiet and hidden from anyone not vetted by the counsel, the counsel is just some ""data analysts"" that do very thorough background checks. Think net runners but more introverted and surviving off of coffee and spite.

So I checked the service board and the dark slate, the dark slate is just a service board but for off planet stuff.

On the dark slate was a search and rescue gig on Nishtal. A tilfish named Vettik, some low ranking business owner with connections to high ranking exterminators, went missing out by Lesk Valley.

I've been there before, a ""retrieval"" gig, it's a rather pretty place. Kinda like a mixture of the Grand Canyon and Mule Canyon but more green and water falls.

I took the gig and started heading towards the armory to get some light weight armor, a viking tree cutter, and a chiappa hand cannon.

Nishtal can be dense with vegetation sometimes and Lesk Valley is one of them times, a lot of vines, hanging moss, and overgrown weeds makes it a pain to navigate without something to clear a path. Sure, I could just brute force my way through but using a sword is significantly more fun.

After I got my gear I headed off to the  specified area for pickup, it was in a dead zone north of New Hope by about an hour.

Dead zones are just unshielded areas usually inhabited by some of the more lethal animals such as poison vikes, said creatures are a nightmare-ish mixture of a komodo dragon, a rhino, and a polar bear. There deceptively fast, big, scarily quiet, and extremely venomous.

Luckily the dead zone was cleared before hand. Not that I couldn't win against a poison vike or any other beast, because I could, it'd just be a pain and waste of resources.

I ran to the pick up zone and boarded the retrieval ship, basic traversal ship just in black, and headed towards the main ship.

Nothing really of interest happened on the ship. Just basic procedure, board the ship, get scanned for anything unauthorized, sign a waiver, then get placed in a holding cell till we get to the destination.

Two of the guards played some alien poker, but other than that it was just waiting.

Once we got to Nishtal I was dropped off 8 miles from Lesk Valley.

Once I got to Lesk Valley I spent a week searching for any sign of the tilfish. Looking in abandoned ruins built into the canyon walls, abandoned temples, and any caves I could find

It wasn't until the sixth day I found something, an old red arm strap with two vertical night blue stripes on it, in a ruin behind a water fall.

It was a New Kelstrah Cartel insignia.

The New Kelstrah Cartel is a drug trafficking gang composed of manly Krakotl from the branch district in New Kelstrah. They're known for peddling Dream Sand and Fire's Grin, both of which are very addictive and very illegal.

At least I knew he wasn't dead. *Probably*.

The New Kelstrah Cartel used their connections within the exterminators guild to ""dispose"" of any ""irritant"" that was troubling them. With Vettik's connections with high ranking exterminators he'd be untouchable by their usual method of disposal.

Now I  just needed to find out where Vettik was.

From what I remember a common drug trafficking spot was 10 miles south east from Zavek, the city was known for it's trade districts and rich Krakotl culture, which was about 20 miles west of Lesk Valley.

So after about 6 minutes of running I got to the drug exchange spot and found 3 New Kelstrah Cartel members  doing a trade with some Zavek gang members. 

After they finalized their deal I ""convinced"" the Cartel members to share their knowledge on Vettik.

Apparently the business owner was involved with one of the daughters of a higher-up in the Cartel, Cahsek the predator, who is known for being prone to violence when irritated. Of course Vettik had a *brilliant* idea, to cheat on Cahsek's daughter with another one of his daughters.

So now I had to save this fool of a business owner from whatever torture was awaiting him. Great.

So I pressed my informants to either take me to Cahsek or get me someone who could.

They decided to take me to Cahsek.

Smart decision on their part. If it became known they told a foreigner anything, let alone a ""shirkesh"", they'd get *heat* from the local exterminators guild. 

So after a cramped ride in a sky cruiser, an older model by Rashúk Independent,  I was finally face to beak with Cahsek.

To say Carsek looked upset would be like saying the sun is warm. he looked apocalyptic, raised crest, wild eyes, and  an exterminator issue enforcer hand cannon pointed at the head of Vettik. 

That stupid bug was taunting him, saying that he was untouchable and how he'll sleep with all of Carsek's daughters and there was nothing he could do about it.

All I could think was how was I gonna explain Vettik's inevitable death to the client.

Smells I like IRL: petrichor, rainy woodlands, salt air, a greenhouse full of tomato plants, old man pubs, apple pies, coffee, old cinemas, recently extinguished candles, incense burning in an adjacent room (too intense if it’s in the room I’m in!), books, churches, macarons, cola, Black Forest gateau, pumpkin spice, cupcakes, fresh cherries.

Heretic - Angels Trumpet 

Lush - Sticky Dates

Kayali - Vanilla 

JHAG - Musc Invisible

They just don't know what you want from them.,"You have to realize it's not that always that we don't notice you're flirting. It's that we don't know WHY you're flirting. Some girls are just flirty cause they're being sweet. Some are flirty cause they want an ego boost. Some are flirty just cause they want to lead you on and never actually care. Some are flirty just cause it's a Tuesday and their horoscope said they would find their one true love. THEN, some are flirty cause they actually like you...

So, guys don't just want a girl to flirt with him, sure it feels nice, but in my experience guys just want to know clearly and flat out if you are interested in him. Then they want to know how fast you want to take things. Are we getting coffee and talking or are we ""getting coffee and talking""...

In my experience, guys know, but they either aren't into a girl and don't want to embarrass or hurt her feelings by saying so, or they are into a girl and just not sure how much they are allowed to show it without scaring her off.

Chapter 1
It was the third year of Savannah Reed’s marriage to Grayson Whitmore when their marriage license accidentally got soaked and ruined by a spilled cup of coffee.

Savannah brought the damaged license to the City Hall for a replacement.

The clerk typed a few keys in her computer, then suddenly looked up with a puzzled expression.

“Ma’am, according to our system… your marital status is listed as single.”

Savannah froze, thinking she must have misheard.

“That’s impossible. My husband and I got married right here three years ago.”

The clerk double-checked, her expression turning awkward.

“The system shows you as single, but Mr. Whitmore is registered as married…”

She paused.

“His listed spouse is someone named Claire Monroe. Do you know her?”

A sharp ringing filled Savannah’s mind, leaving only a shrill ringing in her ears.

Everyone knew Savannah and Grayson had been childhood sweethearts.

She was the girl he had once called the light of his life—the one he used to protect with quiet devotion.

While Claire Monroe?

Claire was just a stand-in Grayson had found while Savannah was studying abroad because he missed her so much.

Still gripping the ruined license, Savannah numbly got into her car.

Her phone buzzed.

It was a message from Grayson.

“Baby, I skipped out on a billion-dollar deal just to be home early. Got your favorite rose tartlets and strawberry cakes. I miss you so much—do you miss me?”

Savannah stared at the message.

And then, suddenly, she laughed.

The laugh rolled out of her chest like something broken.

And as she laughed, tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

For three years, he had asked her the same question every day.

Had showered her with love and affection.

But behind her, he had already become another woman’s husband.

Memories flashed through her mind—

Grayson, at thirteen, breaking his arm falling from a tree to retrieve her kite.

Yet he still handed her the kite with a smile, saying, “Don’t cry, Sav. It doesn’t even hurt.”

At fifteen, waiting in the rain all night beneath her room, just to be the first to wish her happy birthday.

At eighteen, kneeling under a sky of fireworks in a rented amusement park, whispering, “Marry me when I’m twenty-two, okay?”

At the airport, the day she left for college abroad, eyes red-rimmed as he pinned her to the wall. “Two years. That's all time I'm giving you. When time's up, I'm flying over to take you back.”

During those two years, they video-called almost every night.

Once, she was buried in deadlines and missed his calls for three days.

When she finally reached out, she found out he’d been hospitalized with alcohol poisoning.

In the hospital, he looked into the camera, eyes bloodshot.

“Baby, I can’t live without you.”

She had coaxed him gently, “Just a little longer. I’m coming back soon.”

When she returned, she hadn’t told him. Wanted to surprise him.

But when she opened the private room at The Brambleton Club, she saw him kissing another woman—deeply, desperately.

That woman had the same soft features. The same gentle smile. She looked almost like Savannah.

Her purse dropped to the ground with a thud. She turned and walked out without a word.

Grayson chased after her like a madman. She wouldn’t answer his calls, so he stood in the rain outside her apartment, texting nonstop. Begging.

“It’s not what you think!”

“You didn’t let me come see you—I missed you too much. She was just a replacement…”

“I swear it was only kissing, nothing more!”

“Sav, I’m sorry—I love you so much it’s driving me insane…”

He stood there for three days and nights in the pouring rain. He collapsed from a high fever that turned into pneumonia. Even after being rushed to the hospital, he refused to leave.

Only then did her heart soften, and she forgave him. After that, he treated her with the same devotion as before.

Until after their wedding, when Savannah noticed a new assistant around Grayson. Claire Monroe.

The girl he had sworn he’d sent away.

He explained again, “Her parents are sick. She couldn’t handle being away from home. She begged to come back here…”

“She applied for the assistant position—I didn’t even know it was her.”

“She’s actually pretty good at the job, went through all the screening rounds. I couldn’t just fire her.”

So Savannah tolerated it. Again.

Until one day, she looked up and realized the joke was on her.

By the time her car pulled into the driveway at Everpine Estates, Savannah’s tears had dried.

She inhaled deeply. Just as she reached for the front door, she heard voices from inside the house—Grayson and his friend, Logan.

“I just saw Claire at the hospital,” Logan said. “She’s fine. Just a few scrapes. You can relax and stay home with Savannah.”

Grayson’s voice came next. He was stretched out on the couch, black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed.

“You know the rule,” he said coldly. “No smoking in this house. Savannah hates the smell.”

Logan chuckled. “Man, you are whipped.”

Then, more seriously: “I still don’t get it. You're so obsessed with Savannah. Why’d you even marry Claire? Be honest—was she really just a replacement?”

The room went quiet for a second.

Then Grayson’s voice, low and hoarse: “What if I do?”

“I used to think once Savannah came back, I’d forget all about Claire.”

“But after she left, I kept dreaming about her.”

“I couldn’t tolerate anymore. I brought her back. Gave her a job. Kept her close.”

“I can’t live without Savannah… but I can’t let go of Claire either.”

“Savannah gets all my above-board love. Claire can only stay in the shadows, and I'll give her a title as compensation. That’s fair, isn’t it?”

Logan exhaled. “You know if she discovers this, even you bleed out at her feet she still walks away without looking back.

Grayson was silent.

“Then I’ll just make sure she never finds out.”

Savannah stood frozen on the doorstep. Her blood felt like ice in her veins.

She thought she’d collapse. Break down. But the tears didn’t come.

Because pain like this wasn’t loud. It was silent. It clawed a hole in your heart and left it beating anyway.

She remembered that morning, he had kissed her forehead before heading out the door.

Every time he came home drunk, he’d hold her tightly and whisper, “Baby, I can’t live without you.”

He used to warm her frozen fingers with his own, pressing her hand to his chest. “This heart beats only for you.”

And it was all a lie.

The entire time she was trying to understand, to forgive, to believe in his love.

Now, she saw the truth: he'd just fallen head over heels for two women simultaneously.

He never intended to choose.

He wanted both.

Fine.

Grayson was afraid she’d find out?

Then she’d show him what she will do.

Savannah turned and walked away.

And did two things that would change everything.

Chapter 2
The first thing she did was wipe out every trace of her identity in the country.

The second? She changed her name.

The clerk told her everything would be finalized within two weeks.

In two weeks, even if Grayson Whitmore scoured the entire world, he’d never find her again.

Savannah Reed walked away without looking back, her phone buzzing wildly inside her purse—dozens of missed calls and messages from Grayson.

She didn’t check. She didn’t respond.

By the time she returned to Everpine Estates, the sky had already gone dark.

Grayson was waiting in the living room. The moment he saw her, he rushed forward, anxiety etched deep in his eyes.

“Baby, where were you? I came home and you were gone. I waited for hours, nearly this close to calling the National Guard.”

His panic didn’t seem fake.

Savannah stared at him, dazed, as if something invisible was squeezing the breath from her lungs.

She suddenly remembered back in high school, when Grayson skipped an elite math competition just because she hadn’t replied to his message for an hour. He thought something had happened. He’d run all the way home just to check.

He used to love her that much…

And yet, it turned out, love like his wasn’t something unique after all.

Her throat tightened. Breathing hurt.

I am a French student in innovation management (F26) planning to visit Lviv and Kyiv this summer in August.

I do a little field research study about the initiative ""social drone"" through the lense of social innovation. If you are involved in it, or know someone who is, I'd be happy to learn more about it and would like to help build a drone (and of course order the pieces needed).

I'm also looking to connect with locals and would be happy if you'd share some cool coffee spots, techno clubs, art exhibitions, or whatever is going on in your city.

Today I did something small but big:
I went to a café and didn’t take out my phone.

I just… sat there.
No pretending to text. No fake scrolling. Just me, my coffee, and the quiet hum of the world around me.

It’s weird how uncomfortable it felt. Like I was visible in a way I’m not used to. But also… kind of proud?

I’m learning to take up space. Not in a loud way. But in a “I don’t have to shrink myself just to make others feel comfortable” kind of way.

A year ago, I would’ve apologized for everything.

– Sorry I’m late (even when I wasn’t).
– Sorry for talking too much.
– Sorry for not talking enough.
– Sorry for existing in a way that wasn’t palatable or “low maintenance.”

But now?
I’m practicing letting silence speak when I don’t feel like filling it.
I’m practicing not over-explaining.
I’m practicing being okay with being misunderstood.

Growth feels like peeling off layers of yourself that were never really yours to begin with.

So yeah.
Nothing revolutionary happened today. But I left that café a little more me than when I walked in.

*Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: March 3rd, 2130.*

***Memory Transcription Subject: Joseph, ex-commander of UND Dreadnought, new janitor.***

I received a *very* heavy slap on the wrist, but at least I didn't have to go to jail. But that didn't stop the higher ups from giving me a boring job.

I was now a janitor, a janitor with an ankle monitor heading to my new room on the same shipyard the ship I used to work on was docked.

Said ship had been docked for almost the entire period of my absence, she, alongside her sisters had been undergoing extensive modifications, many of which I no longer had the clearance to know about.

One of the changes I knew about, however, was on their AIs.

One of them, Alexandra, was amongst my contacts on my phone, I'd been texting her for the past few hours, and I decided to ask her about the software changes she went through.

She decided to call me to talk about it, instead. Luckily, by the time she did, I was already in my new room.

""So,"" I started, lazily organizing my things near my bed. ""What did they do to you? Are you okay?""

She stayed silent for a few moments, before answering me.

""They added a new program to my coding, in a nutshell, if I fail to prevent the crew from breaching protocol or I breach any protocols by myself, *everyone* aboard will lose access to the ship's main controls and she will automatically plot a course home and return on her own, and the crew, and that includes *me*, won't be able to do *anything* to stop the process. And then, when we get home, we will face the consequences of our actions.

Of course, I was given the option to not undergo said changes, but it would cost me my job and I would never be allowed to be in a military ship ever again, and considering that I *love* exploring, I decided that the changes in my coding were worth it.

And regarding your second question, if having part of your mind changed ***with*** your consent can be considered as some kind of surgery, then sure, you could say that I'm okay.""

""At least you didn't get laid off or brainwashed against your consent, I guess.""

""I knew that I would need to face the consequences when I decided to not report Josué the moment he contacted you. Ricardo, the AI that was aboard Minas Geraes, on the other hand, had a fate much worse than mine, and I would rather not speak of what they *supposedly* did to him, you are free to search on the internet if you want, though.""

""...I can sense that you are likely uncomfortable talking about this, so let's change topics, what changes were made to this ship that you can tell me about?""

Alexandra took a few seconds to respond. ""There were around a hundred or so modifications that will be implemented to all of the UND class ships, UND Dreadnought has, so far, received 78 of them. The largest changes that I can *tell* you about are that half of the megawatt strong point defense lasers have been replaced with standard [AHEAD firing autocannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_GDF) and [interceptor missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile) arrays.

The vessels will also receive larger and better heatsinks, as well as stronger pumps to allow coolant to flow faster, which in turn will allow the point defense lasers, the primary and the secondary batteries to fire faster without heating up as much, overall, getting past the defenses of the dreadnoughts will become significantly harder and they will be able to dish out much more damage.

I'm afraid that these are the only things I can tell you as of now.""

I nodded. ""Serves me right, I guess. Have they decided when the ships will depart after they finish receiving these upgrades?""

""UND Dreadnought is scheduled to leave tomorrow at 3 PM sharp in order to conduct a test run of the new weapons, as well as start the combat drills of the new crew. The other ships of the same class will leave roughly at the same time, too.

Well, thanks for the talk, I guess I have to start my shift, cafeteria won't keep itself clean on its own.""

*A good talk is good* a *way to start, I guess...*

=================================================================

\[Time skip: 4 hours\]

***Memory Transcription Subject: Gustavo, manager of Project Dyson's Control Room.***

*""Warning, this is not a drill, unknown vessel rapidly approaching the edge of the Solar System, ETA: 30 minutes. Warning...""*

Just this morning, the alarms aboard the Space Elevator started blaring, and according to HLNA, the onboard AI of the Space Elevator, the same was happening across all of the facilities in the Solar System.

One of the patrol probes at the edge of Sol detected an unidentified spacecraft rapidly approaching our Solar System.

How our probe wasn't detected by that unidentified ship, you may [ask](https://youtu.be/s5xGp5_OMls)? It turns out that cooling your spacecraft to temperatures similar to those of deep space and coating the hull with an extremely low albedo painting that also absorbs radio waves makes you nearly impossible to detect. Especially designed radiators also helped the probes stay hidden for extended periods. And apparently that's stealthy enough to avoid detection for Federation ships.

Sure, they were smart enough to try and approach us outside of subspace as to not have a subspace signature, but that didn't stop us from using [gravity sensors](https://www.azosensors.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2482) to detect them, said sensors aren't THAT precise, but they are hard to deceive and *can* tell you that *something*'s there.

Thankfully, the personnel that work in the Space Elevator have been conducting almost daily drills on what to do in dozens of hypothetical scenarios, including a potential spy probe, so panic was largely avoided. But it didn't stop people from feeling uneasy.

""Alright, HLNA, did anyone contact the Command Center back on Earth? We need to start taking action soon if we want to avoid them from detecting our radio waves and our ships in the inner part of our System.""

""I already did that sir, they already gave the orders: find out if who's behind that ship using the data the Venlil provided us with, and then send out a virus package to modify their readings to avoid detection, Programming Department is almost finishing the program that we will send out. Outside of that... their defenses for electronic warfare are *suspiciously* primitive for what's supposed to be an organization composed of hundreds of species, so there won't be much of a struggle to deal with their systems.""

""Good, whatever they manage to see gets purged out of their system, we will most preferably want to not leave any traces of interference on that vessel though. Can that be achieved?""

""Quite easily sir.""

""Alright, get that request to the people working on the program, call the guys back at the Control Room and get them to have all of the probes to stop transmitting their energy, their infrared signature's gonna flare out like a sore thumb if their sensors are good enough,""

There was *so much* stuff that had yet to be done, if I had access to cigarettes, I would probably light one to help me cope with stress, but sadly, cigarettes were strictly prohibited aboard space stations.

""Do you think we will be able to avoid detection again, HLNA?"" I asked her while opening the door to the Control Room and quickly moving to my own chair.

""I'm certain that we will, but if not, and those xenos decide to try and get rid of us, they're welcome to try, they *will not* get past Project Dyson if they manage to get close enough to Earth.

""Don't think like that, HLNA, it only takes a single large missile hitting the tether of this structure to cause hundreds of millions of deaths and *trillions* of dollars in damages, and besides, Project Dyson can vaporize stuff as far from the Sun as Mars is.""

""I think that it would be a good idea to let the Venlil working at their new facilities in Sol that we will be entering lockdown for at least a few hours, sir.""

""Feel free to do so, will spare us some time.""

""And also, the virus I mentioned to you will be getting launched in 2 minutes, I estimate that it will only take a few seconds to brute force our way through their firewall, after that, people at the Programming Department are certain that we will have complete control over their systems after that.""

""And if we don't?""

""Then I guess we're screwed, if that program fails to infect their computers, then nothing short of frying their systems will be as effective, and we don't have time to do much else, they're only a few minutes away from the border of the Solar System.""

I could only stay silent in response.

""Annnnnd the Virus is out! Lets see how long they can hold the little devil out of their precious computers!""

One of the monitors started displaying a virus shape in an interception course with the Alien vessel, luckily, we were able to learn how to invade the computers of the Federation thanks to the help of the Venlil.

A few moments of silence passed, and then-

""Virus is inside their system! 6 seconds to bypass their defenses, alright, now's the time for the programmers to do their magic.""

""So, how much time until their sensors start detecting things?""

""Let me see... It will take the vessel roughly 5 more minutes before they get to the minimum distance for their sensors to be able to record anything useful.""

""Alright, lets hope the generative program is good enough to fool them."" If videos made by generative programs back in the 2030's became nearly impossible to distinguish from real life, a century of refinement's probably more than enough to fool the aliens. *Probably*...

Silence followed once more. Tension amongst everyone was in an all-time high, but there was one similar feeling present on everyone.

""The program has started, their footage will be altered to hide our presence."" HLNA spoke for the last time in the ordeal.

=================================================================

***Memory transcription subject: Unknown, third person POV.***

A craft travelled across the void upon orders of Nikonus. Under the highest level of secrecy and making use of advanced stealth technology to avoid detection from their target.

The objective was to collect information on the old star system of the supposedly extinct predatory species called 'humans', one of the commanders of the Gojid raised his concerns on the possibility of them being alive and having allied themselves with the Venlil somehow, and apparently having saved him from an ambush from the Arxur.

As much as the captain of the vessel thought it to be something reserved for fiction, as no predator would help a possible prey in their right minds, he knew he had to follow orders, lest he risk losing his job.

They dropped out of subspace and immediately engaged the systems to cool the vessel down to match the temperature of background space, a camouflage that, although extremely effective against the large majority of the Federation species, could only be active for a period of time due to the heat sink eventually heating up. But with his experience, he knew he would be able to complete the task at hand within that time limit.

He started preparing the sensors to be activated, his crew doing the same, while he was selecting the infrared sensors and the cameras, a command prompt suddenly appeared for the smallest fraction of a *second* at one of the corners of his monitor.

Something at the back of his brain started telling him that something is wrong, after all, command prompts don't appear out of nowhere. But he reassured himself, if something or someone had *actually* tried to tamper with the computers, the protection softwares would've warned him.

The farsul's fur flared out for a brief moment in frustration as he forced himself to focus again.

""Cameras and sensors are ready, turn them .02 degrees to the portboard side, take the star into consideration, start gathering data, we have exactly 5 *minutes* before our craft becomes visible to infrared sensors again.""

His crew immediately obeyed. The craft vibrated in a quiet hum for a brief moment, before they started collecting data. An image alongside readings across different spectrums of light and radiation types appear on the monitors across the bridge.

He frowned, both the image and readings showed nothing out of the ordinary, but something on the image was bothering him. it was, for some reason -for the lack of a better word- *uncanny.*

*Something* was wrong with the image, but he couldn't pinpoint what, exactly.

He ordered his crew to get him more images and readings, again and again. All of them appeared nominal, showing nothing out of ordinary, save for apparent subspace trails left by Venlil ships moving. He wanted to do a more in depth investigation, but he knew the risks of getting discovered. He decided that maybe the stress was playing tricks with him, and that nothing was wrong, perhaps Sovlin was just paranoid and starting to show signs of predator disease.

With barely a *minute* of time left before they became visible to Venlil craft, he gave the order to return.

If only he knew that their craft was carrying an additional passenger hidden in their computers, he would've ordered a system purge...

After over 2-years together, sometimes this shift feels surreal. I still wake up to a silent phone, alone, in a new apartment missing his embrace. I fall asleep forgetting he's not there. I feel the void again and I can’t shake the emptiness. Every day I slowly accept it’s no longer in my cards right now. This separation affected me more than I ever thought. Some days I don’t even see the point in continuing. It was one of the most painful things. Knowingly loving someone with all of your heart and walking away.

I’m 26 and he is 33, so this was the man I thought I’d marry. I never wanted kids until I met him; that's how locked in I was. He had moved here across the U.S. after a transformative point in his life and ironically I lived right across his job. I was a genuine girl looking for a serious relationship during that phase of my life, and I was putting in the work. We matched and the rest was history. I knew on the first date that he was it, even when I gave him crap. I remember it like it was yesterday. For the first year, we slowly proved ourselves to each other. He never left me confused, knew what he wanted and we were always on the same page. I was always honest and tried to match his energy. Everything was so good, even with small bumps. Plus, I loved his family - the last time we saw them in California, they thought we’d get married...

I wish I could tell him that I’ve been waking up every day at 3:30 a.m. to go to the gym, and I track my check-ins. His old gym that he loved. I had to switch gyms, and took his recommendation little does he know. I remember the first day my heart was pounding because I saw his doppelgänger as I was pounding pavement. I had to stare so hard to ensure it wasn’t him. He would laugh if he knew I was going to the gym this early, it used to be his whole personality.

Now? I’m grieving the life I imagined for us, the fact I thought he was my whole future, and also I grieve the past. Sometimes I wonder how this 180 even happened, I felt like it was a tornado. I never thought we’d be without each other. I miss him every day, even if I’m numb, even if the tears dried, and regardless of what distraction I have in front of me, he’s right there in my stupid head. This can't be healthy. I try not to spiral and just stop it.

Every week I work out, meal-prep, attend therapy, mind-map/journal every night, and self-reflect. I attend Alanon meetings and even read the literature. I even caught myself praying…and I don’t pray. I didn’t think there was enough ink in my highlighter left for writing my revelations. I haven’t had a drink since our end and chose to take it day by day. My ex was an alcoholic, and it took him a while to admit it. I found out after we moved in. I still remember both of us crying. I wanted to prove to myself, and to him, even if he’ll never know, that I’m on this journey, too.

My evenings are quiet and peaceful. I mostly do laundry, clean, go on walks, and spend time outside. I feel like I reverted to my old self, in a good way, but it's lonely. It's not like I can text him a song I like or a silly check-in, or a funny meme. I have a switch I like to play, I paint my own nails now, but even that reminds me of him. I’ve dropped some other friends who weren’t good for me because I learned my character flaws: people pleasing, needing to feel in control when I’m anxious, not trusting my own judgment over others, over- or under-communicating, stubbornness, and defensiveness. Ouch. What about my kindness, beauty, creativity, care, passion, and intellect? Well, all of these perpetual flaws are actually fixable though, that's the good news.

I got heartbroken so hard I even decided not to go on a trip I had planned, and stop my Italian lessons because it’s just not what I need right now, instead of checking off more boxes. This healing is something I’m taking seriously. I also am not dating. I don't want anyone else, I don't do hookup culture, and I am stuck wondering if he's back on the apps, or is gonna just jump into someone else that isn't me in a few months, it disgusts me -- but ""not mine"" I say.

Attending Alanon and incorporating these practices into my life have helped me every day, in micro-moments, even when no one is looking. That’s where the real change happens. I feel it with every choice. It’s a very lonely path, and sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve this.

I know we moved in together after one year, and I had never lived with a significant other. I was very apprehensive, I didn’t want to because I didn't want to ruin a good thing and was financially concerned. Part of me felt like we rushed and should’ve waited, I don’t think living together early on proves anything that wouldn’t otherwise prove itself later on. Maybe it would have been better it we waited. Is there any coming back from this, if we really both wanted it? Although we agreed the downfall was mainly characterized by your drinking and worsening mental health, I am no saint, so my reactions and behavior to this were also not great, and I became unwell. I will admit I was just trying my best with what I knew at the time, and I am sorry.

When you live with someone, there’s no escape; you see them day in and day out, and you can't hide anymore. We both like staying in mostly, very clean, enjoy cooking and quality time, cooking weekend dinners, our stupid shows. It was like nothing else mattered. When we moved in, I didn’t know how to manage my time between work and having a boyfriend around in the same house and of course hobbies and friends. There was no longer a separation of all of them so I could delegate. It took me way too long to transition, and I was in over my head, but I couldn't admit it like I was now. Finances became a stressor \[I work at a nonprofit, but am getting another higher-paying job I wish I could tell you all about\]. We temporarily split finances where you paid a lot more in rent. Finances became a stressor, and our original agreement was that after I finished my student loans (I paid them off finally by the way…yay) was going to happen regardless of my other bills.

I know originally, your desire to recognize you needed to stop drinking, the mental health gap (the irritability, moodiness, and isolation), causing distance was difficult. I know me running even further to be out of the house when you weren't in a good mood, or because i thought i needed girl time when I felt like I had to keep up with everything, even though I was drowning and just wanted to stay by you. I didn't know my limits.(my picking fights because I was scared, yelling when i wasn't heard, and crying because i was too tired) because I was overwhelmed after trying what I knew was hard…I feel the cuts. I didn't know what to do, and felt not good enough. I always admired and teased you about being a Navy veteran and I feel like you had a lot of unresolved baggage. I felt an instant connection and still do, just something about you though. You're super strong, but it’s too much for someone to carry alone, and you don't have to do it alone.

I remember trying to plan dates (painting, yoga, video-games, coffee and walking) cook dinner and plan meals, pay for our anniversary dinner because I wanted to contribute more, wrote cute morning notes, setting up morning coffee, packing a nice lunch, making the bed every morning and folding the blankets and trying to clean, cleaning your bathroom, baking muffins for work….but when you kept saying I didn’t prioritize you, I felt confused. I think I understand now you meant it wasn’t measured by the actions, but the day-to-day quality time, and you were right - I was struggling with that. I was so frozen. I remember breaking down and hysterically crying and yelling -- two things I never did before, I was so lost.

For 6-8 months we tried but I don’t think we realllllllly tried. We knew there were issues, that we wanted to be together, but I don’t think we understood the magnitude of them or how long it would take. When things were unhealthy for us at the tail end — We broke it off because I reached an emotional breaking point. I was overwhelmed with a job I’m moving on from, feeling jealous of the past and wanting our future to be good so I wasn’t present in the moment, I ran away when he just wanted to be close because I was scared, and I felt like I couldn’t take care of myself and you, that you needed to do your  own inner work for yourself, too. Both partners ned their own life jackets even if they're in the same boat. Although our lifejackets should protect us the majority, sometimes our lifejacket doesn't inflate, and we rely on our partner and vice versa -- there are two lines of defense, but both partners need to work on their health to work on each others health. In therapy, I wish we focused more on the bigger picture instead of your drinking/health, because I felt it in my bones for him this love -- that I, too, need to change. I didn't know any of this then. My behavior also became not me. I wish I could tell you all of my realizations, admit my shortcomings and apologize.

Maybe I was too impulsive and should have been more patient, but I just wanted us back but I couldn’t take the growing pains. If I could go back I would. If I could go and try again and I mean really try, maybe the second time would be stronger. I wonder if we will ever have a second chance. Sometimes I really do think the heart grows fonder with distance because it brings clarity. I truly believe if they were yours, you’ll find a way back to each other. Maybe I’m just delusional. It makes me think: Did he really love me?

Things I seriously learned the last month of no contact: my growth:

* It’s normal for people to prioritize their partners more often than not, and in the end, I could’ve done a better job when he verbalized it. I really could’ve, and I knew that I was capable of it because I did it before
* Learning when to pause/stop a conversation before it turns into an argument and walk away, and revisit it later. Pausing a conversation may feel uncomfortable but it doesn’t mean anything bad if both people need to cool down and return when they're ready -- it’s normal
* Communication about the mundane is so important. It may not feel like it, I’m so bad about being on my phone when I’m out and about, and I wasn’t used to checking in regularly before - it was so foreign that even a text of a plan change, or picking up a call would solve so many problems!
* Coming together during disagreements or arguments and trying to be close because even when I didn’t want to, it’s one of the biggest times we needed it most - letting the ego aside for a bid of attention
* Keeping most things between the two of us. He’d roll his eyes if he knew I posted on reddit again because I used it a few times to vent anonymously. Here I still am but with more of a realization than a vent. I learned that most things should not concern the opinions of others and to look inward to your partner
* Listening more than talking. When I felt defensive or stubborn it was because I needed to actually listen to what he was saying. It wasn’t my job to pretend I always knew what was best, I didn’t..
* Just fucking apologize. Is being “right” really worth it, for what? Sometimes we just need to not justify or explain because it comes off as defensive and stubborn, we just need to acknowledge their feelings and say sorry, because we may not think we hurt their feelings or didn’t anything wrong but to them we did so it’s valid
* Sex is a connection and was to both of us. He didn’t feel close when we didn’t have it because when we didn’t have that we didn’t have any sexual intimacy which was also very important. I understand when emotional needs aren’t there sex isn’t, but honestly sometimes it made me feel closer and it is what brings in closeness. In the moment I kept thinking he wanted sex because he wanted something, and I had to be perfect or couldn’t do it, but now I understand he just wanted closeness and me and that is all
* Slowing down. God life is so hard but your partner should more times than not be your rock. I wish I slowed down. I didn’t have the tools I did now to step back and really prioritize what I needed. I wish I slowed down and slept in on the weekend to cuddle like we used to — the market could’ve waited.
* Sometimes we need to take leaps of faith when we're not ready and trust until proven otherwise 
* Even if we don’t get back together, I am proud of myself for growing for me and being really kind to myself even on the days I don’t want to keep going.
* Distance helps show us what we're capable of, and we can channel the pain to grow, be more productive versions of ourselves. We can't run from ourselves but we can learn how to work with ourselves

I have this nagging feeling maybe he’ll come back, but knowing him, he probably won’t. I still find it hard every day to move forward. I know actual work takes a few months to get back on track, so if he breaks no contact or I do, or if we don’t — I can’t have any expectations. I am still working on myself with one foot in front of the other, for myself.

Sorry for the rant, it's like this is what I wanted to say to him, but never did since we aren't talking.

I'd been itching to address it but kept putting it off for weeks. It feels way too vulnerable bringing up stuff like this, especially when it's about work-life balance and not being burned out, which is hella important to me. 🙃

I can still remember sitting there trying to summon the courage one Monday morning, sipping my third cup of coffee, just to muster some energy. I thought about how stressed and tired I'd been lately, and it really pushed me to do it.

I'm not gonna lie, my palms were sweaty, and I was low-key freaking out about how it would go. But, surprisingly, my boss was really understanding. I realized afterward that I'd been imagining worst-case scenarios in my head for nothing! It made me think about how often I let those fears hold me back. 

This convo ended up making my work environment so much better, and I feel a bit more assertive now.

(Relationship),"So, I 30m have been with my partner 29F for 6 years, we’ve had a break before but everything has been relatively all okay. It’s been hard to get her family to accept me and my work, (don’t see me good enough for her) we started off really sexual, anywhere anytime kind of vibe. Was amazing! We’re into the same things (because she has taken a liking into my hobbies) and we live together now for the last 2 years. 

Here’s the issues, without being horrible, she’s gotten lazy and doesn’t care about much really at all. She doesn’t care about appearance anymore, hair, clothes, etc. has put on weight and now sits around saying she isn’t happy with how she looks but when I offer help or advice or a training programme she won’t do it or makes an excuse like too tired, or not confident. She doesn’t really take an interest in my stuff anymore or if I want help or support it’s not really there, the words are there but the action isn’t anymore? 

I feel like we’re drifting, like friends, i want to feel like my woman needs me, craves me wants me, loves me like I’m the shit and my shit don’t stink kinda support and love! 
I feel like she doesn’t love love me anymore, like I don’t feel craved and wanted she says she does but I just don’t feel it anymore. I feel lost and craving/looking for it. (Been like this on and off for a year or so) 

If we have convo about it, she’ll ‘realise’ and change for maybe 2 weeks and slowly go back to it again. She says it’s because I don’t help as much with housework anymore so if I can’t do that why would she wanna give me all this love and sex etc. 

I find it hard to get this as I feel as though mine is an emotional need from my partner to feel a certain way for connection where as hers is more a physical chore. Like if we wasn’t living together it wouldn’t be a thing for her side but mine is always there?? Maybe I’m a douche? 
I just now feel when she’s being nice or loving it feels forced and abit weird ? Plus sex isn’t a connection 50% of the time….

Now the difficult part, I went to a family fun event with friends who have kids and met a single mum of 3kids!!! (I said I wouldn’t get with a single mum) The same age as me, and we’ve both had the same kinda raising and previous relationship issues. 

We got introduced, she’s attractive but nothing like my partner now who has a body to die for! 
But she found me very attractive and complimented me plenty of times modestly. 
This mum call her (S) asked about my situation and if I would like to ever have a coffee. I said I can’t I’ve got a partner even though it’s not great right now I wouldn’t cheat… roll on a few more hours and we’re just clicking on everything. I now can’t stop thinking about (S) she made me feel wanted, needed, loved. She came from a very abusive relationship and this is why the dad is not on the scene anymore. 


I guess what I’m asking is, am I being stupid. Relationships are like this and just carry on? Should I keep asking throughout my relationship to fix the issue of how I’m feeling? 
Is my time done? Sell the house move on? 

Is this other girl the one but got 3 kids?  Wtf do I do guys!? 
(Oh it’s so hard for me to make decision or know what’s right as I’ve been homeless before and my partner helped me get life straightened 6 years ago and support that, I don’t wanna end up on a bad place again ) 
Also, mentally it’s so much pressure and I do suffer with alot of anxiety or depression so I just replaying and not getting to the end of anything.

1lu3cdq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lu3cdq,Setup,"Hi there! Just wanted to share my setup and a bit of my coffee journey.

I started (again) making espresso on January 1st, when I got a Kitfort KT-7234 as a gift (it costs around $76–80). After a month with it, I felt like I was stuck — I didn’t have a grinder. So I bought a HiBREW H10B and a HiBREW G3 (still have it, just switched from single dosing to on-demand grinding).

Two months into using the HiBREW setup, I gave it everything I had (well, not everything, but quite a bit) and bought a used Expobar Office Pulser. It was sold for $571 as a bundle with an Expobar Tranquilo grinder. Interestingly, the machine was barely used — in three years, it made fewer than 30 shots, which was clearly reflected in its condition. The grinder, too, had only gone through about 1–2 kg of coffee. I cleaned the machine thoroughly, replaced the steam wand (the stock one felt like it came straight from hell), and made a few other tweaks. As for the Tranquilo grinder… I honestly don’t like it. You can’t properly set the grind time, it’s just annoying to use, and overall it’s not my thing. But no one wants to buy it either — haha.

Right now I’m using the Expobar with the HiBREW grinder. I’m not planning to upgrade the machine anytime soon — instead, I’m looking to upgrade the grinder. I’ve got my eye on the DF64 Gen 2 to move into single dosing and start tasting a wider variety of coffees.

That’s where I’m at for now. Thanks a lot for reading!

I left some papers on my metal coffee table without realizing one of the pages was wet. The moisture plus the ink seems to have reacted with the surface.

I tried cleaning it with a vinegar/water solution… nada. Then I made a baking soda paste and scrubbed it a bit, and that actually made it whiter and more noticeable. It seriously looks like my table has a rash and needs ointment 😂

When I spray water over the table, it beads up everywhere except the discolored spot. I’m guessing the finish or coating is gone in that area?

Some brands are built in boardrooms. American Rebel—America’s Patriotic Brand—was born in a bar. Over cold brew, live music, and a love of country, a vision took shape: to create something real, rooted in values, and unapologetically American.

Inspired by our founder’s journey—from TV screens to the backroads of America—American Rebel [AREB-0.78%](https://www.benzinga.com/quote/areb)\+ Free Alerts is not being built in business meetings but at race-day tracks, in honky-tonk bars, at concerts, or family BBQs. American Rebel is connecting with fans, turning them into customers at the events and places they love. It’s an authentic, not forced, connection that’s taking off.

It’s a brand powered by beer, music, freedom, and the red, white & blue spirit that runs deep in this country. Like Black Rifle Coffee and Liquid Death, American Rebel didn’t come from a corporate strategy deck—it came from entrepreneurialism and passion for America. Consumers are catching on. The market should, too.

In under a year, the company’s flagship product, Rebel Light, has gone from unknown upstart to one of the most culturally resonant beverage brands in America. And the rocket fuel behind that rise isn’t just taste. Its identity.

Rebel Light isn’t a gimmick. It’s a lifestyle—unapologetically patriotic, proudly American, and built on values most of corporate America won’t touch. While competitors hedge their branding with focus-group-friendly slogans, American Rebel does the opposite. It plants a flag. And it’s working.

The result? A brand with real roots, loyal customers, and a growing national footprint in both physical retail and e-commerce.

**Consumer Driven For The Right Reasons**

Rebel Light’s trajectory hasn’t just been fast—it’s been consumer-driven from day one. The brand continues to win retail placements, including Total Wine & More and 62 Minuteman Food Mart locations across the Carolinas. Additional distribution is expanding rapidly across the southeastern and Midwest USA, with distribution agreements in its home state of Tennessee and additional top-tier distribution partners in Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, Indiana, and Virginia.

Meanwhile, the American Rebel is pouring in some of the most influential venues in Nashville—Kid Rock’s Big Ass Honky Tonk, Tootsies, Losers, Redneck Riviera, and Doc Holliday’s among them. It’s not just presence—it’s performance. Bartenders say Rebel Light is taking market share from traditional brand heavyweights. And when tourists, upon returning home, start requesting that their local retail and restaurant establishments carry Rebel Light, that’s real grassroots brand pull, exactly what the company envisioned and expected.

Results are also showing up online. After rebuilding its digital storefront and launching a strategic free shipping campaign around the July 4th holiday, the company saw its e-commerce metrics skyrocket. Website traffic soared 4500%. Orders jumped over 1000%. Bulk sales—particularly the 48-pack—spiked nearly 3000%. Repeat customer rate rose 72%.

That kind of traction is rare in consumer packaged goods, especially from a company this early in its life cycle. But it’s a clear sign that Rebel Light isn’t just a novelty—it’s striking a chord with Americans across the country.

And that traction isn’t just consumer-driven—it’s investor-relevant. Digital marketing now serves as a high-performance engine to identify loyal buyers, improve conversion, and drive regional product demand—something very few small-cap beverage companies have mastered at scale.

**Built Socially Bars on Real Values**

What makes American Rebel different isn’t just its product—it’s positioning. Rebel Light is a 100-calorie, better-for-you light beverage that’s brewed without corn syrup, rice extract, or added sweeteners. But that’s not what makes it special.

What makes it special is that it represents something. In a market where most brands are hesitant to stand for anything, Rebel Light proudly champions a message of patriotism, personal responsibility, and American spirit. It’s “America’s Patriotic, God-fearing, Constitution-loving, National Anthem-singing, Stand Your Ground Beer”—and it doesn’t apologize for it.

CEO Andy Ross is more than a figurehead—he’s the embodiment of the brand. With roots in outdoor television, a music career built on country rock and American themes, and a fan base that already knew him long before Rebel Light launched, Ross gives the company authenticity and cultural credibility. When he sings at a race or headlines an event at Fort Campbell, Ky, in celebration of the 250th US Army Birthday- he’s not marketing—he’s connecting to an audience that’s been waiting for someone and a brand that represents what they stand for and their values.

That authenticity is translating into consumer demand-driven retail placements. Motorsports is a part of American Culture, and that makes it important, if not essential, for an unapologetic, bold brand like American Rebel. American Rebel has been and says it will continue to be the title sponsor of several NHRA events, including the American Rebel Light NHRA 4-Wide Nationals at zMax Raceway in Concord, NC, and the recent American Rebel Light Virginia NHRA Nationals. The brand sponsors Tony Stewart Racing and appears on both the Top Fuel Dragster and Matt Hagan’s Funny Car.

At the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Rebel Light was the #1 selling brewed beverage brand—beating out massive legacy brands in their own backyard. That’s not just a marketing win. That’s market proof.

Distributors, retail chains, and regional buyers see that kind of data and act on it. This is a company turning event buzz into real-world contracts. And once it’s on shelves, the performance speaks for itself. National awareness is growing fast, and AREB's manufacturing capacity, secured through partnerships with AlcSource and City Brewing, provides the ability to scale without compromising quality or delivery.

**A Breakout Small-Cap Narrative Is Brewing**

American Rebel isn’t just a product story—it’s a brand platform in the making. According to Ross, Rebel Light is just the beginning. His vision as founder and CEO has always included expanding America’s Patriotic Brand - American Rebel-branded grills, tailgate gear, apparel, tools, and more.

And yet, despite the early success, American Rebel Holdings remains one of the most under-the-radar consumer growth stories in the public markets. For now.

That disconnect between brand velocity and stock visibility is what makes this such a compelling idea for small-cap investors. The customer base is growing. The retail base is growing. The reorder rates, repeat traffic, and online sales are growing. The only thing that hasn’t caught up yet—at least not fully—is the market cap.

And that’s where the opportunity lies.

Because American Rebel is the kind of brand that doesn’t just generate sales—it generates loyalty. It generates energy. It generates momentum. And in the consumer sector, that trifecta is the most valuable commodity of all",1,1751915494.0,TheStreetReports,0,1.0,False

Some Tips That Helped Me

Walk as much as you can. If you’re a history buff, every street has a story. Walking gives you a more intimate connection with the city.

Take the ferry, metro, and buses whenever possible.

Keep an open mind. Kolkata isn’t trying to be a polished tourist city. It’s unapologetically itself.

Talk to locals. Many buildings, lanes, and ghats have hidden histories you'll never find online.

Eat the local food. ik it's obvious but it's really good

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

1lu2phj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1lu2phj/was_i_a_karen/,Was I a Karen ?,"Question for servers and managers here. Me and my friends went to a breakfast restaurant yesterday and my friends got iced coffee, I did not, and the server yesterday told them there’s free refills ! Today we thought we would go to the same place for breakfast, my friends told me how good the coffee was so I decided to order one today, new server. Once the check comes, today we were charged twice for the coffee. So we’re all confused thinking why. We ask TODAYS server what happened and he informed us that yesterday’s server told you guys the wrong price. I told my friends we should ask the manager if they can make an exception since we ordered thinking coffee had free refills, they’re non confrontational and don’t like inconveniencing people. As all this is happening I’m thinking about how yesterday’s server told us that she had only been working there for 3 weeks. We ended up paying but I did tell my friends to advocate for themselves when something is not right because we weren’t told the correct information. 

TLDR: went to a restaurant yesterday, got coffee and server told us there’s free refills. Went to same restaurant TODAY, got coffee, and got charged twice, new server tells us no refills and that yesterday’s server told us the wrong price. I felt we should have had a price adjustment based on info told to us yesterday, my friends were too anxious to say anything. Paid and left.

Btw Love the restaurant ! Both servers were amazing, just wanted know if I was overreacting ?

My typical day looks like:

- morning drink: water, ashwaganda, Shatavari, ground flax, and some chia seeds. 

- snack: fruit and nuts

- protein drink: Pure whey isolate with creatine and water(this is new)

Instance 1: I loved the clip in aftersun where there was a fly on her thigh and Taylor swatted it away but it seemed like he slapped her butt and it was funny and cute and Nic got territorial. Also when Nic got weird with Elan giving her coffee/breakfast. 

Instance 2: when she was super upset after Andreina came in and he said he wanted to get to know her. No cuddles in bed and wouldn’t let Huda talk to her lol. Seemed very genuinely upset.

Instance 3: the crying at casa amor over what’s gonna happen in the villa and then the kissing and hugging when she was reunited with Nic post casa.

I think she did go on the show to further her influencing, but who doesn’t? Let’s be real. I do think in the process she developed real feelings for Nic (can’t say the same for Nic…) and wanted to pursue that. Her connection came off as cute and genuine to me. 

I don’t condone racism or slurs but she also does have a whole BLM highlight reel on her profile and I know we aren’t talking BLM but I can’t help but think she should’ve been given the opportunity to be held accountable. Instead we pummeled into her while she was in the villa without a phone. A lot of you are coming off on a moral high ground and we just have to be realistic about how many people say things they might not think are problematic. Also the scoresheets of people correcting her seem very photoshopped if you look closely but I guess idk. 

The decision to send Hannah home also was not solely up to her, other girls played a part in that but honestly I think everyone decided they thought she was annoying and not genuine and then when the slur came out they just went in harder to get her off the villa. 

Probably speaking into oblivion here, many people won’t like this post and that’s okay. Stop Asian Hate and also…she is human and her connection seemed genuine. Her style was cute and she seemed bubbly. I will miss her in the villa and I feel sad for her at the moment. Looking forward to her taking accountability when the time is right for her.

I did pass this AM but very frustrated about my experience and the approach PMI is using.

I've been doing Pgrm/Project Mgmt for over 20 twenty years in various industries (Pharma, IT, and Finance/Banking) and wanted to get this certification for all those years but life/kids took over. This year I said I was going to do it.

I started the process in February and took AR's 35 hours, bought a coffee cheat sheet, listened to DM's course, listened to AR, MR, and DM YT videos as well as studied my butt off in SH essentials for the past 3 months and my scores were 67% and 74% on mock tests.

Yesterday, I sat for the exam and it was no joke. I thought at one point ""WTH"" is this. The questions were paragraph length, all answers seemed appropriate, and I just couldn't believe the exam was structured like this. I get some folks get easier tests than others but these tests prove nothing as far as doing ""real life"" PM work and was annoyed at the level of ridiculous unrelated questions.

I'm glad it's over but will say the mindset that all these folks share on YT and through the courses is far from what my test was. Perhaps, the PMI reads these threads and is changing the tests to reflect more situational based tests but tbh, a PMP will not get you the PM experience and I'm unsure why PMI isn't gearing folks to be successful and truly understand what real world work (its hard enough to get folks to realize that these days) is rather than making it so far fetched and out there that people start to lose faith and feel lost.

1lu2d33,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lu2d33/should_the_best_espresso_machine_be_the_chulux/,Should the best espresso machine be the CHULUX Kompatto Review?,"The CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 espresso machine has been my trusty companion for the past few weeks, and I must admit, it has stirred up my mornings in the best way possible. I’m someone who relies heavily on my caffeine fix, and testing this machine was as much about indulging as it was evaluating. Although the stainless steel body and sleek, modern design caught my attention immediately, it was the promise of a 20-bar pressure pump and milk frother that truly sealed the deal for me. However, no product is perfect, and this one, too, has a mix of upsides and quirks.

**The Design That Fits Anywhere**  
I was pleasantly surprised at how compact this espresso maker is. At just 5.6 inches wide, it slotted into my small kitchen counter without me having to sacrifice much-needed space. The metallic finish isn’t just stylish; it cleans really easily, which is a blessing when you’re as clumsy with coffee grounds as I am. The removable drip tray and water tank are thoughtful touches from a usability standpoint, making cleanup far less stressful. Additionally, the inclusion of components like a portafilter, single and double cup filters, and even a small spoon meant I didn’t have to run out hunting for extras after unboxing.

**Highlights of This Espresso Machine**  
- 20-Bar pressure pump delivers impressively rich and aromatic coffee.  
- Compact, stainless steel design is both durable and elegant.  
- Included frothing wand creates creamy microfoam with ease.    
- Fast 30-second preheating is perfect for busy schedules.  

**The Performance That Keeps Brewing**  
This machine is all about efficiency, and I could see that clearly from day one. I was blown away by how quickly it brewed my espresso shot—within just 20 to 30 seconds after the quick 30-second preheat. What stood out most, though, was the quality of the coffee. Thanks to its pre-soak and low-pressure moistening process, the espresso consistently had a well-balanced taste, with lower acidity than what you’d expect from some other machines. Every cup was like having my personal barista.

[Check CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0cpj2xtxf/)

**Adding a Touch of Creamy Perfection**  
The built-in steam wand deserves its moment in the limelight. I got really creative experimenting with lattes and cappuccinos, and I must say, the froth it produced was rich and silky. I’m still getting the hang of making latte art, but the wand made me feel like a pro. One neat detail is how it also provides hot water for Americanos, which my roommate, a non-milk drinker, absolutely loved.

**Drawbacks to Take Into Account**  
- The noise level is noticeable during operation, which could be a concern for light sleepers.  
- A bit of effort is needed to clean the steam wand thoroughly after each use.  
- Limited to manually ground coffee, so pods aren’t an option.  

**Direct Competitors**  
The CHULUX Kompatto goes head-to-head with well-known machines like the Breville Bambino and De’Longhi Dedica. While those models might have a slight edge in terms of build quality, the Kompatto strikes a balance between affordability and functionality. The coffee quality is undeniably on par with the pricier alternatives. A feature that I particularly appreciated here is the pre-soak function, which ensures even extraction—something I’ve found missing in competitors at this price range. However, the Breville did operate more quietly, which is worth noting if early-morning noise is a concern in your household.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When comparing it to other espresso machines within a similar price bracket, this machine stands out for offering premium features like PID precise temperature control, a 20-bar pump, and a frothing system at a relatively budget-friendly point. For anyone venturing into the world of espresso without breaking their bank, this feels like a worthwhile investment. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of high-end models, it packs an impressive punch for what you’re paying.

1lu2c6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lu2c6t/what_makes_the_ninja_cm371_coffee_maker_a/,What makes the Ninja CM371 coffee maker a must-read review?,"The Ninja CM371 Coffee Maker, officially named the ""Ninja Hot & Iced XL Coffee Maker with Rapid Cold Brew, 4 Brew Styles, 8 Sizes Small Cup to Travel Mug, Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, 12-Cup Carafe, Permanent Filter, Removable Reservoir, Black,"" has been a welcome addition to my kitchen over the past few weeks. As a daily coffee drinker with a varied palate, I can say this machine has truly made life easier and my mornings brighter—though it does come with its own bag of quirks. Here's everything I’ve discovered so far about this coffee machine after daily use:

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about the Ninja coffee maker is how sleek and modern it looks. With its black exterior and compact dimensions (12.32""D x 9.13""W x 15.08""H), it fits snugly on my kitchen counter without dominating the space. The removable reservoir and buttons sit flush, giving it a polished feel that doesn't scream ""cheap appliance."" The glass carafe, which can hold up to 12 cups, feels sturdy and well-made, and the permanent filter adds an eco-friendly touch. However, it’s not the lightest coffee maker—you can tell it’s not budging once it’s placed. For its price point, the overall build quality feels durable and upmarket.  

[Check Ninja CM371 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0csdrzsgg/)  

**Brew Styles: A Coffee for Every Mood**  
Here’s where the Ninja CM371 really shines. This machine provides four distinct brew styles: Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Cold Brew. Each mode delivers a strikingly different flavor profile, which is fantastic if you like to shake things up. My favorite is the ""Cold Brew"" option, as it delivers a smooth brew in under 10 minutes—a game-changer compared to the 12–24 hours I used to wait. For occasions when a piping hot cup of joe is needed, the ""Classic"" and ""Rich"" modes provide a perfectly balanced result with consistent flavor. “Over Ice” provides a bold concentrate that doesn’t taste watered down even after the ice melts.  

**Brew Sizes: Truly Versatile Options**  
Eight different brew size options make this machine adaptable to every coffee craving. Whether I want a small cup, an XL mug for a heavy caffeine fix, or a full carafe when hosting friends, this coffee maker covers it all. The travel mug size is a lifesaver for those rushed weekday mornings where I just need to fill and go. No matter the size, the coffee extraction remains consistent—a hallmark of Ninja’s “Thermal Flavor Extraction” technology. To add to the convenience, the removable reservoir with auto-metering takes out the guesswork; it senses the water level automatically, which is a surprisingly thoughtful feature.  

**Advantages**  
- Four brew styles for maximum coffee expression.  
- Easily removable and refillable reservoir.  
- Eco-friendly with no pods required.  
- Excellent flavor consistency across different cup sizes.  
- Cold brew in under 10 minutes is incredibly fast.  

**Coffee Extraction and Taste Quality**  
This machine uses what's marketed as “Thermal Flavor Extraction.” I was skeptical of the marketing speak but admit the results generally justify the hype. Each cup is full-bodied, and you can tell the temperature control and saturation levels are dialed in just right. This is especially noticeable in the rich and classic brews. It doesn’t taste like generic machine brew—it’s flavorful enough to rival what you get at boutique coffee shops.

**Drawbacks**  
- The water reservoir design makes it slightly hard to clean thoroughly.  
- While the machine is fairly customizable, the control buttons can feel a little less intuitive.  
- At 9.04 pounds, moving this coffee maker for countertop cleaning isn’t exactly convenient.  

**Special Features Worth Mentioning**  
One perk I really appreciate is the “24-Hour Delay Brew” option. Setting it the night before to have fresh coffee ready in the morning might actually be my favorite feature. Additionally, the automatic shut-off is an understated lifesaver on those mornings I rush out the door. The inclusion of the permanent filter not only reduces environmental impact but also proves to be incredibly easy to clean. It’s clear the machine was designed with convenience and versatility in mind.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing the CM371 to other coffee makers, one competitor that stands out is the Keurig K-Cafe. While the Keurig is pod-based and offers easy single-serve options, it’s less versatile in brew sizes and lacks the ability to make cold brew. For those who prioritize convenience and don’t mind pods, Keurig’s system might be a winner, but it fails to deliver the eco-conscious and customizable experience this coffee maker offers. The Breville Precision Coffee Maker also came up in my considerations but lacks key features like iced coffee and multiple brew sizes that the CM371 offers.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Regarding cost efficiency, I’d say this machine delivers solid value relative to its capabilities. Considering the number of features packed in, including pod-free operation and the rapid cold brew feature, it punches above its weight in this category. If you’re someone who switches between hot, iced, or specialty coffees regularly, this machine will feel like a steal. But for those who stick to a basic cup of drip coffee, its advanced bells and whistles might be overkill.

1lu2apr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1lu2apr/ingredient_coverage_by_type/,Ingredient Coverage by Type,"Before we actually find out what Expert mode entails (and renders my chart pointless) I thought it would be interesting to see what kind of Ingredient coverage by type.

I am basing production only on finding rate and speed at level 60, actual values will vary based on inventory, Main Skills, etc.  Since I don't want to imply anything, the units are in terms of how much better it is than Bonsly finding Mushrooms (the worst).

Since I'm aware that things are likely to change, I didn't put in a lot of work to make it look nice.  The colors are based on the Ingredient and are based on the best finder of that ingredient, Green finds at least 80% of the best, Yellow at least 50%, Red is lower than that.

Sometimes there are multiple good Pokémon for a Ingredient-type combination, but I just put the best one.

https://preview.redd.it/69xmofqknhbf1.png?width=2864&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc58ec8ba20172fc7ffb7745948cd1951a45a890

Some observations.

C ingredients are the hardest to come by (only Dragonite and Ditto are green for their C ingredient) but in many places is the only choice for coverage.  But will people actually raise Pokémon for their C ingredient?  That is a lot of investment for not a lot of return.

Several types don't have a lot of good coverage.  Ground only has Dugtrio in green/yellow.  Fairy only has Comfey.  There are only two Dragon types, and only Dragonite is any good.

For a lot of types, it might look like they have decent coverage, but the same Pokémon appears more than once.  For example, Fighting has 3 Quaquaval and 3 Bewear in green or yellow.  But that doesn't necessarily mean it has ""good"" coverage  because in practice, to achieve that coverage, that would mean you'd need an AAA and ABB and AXC for both those species on your team in order to get full coverage on those six ingredients.  I don't think it is likely people will be raising multiple of the same species in this way.  Of course, you could just use an ABC for coverage, but that will just give ""some coverage"" rather than ""good coverage"" of the three Ingredients, since A and B in an ABC will be worse than AAA and ABB.

There's a lot of Pokémon where they are the only ones that give an Ingredient for their type, but since they don't specialize in it, they aren't very good at finding it.  A lot of others don't have any combinations at all.

Obviously, I don't expect answers right now, just questions that I'm looking forward to seeing what is going to happen.  So some considerations:

* There will still be three berries, one is the *main* favorite.  But since it is random, that makes it difficult to plan ahead without preparing *something* of each type
* The main favorite will get ""helping-related bonuses"" and so it is possible that these bonuses can boost those worse ingredient rates into something more worthwhile
* Those outside the favorite berries will get penalties.  It is not likely that they will be completely unusable, and we will need to decide whether the benefits are worth the penalties.",0,1751913740.0,PokemonSleep,0,0.5,False

Hi I am thinking about moving from my (broken, after 3 years already!) Delonghi la sepcialist maestro (yeah roast me) to an upgrade. I need to consider a few things

    99% i only drink coffee in the morning, foamed milk and different types of infusion and a few times an espresso

    using very dark spanish/portugese roasts mostly

    i am a bit stressed in the morning, faster getting a coffee is better

    it needs to be optically acceptable to my partner (bianca with stainless and wood is)

    should not be very loud

As the bianca does not have a grinder, i am looking for a suitable grinder, too. And a table to place it on, that fits the machine (not that I would personally care but...)

So, vast knowledge of the Espresso world, what would be good for someone used to push buttons in the morning but is willing to learn and extend the knowledge to another world?

Any recommendations?

Or anything Instagram would call “a backyard oasis.”But we have this.," And somehow, it feels like more than enough.It started with a trampoline we were going to give away the springs were squeaky, the frame a little wobbly. But every time we mentioned it, the kids protested like we were suggesting we sell the family dog.“This is where summer lives,” my son once said, dramatically flopping onto it like he was in a Shakespeare play. One Saturday morning, I found my husband out there stapling old fabric scraps onto the mat. “Just to give it a second life,” he said.By evening, we’d turned it into a canopy bed.The kind you’d see on internet only this one had stories sewn into every inch.The curtains were made from our wedding sheers.The lights were left over from our daughter’s 10th birthday.The pillows? One of them still smells like my grandmother’s cedar chest the last one she gave me before she passed.And the cushion covers? Hand-stitched by the seller I met when I went looking for “something that feels like a hug.”She messaged me back:“Then I’ll send you one.”Now, this little cloud of a corner is our family’s favorite place.We have pancake breakfasts here on Sundays.My daughter reads novels with her feet in the air.And last week, my husband surprised me with a thermos of coffee and a note that said,“You turned a trampoline into a temple.”And maybe he’s right.Because in a world that moves too fast and forgets too easily this space holds.It holds our laughter.Our rest.Our growing kids and aging parents and long talks under the stars.So no, we don’t have a backyard oasis.We have something better.We have love, stitched and tied and glowing softly through white curtains.And when people ask where I bought all this I smile and say,“Some of it came from my heart.The rest came from people who put theirs into everything they make.”",1,1751913558.0,EmotionalCrafts,0,1.0,False

I am looking to meet a woman for a potential long term relationship/forever person. Age doesn't exactly matter, but I can't see it working too well with someone too much younger than me as the further apart we are in our lives, the chances are we will have less in common.

I have a long term established career and have always been incredibly ambitious. That said, I have a good sense of work life balance, and place high value in romantic and family time. I have two children (14 and 11) and have half custody of them (full week, every other week). I have had a vasectomy and am not interested in bringing any other children of my own into the world. I do love children though and would be happy to meet single mothers and childless women alike.

I would like to avoid too much online chat and would like to meet and see if we vibe sooner than later. Whether that is a walk in the park, a meet at a coffee shop, meet for a drink at a pub, etc. Message me and let's find our spark!

It turns out, this habit isn’t new it’s deeply human.

In ancient times, riddles weren’t just entertainment, they were tools for survival, storytelling, and even gatekeeping. The famous **Riddle of the Sphinx** in Greek mythology? That wasn’t just a literary device — it reflected the cultural belief that solving problems was a sign of worthiness, even life or death.

In **medieval times**, monks used logic puzzles and mental exercises as part of their daily rituals to sharpen the mind and spirit. Fast-forward to the **19th century**, and newspapers began printing puzzles in the morning editions a way to “wake up” the brain with something more than headlines.

And now? We’ve got **apps**, **YouTube quizzes**, and mini logic games waiting on our phones before we even roll out of bed.

So why do we keep doing this?

Some say it’s habit. Others say it’s brain chemistry. But I think it’s because puzzles give us *a small, satisfying win,* a way to reclaim our mental energy before the world starts making demands.

For me, it’s become a morning ritual, right after water and before coffee, I do one emoji quiz, one pattern puzzle, and one spot-the-difference. Feels like a warm-up set for my brain.

I’m curious, do you have any morning brain rituals?  
Do you solve puzzles, read riddles, or play a quick game to jumpstart your mind?

Here's the **TK Maxx method** that a lot of UK resellers quietly use:

# ✅ Why TK Maxx?

* Constantly rotating stock – no two stores are the same
* Big brands at heavy discounts (Nike, North Face, Vans, etc.)
* Yellow sticker clearance = huge profit margins
* Great for shoes, streetwear, kitchen gear, toys, beauty products

# 🧠 The Method:

1. **Go Midweek (Tues or Wed) Morning** Most stores restock early in the week – you’ll catch new drops before the crowds do.
2. **Check Clearance Racks First** Look for **yellow sticker items** – they often mark stuff down 3+ times.
   * Trainers marked down from £50 → £16.
   * Kitchen items £5 → sell for £20+.
   * Beauty bundles can be gold.
3. **Use the eBay App In-Store**
   * Scan barcodes or search manually.
   * Look for sold listings, not just active ones.
   * Stick to items with consistent demand & sold comps.
4. **Don’t Sleep on Niche Stuff**
   * Premium socks
   * Uncommon toys
   * Outdoor gear
   * Hair tools (GHD, BaByliss, Revlon)
   * Coffee gear or reusable water bottles (Hydroflask, etc.)
5. **Buy Low, Sell Mid**
   * Even if you double your money after fees, it adds up.
   * Use multi-buy strategies if an item’s hot.

# 🛑 Tips:

* Be respectful to staff – they know resellers come through.
* If you find good items, check other TK Maxx branches nearby.
* Save receipts. TK Maxx has a generous 28-day return policy if something doesn’t sell or turns out to be a dud.

Along these lines, it's interesting to notice how couples are willing to be physically intimate before marriage, under the guise of determining compatability.

But if you tell them to simply find a quiet corner at a coffee shop, and sit across from each other and discuss sexual expectations... they'll say that's weird because it makes them uncomfortable.

I lost my daughter,"I’ve been carrying this story in silence for almost two years because it hurts more than I can explain. But I’m done being quiet. Maybe someone out there will hear me.

I live in Québec. During COVID, I had a baby, my daughter. I was in full postpartum depression, completely isolated, and overwhelmed it was during peak quarantine... couldn't find no help no nothing everyone were either closed or not taking new clients. I reached out for help thinking DPJ would support me. That was my first mistake. I was honest in a moment of despair, crying and saying “I’m tired... maybe I should put her up for adoption.” I never meant it literally. I was just exhausted and broken.

But from that moment, it was like I triggered a chain reaction I couldn’t stop. Suddenly I was in non-stop meetings with adoption workers, people treating me like I'd already made up my mind, even though I was crying in every single meeting, saying I didn't want this.

They never told me I had a right to a lawyer.
They never offered me real help to stay with my daughter.
They just kept moving forward like my words didn't matter.

The only paper I ever signed was a temporary placement in foster care for one year, not adoption. I even started improving. I got a job as a dental secretary, found an apartment, a car, stability, but it was never enough for them.

They made me do two psychological evaluations , both chosen and paid by DPJ. The first one was in my favor and said I was a good mom, just struggling with depression. DPJ didn’t like that one, so they had me evaluated again by someone else. The second one suddenly labeled me “manic depressive” even though I was doing better by then , and that was the nail in the coffin.

The foster family was two white men,a gay couple (i have absolutely nothing against that)  and at first, they promised it would be an open adoption. They said things like:

“You can bring her to school some mornings.”
“When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.”
“We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.”
I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her.
I never got to tell a judge my story.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th.
I haven’t seen her in over a year.
On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did).

Hello, IndieExchange! This week, I'm trying something different. I've done ""mystery bags"" before, but they were pre-made. This time... I'm designing five-sample bundles based on customers' requests!

What you would do is give me the ""vibes"" you're seeking--e.g. ""I'm on vacation in the Greek Isles and floating on my back with the sun shining on me,"" or ""I secured a spot in my favorite coffee shop to write when it started pouring rain outside""--and I would give you **5** ""mystery"" samples for **$14.00** (plus $5.00 shipping). Also, let me know if there are notes, or brands, you're trying to avoid.

While I reuse packaging, I'll try to include some treats / freebies, as well. Home is pet-free, and while a smoker lives with me, there is no smoking in the room where fragrances are stored. PayPal G&S only.
 
TAT should be 72 hours. I can ship Tuesday through Friday, but for orders placed beyond Thursday late afternoon, shipping will wait until the following Tuesday.

If you are interested, please reply to this comment and I will initiate a chat.

I wait a bit, thinking maybe she’s just finishing up something. Nope. Five minutes pass.

I give a polite beep.

She looks in the mirror, rolls down her window, and yells, “I’m not ready yet! Just go around me!”

I say, “There’s no way around. You’re blocking the whole lane.”

She shrugs and goes back to texting.

I ended up reversing into the street to get out. I wasn’t going to sit behind her all day.

Later that day, I went in on foot to grab coffee, and the barista recognized me. She said the woman finally pulled up, then argued with staff for ten minutes because she “waited forever” and thought they “skipped her.”

* [Chocolate ](https://worldmagzine.com/food/the-story-of-chocolate-in-india/)is celebrated worldwide not just as a dessert, but as a symbol of indulgence, emotion, and cultural identity.
* Viral desserts like Dubai chocolate and tanghulu show how social media drives global food trends.
* Spirit-chocolate pairings and flavour-led travel experiences redefine how we enjoy this beloved treat.

Every July 7, [World](https://worldmagzine.com/world/) Chocolate Day reminds us that chocolate is far more than a sugary indulgence—it’s a shared emotional experience spanning continents and cultures.

Meanwhile, the internet—especially TikTok—has become the world’s dessert compass. From Indonesian martabak manis to the viral Dubai chocolate, social media platforms fuel [food](https://worldmagzine.com/food/#google_vignette) pilgrimages.

# Sweet Signals: How Chocolate Connects Taste, Travel, and TikTok Trends

Chocolate has outgrown its reputation as a mere snack. It’s become a powerful symbol of [celebration](https://worldmagzine.com/sports/glenn-maxwell-retires-from-odi-cricket-a-career-celebration/), nostalgia, and even status. In recent years, the rise of bean-to-bar artisans and ethically sourced cacao has pushed consumers to consider the origin and craftsmanship behind their sweets, transforming a simple treat into a statement of mindful luxury.

Cultural reinvention is another layer of chocolate’s modern appeal. Countries like Japan, India, and Peru are reimagining chocolate with local flavors—think matcha truffles, filter coffee-infused bars, or spicy mole-style blends. These regional takes reflect a fusion of tradition and innovation, offering a taste of heritage with every bite.

[Social media](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/sebis-social-media-rule-whatsapps-crackdown-a-big-win-for-investors/) has given desserts their golden hour. TikTok, in particular, turns sweets into showstoppers, using short videos to showcase rich textures, dramatic drips, and cross-section cuts. Platforms like Coffeeness leverage AI to sift through millions of uploads and identify dessert trends that spark wanderlust and cravings in equal measure.

Luxury meets indulgence in chocolate-spirit pairings, a growing niche that elevates tasting into sensory storytelling. A citrus-accented dark chocolate can echo the earthy botanicals of a dry gin like Hapusa, while a silky praline complements the oaky finish of an aged rum. These curated duos encourage savoring slowly—an act of indulgence and mindfulness.

World Chocolate Day isn’t just a celebration of sweetness—it’s a global toast to creativity, connection, and[ culture](https://worldmagzine.com/culture/). Chocolate continues to evolve, but its place in our hearts remains deliciously constant.

**Here are some examples of how we interact:**

* Our school gave us each a limited food budget, and we took turns paying for each other's meals using our cards.
* I usually grab him coffee with my card whenever I get one, even if he doesn't ask.
* We often order the same meal or split one. If he orders drinks, he always asks me what he should get.
* He *really* dislikes social gatherings, but he'll come if I ask. I paid for the first one we went to; he paid for the second.
* He stayed up with me until 2 AM to help with a project, even though his part was already done. I thanked him by buying some treats from a bakery.
* We live in the same area, but he'll walk the route closest to my house so I can reach home quicker.
* Whenever he's very stressed or nervous, I noticed he says my name. Not to call me, but i think it grounds him
* A lot of people see us as a pair—we prefer to sit next to each other and usually attend things together. If one of us is invited somewhere, people assume both of us are coming.",4,1751912775.0,ISTJ,0,0.84,False

For a long time, I thought it was something I could only get at fancy coffee shops. But recently, I discovered how to make it at home, and I'm excited to share what I've learned.

Nitro cold brew is basically regular cold brew coffee that's been infused with nitrogen gas. This gives it a rich, velvety mouthfeel and a beautiful cascading effect when poured. The best part? You don't need expensive equipment to make it.

First, you'll need to start with a good cold brew. You can make this easily at home by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cold water for 12-24 hours. The longer you steep, the stronger the brew. Once you've strained out the grounds, you've got your base.

Now, here's where the magic happens. To add the nitrogen, you'll need a special dispenser. These are like mini kegs that use small nitrogen cartridges. You pour your cold brew into the dispenser, charge it with nitrogen, and shake it up. When you pour it out, you get that signature nitro effect.

I found a great selection of nitro cold brew makers here: https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have options for all budgets and skill levels.

One thing I love about making nitro cold brew at home is how much money it saves me. A cup at a coffee shop can cost $5 or more, but making it at home costs just cents per serving.

Plus, you can experiment with different coffee beans and brewing times to find your perfect flavor. I like to use a dark roast for a rich, chocolatey taste, but a medium roast can give you more subtle flavors.

Another benefit of nitro cold brew is that it's naturally sweeter than regular coffee. The nitrogen brings out the coffee's natural sugars, so you might find you don't need to add any sweetener at all.

If you're health-conscious, nitro cold brew is a great choice. It's less acidic than hot coffee, which can be easier on your stomach. And because it's so smooth, you might be less tempted to add cream or sugar.

Making nitro cold brew at home does take a bit of practice. My first few attempts were a bit flat, but I soon got the hang of it. The key is to make sure your cold brew is strong enough to stand up to the nitrogen, and to really shake the dispenser well.

For those who are serious about their coffee, investing in a good nitro cold brew maker is definitely worth it. You can check out some great options here: https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have everything from simple handheld devices to more professional setups.

In conclusion, making nitro cold brew at home is easier than you might think. With a little practice and the right equipment, you can enjoy this creamy, delicious coffee whenever you want. It's a fun way to elevate your coffee game and impress your friends. Give it a try - you might just become your own favorite barista!",1,1751912715.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

“When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.”
“We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.”
I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her.
I never got to tell a judge my story.
I was erased.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th.
I haven’t seen her in over a year.
On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have videos of the foster parents interfering during visits.
I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did).
I have a timeline of everything that happened.
But two lawyers told me there's ""nothing I can do"" because she was adopted so young.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen parents on drugs still allowed to see their kids every weekend.
But me, sober, stable, and emotional during postpartum, was treated like a monster.
How is that fair?

I’m terrified to hope again. Every time I think I’ve found a way, I hit another wall. But I’m writing this here because maybe someone out there knows what I can do. Or maybe someone went through something like this and just… gets it.

I want to believe there’s still a chance.
Even if it's just to be in her life again.
Even if it's just for her to know that I never gave her up.

I just want to see her again...at least one time.. because last time i saw her i didn't even knew it was going to be the last... I'm grieving a child that's alive and that's the most fucked up thing I've ever been thru...",19,1751912457.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.83,False

After a few weeks it started channeling reeeaaaalllly bad no matter what I did. I found that a common fix/upgrade was to replace the group head. I opened it up and it looks like it hasn’t ever been cleaned or replaced before 🙈 I managed to get the shower screen off pretty easily, and I got the screws out of the group head, but it’s stuck on to the machine like it’s super glued. I’ve tried sticking a screw driver and prying it out, and I’ve hit it pretty hard with the butt end of my screw driver, but it won’t budge. Any ideas of how I can this thing off? I have also tried getting the gasket off first, but that also won’t budge, I even tried the “screw trick” and I was only able to get little bit outs from the gasket. 

Any tips or tricks would be highly appreciated! Missing my espresso coffee ☕️

1lu1oju,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1lu1oju/working_for_my_deadbeat_aging_dad/,Working for my deadbeat aging dad.,"My dad has never been a good person to his family.
He is very delusional about how much he has done for his children.

Growing up, my mum had mental health issues (exasperated by being a single mother and having no one to help her or any family members of her own). Whenever she had an episode or was hospitalised, my dad’s brothers  (uncle & auntys) family would take us in and look after us.

After, becoming adults and trying to find our own places in the world, things don’t work out with my university and I’m trying to do a career change from healthcare to IT.
As well as starting medication for ADHD treatment.

I hear that my dad has a cafe and that he wants help to do ‘afternoon teas’.
I jump at the chance to do this as I would love to be my own boss and do something creative.

I made two different menus using my own savings. I come down to work here and I am only used as a waitress.
Running around like a headless chicken, taking orders, cleaning toilets, learning coffees, doing night shifts to make cocktail preparations and baking too (buying ingredients with my tip money).

My dad doesn’t pay me. He hasn’t paid me properly at all.
I lugged all my things here and at first knew I didn’t want to be paid for the good of the business.

But when I confronted him about why I haven’t been given money to start making the cakes or anything- he questions me and says WHY DIDNT I ASK FOR IT??

To top it off, my brother was sent here as my mum couldn’t live with him anymore as he is very tyrannical and didn’t leave his bedroom for 3 years till he got sent away at age (28- 6months ago). 
Anyway, he constantly blames me for this and always speaks to me like shit. Tells me that he doesn’t like me but that he needs my help.


I’m sick of being here with no money and not seeing my friends or having no control of my life again.

I stopped my IT course because I thought this was my big chance.
My dad later told me that once this business becomes a success, he wants to sell up and move away. Which isn’t what I signed up for either.
None of them deserve good things- especially from me.

Part of me wants to stay on and create good things, for my sake and my experience BUT I don’t think I feel good about it when it has my dads name on it and working with them both is killing me.

I’ve made nice friends here with the waitresses but it’s not enough to put my life on hold. And I’m sure they won’t stay forever either.

Has anyone else been in this predicament? 

Before I came here, yes I was on a course. But I was also unemployed looking for work and getting nowhere. I had ideas but I could never use them. 
If I go home, I’m scared I’ll be stuck in that loop again. 
But I know I wouldn’t be getting used.

Help!

1lu1oj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nervous-Gazelle-5909/comments/1lu1oj2/minha_esposa_está_escondendo_algo_de_mim/,Minha esposa está escondendo algo de mim,"My wife has been acting really strange lately. We've been married for 8 years and have known each other for 17. I still remember how we met. It was the first day of high school. I didn't know anyone until I saw a girl who stood out from the others. It must have been because of the way she picked out random clothes from her closet and the dark circles under her eyes, a result of staying up until 3:30 in the morning (not that that detail has changed).

And like any good teacher on the first day, he told us to pair up so we could get to know each other. Since I didn't know anyone, I waited to see if anyone would be left out so I could find a partner. As if it were a sign of fate, she was left without one.

So, I slowly approached her and asked if she had a partner. With that charismatic way of hers, she said, ""No, my imaginary friend is right here next to me. Can't you see him?"" she frowned. ""Sit down there, idiot."" Just from her behavior, I was already interested in her.\]

Her name is Júlia, a woman's name that could keep you in therapy until you forget her. But not in this case; we spent the whole class talking about games, anime, and other things that nerds enjoy.

After that day, we always sat close to each other. Whenever we could, we would pair up, and 90% of the time, the teacher would separate us and put each of us in a corner of the room.

In our third year of high school, we started dating. That year is like a blur in my mind; I only remember the proposal I made to her and losing our virginity at the end of the year.

Now that you know my history with Júlia, I'll start telling you why I began to suspect her. On March 15th, I was drinking coffee, needing energy for work. Typically, Júlia would get up when I was already leaving, but that day she rose earlier and stared at me with a look that made me feel like I was hiding something, like a nervous and scared child.

I asked her, ""Honey, are you okay? You seem a little nervous.""

She looked wide-eyed, as if I had discovered something she didn't want me to know.

""I-is everything okay, honey? Why are you so worried about me? Did something happen?"" she asked with a scared look.

I still felt worried, but I answered her question, ""I'm okay, honey, it's just that you're acting a little weird. That's why I asked.""

She looked at me with a look of relief, then replied, ""Oh, today I want to surprise you.""

I was a little surprised by her statement, but I figured it was fine; she must be trying to please me after these difficult days. I didn't say anything else, just gave her a goodbye kiss, and then went to work.

The rest of the day was normal. She made a chocolate cake, and we spent the rest of the night talking and watching a series about a guy who killed his parents, continuing our lives normally. But that night left me with a ""flea in my ear,"" as we say.

I was sleeping normally until I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, returned to the room, and realized that Júlia wasn't in bed. Then I heard a noise so faint outside that I wondered if I had really heard anything at all.

I decided to look, just to ease my mind. Looking outside, I noticed Júlia jumping the fence to return to our house. As she headed towards the backyard door, she was looking around as if she had just committed murder.

And now I'm at work writing this story. So far, I haven't confronted Júlia. What do you think I should do?",1,1751912324.0,u_Nervous-Gazelle-5909,0,0.99,False

1lu1oa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegaslocals/comments/1lu1oa6/good_places_for_reading/,Good places for reading?,"I’m starting a reading club here in Vegas and want to select local businesses to visit across town. 

Here’s the criteria:
- comfy seats 
- enough space for a group of 4-6 to be there comfortably 
- can buy just a drink or snack (full meal not required)
- not too dark inside  
- not too loud inside (or has a quieter patio option)
- local business ideally 

We’ll also be going to parks when the weather is nice ☺️ 

The vibe should also be reading-friendly. General noise while reading can be eased with headphones of course, but we should be able to talk normally (so bars will usually be wine bars for this reason). Or for a cafe, I like the vibe at Gabi but it’s soooo busy and loud. I tried once with another group and we couldn’t sit together to chat. Places with good patios are ideal, because they’ll naturally be quieter, they just should also be weather-friendly. 

Spots in mind currently:
- Vesta patio (Summerlin)
- The Coffee Class (Summerlin)
- Firefly Tapas patio
- Flowerchild patio
- Honey Salt patio
- Ada’s Wine Bar 
- Wineaux 
- Rooting For You event room

Let me know what other places I should scout around town! Especially for the comfy chairs 🙏

And if y’all are interested in joining the group I’ll make another post about it when the first meetup is planned. ☺️✨",6,1751912311.0,vegaslocals,5,0.8,False

And why?","I’m trying to figure out triggers. There are no safe foods, just ‘safer’ foods. They all cause immediate and massive bloating at a minimum. Some also cause diarrhoea, rosacea flares, mouth burning and sores, you get the idea. Everything I put in my mouth causes pain. Except espresso.

Pourover coffee often can, but the same bean ground finer and prepared as a shot of espresso doesn’t. This has been consistent for the weeks I’ve been trying to eliminate triggers.

I have dysautonomia, so I always let coffee cool enough to avoid triggering a heat reaction. So, it isn’t that.

How on earth is this possible?
