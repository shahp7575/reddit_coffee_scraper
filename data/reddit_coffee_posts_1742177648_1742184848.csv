So far he has made some really nasty coffee experimentations:

1. Mixing different coffee beans together without looking at the labels or where they're from (I'm gonna call this the coffee jungle juice) and grounding them up into the machine

2. Roasting coffee with different kinds of liquor. Moms pissed at him for stinking up the house with booze vapor because its just panfrying alcohol with coffee beans

3. Air drying coffee beans bought from a grocery store indoors like ??? it's already been dried why are you drying it further 

4. He never cleans up after himself and has to wait until the housekeeper comes

I mean, everyone else at home is just leaving him to his devices and we're all now just using coffee pods cuz we don't wanna deal with dad. But should someone like stop him? Like he isn't taking this coffee journey seriously where he's taking notes and keeping a log of what he's doing with coffee.

1jd460e,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1jd460e/vestibular_migraine_give_me_all_your/,"Vestibular migraine, give me all your recommendations please","**Hi,**

I (M, 38) am writing because I am getting a little desperate here. I've always suffered from headaches, but the past year has been grueling. I've been having more and more migraines, with the added symptom of dizziness. It seems that stress is a huge factor in my case. Sadly, the days when I experience the most stress are the ones when I feel the worst (on the day of my last doctoral recital, I woke up with the room spinning).

I am getting a little scared because I can't continue like this—my livelihood depends on playing in stressful situations. I am a classical musician trying to get a full-time job, which means I need to play auditions and recitals under stress.

At my last doctor’s visit, I was given Nurtec (Rimegepant), which works more or less okay, but I only get six pills per month (thanks, insurance...), and I feel a tad dizzy with a constant headache at least three or four days per week. I can deal with the standard pain, but the dizziness is killing me—I can't do anything. Also, I don't like that my nose has become a little numb during some episode. 

I've tried meclizine for the dizziness, but I don't think it actually makes a difference.

Please let me know what you do for vestibular migraine—I am willing to try anything at this point.

# Extra Information:

* I had a couple of heart ablations for arrhythmias in the last couple of years, and I am still taking heart medication (Diltiazem and Flecainide).
* Running kind of helps, but it is very difficult to go out once I have a full-blown episode.
* I usually feel better in the afternoon/evening. Many times, I wake up okay, but I get a migraine within the next hour.
* I drink 2–3 cups of coffee per day. Not sure if the quantity makes a difference in any way.
* I haven't discovered any food triggers, and I basically eat a little bit of everything.

I live in a small tourist town (under 20k population) that isn’t the most developed, but it has potential. I’ve got two business ideas but also a big fear of taking the first step.

1) **Coffee Shop in a Motel** – Breakfast & lunch with a simple menu (3 breakfast items, 3 desserts, coffee). The space is for lease and was a restaurant before, so it still has working equipment. It's been empty for years but is in a decent spot.

2) **Food Trailer (Truck) with Charcoal Grill** – Serving stuffed flatbreads (like Greek pita pockets), burgers, coffee, and cold fruit drinks.

I know the challenges—staff shortages, rising food costs, and my lack of experience running a business. But I also know that if I don’t try, I’ll never know.

So, if you were in my shoes, would you start a food business in this kind of town? If yes, which concept would you go for and why?

Which is fine I don’t mind sharing but.. 

I don’t know them a great deal and they seem friendly but have noticed they are incredibly nosy and like to pry, (have even admitted to telling me and parents that they like to look out of the keyhole when they hear me or my parents leaving for work). when they first moved in they got into the habit of knocking regularly and would try to invite themselves in for coffee and tea. I had bumped into the guy a couple of times at the start of the year and would ask me in whenever his partner wasn’t home which just felt a bit strange. I was also going out to a party one evening and bumped into him on his own and he made comments that I looked really well and that my dress was sexy, again very odd and quite uncomfortable, went out of my way to try and avoid meeting in the hallway for months after that. Not sure I’d like my partner telling other women they looked sexy (that’s just me though?) 
He always specifically goes out of his way to mention that he doesn’t seem me often enough even when his girlfriend is standing right next to him.

It was a little awkward trying to set boundaries as me and my parents all work from home at alternating times, and we ended up having to ignore the knocking. I think they got the message and we went back to the saying short hellos when passing in the hallway. 
However dropping off the spare food seems to have opened up a can of worms because now the guy wants to make me a breakfast and drop it round one morning during the weekend. I told them I may or may not be in on the day they want to bring over cooked food because I have to take work calls/ run errands on that morning, but they insisted that they’d be knocking around 11-1pm, I am booked in all week and weekend so don’t have the time to stop but they don’t seem to understand. The guy also communicated that he was  jealous that my parents got in touch with his gf and didn’t include him as well. 

What would you guys do in a situation like this? Am I overreacting to the behaviour of the dude in particular? Any solutions/similar experiences welcome!

However, it can be challenging to understand what path to take when it comes to monetizing your videos since every creator earns in different ways on YouTube.

Today, we'll discuss six ways to [earn money on YouTube](https://1of10.com/blog/how-make-money-youtube/) and provide examples of creators who do each!

[This YouTube video likely provides tips and strategies on how to monetize a YouTube channel.

# 1 - Ad Revenue

The thumbnail suggests a focus on financial success and generating income through video content.](https://preview.redd.it/e32cfcws46pe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=86a84bf2f87ffef004cff6a3af80b6b4c67b2afe)

# What This Means

The most popular way to [make money on YouTube](https://1of10.com/blog/make-money-youtube-examples/) is ad revenue.

YouTube places ads on your videos, and you earn money whenever someone watches or interacts with these ads. The amount you make depends on factors like video length, audience demographics, and the number of people watching the ads.

Unfortunately, to do this, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means you need [1,000 subscribers](https://1of10.com/blog/how-get-first-1-000-subscribers-youtube/) and [4,000 hours](https://1of10.com/blog/reach-4-000-hours-watch-time/) of viewers watching your content, or 10 million short views.

Now, once you reach those stats and get accepted, all you need is for people to watch your content so you can make money.

It's important that you're aware of RPM, Revenue Per Mile, and the total revenue per one thousand views. Some niches, like personal finance, education, and tech, have higher RPMs, while some, like comedy or gaming, have lower. So, it's incredibly important to know the RPM of the niche you're in if that's how you'd like to make money on YouTube.

Graham Stephan is an excellent example of someone who makes a significant income via YouTube RPMs. His official channel alone is making over $100,000 a month: no employees, expenses, or advertising on his end. It's just him, a camera, and a laptop, making just over a million dollars a year through ad revenue.

He makes so much because he attracts high-paying advertisers like banks, investment platforms, and insurance companies in the Finance niche. His audience averages more income, so he, or should I say YouTube, can charge advertisers more for putting the ads in front of them.

# 2 - Sponsored Content

# What This Means

We're all used to the phrase ""This video is sponsored by..."" Sponsored brand partnerships allow creators to collaborate with certain brands and sell their products to the creator's audience.

Companies pay you to feature their products or services in your videos. This could be a brief mention, a review, or an entire video focused on the thing you’re endorsing.

You can either reach out to brands, or brands can reach out to you. However, make sure to endorse brands that would make sense to sell to your audience. If not, you'll leave a wrong impression on your viewers, and their perspective of you will change from an authentic creator to a sellout.

A creator who attracts sponsors and endorses only what the audience can benefit from is Babish.

# 3 - Affiliate Marketing

# What This Means

This is as simple as it gets. You talk about a product and link your viewers to check it out in the description or the comment section.

Affiliate marketing is especially useful for creators who don’t have the largest following.

You promote products through special affiliate links and earn a commission for each sale you make through your link. Again, make sure you choose products that are relevant to your content and useful to your audience, very key.

Affiliate marketing can be an awesome way for creators to earn income without YouTube‘s partnership program. It's also perfect for reviews, such as tech.

Yes, that was a transition to talk about Marquise Brownlee. He reviews tech that he can include links to in the description, so when his viewers want to buy that product, he earns money.

# 4 - Courses or Digital Products

# What This Means

If you’re knowledgeable in a certain niche, you can create and sell online courses, e-books, or other digital products. This is incredible for creators with a large audience of viewers with the same problem.

If you want to know your audience's problem, ask them! Either through the comments, community tab, or even a full-on video, once you know the problem the majority of your audience faces, you can see the product. The majority of your audience will want and buy it.

# 5 - Channel Memberships

# What This Means

Channel memberships are a way for YouTube creators to [earn money on YouTube](https://1of10.com/blog/make-money-youtube-without-face/) directly from their audience.

Viewers can pay a monthly fee to become a member of the channel, which [gives them access to exclusive content](https://1of10.com/blog/deep-psychology-why-viewers-click-subscribe/), special badges that appear next to their name in comments, custom emojis they can use in live chats, and other perks like early access to videos or members-only live streams.

This system is similar to memberships on platforms like Twitch or Patreon, where fans support creators by paying for extra benefits. It’s a way for creators to reward their most loyal viewers while also generating a steady income.

A creator who did this incredibly well was Technoblade. He took full advantage of this feature. He launched his channel memberships and found success instantly. He offers members-only live streams, videos, posts, custom emojis, and the exclusive chance to play live video games with him.

# What This Means

Creator-led businesses have become a powerful way for YouTubers to grow their influence past the platform they started on and create companies that resonate with their audiences.

What's different about creator-led businesses is that they are extensions of the creator's brand and personality. It allows them to connect with their fans in a new, meaningful way while making money.

If you have a large enough audience interested in you or what you do this can change the way the see the game that's YouTube.

For example, Emma Chamberlain launched Chamberlain Coffee, a brand that perfectly matches her laid-back vibe. She knew her fans shared her love for coffee, so she created a product that feels like an extension of her personality.

[An image of Emma Chamberlain](https://preview.redd.it/cn4s53ab56pe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec80f7917d2dd1bf823f9278607e19fa105679e2)

MrBeast created MrBeast Burger. Instead of just featuring his favorite foods in videos, he launched a business where fans could actually order the meals themselves.

Doug DeMuro, an automotive YouTuber, started Cars & Bids, a car auction site. This business is a natural fit for his audience, who are passionate about unique cars. By creating a platform tailored to his viewers, Doug built a business that complements his YouTube content and provides real value to his audience.

These are just a few examples but they show how YouTubers can turn their personal brands into massive businesses that connect with their fans and grow their influence outside of YouTube.

YouTube offers several ways to make money, each with its benefits.

So, I thought it was weird to think I had seen events occur in dreams before they actually did, but having read a few comments on other posts, it seems like a lotta y’all have experienced the same thing. 

I’ve had some that were specific down to the most minute detail. I once had a dream where I was sitting in a white oval-shaped room on a bench that curved around one of the long bends. Brilliant sunlight streamed into the room through windows. Someone was speaking about their son, and there were lots of other people sitting on the bench. A year later, I’m on a boat in the Galapagos listening to a guy talk about his son’s small coffee farm, and there are maybe fifteen other people on this giant bench in the exact room I had pictured in my dream. Bright sunlight illuminated everything. In that moment, I remembered having an oddly specific dream that exactly matched the situation.  

This isn’t the only time this has happened, too. I’ve had them with less frequency these last few years, but I can vividly remember the moments that exactly mirrored a dream I had had, and thinking “what the heck is going on”.

1jd372e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadianstopsmoking/comments/1jd372e/struggling_with_awakening/,Struggling with Awakening,"For years, I've been struggling with my cigarette addiction. The smell of cigarettes on me, the persistent cough, and concerns about my health have been constantly bothering me. However, quitting smoking always seemed like an impossible task – until I tried nicotine pouches.  
Why Choose Nicotine Pouches  
Unlike e-cigarettes or nicotine patches, nicotine pouches allow me to maintain the habitual action of putting my hand to my mouth without having to inhale smoke. The mint-flavored nicotine pouches bring a strong cooling sensation, effectively diverting my craving for cigarettes. More importantly, I can control my nicotine intake on my own (gradually reducing it from 4mg to 1mg).  
The First Month: A Roller Coaster Experience  
The First Week: I always instinctively reached for my cigarette pack. I used 6 to 8 nicotine pouches every day and often felt a stinging sensation in my gums.  
The Third Week: My cigarette addiction was reduced by 50%. I began to enjoy having fresh breath and the restoration of my sense of taste!  
The Fourth Week: Social situations became tricky – it was a bit embarrassing to explain the nicotine pouches in my mouth to my friends.  
Success  
Key Strategies for Ritual Replacement – Keep the original ""smoking break"" time but use nicotine pouches instead of cigarettes.  
Flavor Exploration – Try coffee and citrus flavors to maintain a sense of novelty.  
Progress Tracking – Use a smoking cessation app to visualize health improvements (for example, ""Already saved $200!"").  
Six Months Later: A Smoke-Free New Life  
Now I occasionally use 1 to 2 nicotine-free herbal pouches. My lung capacity has significantly improved and my morning cough has completely disappeared. The best part is that when I hug my children, they no longer shy away.  
Advice for Beginners  
✔️ Please consult your doctor to determine the appropriate dosage.  
✔️ Combine with behavioral therapy when necessary.  
✔️ Celebrate every small victory (for example, ""One week without smoking!"").  
Quitting smoking doesn't need to be perfect, but perseverance is crucial. I relapsed twice, but each time I started over again, I became more determined. You can definitely do it too!

Okay let’s get into it. First off, start a spreadsheet (bc banking) that helps you track the people you talk with. This is mainly for reminding yourself to follow up every few months. Doesn’t have to be complicated, just the persons name, firm, title, some notes, and the date you last talked to them. 

The two methods I used were LinkedIn and email (shocker). I could write an entire post on each of these but, for brevity, I’ll stick to the important stuff. 

To initiate a conversation, always have an icebreaker. Some examples: you went to the same school, you just read an interesting article they were featured in, they’re your rich uncle, or maybe you just enjoyed one of their LinkedIn posts.

To set up a coffee chat (quick Zoom or phone call), shoot them an email or message that is only a couple of sentences and asks for 15-30min of their time. Do NOT be overly formal. 

Trust me, as someone who’s now on the receiving end of these messages, if someone is being formal it feels like they have an agenda or think it’s an interview. But I get it, I used to wear a suit and tie for these calls and now I realize how silly I must’ve looked.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jd2xzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jd2xzh/james_the_sipper_short_story/,James The Sipper (Short Story),"The concept of this story, was about an unidentified man around age 30, who was helping five women struggling financially to make amends meet in London's (Ontario not England) East End. 

In 1888, an infamous serial killer named ""Jack The Ripper"" was active in London England's East End, claiming the lives of at least five women, to whom we're all living in extreme poverty at the time. 

Then in 2024, 136 years later, a famous serial helper was active in London Ontario's East End, giving $10,000 each to five women. 

Jessica West, Jackie East, Jackie Central, Sarah South and Nathalie North, were all targeted to be given large amounts of money with just one exception. He wished his dick to be sucked, because it ""sure as shit wasn't going to suck itself!"". 

Upon receiving oral sexual stimulation from all five women, James The Sipper gave them $10,000 each, and sipped on red wine with them, then they'd sip on his cock. 

After The Sippers efforts, the women where then able to use the money, for the better benefit of their families and well-being, and we're all able to afford their expenses for many months to come. 

The five women combined their money to open their own coffee shop named ""Five Girls"", once the business made sufficient money, the women returned $50,000 to the sipper, who then invested it into Five Girls so they can expand the restaurant chain. 

A lot more then five girls went to Five Girls, more like 5 million girls. 

The sippers identity Police kept secret, as they didn't want to spoil his reputation as a prostitute investor.

1jd2x1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1jd2x1k/a_butch_lesbians_somewhat_disappointed_review_of/,A Butch Lesbian's Somewhat Disappointed Review of Juliette Has A Gun,"So, I got my hands on the current Juliette Has a Gun discovery set for a good price at Sephora a while back. I'm still new-ish to the world of fragrances, & JHaG gets talked about a lot, so I was excited to try them out! After some testing & wearing them out though, I was overall slightly underwhelmed. I'm also new to fragrance reviews, so I'm here for any constructive feedback! Anyways, here are my extended thoughts.

**Overall Thoughts**

Even though I view a lot of the scents to be below your typical designer quality, I grew to appreciate JHaG as a marketing triumph given it's popularity. In the discovery kit that I got, all of the fragrances were marketed as unisex except for Juliette, but I was disappointed how far the fragrances all lean towards feminine - JHaG fragrances have a total lack of ""manlier"" notes like leather, tobacco, rum, vetiver, oriental woods, etc. Also, I feel like the scents I tried were all fairly youthful & would be suitable for people in their early 20s looking for their first real fragrances. Given that I'm 27 years old, maybe I'm just outside the age demographic these were designed for.

I was less than impressed with most of the scents, but all of the fragrances had a consistent, decent performance! These fragrances do last more than a couple hours, & the drydowns were pleasant on average. The prevalence of Cetalox in many of these fragrances led to all of them having vaguely similar-smelling drydowns. I find the price point for a full bottle to be fairly high. The scents remind me of fragrances you'd find at Victoria's Secret, & I think a similar \~$80 price point for a 100ml bottle would be appropriate for JHaG.

**Not a Perfume & Not a Perfume Superdose**

I'm apparently one of those people whose skin chemistry just does not react loudly to the Cetalox, because Not a Perfume was basically imperceptible on my skin. Some people get amazing results from this one & will say that it's their favorite/most complimented fragrance, but on me it's a ghost, so unfortunately I can't rate it.

Superdose on the other hand, you can smell on me. It still projects close to the skin, & has a clean, powdery, musky scent. Reminds me of fresh clean linen, with a little bit of white musk, & the faintest note of rubbing alcohol. On my skin it's also slightly lemon-y. Minimalist pheromone scents vary wildly based on skin chemistry, so these could work amazing on you, but NAP & NAP Superdose are just not my favorite.

**Juliette**

Starting off with maybe my favorite from the set, Juliette is a pretty gorgeous scent. It's a cherry floral scent, but I found the cherry to be tart & bright, as opposed to being overly sweet or medicinal, & the cashmere does a great job of making this scent feel very intimate. Juliette performs & projects pretty well, absolutely no complaints there. There are plenty of reviews online that complain that the cherry falls off too quickly, & it does fade, but in my experience it hangs on enough to blend really nicely with the jasmine. Based on the branding you might be expecting Juliette to be sexy, a femme fatale, leather jacket, red lipstick stain on a cigarette filter outside the bar, but that's not quite what you get with this fragrance. This Juliette is a black dress, a candle-lit dinner date, a glass of sparkling red wine, holding hands on the walk back home. It's a wonderful, soft, versatile, wearable scent. For the price, I still feel like you could do better with a designer fragrance, but Juliette stands out from other fragrances by putting the cherry on its pedestal. So if you're in your early 20s & looking for a perfect everyday wear with a cherry centerpiece, I would pick this up. 

**Lust For Sun**

In my experience, JHaG is very good at making a scent that paints a specific picture, & Lust For Sun is no exception. This smells like sun tan lotion, warm skin, coconut, a cocktail by the pool, & a cloudless blue sky. The coconut, ylang-ylang, & white florals do a fantastic job of mimicing the rich, brassy smell of sun tan lotion. The gardenia & jasmine are the key floral players in this scent, & it has a distinctly tropical feel without any of the typical fruity, sweet tropical notes like pineapple. There's supposed to be bergamot in the opening, but I can't really smell it, & I do wish the vanilla was slightly more prominent. Either way, this scent is an absolutely great summer fragrance for fans of white florals. The only complaint I have is that I feel like this one performs pretty poorly on me compared to the others. I wouldn't call this fragrance adolescent like some of the others in this set, Lust For Sun seems like it could be appropriate as a beach scent for women through their 30s & above. Also, Lust for Sun does a poor job of being a unisex fragrance. It leans very strongly feminine. It's maybe not something I would wear, but I would LOVE to smell this on my girlfriend at the beach.

**Pear Inc.**

Pear Inc is one of the fragrances in this collection I **almost** really like. It's a fairly simple fragrance: the notes listed are a pear accord, Cetalox, & musk. The pear accord mixed with the musk produces a nice dissonance that adds depth to the scent, & the Cetalox's woody/fresh linen scent rounds the creation out pretty nicely. However, the pear accord was simply too sugary, maddeningly-sweet for my taste. Without any additional notes like florals or woody accords to blunt the overwhelming sweetness, I just get sick of it fairly quickly. Despite being marketed as unisex, I was disappointed by how hard Pear Inc leans towards feminine, & I feel that Pear Inc leans more adolescent than the average JHaG fragrance. This is another one that I probably wouldn't wear, but it is very nearly something I would like to smell on my girlfriend. This is another one that could work amazing on your skin, it just didn't quite click for me.

**Vanilla Vibes**

Based on the name, I was expecting a warm & cozy vanilla, but what you get with this fragrance is more salt than anything else. The vanilla takes a back seat, & is dry & understated, as opposed to warm & sweet. Vanilla Vibes is marketed as beachy summer scent, & to it's credit it does do a very good job of mimicking the smell of a slow walk on the beach. On me it smells like sand, warm sun-dried skin after a dip in the ocean, worn-off spray-on sunscreen, & driftwood. It reminded me of sun bathing by the ocean in LA. I wish the orchid played a larger role in this scent. I found the scent a little top-heavy, with the sea salt note dominating everything else at first, but the vanilla warms up eventually leading to a pleasant drydown. Still, Lust for Sun is just a better beach scent. Not my favorite.

**Ode To Dullness**

Ode To Dullness is another JHaG fragrance that does a fantastic job of painting a picture. If Lust For Sun is sun tan lotion at the pool, Ode To Dullness is a warm clean blanket, a book, a lit candle, & herbal tea on a cool fall evening. In the opening there's a strong chemical, fresh, clean scent that reminds me of the smell of dryer sheets or detergent, the chemical-y aspect of which falls off pretty quickly. Ode To Dullness is a very gentle scent but it projects surprisingly well. I like Ode to Dullness more than some of the other scents in this set, but I find it too literal. This is the perfect scent for staying in, bundling up in a warm sweater & lighting a candle... but then you're just living the exact experience this fragrance is designed to evoke anyways. & Ode To Dullness would be totally out of place if worn while going to a party, going out to the club, or going to a concert. Still, it could be absoltely perfect for smelling clean & cozy in the office, while shopping, while on a low-key date, or when grabbing coffee!

**Magnolia Bliss**

Magnolia Bliss is a decent, well-rounded fragrance! I have been curious about exploring more fragrances with plum notes so I really appreciate the mirabelle plum in this, & it comes through bright & sweet. Magnolia Bliss is citrusy, floral, sweet, bitter, soft, maybe slightly synthetic. Again, not very unisex, definitely very feminine. I think I was disappointed in this one because it feels like a very safe fragrance, it's pleasant but it isn't a fragrance that makes a crazy first impression. Don't hate it, wouldn't highly recommend it. The notes combine to create a kind of peachy sensation that I've seen people compare to **Jo Malone Nectarine & Honey Blossom.**

**Bottom Lines**

These fragrances for me range from mediocre to sorta good, but none of them blew me away. I am probably too old for these scents but they generally feel very appropriate for someone in their low 20s just beginning their fragrance journey. I was pretty fond of Juliette & Lust for Sun, & would enjoy both of those if my girlfriend was wearing them. I would hard pass on Ode to Dullness & Vanilla Vibes. I think these pretty much all desreve a lower price point, & you can probably do a lot better with the money you'd spend on a full bottle of most of these. Most of these are fairly feminine despite being marketed as unisex, & I really wish JHaG used more of the traditionally masculine notes.",5,1742180035.0,fragrance,6,0.63,False

1jd2unr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lelit/comments/1jd2unr/inconsistent_extraction_time_need_help_lelit/,Inconsistent Extraction Time - Need Help! [Lelit Elizabeth v3],"Hey everyone,

I'm having an issue with my new Lelit Elizabeth and I was hoping to get some advice from the community. My previous machine was a DeLonghi Dedica, and I used to get very consistent extraction times within 30 seconds (± 2s) for a 1:2 ratio using 15g of coffee. However, with the Lelit Elizabeth, I'm experiencing significant inconsistencies despite following the exact same preparation process.

https://preview.redd.it/bkmz8t9vv5pe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe8ddd16e380592580868023b6f5f0d51d75cbb

**The Issue:**  
With 17g of coffee, aiming to extract 34g, my extraction times vary wildly. Sometimes I get 34g in 25 seconds, other times it takes 45s, and occasionally over 60s. In some cases, the coffee starts flowing after 20 seconds and comes out very slowly. A couple of times, no coffee even flowed at all.

**Quality Variations:**  
Crema inconsistencies (sometimes none at all, sometimes great)  
Taste fluctuates between great, good, bad, and horrible  
Different flow rates despite using the same grind settings and preparation process

**My Extraction Settings:**  
Extraction temperature: 93°C  
Boiler temperature: 132°C  
Preinfusion: 5s  
Pressure: 9 bars  
Water: Bottled water (ideal mineralization)

*I also tested with:*  
Preinfusion at 10s and 2s  
Pressure at 10 bars  
None of these changes helped.

**Additional Observation:**  
After powering on the machine for the first time and seeing the ""OK"" signal on the display, I noticed that if I do a water purge through the group head, there is a lot of steam along with a strange steam noise. After a couple of purges by tapping the extract buttons 1 and 2, the steam stops.

**My Preparation Process:**

1. Weigh 17g of coffee beans
2. Spray water on the beans twice
3. Grind the beans into a shaker and weigh again to confirm exactly 17g
4. Shake for 20 seconds
5. Transfer grounds into the portafilter
6. Gentle bumps to settle the coffee
7. WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique)
8. Tamp (Im used to do this process very consistently, I've been doing this for 4 years now)
9. Extract

I've done over 20 tests with the same grind setting and coffee, yet the results are all over the place. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this inconsistency? Any suggestions on what to check or tweak?

Inside 1.8k, outside 1k, behind 6th block and everywhere. We used to have a tiffin center too. Or atleast we used to have a street full of shops.

Now only Amul is opened, and Madras Coffee. Madras coffee is damn costly (my opinion) as just 2 puffs can cost 50 and just 10 fries in a plate costs 70.

Prices are for another rant session, but there is no shops opened to talk about the prices too. 

I heard someone saying that the shops didn't renew some tender validity and that's why they are not opened. How many people would like to put a Shop inside our college? College can give a chance to them ryt? What are they doing? 

Most importantly, the photocopy/stationary shop. It's one of the essential part, yet management decided to not to keep it in the food Street. 

Do not jump at me saying we have a photocopy machine in professor quoters store, it's not even good and they don't have colour and everytime I try to do my work there it's always damn crowded. Atleast in fs they have 4 pcs, still I used to wait in the crowd, here they have only 1. That's fking impossible. The outsiders took an advantage of this and costing 20-30 rupees per page.

Everything is changed after the new director was appointed. It's not only to blame him though, as he has his reasons to remove Yumpies and Tiffin center.

We all agree the reasons of removal of the shops, but can't the college replace it?

The only shop which is healthy inside the college is Thirumala juice center. And now it's not there. 🤷

There is a useless Dominos, inside the college that too very long distance from my hostel. Eating in dominos is a celebration for me, and many students are like me. We don't do that in a weekly basis. 

I wish director should take an action, atleast an immediate action on the stationary shop, as it's the biggest headache we, students face.

I had my first thunderclap headache in November 2024 during intercourse. It lasted 2-4 hours before subsiding and then I thought I was fine. Prior to November, I was drinking alcohol and caffeine more than normal, used THC for a month, and had a large stress increase from a new job. Several days later I got so nauseous and sick that I was throwing up non-stop for several days. After that, pretty much any time I did any exercise or had a high heart rate I had a thunderclap headache. I was seen by my General physician and was told to immediately go to the ER where they admitted me. They ran CT/MRI with and without contrast, and scans were normal. They additionally did an angiogram. They found a slight narrowing in my basilar artery but aside from that, things appeared to look healthy and normal.  One neurologist thought the narrowing was concerning, but the rest of the teams were not too concerned. The term RCVS was thrown out at this point, but no definitive evidence was shown to say I had RCVS. To be certain I didn’t have any bleeding, they performed a lumbar puncture. No blood in my spinal fluid was found. I was discharged from the hospital with a low dose of aspirin. 2 days later, I was re-admitted to the hospital with a spinal fluid leakage. Upon entering the hospital, I had the worst thunderclap headache of my life. I was throwing up, and in and out of consciousness. The hospital couldn’t perform the lumbar puncture patch until nearly 3 days later. After the patch, I felt better and was sent home. After about a week of bed rest, I started moving around more and found the headache from the lumbar puncture was gone, but if my heart rate increased too high, I could feel a thunderclap headache coming. This went on for 1.5 weeks and in early December I went back to my GP. He prescribed me amitriptyline. This prescription made my headaches much worse, and I had several small thunderclap headaches, so I stopped taking it. At this point I had been alcohol/thc free since early November and very low caffeine (1-2 small cups of coffee in the morning). I was doing a lot of research and was certain what I had was RCVS. I asked my doctor to put me on Verapamil 120mg and started taking that. My thunderclap headaches were almost immediately eliminated. I was able to get a higher heart rate and started lite movement again. Unfortunately, I had heavy side effects with the Verapamil including extreme fatigue, fogginess and lightheadedness. It was almost impossible to work while on it, so I started taking it at night before bed. I was still extremely tired, but other side effects were not as bad, never good though. After 2 weeks of taking 120mg verapamil daily, I started tapering off. My GP advised to stay on verapamil, but the side effects made it nearly impossible to work. This entire time I was still having headaches and extreme soreness in my neck – separate from the verapamil side effects. For a month around Christmas, I was not taking Verapamil. I had no thunderclap headaches, but every day I would wake up feeling fine, then within several hours of being upright or on my feet I would develop lightheadedness, fogginess, extreme neck soreness, vision sensitivity and extreme cognitive decline. Work and communication have been very challenging. I have a very hard time remembering things, and staring at a computer screen does not help. I found taking breaks and laying down will relieve symptoms, but as soon as I’m vertical, symptoms return. I restarted taking verapamil every 2-3 days at night which seemed to help with the regular symptoms and minimize the verapamil side effects (right or wrong, that’s all I could manage). I was referred to U of M neurology and have an appointment at their next opening in August of 2025… I was able to be seen at a local neurologist in February. The doctor reviewed my previous imaging file and concluded I didn’t have RCVS, my basilar narrowing was normal, and all of headaches were a side effect of anxiety. No tests or imaging were performed and my consultation lasted all of 20 minutes. She questioned why I was taking verapamil and thought I should get off it. I was referred to a psychiatrist. I do have anxiety and depression, but in all honesty, most of my anxiousness is related to the side effects I’m battling every day and not knowing if I’ll be able to find the words in a meeting or remember to do a task. I was prescribed Zo-loft but have not started taking it. I went on a fishing trip in early March (not on verapamil) and drank alcohol and heavy caffeine for 5 days straight. The day after the trip I could barely form a thought and almost went to the ER. I have done trips like this many times and never felt anything like it. I couldn’t remember where my house was or where I had just gone fishing. I took verapamil and within an hour I felt better, however so far from feeling normal.
At this point I’m quite convinced what I’m dealing with is RCVS or something related to vasoconstriction. My symptoms are rapidly getting worse. I feel so out of it most days and I worry something severely damaging is occurring. My reaction time is decreasing, my memory is decreasing, my vocab and speech is declining and towards the end of the workday I can barely form thoughts. I have zero energy most days and am exhausted. I can feel tightness in my neck like vessels closing with a weird head pressure. From there all the symptoms follow.
Additional observations/considerations. 
•	Alcohol and caffeine make it worse
•	Being vertical makes it worse
•	Stress and an increased heart rate make it worse
•	Heat seems to help it, where cold or icing my neck makes it worse
•	Exercise helps temporarily, but later in the day it seems to make it harder
•	Verapamil helps, but I have a hard time telling between side effects and normal symptoms
•	Could this be seizures?
•	Could this be related to the lumbar puncture?
•	Could this be early alzheimers?

I’m going off caffeine and will be completely alcohol free until I get a diagnosis or symptoms are gone. I am willing to try Zoloft, but am worried an anti-depressant will make my headaches worse. I have asked for a 2nd opinion with Noran, but still several months. I have no idea what to do and am looking for any help/advice even if it’s as simple as things to avoid or ways of reducing symptoms. I’m truly desperate.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks BPPV. So I get BPPV attacks from my menieres ear - when the ear fills up it knocks the crystals out of place according to my doctor. 

Every episode I have had has been asleep/waking up  all but one and I think I like bent over to get something that one time. 

I had vertigo Tuesday and now I’m back to basic regular life. Lower salt- no coffee and tons of walking to get my system going.  

Just kinda venting. No one else gets it so sorry to fill this space but it is appreciated. I guess my next step is to learn the head movements I can do at home. I had the eply done on Wednesday and with a round of steroids to knock the fullness I have been feeling really good. 


But I’m just scared of the what if…. What if this is regular idk. How many times can I do the eply? So far I’m at 3 this past year I believe. It really does help me personally though. 

Maybe I need a steroid shot. I’m going to think on this.

A certain man found himself lost. At his age, he was supposed to have found himself, but he never quite could.
There was no objective reason for him to be lost—he had followed the path perfectly. He had accumulated multiple college degrees, a respectable occupation where the work was not unbearable, and numerous significant relationships. People said of the man that he was always so happy. His coworkers looked forward to his smile in the morning, always paired with words of encouragement. The man did not complain and completed his work efficiently, pivoting as necessary. When the workday was over, he would often go to some sort of social function, or perhaps he would have a quiet night in with his partner. Oh yes, he had also acquired a partner.
Yet with all of these things in place, the man still had absolutely no idea where he was. Not speaking metaphorically, he was genuinely confused about nearly every facet of his life. Surely he had gone to college, as he had the magic piece of paper on the wall saying he did. Surely he had a job and friends, because where else would he go when he left the house? The job had to pay relatively well, as he was able to go out routinely and afford the house he lived in, as well as providing for the needs of his partner. And surely he had a partner—the entire situation would make no sense otherwise.
However, if you asked him to provide any detail about anything, he simply could not tell you.
Not a single professor's name. Not one specific conversation with a friend. Not a memory of applying for his job, or even being interviewed for it. He had no recollection of what, precisely, he did each day. He understood the functions of his work well enough to complete them, but how had he learned them? When?
He had built a life, yet it had the consistency of a dream—real only as long as he didn't question it.
One night, while his partner slept, the man walked into the study of his home, intent on finding some trace of his own past. Something tangible.
His bookshelves were lined with the expected: old textbooks, novels he had no memory of reading but assumed he must have enjoyed, and decorative coffee table books that were rarely touched. But one book stood out.
It was large, bound in leather, with no title on its spine. It looked ancient, though the air smelled neither of dust nor age.
With great hesitation, he pulled it from the shelf and set it on the desk. As soon as his fingers grazed the cover, golden lettering appeared across the front.
THE BOOK OF EXCUSES.
A chill ran through him.
He opened it.
The pages were filled with words he did not recognize but knew to be his own.
""I just don't have time to write that novel.""
""I'll reach out to him later—he's probably busy.""
""I need to wait until I have more experience before I apply.""
""It's not the right moment to make a change.""
""I'll be happy once things calm down.""
He flipped through, faster now, heart pounding.
The entries stretched on, pages and pages of justifications, apologies, hesitations. He saw excuses for why he never learned to play the piano, why he never took that trip overseas, why he stayed in a job that neither fulfilled nor tormented him.
Each excuse was dated, he realized with growing horror. Some went back decades. There was an entire chapter devoted to his twenties, when possibilities had seemed endless. One by one, he had closed those doors with gentle, reasonable words that accumulated like sediment, eventually hardening into the bedrock of his unremarkable life.
He found excuses he'd made just yesterday.
""I'm too tired to have that conversation right now.""
""Better not to rock the boat.""
""That's just how things are.""
The excuses for his thirties grew more sophisticated, more convincing. He had become an architect of his own confinement, building walls so gradually he never noticed the prison taking shape around him.
His fingers trembled as he turned to a section titled ""Dreams Deferred."" There he found a comprehensive catalog of everything he had ever wanted to do but hadn't. Besides, each dream was a perfectly rational explanation for its abandonment.
The justifications were so reasonable. So sensible. Who could fault him for any single one?
Yet their cumulative weight threatened to crush him where he sat.
A memory surfaced—his only clear memory—of being seven years old, declaring to his parents that he would someday sail around the world. The earnestness of that child, the certainty in his voice, made the man's chest tighten. What would that boy think of him now?
Then, towards the end of the book, he found a page that had yet to be written.
The ink began to form as he watched.
""I can't change anything now. It's too late.""
His breath caught in his throat.
The room suddenly felt smaller, like the walls had drawn in. The book was warm in his hands, almost alive.
For the first time in his life—if this was truly his life—he felt something sharp and undeniable: choice.
He could close the book, set it back on the shelf, and let it collect dust like all the others. Or—
He could pick up a pen.
The empty page before him awaited his response.
The void of the blank page terrified him more than anything he had ever encountered. It demanded authenticity he wasn't sure he possessed anymore. It asked for courage he couldn't remember having.
Who was he, stripped of his excuses? What skeleton remained when the comfortable flesh of justification was peeled away?
He stared at the book, paralyzed. The thought of writing something true made his stomach clench. The thought of closing the book made him dizzy with self-loathing.
The clock on the wall ticked. From the bedroom, he heard his partner turn over in sleep. The ordinary sounds of his ordinary life continued, indifferent to his crisis.
If he wrote something—anything authentic—would the scaffolding of his existence come tumbling down? Would his partner wake to find a stranger beside her in the morning? Would his colleagues pass him in the hallway without recognition?
Or worse, would nothing change at all?
The paralysis of possibility gripped him. Every path seemed equally terrifying—to continue as he was, knowing what he knew; to tear everything down and start anew; to make one small, true choice and see where it led.
With shaking hands, he picked up a pen from the desk. The weight of it was unfamiliar, as though he had never held one before. Perhaps he hadn't—not really. Perhaps he had only been going through the motions all these years.
The nib touched the page.
He hesitated.
Then, in a rush of devastating relief, he wrote:
""I don't have time to figure this out right now.""
The words glistened on the page for a moment before sinking into the paper, joining all the others. The golden lettering on the front cover seemed to pulse once, then dim.
Carefully, he closed the book. He returned it to its place on the shelf, where it blended seamlessly with the other volumes, indistinguishable once more.
The man turned off the study light and walked back to the bedroom. His partner hadn't stirred. Everything was as it should be.
As he climbed back into bed, he felt the familiar comfort of routine envelop him. He would wake tomorrow, smile at his colleagues, complete his work efficiently. He would continue.
Just before sleep took him, he thought he heard the faint sound of paper rustling from the study, as if a page were turning. But it was probably just the wind.

Back in August 2024 I met a friend, lets call her Ashley, in optometry school( I ended up failing out after one semester). Ashley was like a big sister to me, and as someone who is an only child it was the first time in my life where it felt like I had a sister and that someone besides my parents actually cared about me lol. She knew that I was struggling in optometry school and would hire tutors for me so that I could pass my courses, she would give me some of her lunch almost daily even when i said she didn't have to do that, make coffee for me, scold me when i was being lazy lol, offer me encouragement/words of wisdom all the time. She was so sweet and honestly such a rare friend to find. After I failed out of optometry school she told me to not give up and would call me daily during her winter break and encourage me to apply to other graduate programs. I ended up staying in that town after the sem ended (where I went to optometry school )since my apartment lease didn't end till February. This semester, I went to the library almost everyday with her for 7 weeks lol. Even though she was busy with school, she would call me everyday and drag me to the school's library so that I could apply to graduate programs and apply for jobs in the meantime. She even wrote me a letter of recommendation for grad school, and I eventually ended up getting accepted to a program.

Its been a little over two weeks but  I moved back to my hometown since my lease ended in February, and during the first week back home Ashley would call me but I noticed its been a week and she hasn't called nor texted me. For some reason, I hate texting and calling people first because I always feel like I'm bothering them and don't want to come off as clingy however I miss her way too much to the point where my heart hurts and I ended up FaceTiming her today to check in on her. She just seemed really tired and normally she would yap my ear off and tell me make sure you ""do this, do that"". She only talked to me for like 5 minutes and said she had to go. She has a lot of exams coming up so I'm assuming thats why she's been a little distant which is understandable but I can't help but worry that she'll get closer to other optometry classmates and eventually forget about me. This is so toxic but I noticed that when she calls/texts my mood goes up and I feel so happy but when she doesn't I feel sad and its so unhealthy. When she gives me words of encouragement, I feel more compelled to get work done ugh I'm trying to not depend on others though cause I understand people always come and go in life but I was really hoping she was a lifelong friend especially since I genuinely loved her and she was like a big sister to me. God I miss her so much I could cry just thinking about her and its crazy because I have literally only known her for 7 months now but we did get really close in a short amount of time. I just had to get this off my chest because its been killing me.",2,1742178928.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

My pregnancy was not planned at all. I had graduated college and a couple of months later I moved out with my partner. It hadn’t even been two weeks before I found out I was pregnant after moving out. I went cold turkey on everything cause I knew it was best for the baby. I was a heavy weed smoker, vapor, and alcohol drinker (mostly wine). I also was extremely self conscious about my weight. (I ate very minimally to keep myself from gaining weight). I put all of this aside when I became pregnant. However, I’m almost two months post partum and I can’t take this anymore. I finally had the courage to weigh myself about 10 days into my post partum and I had gained 28 lbs from my pre pregnancy weight. I spent the rest of the few weeks trying to lose that weight, and a couple of weeks later I was about 16 lbs down and barely producing breast milk. So, I had to start eating normally again to produce milk. I now have not changed weight since then but I miss my old life so much. Yes, I have drank a couple of glasses of wine as I heard that ok to do and even order breast milk testers. But I can’t actually enjoy myself drinking cause I constantly am paranoid about how much I’m drinking and making sure it’s fine. I honestly want to just smoke a cigarette or smoke a joint sometimes but I know I can’t do that because of the baby. I can’t even go crazy on coffee or eat less, this is consuming my life. I’m depressed everyday  and I understand I won’t have a normal life anymore, but I feel like I have a completely different life that is dragging me everyday. I literally can’t even work. I’m home all day with a baby, I can’t do anything I used to do and now this is my norm? My mental is falling apart and I’m doing everything I can to maintain my mental health, but it’s honestly barely holding together. I don’t want to move to formula but I feel like it’s the only thing that will keep me sane. Any advice?  ",4,1742178858.0,postpartumprogress,5,0.84,False

I live in an apartment and we do have a shared outside space, but it’s very small and pretty awkward to just sit there. It’s right by everyone’s cars so they’ll pull up and I’m just there on a chair. What should I do? 

I’ve done things like walked to local coffee and ice cream shops, but I don’t want to keep buying things just to step outside. I also don’t really want to walk around my area too much because I don’t want someone to watch me and track down where I live.

I'm in a long-term nested relationship and recently started dating someone new over the past few mos. When it's good, it's \*really\* quite good. Great sex. Good chemistry. Interesting conversation. 

I've noticed this person tends to run really hot and cold. There's been a pattern that's created a lot of anxiety and dysregulation for me where they go from \*extremely\* effusive, fast constant texting, flirtatious, and available to.... like nothing. Emotionally unavailable. Virtually unresponsive to my flirtation... But weirdly like... keeping up texting a few times a day with updates. Pictures of stuff they're doing. Very matter of fact. 

Early on in the relationship it \*freaked\* me out because they were very ""I'm not sure I've noticed a difference. I'm just kind of busy right now."" and ""I don't know that I can give you the reassurance you're looking for right now""  When at the time I was really looking for just... ""hey can you tell me we agree that the sky is blue right now?"". Later on we'd talk about it and they'd admit they had some major underlying thing that was pulling their attention and stressing them out. 

We've been through enough cycles that I'm able to self soothe without freaking out and needing to talk through it, but it's a pretty clear pattern for them and my instinct is to pull back and make some space for myself when it happens. I can tell it has less to do with me and more to do with them just... getting really overwhelmed with life stuff, emotional stuff they're processing that they're not ready to talk about, etc.  
  
Here's where it gets tricky. When I withdraw and mirror that behavior, I get pushback for not wanting to make small talk. Is this... unreasonable of me? 

Similarly, another thing I've noticed is this person hasn't historically done sleepovers. I can't host so we always do sleepovers at their place. They really like having me sleep over, and I'm a big sleepover person. I've felt insecure enough in the relationship that I've had trouble sleeping in their bed at times because I feel.... Unwelcome sometimes. Like they don't really care if I'm there or not. 

When we wake up in the morning after a sleepover, they get up and give about 10x more attention to their dog (Good morning! Who's a good boy!) than they do me, and kind of set about their morning somewhat distant. One of the first times I slept over, they snapped at me the following morning because they were in their phone and watching tiktok, and when I commented on a video they were watching, they were creeped out that I was looking at their screen. My spouse and I sit in bed and watch stuff all the time, and I honestly just didn't know \*what\* I was supposed to be doing, and assumed we were just hanging out. It's weird because when we're together they're really good about not having any screentime otherwise. 

What's more, they've told me explicitly that I should feel welcome to hang out in their space during/morning after a sleepover, not as a guest, but just making myself at home. Go downstairs and make coffee if they're busy. Go get breakfast down the street. Go back to bed. When I wake up and feel like I don't have their attention, I'm inclined to get dressed and leave quick, and they always act disappointed that I'm not sticking around, even though they're just... highly inattentive. But they clearly \*want\* me there when we talk about it. 

There's another element to this- We've only been dating for like 5 mos and I almost never watch movies/TV on dates with new partners or friends. I watch very little TV and movies in general lately, and I don't think my spouse and I watched TV together \*at all\* for the first 6 mos, and so far we've had like 4 or 5 dates where this new partner decides we're gonna watch something... I go along with it and they always pick the movie. When I hint at wanting to watch something, they kind of ignore/miss the cue, and pick some major studio film that I would never pick and only marginally enjoy. What's more is it feels like they're not being super intentional, but just grabbing whatever... 

I think above all it feels disappointing that they want to spend time together in such a passive way so early on. Like.. not really paying attention to each other, but just spacing out. I get it if they're tired or whatever. 

To be fair, I haven't raised this issue at all. I have said things like ""I'm really excited about this movie and want you to watch it"" or ""I don't really spend a lot of time watching movies"", and it feels a little extra to have to raise the issue of ""I don't want to go on dates where we watch so many TV/movies together, and if we do I'd like there to be a bit more even mix of taking turns picking"" 

The other night, we had a pretty big fight... They took me out on a date which was nice, and after we got back from the date hooked up and they said they hadn't seen their roomates in a few days and wanted to hang out I assented to going down and watching a movie. They'd already picked the movie and I just went with it. Afterward, they were flipping through their library talking about dif movies. The roommate noticed one movie and was like ""We should watch that!"" and was met with ""I want to keep flipping through for a bit for now""... I felt kinda bad that the roommate was ignored, as they left the room and the person I'm dating put on some action flick they got excited about shortly after. I very much did not care about the movie. 

I was tired and said I was getting really sleepy and didn't get a response at all. Because this person had said to act like I lived there, I just grabbed my stuff and went upstairs.I was just going up to the bathroom at first, but didn't feel like going back down and crawled into bed. I have a bit of a tendency to freeze and fawn, and I think I just felt really uncomfortable about the whole situation. They had tried to text to see where I was, and my phone was on silent. They came up about 20 minutes later and were \*livid\* to find me in bed. The said I was rude to them and their roommate. That they didn't know where I was and accused me of leaving in that way specifically to start a fight. It didn't really resolve well. I actually started to get dressed to go home and they threatened to rescind my invitation to stay over if I left. We were able to kind of button it up that night, but... Ugh I just got really upset and tense and raised my voice in a way that I haven't in a while. 

I didn't think going to bed without saying anything was a huge deal, and I didn't feel comfortable raising the issue a second time in front of their roommate, especially after they'd made a big deal about me feeling welcome to not act like a guest. 

  
I thing what I'm coming to grips with is... this all just kind of makes me feel shitty. And I realize I can just avoid situations that make me feel shitty rather than say yes to everything. 

Am I unreasonable for wanting time spent together to be more... attentive and thoughtful so early in dating? I've been accused of being inflexible or all or nothing, but also... I have the benefit of a partnership of almost 2 decades and I've \*never\* had issues like this. 

I'm also a pretty rampant people pleaser and set a pretty high bar for myself when dating... I tend to make home cooked meals, plan very bespoke evenings, handmake gifts for my partners. Part of me feels like I'm just overdoing it and need to dial back the effort here? 

I don't know... does this feel red flaggy to you? 

I have people in my life who are... protective toward me about this kind of stuff because I tend to default toward thinking I should just... get over it or be less sensitive or that it's somehow my fault... I think I'm starting to feel resentful... Part of it feels like I need to get better at saying no, but the nuance is also that sometimes I'm trying stuff out to figure out how it feels, and then later I have a bit more conviction about it once I've processed.

1jd28l6,https://i.redd.it/pp2pi7o9t5pe1.jpeg,7Brew vs. Black Rock Coffee Bar,Hi everyone! Last year I was living in Colorado and took a trip out to Arizona where I got to try black rock coffee bar! I fell in love with their Orange Dream Fuel and when I returned to Colorado I made the 2 hour drive to my nearest BR to enjoy my beloved Orange Dream Fuel! I’ve since moved back to my home state of Ohio and learned about 7Brew! I’m curious to know if 7B has an energy comparable to my favorite Orange Dream Fuel! TIA 😊,1,1742177871.0,7Brew,4,1.0,False

I haven’t seen any posts on this topic. I’m in the TWW and here are some things I’ve noticed I did differently going in to IVF:
1. Savoring coffee and tea because I know morning sickness might rob me of this pleasure.
2. Doing physical tasks now eg. Cleaning baseboards, sorting clothes for donations.
3. Avoiding accepting onerous tasks in the near future eg. Not volunteering for that project at work.
4. Just got a dental check up.
5. Ordered a bunch of fruit boxes, chocolate milks, jerkies, fruit leathers, comfort foods for if the morning sickness hits.
6. Made sure my vaccinations are all up to date.
7. Being very involved with my family so they don’t feel too neglected if I’m exhausted/vomiting.

But lately, it’s been harder to shake the weight of it all. Depression has a way of creeping in, making things feel heavy, even when there’s no specific reason. I know I’m not alone in that. Last night while driving at 1 am, I think I lost the last positive connection I had with someone I could talk freely, someone that understood how i am in reality in all of the turmoil I'm living, and that left me again alone in the dark.

My job is to prepare for things to go wrong, which is fitting because my brain kind of does the same thing, ""Always flirting with chaos and Issues"". I’ve got a nerdy, slightly goth side, a love for deep conversations, and a dark sense of humor, but most of it, a need for a connection that might keep me going. On the surface, I stay optimistic, but deep down, I wrestle with that quiet nihilism that makes it hard to see the point sometimes.

I guess I’m just looking for a friend to talk to on a daily basis—someone who can talk about life, share random thoughts, and maybe help each other find a little more light in the mess. No pressure, no weirdness, no NSFW, just good conversations and a reminder that the world isn’t as isolating as it feels.

A little about me:

🔹 Tech geek by day, engineering specialist (both digital and personal) by night.

🔹 Sometimes sarcastic, witty, and a firm believer that memes are a love language.

🔹Cooking and making coffee is the way to know the other one.

🔹 Music taste? Industrial, metal, reggeton, and whatever fits the mood.

🔹 Into gaming, horror movies, and fixing things most people would just replace.

🔹 A fan of waking someone up with a deep phrase or a simple good morning sunshine

🔹 Big fan of deep, weird, and unfiltered conversations—sometimes geeky but mostly emotionally charged with poetry maybe.

What I’m looking for:

👉 Someone close to my age (29-45) who enjoys excellent conversations.

👉 Nerdy, goth, alternative, or just someone with their own unique spark.

👉 Bonus points if you like gaming, cooking, tech, horror, or just being delightfully weird.

If any of this resonates, send me a message; let's dive into a crappy chat for some time, since ghosting seems to be the way of reddit.

If you’re out there, let’s talk. Maybe we can make things suck a little less together.",1,1742177759.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1jd26rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1jd26rx/meraviglia_drinks_coffee_qs/,Meraviglia - Drinks / Coffee Qs,"So, I’ve only been on one other cruise - on the NCL Gem - but today, I had more than one cocktail served in a plastic glass on the Meraviglia - tho not all of them. Is this normal? 

I don’t mind like a whiskey and coke like that, but a margarita in the Sky Lounge …that was unexpected.

The bars are even busier than the ones on the Gem were but are there any that are better than others? Will they make flavored margaritas? The cocktail menus are pretty limited from the ones we’ve been to so far. The Gem had several signature cocktails and some bars had their own even.

Also, I am kind of floored there isn’t a specialty coffee place that’s included with the premium drinks package. Are bars really the only place to get specialty coffee drinks or am I missing something? 

Thanks in advance!! ",1,1742177710.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

1jd26e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1jd26e9/im_over_it_cash_app_keeps_blocking_accounts/,"I'm Over It, Cash app keeps blocking accounts?","Hey everyone, this is slight rant/question for the internet. Has anyone else been flagged, blocked, or had their accounts locked recently on CashApp for no real reason?
My personal examples: My best friend's account got literally flagged and barred from certain features all of the sudden last week. When she tried to find out what happened they just kept saying she needed more verification? She has had the account for quite some time and everything was current. They then a couple days later told her her account was flagged for peer to peer transactions seeming suspicious.... THE APP WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED FOR PEER TO PEER TRANSACTIONS like paying people for coffee or simple services or groceries?! 
Why is that suddenly a ""Suspicious Activity""!?
Cue today, my account Also got flagged? I was trying to send my fiance $35 in grocery money and the app told me it had an error from my bank? I tried a second time and cancelled again but this time I get the error page. But told him it ""Cancelled this transaction from (me) for your protection"" 
What the hell is that for? So I try to contact support and of course it's AI (garbage) bot tells me it sometimes flags transactions for suspicious activity. So I'm like is my account in trouble? The AI bit of course doesn't understand 😒
So I ask for a human, but of course their offices closed in the next five minutes so it told me I would have to wait until tomorrow. 

I used ZELLE instead with ZERO issue. This isn't the first random weird time CashApp has pulled some weirdo moves but has anyone else received problems like this? 

*TLDR; CashApp has been flagging accounts and giving me and others I know issues by blocking payments. Is anyone experiencing these weird problems? 

Thank you! ",3,1742177675.0,CashApp,1,1.0,False
