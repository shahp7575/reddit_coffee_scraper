1q7x404,https://v.redd.it/sc34s2php8cg1,"Finally dialed in my morning routine, Feels like a cheat code for focus","**My Information:**

* Age/Sex: early 30s
* Body Stats: Nice and fit
* Lifestyle: Startup founder
* Out of Range Biomarkers: Always better to have more brain juice

**Goals:**

* Be more foucs and better sleep

**Supplements:**

* Caffine, Creatine, Alpha-GPC (sometime)

**Questions:**

* Shower, Hot -> cold, or cold only?

Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to integrate Huberman’s protocols for a while, but like many of you, I struggled to fit the perfect morning into a real job schedule. I usually got stuck on the logistics (e.g., when to shower vs. when to get light vs. when to drink coffee). And want to understand why on my own pace and terms.

My specific situation (short commute 800m home to work door to door, winter mornings, dont have a pool for cold plunges but can do showers).

Here is the **""Optimized Commuter Routine""** I landed on. I’ve been doing this for a few weeks and the energy difference is night and day.

# The Routine

**1. Hydration (0–5 mins)**

* **Action:** 500ml water + pinch of sea salt immediately upon waking.
* **The Why:** Rehydrates the brain and supports adrenal function before any stress hits.

**2. The Contrast Shower (5–15 mins)**

* **Action:** I start with hot water (to wake up/wash) and finish with strictly **30–60 seconds of cold**.
* **The Why:** I learned that you don't need a full ice bath to get the norepinephrine spike. The *transition* from hot to cold forces vasoconstriction, flushing blood to the core and brain. It wakes me up instantly without the dread of jumping into a freezing tub.

**3. The ""Optic Flow"" Commute (30–45 mins)**

* **Action:** My office is only 900m away, so I walk it.
* **The Why:** This was the biggest unlock. A 10-12 minute walk combines **Sunlight** (for the circadian clock) with **Optic Flow** (self-generated motion).
* Even if it's cloudy, the lux is higher outdoors. The ""optic flow"" of moving through space actually quiets the amygdala (anxiety center), so I arrive at work alert but calm, not jittery.

**4. The Coffee Gap (45+ mins)**

* **Action:** I don't touch caffeine until I actually sit down at my desk (approx 90 mins after waking).
* **The Why:** Waiting allows adenosine to clear naturally so I don't crash at 2 PM.

**5. Creatine 5-10g, Alpha-GPC (sometime)**



# My Takeaways

The biggest game changer was realizing I didn't need to add *new* time for ""biohacking."" I just stacked the light exposure with my commute and used the shower I was already taking to trigger the catecholamines (focus chemicals).

If you have a short commute, I highly recommend walking it. That 15 minutes of ""forward motion"" does more for my mood than meditation ever did.

Source / How I planned this: I built this specific schedule, It helped me dive deep into specific questions (like ""Is a 900m walk enough for optic flow?"") without losing track of the main routine.

Today marks 7 days completed out of 21 days—so I’m celebrating! 🎉

The shakes get old pretty quickly, even if you have different flavours. Sugar-free, zero-calorie syrups like Matteo’s or Skinny Syrups are honestly life-changing. My favourites are Cookies & Cream and Marshmallow. They really help with sweet cravings.

I know caffeine can be hard on some people, but because of my religious beliefs, I don’t drink it. During my nutrition class, though, I was told that coffee is allowed, and you can even mix it with your shakes if caffeine isn’t an issue for you.

You will crave salt and normal flavours, especially during the first few days. Those days are mostly a mental challenge. Removing temptations is really important—seeing or smelling food will trigger cravings and make you feel hungrier. An air purifier can actually help a lot with food smells.

Sugar-free Jello will be your lifeline, and gum helps too. Trust me, you’ll want to eat a lot of both—but be careful, because too much can lead to diarrhoea. The first couple of days are definitely the hardest.",1,1767928529.0,BariatricSurgery,0,1.0,False

	May not be Maverick, but I can pull an ace & bring a smile to your face in any   place & let’s see ‘em all! I’ll have to see through your eyes, but it’ll be a ball, I’m all in, too late to call… unless you wanna chat, religion, travel, food, culture, crafts, love, plans for life… or how you named your cat. Just exploring the world, maybe I’ll find you the end a twisted cord, loom,lyre, or roaming the shire & we share mauled mead by the fire, but to enter the meadow, one must push past the mire🏰

Not lightening in a jar, but ‘til now, the edge of where you are, like smoke in your hands, yet you know where I stand. Not just for looks, I, wild for books & intimate nooks. Music of strings, symphonies or stage, maybe  trip soundtrack as we turn the page. I’ll be found living my half of our whole cross the mountains & plains, Mayhaps we meet in a field in the fall, or on a bus, plane or a train… so why not ask me for coffee or tea, for asking is free, but will it cost you later not asking me?

These are bios I wrote for a dating profile that limits the user to five hundred characters. Now coming up with these bios, I found it to be enjoyable solving the puzzle of scribing who I am and whom it is I am looking for in so few characters… but

After having both of these among a few others in rotation I had a realization; I think.

Our problem I think is how we truly feel flirtatious and pursued is when it’s a bottle of the whit and mind if you will. Think of it like a Sherlock and Moriarty type song and dance. Not that we are enemies or rivals, but probing out potential partners for the dance.

It’s hard enough finding one whom enjoys the dance but it’s made even harder by people whom present themselves as dancers and they may even be learning but I feel the crux of our struggle and sore toes comes from the lack of environments where one can see a dancers body, grace and form, before they step on the floor.

We’ve basically lost the temples of thoughts where thinkers once gathered.

Now we have philosophers pondering their existance, next to the workout bra recording his latest blog, beside the face for the next product line sweeping the nations, beside the theologian, poet, sculpture, and research scienceist, all talking over one another.

Most with sense, stay away from that dumpster fire and would rather stay to the shadows or solitude.

Just my general observations. I know I’m not the most clever of peeps but I almost view my bios as a puzzle to think over, ponder and ask questions. In my mind it’s like a social flirtatious game of chess with words, I move here, where do you move and how do I react to your reactions…

Or Mayhaps I’m just a loon and a blathering buffoon?",1,1767928473.0,sapiosexuals,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1q7wyf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HopefulThrowaway25/comments/1q7wyf9/37_m4f_nyc_too_much_time_has_been_wasted/,37 [M4F] #NYC Too much time has been wasted. Hopefully this is it.,"Will start with the classic “Long time lurker, first time poster”, as it certainly is true.

After many frustrating months replying to posts that were, for the most part, dead ends (from scammers, to OF models, to people who outright lied about location/availability/looks), I have finally decided to fully take charge and post what I am looking for. Life is indeed too short, and I am not longer in the mood to waste time chasing.

While the above makes me sound a bit grumpy, I promise I’m definitely not.

A little bit about me: Manhattan-based, 37, married for 10. I’m white, very athletic, tall, full head of hair, clean shaved. I’m also smart, witty, have a dry (and often times weird) sense of humor, social (yet also cherish being alone), flirtatious, and successful in my career. I love reading, traveling, eating out, going to concerts, listening to music, visiting museums.

What I am looking for:

An AP (hopefully a LT one, but OK with being less committed at first) who:

1. Is also married. This is non-negotiable. If you are single, move along and don’t message me. I need to know that you are as committed to discretion as I am.

2. Is not interested in any way, shape or form in changing her circumstances. I have ZERO interest in changing mine. Can discuss my reasons for being here separately. But this is non-negotiable.

3. Is between 30-45. I am not particularly strict on this one, but that is a good enough range to find someone who is mature.

4. Is serious about this. You must be willing to chat, exchange pics, and meet (even if just for a coffee). I don’t want a months-long conversation that goes nowhere. We can do all the chatting once we’ve met and know that the connection and attraction are there.

5. Is conventionally attractive, health conscious, and keeps an active lifestyle. I take very good care of myself and am looking for someone who does the same. That also means being DDF and willing to show test results if we ever get that far. 

6. Is, ideally, based in Manhattan. I want the logistics here to be simple. If you come to the city often, I’m open to chatting, but will prioritize NYers.

7. Is willing to exchange pictures (SFW) early on. The intellectual attraction is as important as the physical one. I don’t want to waste our time if we don’t connect on anything.

8. Ideally has flexibility to meet during the week and during the day (at first). Arrangements can be made subsequently if we get that far.

9. Is successful and/or leads a busy life. Boredom is a dangerous thing.

10. Does not have expectations on how I align myself politically. I have no intention whatsoever of discussing politics. I save that for work. This does not mean I am a leftist or right wing; I just don’t want to mix business with pleasure.

I might be missing a few things, but this should cover the most ground.

If you had the patience to read through this post, please reach out, tell me a little bit about yourself and pitch me your favorite place in the city.",1,1767928292.0,u_HopefulThrowaway25,0,1.0,False

​Several years ago, I treated Lyme disease with long-term antibiotics/treatment. Ever since, I’ve been dealing with ongoing gut issues that mirror IBS: bloating, alternating constipation/diarrhea, and significant pain in the lower left abdomen. I also have recurring neutropenia (low neutrophil counts between 1.0–2.0) that comes and goes.
​While symptoms flare up periodically, I’ve found a combination of things that helps me manage them—some of which have brought massive improvements:
​High-dose Glutamine & Creatine
​High-dose Vitamin C
​Moderate caffeine (coffee/tea, but no energy drinks)
​Exercise (long walks, light cardio)
​Cinnamon + Rosemary oil (taken internally in high doses—carefully, of course). This has been a total game-changer for me.
​Lifestyle: Sauna, intermittent fasting, and a careful diet.
​It’s not 100% gone—the left-side pain can still be rough—but this routine keeps it mostly under control.

​I’m curious about your experiences: For those with IBS symptoms after Lyme (especially with left-side pain or neutropenia), is this something you’ve had to accept as lifelong, or did it eventually resolve?
 Do most people find a way to just 'manage' it, or is full recovery possible?",0,1767928158.0,ibs,0,0.5,False

Anyone else feeling this?,"I visited Karachi recently and honestly I was shocked again. I have been visiting regularly for the past 3 years and every single time it feels like the city has gone further downhill.

This time the traffic was absolutely unbearable. So bad and so dusty that I flat out refused to meet anyone inside the city. I only met people who were willing to come up to the highway, and that was it. Moving around Karachi has become exhausting and mentally draining.

The dust, the congestion, the chaos, it just kills the whole experience. I used to look forward to these trips, but this time I was actually happy when it was time to leave Karachi.

The only positive thing I noticed was that the coffee scene has improved. Some really good coffee shops now, which was a pleasant surprise.
Karachi Airport was another disaster. No AC, poor flight operations, no porter available anywhere. It felt neglected and poorly managed. The only decent part was the Marhaba lounge, which was fine.

Honestly, I don’t enjoy coming to Karachi anymore, and that’s sad to say. I really wish someone serious comes in and fixes things. Kasam se, dil se dua nikalti hai, Maryam Nawaz ajaey yahan bhi.",1,1767928139.0,KarachiSocials,0,1.0,False

""Lockdown and Martial law""","Warning, following passage includes strong language, substance use, topics of suicide, offensive jokes, detailed imagery, and other sensitive topics. Any mention of real people is strictly fictional as this story takes place in an alternate parallel universe.

 Reader discretion is advised. 



I'm so glad I reupped my marijuana before this. My plug gave me an extra eighth with the ounce that I ordered, plus, a blunt variety pack. As a joke, he put down a note under a red gift ribbon. ""Happy Yule to my one pagan customer"" the note read. I chuckled as I walked in with the bulky envelope alongside the rest of the mail. I gazed upon the grey sky, specks of blue visible. The short breeze carried my breath into the air, chills ran down my body. ""Now.. is it cold? Or do I detect.. a mid day spirit?"" 

I went back inside, feeling the tension once again. Everyone seemed to be doing their own thing. Father was on the game in the living room, brothers in their room, sister in hers, Mother talking on the phone about the shit happening around, and my other brother in the garage playing the game. 

 Martial law had been enforced. I sat in my bed watching videos online. I came across a video of national guardsmen in helicopters flying over huge clouds of greenish reddish mist/fog. It was terrifying seeing only the tops of some sky scrapers disappear into the colorful abyss. The camera cut to the outside of the zone. It was like looking at a giant hill.. you'd stand at the edge of this stand still cloud and only your feet would be submerged in the fog.

As I finished rolling a blunt, I got a text. ""Yooo you hearing ts??"" My homeboy Kash texted. ""Yeah mate, some biological bomb hit New York and LA"" I texted back. ""I'm rolling a blunt rn got reupped, you wanna smoke?"" Right as I hit enter, another discord message popped up in the notification bar. ""Nah nigga not just LA and NY whole main cities DC, Seattle, Arizona, Miami too. My folks had to evacuate"" the message read. ""Bet I was finna ask sameshit"" a second one followed up. 

I made my way downstairs, the foot of the Coyote pelt hat I wore brushing against my bare back. I filled two cups of cranberry mango juice, adding a shot of vodka to mine. Mother was in the kitchen sitting at the table, her phone faced up sitting idle by her rested elbow. ""You alright Bonnie?"" I asked, having called her Bonnie since the day she adopted me. She looked at me with that ""Are you serious?"" look. My eyes went wide as I took the hint that she was so overwhelmed with stress she couldn't reply with words. ""You need some of this?"" I asked, waving the blunt in my hand. That seemed to ease her nerves a bit, causing her to let out a quick breath of laughter. She shook her head and waved her finger. ""Oh right you quit smoking entirely,"" I said with surprise. 

I headed out to the front porch, using my mini torch to light the blunt. I realized I forgot the drinks, so I left the blunt lit up on the front porch and headed back inside. The time was 11:23 on a Sunday morning, so I heated up some water and made me some coffee, adding a shot to it of course. These days were a struggle with the politics, economy, and state of the country. 

I headed back outside, holding both cups and the coffee handle around my fingers. Jason, the Father, looked at me strangely. ""Why the hell do you got three- two cups and a mug?"" He asked with amused confusion. ""Kash is coming over,"" I replied. ""Ah, okay,"" he replied before continuing his game of Pal world. 

It was a peaceful morning, even more peaceful due to the lack of highway sounds. Only a few birds sang, giving the environment an eerie silence. One could've thought this neighborhood was in the middle of the forest. It was a dead end neighborhood, down Georgewood Road was the apartment complex, Kingwood residence. It was all one main road leading to a bridge connection to the highway and a backwoods road as well. As I took a puff of the blunt, I noticed a distant mechanical warping sound which grew in volume to a helicopter wiring. A fuckin Chinook helicopter had landed somewhere ahead, I guessed in the field by Georgewood road. ""They must be deploying soldiers.. damn were really under attack huh?"" I said to myself. 


Right when that thought passed a light skinned dude in a ski mask and all black came walking up the driveway. I recognized Kash with the mask, and stood up to dab him up. ""Wasgoinonn mate! How's shit been?"" I asked. ""It's aight, I'm relieved to be honest. Bro.. you know my folks said? They got put on a bus, got off at a beach, got onto LIFE RAFTS, put onto one of those military ships that holds helicopters n shit? Then they got put on a big ass plane and I ain't heard nun from them after that"" Kash explained. The center of my brows raised in confused shock. ""Fuckin hell, wonder why they're doing all that,"" the smoke left my lungs with each word as I offered him the blunt. 

""Ion know,"" he admitted, taking a puff of marijuana. ""Shit makes me think we finna get NUKED or something."" He added, causally. ""Eh, if we do get nuked at least it would be beautiful,"" I half joked. Kash laughed. ""Right! I'd keep my blick right there case I wanna pop one real quick,"" he said while blowing smoke. A moment of silence passed by a I imagined how it would look. The trees swaying, the clouds going from their normal speed to fast forward, and that mushroom cloud. It would be a bittersweet moment indeed. I voiced that thought. 

""You got your phone on you?"" Kash asked as we took in the environment. Lots of people were out and about. The lockdown only restricted us to our residential neighborhood. ""Nah, why?"" I asked. He tossed his phone gently into the grass. ""This nigga Aquil been posting hella shit from this lick him and these other niggas did on a trap house. I'm talking a black duffle bag he got stashed filled with some blicks, weed, other drugs and shit.. they gonna be partying tonight at some house in Chevis, I know you ain't wanna get in trouble with the law but I was wondering if you wanted to be a lookout for me,"" he explained, getting very serious very fast. 

My heart rate definitely raised at the thought. ""I mean.. shit.."" I hesitated. ""He also been posting pics of him holding whole.. fuckin... Bread loafs,"" he joked. I laughed, ""that what you call fat stacks? Bread loafs?"" I asked, a smile plastered on my face. Kash laughed at that remark. ""Yeahh!"" He proudly replied. I chuckled, ""alright, anyone else coming?"" I mumbled quietly. ""Fuck yeah man, I'll hop on GTA later,"" I said aloud, realizing how loud we were talking. ""And Dami hopping in too,"" Kash wisely replied. 

We finished our blunt and I finished my coffee within the hour.  We went walking around the neighborhood, reminiscing on how every kid used to be out on the block and now you rarely see one kid on a bike. There were families that would walk around together, dogs being walked, hikers, and even one group of kids playing at the park. Nature sang above the trees,.willow moss swaying with the wind, and we even saw a group of deer. 

When we got to the one entrance and exit of our neighborhood. Two soldiers were posted in a humvee dead center of the road. Kash and I stood at the large sign that read ""Pineneedle Village"" likely given its name due to the pine trees in the area, at least I thought that. One of the soldiers was sitting in the gunner slot of the humvee. ""Hey soldier! How come there's just two of you?"" I asked. 

The soldier looked at me with a smile, ""Because the other four are in the ghetto ass apparement complex,"" he replied, carrying a southern draw. Kash and I called it the ""FAN"" neighborhood, Kash calling it the ""Fuck ass nigga hood"" due to the amount of enemies he had. He only had 2, but.. they had friends of course. Readers probably see Kash as just another gang affiliated goon waiting to die, but I saw differently. We met in high school when I went around asking if anyone knew of a fight club, Kash met in the bathroom when he overheard me.

""I'm actually the guy to see if you can qualify for the club, you beat me, you're in,"" he said, that day lead to us sparring, I got in of course me being trained and all. After that, we smoked a blunt and fed the ducks in the FAN neighborhood at the time. He didn't have enemies then, only after, when they tried pressing on him because he was with a girl that was an ex of the same guy, Aquil, who I decided I'd be helping Rob.

We had a route plan, multiple. His cousin, Brooks, would be hanging out at the party Aquil was at, I gave the suggestion that he would be able to give us a heads up. 

That night came quick, the high was off, and I sat outside waiting. I wore black sneakers, black cargo pants with the sock pulled over the leg sleeve. A tucked black hoodie with a denim torso, and a black patterned bandana tied around my face. 

The night was foggy, something that would come to our advantage. I hopped the back wooden fence at around 12:00. I pushed through the thick vegetation and closely huddled young trees by as gently as possible. A cicada above me went silent at the slight rustling caused by my brief tussle with a thorn vine, but I made it to the clearing after about a minute. I brushed myself off from the pine needles and other Georgian plant matter which sticks to your clothes. I made sure every bit was off before heading towards the meetup. 

Right around the bend, I saw a figure leaning back against the steel gate guarding the gated community behind. A puff of smoke suddenly erupted from the figure's face, and I recognized Kash right then. I let out a silent but audible laugh. ""Bro you're getting high before doing this?"" I asked with concern. Kash let out a breath chuckle. ""Yeah, boosts awareness,"" he replied, pointing at his head and twirling his finger. ""Ah, alright where's this dudes house?"" I asked. 

Kash pointed at the tall wooden gate across the street. ""We gotta jump that, but once we jump it we gotta go STRAIGHT to that nigga crib, them soldiers gonna see our asses,"" he explained with hand gestures. I nodded, getting into a running ready. There was a curfew hour of 8pm for kids, 10pm for teenagers, and 12:00 for adults. Anyone caught out would be brought back to their house and anyone living with them would be informed. If they caught said person again, they would all be responsible for allowing he or she out again, causing everyone in the household to be arrested. 


Stupid rule, yeah, but that's how things were for some reason. 

My heart raced as I ran for the fense. I got over the fense, watching Kash flop over it and somehow land on his feet. I did the good old pull push climb method, landing on my feet with a crouch. We continued around this blue house before cutting across the windy neighborhood road. Kash went for the side window which was shadowed. I could hear voices from over the fence which sounded like yelling, maybe it was someone else, I couldn't tell because of the adrenaline. 

Getting inside, Kash shut the door behind me. I found myself in a dimly lit livingroom, a squeaky fan and pipes behind the wall being the only audible thing. To my left there was a door which lead into a closet, I pushed around the shoes and checked in coat pockets but found nothing. I thought I scored but it was a golf bag. ""Kash, I didn't know ghetto cunts played golf?"" I joked as I passed him in the living room. He tried holding his laughter but it came out in a hiss before he just wheezed. ""I'm fuckin dead cuz nah"" he whispered. 

We both began moving cloth piles, the livingroom was a mess. Kash began unplugging the cords from the TV, going for the PC tower and Xbox series S. As he did that, I pulled couch cushions off, and to my surprise. A black duffle bag that was zipped up, I unzipped it and my jaw dropped. 

I found myself stuck gazing upon two Glocks wit drum mags, some laser pointer, a red dot optic, two miniature rifles of some sort crossing each other like a flag decal, one looked more AK variant while the other looked AR. The AR had a red dot looking optic as well as a laser pointer and suppressor. The mini AK had a drum mag and fire grip, iron sighted with a laser. On top of them were big bags of weed, the size of two fists. 

A tap on my shoulder got me out of my trance. ""Lock in twin, Brodie say we he walking here with his homies talking bout niggas robbing his crib, they got cameras nigga.. oh shit"" Kash realized what I was looking at. ""zip that shit twin zip that shit and get that shit!"" Kash excitedly whispered, nearly letting out squeals. 

Bro for real let out zesty ass energy with the way he was hyped. I put the bag around my shoulder, feeling the weight instantly. We were out the door by the time I had it all the way on, and over the fense we went. ""Yo take that shit twin I'll come tomorrow and we can split that shit,"" Kash said as we ran across the road, going opposite ways of the canal. ""Fuck yeah mate,"" I replied, bidding him with a two fingered salute. ""Love and safety,"" he bidded. ""All the same to you brotha'"" I bidded in return. He didsapered in the shadows of the trees, hopping his back gate, and shutting the back door behind him. 

I took off my bandana and jacket to tie it around my waist so the bag was covered. I knew I'd have a tougher time getting through the foliage with the bag which was quite heavy. I cut through a neighbors yard who was chill with it, as it got me in the residence. I made my way through the front door after stashing the duffle bag into the abandoned van we held. Filled with junk, I covered it with a trash bag full of clothes. 

After that, I got them clothes off, showered, and hit the hay.

I am a heteroromantic ace somewhere in the middle (so sex isn't the focus for me, but I'm not opposed either) I'm all about taking things slow and really getting to know someone.

I value honesty, communication, and loyalty - and I'm looking for someone who's willing to grow, repair when conflicts pop up, and build a genuine connection.

Some fun facts about me: I love music (I sing, play guitar, and write songs), building lego, baseball, museums, and exploring new places. I usually travel once or twice a year, often to Europe, my family's from Italy, so I spend time there whenever I can. I also enjoy trying new restaurants as well as hitting up coffee shops, although I’m more of a tea person.

I like staying active, though fitness is still a work in progress.

Musically, my tastes are all over the place: Turnover, Weezer, The Story So Far, indie, punk, alternative... even some dance, metal, pop, and classic 60s-80s songs. Music is my passion, and I love sharing it.

I’m looking for an honest, real connection - ideally leading to a long-term relationship.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1q7wssz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q7wssz/aita_for_going_out_with_my_best_friends_ex/,AITA For Going out with My Best Friend’s Ex,"Sorry for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom. 

Ok, I know how it sounds, but hear me out. All of this happened a few months ago, and despite the title, pretty much all of my friends/family say that I did nothing wrong. However, I can’t shake the guilty feeling in my chest when I think about how I got here, and the fact that my friend is still mad at me isn’t helping.

I (20F) have known my best friend “Lia” (20NB) since 7th grade. They were my platonic soulmate. I loved them. I loved them as a friend, as family, and (for much of our friendship) even as more. I adored them and would do almost anything they asked me to. Genuinely, if Lia told me to jump from a cliff for them, I probably would have. We almost never fought and always did everything together. When I got my college acceptance letter for my current university, Lia was the one sitting next to me when I opened it. 
That being said, our friendship was not without faults. Lia has always been the “whatever Lia wants, Lia gets.” Type of person. That refers to jobs, experiences, trips, presents and yes, even people. I often felt like our friendship dynamic was very “Regina and Gretchen” and used to express that to Lia a lot in high school. Lia always convinced me that it was all in my head and that I was just imagining it, but recently many people who’ve known us since then have expressed to me that they felt the same viewing us from the outside. One of my friends even said something along the lines of “Lia says jump and you say ‘how high?’” Over the years I stopped really minding it. It just became the dynamic, and I was happy as long as Lia was happy. Lia was my world. 

Now, the drama. Lia and I have known “Jake” (20M) since 7th grade as well. The three of us used to be friends in middle and early high school until one day in the summer between 9th and 10th grade when Lia and I cut him off. See back then, Jake was a very typical 14yo boy and would often tease us a lot, especially me. Nothing too bad, however I have the spine of a jellyfish and don’t handle teasing well due to a history of being bullied. All of this was also amplified by the fact that I had a crush on him. When Lia found out I had a crush on him it quickly became a big deal as Lia then announced that they had a crush on him too. What did I do? I told them that they should go for it and that I would back down as I didn’t want a guy to come between our friendship. This later became a pattern of me developing a crush on someone and then Lia pursuing them anyway and me having to sit by and watch. The most recent time might I add, being just last August when Lia was 20 and I was 19. With Jake though, it was especially brutal. Lia would ask me to wingman for them all the time and I had to sit by and watch as Lia actively flirted with him right in my face. Soon after that, it became obvious that the teasing was really affecting me and Lia convinced me that it would “just be easier” if I blocked him on everything and stopped talking to him whatsoever. After some convincing, I agreed and blocked Jake along with two other guys in our friend group. In solidarity, Lia blocked the three of them as well, however unblocked them shortly after and started going along with a rumor that had started about me being the one who told Lia to block them. After unblocking them, Lia and Jake “dated” for about a month. I use quotation marks because Lia made it abundantly clear both back then and post-breakup that they weren’t very emotional invested in the relationship since they had already started crushing on one of Jake’s close friends. I will note however that Lia made sure to flaunt the relationship in front of me and would cling onto him and kiss him a LOT around me. Lia got bored after a month and dumped him over the phone while he was boarding a plane for a family trip. That was the middle of 10th grade. Neither of us really spoke to Jake after that, though in senior year I did unblock him because we sat next to each other in a class (assigned seating) and I wasn’t sure if I’d need to reach out for group projects. 

Fast forward 5 years, and a lot has changed. My spine is a lot stronger and Lia and I were still close, though I’d say I’ve gotten slightly better at standing up for myself. Jake and I are both juniors in college at schools relatively close to our hometown (his is 40mins away, min is an hour away) and Lia has two full time jobs in our hometown (chose to join the work force straight after high school) so we’re all still pretty local. 

A few months ago, my birthday passed and Jake decided to reach out. He saw something I posted about my birthday and texted me on Instagram something along the lines of “Happy belated birthday! It’s been a while, how’ve you been?” I immediately texted Lia and was like “omg, you’ll never believe who just texted me!!” Lia’s immediate response was “I bet he’s only texting you because he wants to hook up.” I then said something like “idk it seems like he just wants to catch up. If anything he’s probably just texting me to get back in contact with you lol.” Lia then latched onto that idea and it soon became the narrative that there was no way he wanted to talk to me, he was obviously only reaching out because of Lia. I ended up responding to him and we talked for a couple of days. I made sure Lia was fine with it and they just said something like “yeah just don’t meet up with him.” I then said “are you sure it doesn’t both you that I’m texting your ex?” And Lia said “oh yeah, I forgot I dated him. No I just don’t want you hanging out with him because of how he treated you in 9th grade.” I respected that, said I wouldn’t meet up with him, and it also prompted me to finally confront Jake about all of the teasing from when we were kids. He apologized, said he didn’t realize how much it had affected me, and said that he was sorry he ever hurt me. He said it wasn’t intentional but that he takes responsibility for his actions, and that he’s a different person now and wouldn’t make those kinds of jokes towards me ever again. I was really relieved by this apology. I had finally gotten closure on something that had been weighing on me for 5 years, and I was really happy. I told Lia right away and Lia’s immediate response was “I don’t buy it. I bet he’s just lying because he wants something.” I tried to tell Lia that it felt really genuine and that I had finally gotten the closure I never thought I would get, but Lia kept pushing that he was only doing it to either hook up with me or to get back into contact with them. I felt really hurt by that and said “god forbid someone wants to talk to me for my personality.” Lia then started backtracking and said “of course people can like you for your personality, I just don’t believe him.” We went on for weeks of Lia saying that there was no way he genuinely wanted my friendship. And me saying it didn’t matter because all we were doing was texting. Lia kept responding with “just don’t meet up with him.” Lia also thought it would be funny to start talking to him too, so they reached out to him on Instagram as well. 

Everything changed though when Jake texted me a week later. “Hey, I’m going to be in [hometown] this weekend because Lia asked me to come over. Do you want to do something this weekend too?” I was so confused. Lia had been telling me not to hang out with him under any circumstances. I immediately texted Lia about it and Lia was like “I changed my mind. Maybe we can be friends with him after all.” I then told Lia that if that was the case, I was going to hang out with him too. At this point, my texts with Jake had also started getting increasingly flirty and I had been talking about it with Lia. Lia just kept saying (in a joking tone) “just don’t hook up with him lol.” This joke wasn’t out of the ordinary as I had been going through a period of sleeping around at the time. I had developed a reputation in our friend group for sleeping with people on the first date that I’m not quite proud of, but I also wasn’t in the best headspace emotionally at the time. In fact, it was made by a couple of my friends, thus, in my head, reinforcing the idea that it was a joke. Two days before hanging out with him, I once again asked Lia if they had any problems with me hanging out with their ex. Once again, they reaffirmed that they didn’t care about the fact that they dated in the past and that their only distain for him came from how he treated me in 9th grade, and also one minor instance of how his friends never liked Lia when the two of them dated because of something Lia said in front of them. We talked about my plans with him for a bit, and it again ended in Lia saying in a VERY JOKEY TONE “just don’t hook up with him.” 

So he and I hung out and we had a really great time. We went bowling, got lunch, and watched a couple of movies at my apartment. Looking back, admittedly it felt more like a date than “two friends meeting to catch up,” but I didn’t see it at the time. One thing led to another, and we ended up hooking up. Now again, I really thought Lia had been joking when they said “just don’t hook up with him.” If I had any thought that they might have been serious, I wouldn’t have done it. Lia was the most important person to me and having them be mad at me was world shattering. After hooking up, I texted Lia right away. Like he was still at my apartment. I didn’t think of it as a serious matter, so I jokingly texted them “hey pookie, remember that thing you told me not to do?” They said “what thing?” And I said “I hooked up with him.” I thought I would get a sarcastic “OP wtf” and we would laugh about it. That wasn’t the case. Lia texted “don’t talk to me.” And it all went down hill from there. When I realized they were serious, I apologized. Said I would do anything to make it right, but they weren’t having it. They ended up ghosting me for weeks afterwards, and our other best friend took their side without me ever having a chance to explain my side. I was left confused, wondering what specifically Lia was mad about. Was it because they were being protective since he treated me poorly in the past? Was it because they told me not to and I did it anyway? Was it because the two of them had dated? Spoiler alert: it was the last one. I wouldn’t get confirmation until a month later when NC was broken and we sat down for coffee to discuss things. 

Here’s where I actually feel like TA. By this point, he and I had been lightly flirting for a couple of weeks and pretty much talking every day. Lia knew about all of it, and had even commented on how one time they texted him at the same time as me and he responded to me right away and didn’t respond to Lia for almost an hour. All of that to say, I didn’t want to stop talking to him. I knew if I wanted to save things with Lia I should have cut him off, but I really liked being with him. From then we hung out pretty much every weekend. His school is close enough to mine that he could take the train to see me for day trips no problem and we just fell into a routine I guess. We started FaceTiming daily and I realized that I didn’t really have a desire to see other people anymore. We became “official” (I hate how childish that sounds, but for lack of a better term I’ll use it) a month later. That was about two weeks  before Lia and I had coffee. Lia flipped out when I said that Jake and I were dating. They said they did not approve and said “let me put it this way, which one of your exes would you be ok with me f*cking?” Now I understand where they’re coming from, but side note to that: prior to my hookup phase, I’d only ever had extremely serious relationships. My shortest relationship was 8 months. Of the 4 relationships I’ve been in, two of them asked me to move in together and one of them PROPOSED, so I don’t think that’s really comparable, but I digress. Anyway, we talked things out and Lia and I agreed that we both wanted to be friends still but that it would still take time. I walked out of the meet up hopeful, but also very exhausted, as Lia had said some pretty hurtful things about me, including an accusation that I was only dating Jake to make Lia mad. I resented that because I genuinely like Jake and I had nothing to do with Lia. Anyway, that was over a month ago. We haven’t spoken since. In fact they actually blocked me on everything. Even costar (didn’t even know you could block someone on there??). 

Here’s the thing: I don’t regret hooking up with him. Do I regret hurting Lia? Yes. Do I wish we were still friends? Of course. Would I have stopped talking to him if Lia had just been honest about how they felt from the get-go? Absolutely. However, I let myself catch feelings. And I’m glad that I did. I’ve never dated someone so kind, generous and caring towards me. He takes care of me, he listens when I’m upset and he doesn’t invalidate my feelings. He’s reliable and made it clear from the beginning that if we were going to date he wanted it to be something that would last. He makes me genuinely happy in ways that I’ve never felt before. I know it’s early in the relationship, but I love him. 

TL;DR: my (20F) best friend Lia (20NB) briefly went out with Jake (20M) 5 years ago. He reached out to me 3 months ago to catch up and we started talking regularly. I asked Lia if they had a problem with him being their ex and Lia responded that they forgot they had even dated. Now Jake and I are dating and Lia won’t talk to me. 

So Reddit: AITA for dating my best friend’s ex even though I thought they didn’t care about him?

1q7wsal,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q7wsal/the_longest_night_part_31_snow_day/,The Longest Night Part 31 - Snow Day,"From the back of a couch a boy and his dog had been left to stare out the front room window. To stare out upon all that had been the yard, the street, the house, and all that now lay hidden beneath the blanket of white. 

📻 *This just in, We've got word another has been caught in the trap left by ""The Hunter""*

Snout of the canine pressed upon the very glass, for heated breath now left to fog once frosted glass. Large had been the paws that grip, To hang upon the back of the couch they sat. How strange it had been to see what had once been a pup, to have out grown the boy called Jack.

*📻 This makes the third one this week alone, in this month long reign of terror.*

Head left to turn, to stare upon the muzzle now pressed upon the glass, for the fog now spread to obscure the very spot the boy once stared. Now too, Did the boy press his snout, and face firm upon the glass. To leave his mark just as the canine had. One the mark had spread across the very room they sat.

*📻 But have no fear folks, The Hound is on the case! Working closely with Santa and his helpers to catch the one who's made his naughty list!*

Annoyed had been the tone of a mother who nearly lost her cool. Strained had been the sweeter cords of words that sounded as if they might snap under the tension of each  syllable that made up her every word. ""I think it's time the both of you spent some time out side in this lovely weather."" 

📻 *And for all those good little girls and boy's that are waiting for Santa, Don't forget to to turn on your ClemCo lights! Available now at your local Super-Mart!*

Rex would not bother to even look, or turn from the spot he sat. The boy had been much the same, Least until he had been lifted right off his knees, and tucked beneath the arm of his mother. To be whisked away to the place that served as his nightly cage, to once more be changed. Forced to step through the havoc left behind of one that wished to always play.

Every shelf, knocked from the very wall they had once been pressed and laid to rest. Scattered had been the half eaten, and chewed books that now scatter and drape across the place. Mother not even bothering to question how some found their way to hang from atop the ceiling fan. Coffee table left flipped upon it's side, stained had been the rug beneath by the hot coco the boy hadn't the chance to drink. Left to stare down at the half melted, fluffy treats that had used it to bathe. Yet when it had all been said and done, only a single thing had been spared by this canine's more curious nature.

📻 *Super-Mart!, Fulfilling all your Christmas needs sinc-* Screeching pain heard from within the box now that his mother twisted the dial used to silence the very thing that speaks.

""Can't believe you two managed to make such a mess in such a short time."" His mother having yet to process all that had been done to the room she stood. 

""The cookies will just have to wait"" Large had been those eyes that now stare up at her from beneath her arm, Both now vanishing down the end of the hall. Canine now left to chew, to rip free all the fluff that had once filled the cushion the boy sat. Slamming of a single distant door heard.

Slamming that left both upon the back porch steps. Canine left to stare down at the stuff he dare not try to eat. Hesitant had been the paw that had been lifted, to hover over this great big white thing. The boy had been more interested in the wool mittens forced over each of his hands. Trying his best to wiggle his now bound fingers With little to no success the boy now gave each of his new found flippers, a curious flap. Stacked had been the layers that left the boy looking more like one of his fluffy treats, than a son of man.

Reluctant had been the canine to touch this stuff that had been soft as powder, cold as night. Growing cold now that he gave it a press. Trio now left to stare down into the paw shaped hole Rex had left. Curious had been that foolish thing that now stare down from a branch above. For it had made a single mistake. It had stopped, to meet this canine's gaze.

Oh what horror had been left on this squirrels face, Moment it realized the very mistake it had made. Neither dare to move a muscle now, That each had been caught within the others stare. One that might of worked, had it not been for a single boy. One that had tried to take a step, To find himself flopping right on his side. 

Plop had been the sound of the gun fired, that marked the start of this chase. Scurrying had been the squirrel right up the side of, and to the very top of this naked tree. Fleeting had been the notion of safety, and comfort it used to bring, now that the very beast below had been left to leap. One that moved with the familiar grace of a mountainous goat.

From one branch, to bound off to the next with a twang, and a snap. Scratching of claws that now gripped, to drag the canine right up the side. Thunk had been the sound the canine made as he now sprang right off the side of that trunk. Snapping had been the trap now sprung, for that now caught within a gluttonous maw. The boy left to stare up from the spot he had been left to lay. Left to watch that fluffy tail that was left to hang free, To be slurped up just like spaghetti. Fluffy had been the tail this gluttonous beast now wag.

Atop the tree Rex had been left to stare, down at the distant boy. Without reason, Without warning this canine would leap, To vanish into the depths of this sea of cold, sea made of snow.

Scattered had been the layers of clothes that bound the boy so. Left free of such senseless things. Free to crawl toward, to stare down into the hole from the warmth of his footie pajamas. Yet no matter how hard he tried to wave, he couldn't free himself from his new found flippers. 

Deep had been this hole that looked to have no bottom. Dark had been all this boy could see. For just how deep would the canine need to dig, to create such a thing? Over the edge the boy now tipped, to fall into this dog shaped print into the abyss. To slide for a time, before he had been left to crawl through this narrow place that knew not the warmth of light. 

Greeted by the sound of gnashing teeth, of that which had been left to dig. Crunching of snow as hard as stone, From this thing that would dig not with claws, but with it's teeth. For munching had become this wayward child's guide. Bright had been the sudden rush of light, now that the one that lead him crawled out from the very depths of this abysmal cold, snow filled sea. Panting heard from the canine that now stared down at him from the edge of what looked to be, a bottomless pit. 

 Eager had been the canine to pull this child free from what had been an Icy treat. Gripping him by the wool that had served as the scruff of the neck. Left to flop, to plop upon the very spot. To stare up at this new found place. Cryptic had been this place the snow dare not grace. Spears of black stood en garde of this new found place. Standing above the wall of thorn it had been placed, and left within it's grace. Deadly had been the allure it's crimson flowers gave. One met for love, now meant for pain.

Massive had been this place that could be mistaken for a gothic church. How steep, how slanted had been the points of each tower that had been part of this derelict looking, Victorian manor. To stare upon one gargoyle that had been sitting just beneath each and every peak. One that had a more pointed beak. 

Smacking of tail felt against the boy's face, as something had once more been caught in a game of chase, To rush through what had been a maze of thorn. A maze the Canine care not, for he only knew one path, One filled with wanton destruction. One the boy now followed, to step through the demolished walls of thorn that once barred their way. To find only a colossal door lying in wait.

Silent had been each half that had been left to slowly open of it's own volition, Eager had the darkness been to welcome the one now left to stand before it's gates. From this place a single figure would step. One that had more in common with a skeleton wearing opaque skin, then that of an Elderly, and well dressed, gentleman. 

A single hand would rise from the darkness within, to reveal what had been caught within the trap that was his grasp. By the scruff of the neck the canine had been left to hang, with a tail wag. Just what was the boy to make, of this canine that gave such a happy, panting face. Hoarse had been the voice that came deep from within his frail frame. Feint had been the strained whisper that escaped.

""Welcome child, I've come to greet you on behalf of the one that is awaiting you inside."" Slight had been the bow this one gave, to retreat back into the darkness from wince he came.

1q7wpta,https://www.reddit.com/r/TouchPlanetTreks/comments/1q7wpta/changunarayan_temple_tour/,Changunarayan Temple Tour,"# Changunarayan Temple Tour: Its History, Religious Importance, and Legends

The **Changunarayan temple** is located in the Bhaktapur district. It is one of the oldest temples of the [Kathmandu Valley](https://touchplanettreks.com/trip/kathmandu-sightseeing-tour), which offers ancient artwork, history, and beautiful cultures. The Changunarayan municipality is named after this temple. This temple comprises four entrance doors, each with a guardian (Dwarpal). They consist of a lion, an elephant, a griffin, and a Sarabhas. The main entrance gate is on the western side. It was established by the **Lichhavi king Haridatta of Burma** around 523 BC.

Regarding its etymology, it has **been called Changunarayan**, Garudnarayan, and Dolashikar (Lichhavi period). In Nepal Bhasa, ‘Chu’ means Champak tree, and ‘Gu’ means forest. Thus, ‘Chugu’ gradually becomes ‘Changu.’ Similarly, during the regime of Manadev, a renowned Lichhavi king, he built a **sculpture of Garud** in the temple alongside the sculpture of him and his wife. He also donated land as a Guthi (endowment) for the temple. He also built a ‘Dhungedhara,’ and the main source of water was from **Nagarkot**, a beautiful tourist **destination in Bhaktapur**. According to different legends, water, an element of the body, is a source of energy, due to which the stone waterspout is built. The location of that tap resembles Shivalinga. The temple is in a pagoda style, which shows its artistic nature. It’s a historic temple, so it has been renovated by different kings, such as in the medieval era by **Shiva Singh** and in the 18th century by Bhaskar Malla. Similarly, a massive fire caught the temple, and it was also rebuilt by Bhupatindra Malla. He did some sacred rituals for the wellness of the temple. It is a two-story temple in which the base is one floor. The construction material includes tiles, copper, wood, and bricks; a medium-sized window; and forty Tundals, which consist of three categories of sculptures. The first category is of a tree, followed by sculptures of **Shiva and Bishnu**, and the last one shows sculptures of a man and animals. There is also Torans.

# Changunarayan Temple Overview 

This **Changunarayan temple** has also been used as a fort in order to provide security to Nepalmandal. This temple has many ‘Daha’ (lakes), which shows it is directly connected to snakes. It has been said that lakes are home to snakes. There is also a tap known as the **‘Narayanhiti’ tap**, in which people bathe. The word ‘Narayan’ resembles Lord Vishnu or the king, and ‘Hiti’ means tap in Nepal Bhasa. There is a method to enter the temple. In the main entrance gate (which is not there, due to the earthquake of 2015), there used to be ‘Chuku’ (the Newari name for hinge) at the top and bottom of the door. When we are likely to enter, we should first be purified physically by drinking the water flowing from the sculpture of Naagas located at the side of the gate. After visiting the temple, it is believed that we will be pure mentally too. According to guru Sankaracharya, **‘tantra,’ ‘mantra,**’ and various methods are the only ways. Similarly, when we are purifying ourselves, we should chant the verse “**Dolagiri Parwata Champapur Mahanagar Changunarayangrame**.” It will provide positive vibes in our bodies.

# Religious Importance of Changunarayan Temple

Hindus have lots of deities, and we have **different temples** too. The main objective of all deities and temples we worship is to provide us with mental peace. Since every temple is built with a purpose regarding festivals, this temple also has its own religious importance. Every year at the ‘**Haribodhani Ekadashi**,’ there is a tradition of lighting an eternal lamp (Akhanda deep) in the temple. According to belief, it has been said that if people have seen the lamp during their lifetime, it will be easier for them to enter heaven. Yamaraj, the god of death, asks people if they have seen the lamp. If people say ‘Yes,’ they are likely to go to heaven.

A great festival, Changunarayan Mahasnan, is celebrated every year. This year it was celebrated from Mangshir 16 to Marga Sukla Duwadashi. Except for maize, millet, buckwheat, and lentils, all grains are offered to deities during a week-long festival. Similarly, the head of the state offers sacred items to the deities.

# Legends: Changunarayan Temple

There are different myths regarding the [Changunarayan temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changu_Narayan_Temple). In ancient times, the **Changunarayan** area was covered with a dense forest of Champak (chapa) trees. Near that place, a **Brahmin named Sudarshan** used to live. He had many cows and had many employees to graze the cows. One day, he saw that his new lactating cow didn’t give milk, and he was suspicious of whether the cowherd had stolen milk. The next day, he followed his cowherd during the grazing time. He saw that the cowherd was sleeping and the cow was eating grass. In the meantime, he saw a small Black boy go near the cow and drink the milk directly from its udder. He was shocked and shouted at the boy. The boy just disappeared by hiding under the tree. From the voice of the master, the cowherd woke up and was surprised to see him.

The angered Brahmin cut off the boy’s head using the sword, and a miracle happened. The **Black Boy** was none other than four-armed Vishnu. Then the Brahmin realized that he had made a mistake and was going to cut off his head, and then Vishnu said, “During the time of ‘Devasurshanghram,’ a Brahmin named Sumati was fighting against me on behalf of the Asura, and I had to kill him. Since I killed a Brahmin, **Guru Sukracharya** cursed me for the incident. He said you will be free from the curse when the descendant of Sumati kills you. Since you have done your duty, it is not a crime; rather, you are a priest of mine.” Then Vishnu taught him to worship. Similarly, the priest has to do their duty even in their mourning periods.

# Narratives About Changunarayan Temple

The **sculpture of Narayan** is associated with a necklace, which is called ‘Satyanag.’ The god had hidden the **Nag in the Sundarjal**, but Garud wanted to find the Nag. The Nag came out of the lake, convincing his wife not to open where he had gone. Then Garud came and asked her about Nag. She didn’t say anything. Due to her behavior, Garuda was angry and told the Nag that she had eloped with another Nagin. After listening, she said the truth that he has changed himself into a human and has gone to see a ‘Jatra.’ He is a bit taller than the other person and has no shadow. Finally, **Garud found Nag**, and she ran away into the house, but her wife didn’t let him enter. Then he cursed him that she would weep all day, and Nag sat down on the neck of **Narayana**. (The above story is told by **Chakradharananda Rajopadhyaya**, a descendant of Sudarshan Brahmin.)

Another myth is regarding the demon Mur. This demon tried to destroy the **Nagarjun and Dolalghat hills**. Due to the fear of demons, people remembered God. So, Lord Vishnu sent Garuda to fight with the demon, but Garuda was defeated. Then Vishnu himself came, but neither Mur could defeat him, nor could he defeat Mur. So, Vishnu summoned [Lord Shiva](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shiva), and Shiva appeared. During the fight, Mur shook both the hills, and people were in panic. So, Shiva stood as a peg (Kila), due to which there is also a temple of Kileshwor Mahadev. The fight was going on, and [Lord Vishnu](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vishnu) invoked Mahamaya. Due to the severe penance, Lord Vishnu's head was severely damaged. As a result, Goddess Chinnamasta appeared and finally defeated Mur.

Thus, due to the residence of Narayana, it is called **Changunarayan**. Along with Narayan, the temples of **Kileshwar Mahadev and Goddess Chhinnamasta** also hold special importance. Many other statues of Ganesh, Shiva lingas, and various deities are found around the temple complex.

Near the Chhinnamasta temple, there is an unfinished stone statue of an elephant. There is a saying that when an architect was designing the stone, there was a sudden flow of blood from the stone, and he was terrified. Since this incident, no one has dared to touch the statue.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I personally feel that the way most interviews are conducted today is far from optimal and doesn't truly reflect a candidate’s real potential.

For example, candidates are often asked to respond to behavioral questions like “Tell me about a time you solved a problem,” usually expected in a STAR format. But how can interviewers be sure whether the story is real or just well-rehearsed? In many cases, the technical details are not even understood or evaluated properly by the interviewer, and I am not sure if hiring manager even understand it — especially if it's an HR or hiring manager without deep domain expertise.

Plus, interviews are high-stress, artificial situations. In real work settings, problem-solving happens over time — through collaboration, conversations, coffee chats, and back-and-forth discussion. Not in a one-shot rehearsed story.  It feels like we are prioritizing memory over substance, and disconnect from the real job task.

So I feel the current process often rewards performance under pressure, not genuine ability or long-term fit.

“What can I get for you?”

At first, it sounds genuine, right? Later I realized this was one of the darkest psychology tricks ever created.

The barista was trying to push her own agenda onto me by setting up the interaction as if she was giving me something, doing me a favor. This would make me indebted to her, and she can use this later as leverage against me.

That’s the thing about manipulation – It’s not always what you see in the movies, screaming, shouting, aggressive love bombing. Sometimes, it’s disguised as kindness. 

Of course, I began to yell “You sick monster,” to her and berate her for trying to manipulate the trained master of manipulation. She was no amateur herself, she began crying how she was only 17 to make me look like the bad guy. 

That’s the thing – narcissists will do everything in their power to make you seem like the bad guy. I was losing the psychological battle, other sheep in the coffee shop began looking at me with disgust. I had to leave before more damage was done to myself.

On the way out, I tripped on a chair and pulled a push door. This is another thing narcissists do, they make you let your guard down, making you vulnerable to embarrassing mistakes.

Let this be a reminder. Be careful – I hadn’t just survived the Starbucks encounter – I had survived society.

Plant Bistro - fancy with a fancy out of the way view. Interesting menu with fancy presentation. 

Sattvik - downtown Ubud. South Indian / Jain food.  we ordered pretty much one of each here and liked everything. Stand out were tandori, paneer and lentils. Online reviews are spotty but we loved it and went several times. Indian cuisine is an easy way to eat veg when traveling so I usually wait until I’ve tried everything else.

9 Angels - one of a kind near the monkey forest behind Monseur Spoon. Vibes for days, cafeteria style- menu changes with the wind. Serve yourself. Figure out what you owe and put the bills in a bottle. Wash your dishes. Leave enlightened. Ask about Sari Hati while you’re there. 

Bali Buda - downtown, clean and efficient. Loads of healthy and satisfying options. (Also serves meat)

Wild - downtown airy dining room with a nice menu. (Also serves meat now)

Usada -downtown. Auervedic. Cool dark airy shoeless dining room. Shoeless bathroom too so go before you go. Veggie takes on Indonesian cuisine.

We look at reviews and stuff and she’s like “the food here looks terrible haha.” And I agree, but later he says “we should go there and study or something” and I say “you asking me on a coffee date?” And then my friend says “maaaybe” and we laugh it off. My friend likes to use his computer camera as a mirror, and he needed to tell me something about how he thought he looked and they wanted to record my reaction, so they start recording. They talk, and then I don’t notice it’s still recording so I talk about how shitty I look on the camera and they just start immediately complimenting like, everything about me. After the video stops, we keep talking, and I notice she keeps looking down at my chest area a lot. Idk if she was looking at my shirt, since it had a band we both like on it, or if she was looking at my b00bs. They compliment me sometimes, and I always return the favor because they always look nice too. I don’t think I have feelings for this person, but I’d like to know if you guys think this is flirting or if I suck at social clues. Thank you guys 

TLDR?: friend is touchy with me, says we should get coffee at this local place, I say “you asking me out?” They say “maaaybe”, they look down at my chest a lot, we’re physically touchy bc that’s how we’ve always been, I’m confused about if this is flirting. ",0,1767926716.0,teenagers,1,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q7wa6a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7wa6a,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

1q7wa0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/storys/comments/1q7wa0i/what_had_you_completely_baffled/,What had you completely baffled?,"I been going to this popular Cafe for the last year cause it was just close to my school and we just moved from another city. Theres always this autistic teenager with his water and donut in the corner playing on his iPad, I'm pretty sure he's autistic anyway. One day I actually took notice no one ever talks to him he gets a few weird looks and thats the most anyone interacts with him so I took the initiative to go up to him and ask him if I can sit with him. Without hesitation he said sure so I say across from him. After about 2 minutes of just watching him I asked him if he lives around here just to make small talk he pointed to 3 different directions and mumbled 'down there' I then really looked him in the eyes and really tried starting a conversation with him and he put down his iPad and starts telling me about his video games he plays at home and just tells me random stuff about the activities his mother does but then he mentioned called of duty zombies which I abselutely love, now im really interested. I scoot up closer and ask him if he has two remotes we can play together and his face lit up and he started clapping. Just then a waitress came up to us and was like 'um excuse me sir i think you have to leave' I was so excited I thought nothing of it and told the kid to get up and lets play called of duty just then the waitress put her hand on the table looked me in the face and said 'he stays you leave' that's when I became confused like huh but we were going to play video games? She said 'this boy is mocked enough and we don't need your negativity here I know your not serious and you need to leave and stop harassing him and making fun of his autism' I was baffled like how is genuinely having a conversation with a autistic person automatically mocking them? I told her I was trying to make a friend and I wasn't trying to mock him but she didn't believe me ans threatened to call the police and told me I can come on days he's not here. I slowly got up and mumbled this was ridiculous and just left the autistic guy seemed as confused as i was that I just left him there. Weeks passed by and I would walk right past the Cafe not even wanting to look inside till one say I just went in and sat in my usual spot just ordered a regular coffee and was expecting the waitress to come out and accuse me of some non sense again but I didn't see her anywhere. I sat there for 20 minutes until she finally cake out of the back and she instantly recognized me and just gave me a dirty look as I was also staring her down this lady burst through the door and looks right at me. She looks at the waitress and points at me and starts mumbling then speeds towards me and grabs my arm and pulls me out of the Cafe. She said 'look I am that autistic man's mother, I'm aware of the incident that happened a few weeks ago and im sorry for that waitresses behavior. See she is very mean and she doesn't like my son and scares anyone off who tries to talk to him I already told my son not to come here because that waitress openly talks shit about him but he obviously doesn't understand I want you to come to my house to play games with my son he genuinely wanted to be your friend and play but after that lady told you to leave it upset him and he hasn't been back since.' We got in her car and she seemed so happy to be bringing me to her son we got into the house and her son was in the kitchen just sitting at the table. I softly said hello and he looked up slowly and his face lit up he ran towards me with open arms and we started playing video games. We now have play dates every week on called of duty and we became very close friends and his mother always has snacks ready for us same time every week Saturdays at noon. It was a bit hard to manage home work and such but it was totally worth it. A few weeks later we went back to the Cafe and made a formal complaint about the waitress turned out she had been driving customers away for the last year and business died down. She got fired and the place was packed again when word spread now me and him meet at that Cafe every week and walk to his house with our coffees to eat snacks and play video games",1,1767926461.0,storys,0,1.0,False

So here I am again, trying this year—who knows, right?

I’ve had my fair share of awkward dates, bad timing, and moments where the vibe just wasn’t vibing.
Sooo yes, I’m giving it another shot, hoping luck’s finally on my side this time 🍀 I’m dating seriously, with the intention of long-term 🥺

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- 5’2”
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉  I’ve lost 7kg so far… 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I don’t drink coffee often, but I like the taste. I don’t love this feeling though. It feels like I snorted cocaine. I think I will need to switch to decaf or some kind of combination. I definitely don’t usually feel this from Starbucks lattes which I’ll have from time to time. 

For a combo, should I just put the combined decaf/ regular beans in the grinder, or is there a better way. 

And finally, which coffee bean brands do you recommend, both decaf and non decaf. For someone like me, unrefined taste buds. 

I bought “stumptown coffee roasters” founders blend from Amazon. When I tasted just the espresso, the first thing I tasted was bitterness. I know the machine won’t be well calibrated on the first go so it might get better. It wasn’t terrible, like I didn’t want to spit it out. It was just exactly what I expected plain espresso to taste like, very strong coffee.

I’m the same with wine, I really can’t tell. Is there something I should be doing? To advance my taste buds or make the espresso taste like how people talk about it tasting? Notes of berry and chocolate and vanilla and orange etc. ",1,1767926205.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1q7w5zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1q7w5zi/1_month_in_suresmile/,1 Month In (SureSmile),"I utilized this community a lot before pulling the trigger on getting invisalign (or in my dentist's case, SureSmile). I wanted to share a couple of things I've found/info I gathered because I appreciated everyone's insights. 

Some context for me: 35F, mild-moderate crowding on my bottom teeth, and a slight crowd on my top. Nothing was super bad or noticeable, but I feel like one day last year I saw my bottom teeth and couldn't unsee it. 

I will own that this is 100% superficial, but teeth move. I had braces for a year as a kid, and wore a retainer for a long time, and they still moved. I am in a position where I can afford this, and my dentist felt/feels confident in my case, so I am excited to do this. I didn't feel bad about my smile before, but I am excited to feel super confident in it for the rest of my life. 

Some notes:   
1. I know there is a ton of discourse around going to a dentist vs. orthodontist. This is totally valid. When I brought it up to my dentist/their office, they were clear that if they felt that my teeth needed to be reviewed by an orthodontist, they would send me to one. I also conferred with my friend's husband who is a dentist, who said the same thing. It doesn't help a dentist's practice to be shady about that (although I'm sure some people have had experiences like that). 

2. I was really nervous about how visible the attachments are, and having a lisp. I am lucky in that I don't have attachments on my very front teeth (although you can still see them). These are definitely nit invisible, but it's really not as bad as I thought they were going to be.  A lot of my friends/coworkers said they wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't pointed it out (probably being nice, but I do think they aren't as bad as I built it up). There was definitely an adjustment with speaking. I think at the beginning/end of the aligner cycle, there's a more noticeable lisp, but it's really not that bad.

I think the biggest thing that helped was that a day or so after I got them, I spent a day with other people talking (I was doing a volunteer event with people I didn't know), and it was really good practice to just be like, this is how I sound/look right now, not a big deal. 

  
3. I miss being able to snack over time and sip drinks throughout the morning. Not the end of the world, I wasn't a big coffee person before, but I am not going to waste my time without them in on just a beverage (or at least one that's not a margarita). 

  
4. It can be a little annoying to have to brush your teeth after eating, especially while out. I got a little bag to carry my aligners/toothbrush in that makes it a little easier. I can usually put the container in my pocket if I really need to (damn women's' pants pockets though), but I just take it with me. Maybe people think I'm just perpetually on my period, who knows. 

5. I know the timeline we're given is not set in stone. I was really hung up at first at how long it was going to take (\~7-8 months initially (if no revisions), and then 6-8 months with retainer after). BUT. I'm coming to the realization that I'm doing this for me. I already regret not having done this sooner, and there's literally nothing I can do to speed up this process (I have no interest in veneers). Also. The time is going to pass anyway. 

  
Anyway--long story short, it's not as bad as I built it up to be--and while it is annoying, I'm very glad I'm doing it :)",0,1767926164.0,Invisalign,0,0.5,False

When the first nanny we found could no longer work for us(had to step up and take custody of her younger siblings) we were very sad but decided to go through an agency to find the replacement. My husband and I both work demanding jobs and a nanny fit our needs the best. At first I was impressed by the work of the agency. But some of the candidates were not as professional or didn’t watch the children that closely on our trial days (came home to find an entire roll of toilet paper in the toilet unwound and marker all over the wall and coffee table and she had no idea…kid isn’t potty trained yet and needs help in bathroom… etc). We finally found a nanny we thought we liked. Was never on her phone, did a ton of educational activities for the kids, and was always punctual. We decided to go with her and did the whole contract process with finding a service to pay her through a W2. The first week was going great. She put some knives in the dishwasher and we asked her not to do that again but otherwise was amazing and did everything we were looking for. She worked a total of four days and after the weekend sent us an email quitting effective immediately and asking for the pay we owed her. I’m at a total loss. I thought someone died or family circumstances came up that she had to deal with. I emailed her back for clarity and feedback to see if there was something that she didn’t like. Her response was contradictory- she appreciated the freedom we gave her in caring for the kids and deciding the schedule but felt that we micromanaged her too much. 

After that, I lost all respect for her. I feel that all she needed to do was have a conversation about her feelings and we would have come to an arrangement that made her more comfortable. I am completely flabbergasted at the feeling of being micromanaged (we are pretty laid back according to all the previous 4 Nannie’s we’ve worked with). I cannot believe that someone in their thirties would act this way after spending so much time prior getting the job set up.

I don’t know how I feel about the agency either. We set up a fill in nanny for Wednesday (on Monday) this week and my husband and I filled in the other days. Wednesday morning comes around and the fill in nanny cancels on us-changing calendar notification from accepted to declined, doesn’t answer her phone when called. The agency immediately reached out and said this nanny has never done that before and they are so sorry all of this is happening to us. 

I’m grateful for all the fill in Nannie’s the agency has been able to supply but Lordy I’m giving up. We started calling around to find a different daycare to put the youngest into (the oldest goes to one that has no availability for another). I paid the finders fee $$$$ the week before the nanny quit. I clarified with the agency that it will be transferred to the next but I kind of want to ask for half back and keep utilizing the agency for fill in Nannies as needed over the next six months. 

I feel very emotional about the whole thing and would love to hear from everyone about what you think or if you have any advice. Part of me wants to email the nanny back and give advice about being professional but I wouldn’t be able to do it in a constructive way just yet.",2,1767926032.0,Nanny,10,0.63,False

1q7w2yf,https://i.redd.it/w5282qk6i8cg1.jpeg,"NFC/RFID Smart Ring: Constraints, Security, and Real-World Viability -- Seeking Hardware Perspective","Hey r/IOT ,👋

I’m exploring the technical feasibility of a smart ring as a low-friction, always-on interface for payments, access control, transit, and lightweight identity use cases -- and I’m looking to sanity-check the idea with people who’ve actually built things at the hardware/firmware layer.

**Core questions I’m digging into:**

* NFC vs passive/active RFID in ultra-constrained form factors
* Secure element choices and threat models for payment & access use cases
* Power strategy tradeoffs (fully passive vs energy-assisted vs active)
* Antenna design challenges in proxy resin, or metal-adjacent, curved, skin-contact environments
* Manufacturing realities at small scale → DFM, yields, durability
* What *breaks first* in real-world wear (water, impact, heat, EM interference)

**Target interaction model (high level):**

* Tap-to-pay (where permitted by ecosystem constraints)
* Tap-to-unlock doors / access systems
* Tap-in for public transport
* Single-link identity or contact exchange

I’m intentionally focused on doing fewer things well, rather than building a feature-heavy wearable.

My background is in data, finance, and business operations, and I’ve worked closely with technical teams but don’t pretend to be the hardware expert here.... ... that’s why I’m reaching out. 

I’m well connected in the Midwest startup ecosystem and exploring a smart ring with NFC/RFID capabilities business seriously, but right now my priority is deep technical validation and honest feedback.

If you’ve worked on:

* Embedded systems / firmware
* Secure hardware
* Wearables or constrained IoT devices
* NFC / RFID in non-ideal environments

1q7w2w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1q7w2w5/my_mother_is_dying_and_i_cant_save_her/,My mother is dying and I can't save her,"My mother is slowly dying in front of me and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. She’s chronically ill and disabled, with a slew of medical problems. To list a few, she had a brain tumor in her teenage years which has affected her severely in the latter years of her life, she’s a type 2 diabetic, she had a stroke a few years ago, suffers from seizures, has memory issues, and a fuck ton of other problems. 

Most of her problems stem from the tumor, but in general she’s incredibly weak and tired all the time. 

  
She often forgets to take her meds, which is incredibly dangerous because she is on a boat load of pills. I am trying to advocate for someone too look over her medication list because i have a hunch she might be overmedicated. But either way, she has meds that keep her alive, and sometimes she doesn’t take them. Which is incredibly risky.

  
She also doesn’t eat properly. Which could be because of the meds, or because she isn’t hungry because she literally doesn’t move all day. But she isn’t getting enough nutrition or calories and that’s also dangerous.

  
She often forgets my name, among other things. My maternal grandmother developed Alzheimer’s before she died. I saw what that evil disease turned my Nana into. I honestly hope my mom dies before her mind goes completely. It sounds morbid, but anyone that’s seen a late stage Alzheimer’s or Dementia case knows it’s brutally painful to witness.

Currently my mother is in the hospital because there’s a freaky flu going around my area and it’s kicking people’s asses. My mother caught it, and she had to go to the ER a couple nights ago because it made her incredibly ill.

 I’ve seen my mother carted off in an ambulance many times. The worst was probably about 3 years ago. We had gotten into a fight because I had checked her pill box and she hadn’t taken her AM meds. She also had only eaten a Nutella sandwhich and drank coffee all day and it was nearly 1pm.

After our fight, she went on a walk alone in the summer heat without water. I am not sure how far she went or how long she walked. All I know is I came out of the shower to my sister begging for help because my mom was collapsing in her arms, spitting up brown bile. She was covered in grass, so we assume she also fell in the front lawn before collapsing in the kitchen.

That was the first time I had to call 911 for my mom. She was barely coherent, and I remember looking at the paramedics and sobbing, pleading “Please don’t let my mommy die.” She was ok in the end, doctors assumed it was heat stroke and dehyration that caused a small seizure.

For a few terrifying minutes I thought I had killed her that day. I thought that our fight was going to be the last conversation we’d ever have. Everyone in my life tells me that’s an unfair thing to think that. And it probably is. 

That day plays over in my mind often.

My mother was carted out in a stretcher apologizing profusely. She promised me and my siblings that she’d get herself together and that it wouldn’t happen again.

But it did. Over and over and over. At least a dozen times in the past 3 years my mother has collapsed or needed to be taken to the hospital.

Sometimes it isn’t her fault. Like the other night when she got the flu. But sometimes it is.

One time she called me while I was at work, delirious and stuttering, asking if I could pick her up. I was confused and tried to get answers from her, but she changed her mind, told she was fine, and hung up. I came home from work to a text from my father telling me she was in the ER. She had tried to walk to a Wegman’s about 2 miles from my house. Which to most people, it’s that bad of a distance. But to a disabled woman who probably didn’t eat anything besides coffee for breakfast, that’s a terrible idea. Especially alone.

She had collapsed at Wegman’s and a kind stranger called an ambulance for her.

Nothing is working. We’re trying to get her mental health treatment, but my father can’t sit in her therapy sessions to make sure she tells the truth. Because my mother also likes to lie to doctors, my father goes to most of her appointments.

She lies to me to. And my dad. Often.

She’s probably going to die before I turn 30. That terrifies and enrages me.

I cycle between unbearable grief, saddness, and anger. I have cried to my father, my therapist, my boyfriend, and my mother about my fears. Sometimes I cry so hard my nose bleeds.

Sometimes I hate my mom for this. And that also feels unfair. But none of this is fair. Life isn’t fair, right?

I hate my mother. But I also love her more than anything. She wasn’t always like this. She used to have a personality. She loved to paint and sing along to country music in the car. She enjoyed going on long walks with my Nana and rewatching episodes of The Facts of Life. She helped me with my elementary school projects and she went to every sports game and band performance.

She’s my mom. But she’s also a stranger.

I’m jealous of other people’s moms. I’m jealous of the girls that get to go on Mommy-Daughter dates. I’m jealous of my boyfriend’s mom, a wonderful woman who has to much energy for life. I’m jealous of my cousins when they post selfies with my aunts. I’m even jealous of my friend who gets into screaming matches with her mom.

I miss my momma so much it hurts. And she sleeps in the room next to mine. I check her bedroom every night to watch her chest rise and fall. 

I wish things were different but they aren’t. I try to go on walks with her and make her food. I try to help. But I’m also a college kid with a million things on my plate. And I’m also struggling.

I wish I was 12 years old again, falling asleep next to her on the couch. I wish my mom wasn’t dying.

2. I need communication. If you don't like something, if you're busy, anything like that, I need you to tell me, I'd hold the same standard for myself. You need me to write more? You tell me. I need you to write more? I tell you. I understand people are busy and have lives, and I hope you understand the same. While I may ask when you'll respond, it's more out of genuine interest, not pushiness. I'm fine waiting hours, days, weeks, or even months, as long as I'm told.

3. I'm picky with writing styles, I will say this now. I also am a fan of OOC chat, about our OCS, about our lives, and so on. If you have questions, ask them! Don't be afraid to ask me things, or for clarification, I'm not going to bite your head off for it <3

4. I'm a freelance artist. That being said, I can draw both OCs, as concept and such, if needed, if you're like me and like making new OCs for RPs. That being said, again, this is NOT a promise they'll be drawn, this is a flat-out MAYBE.

I have an 8 week old golden retriever pup & want to get off on the right foot with her so i consulted a local trainer who was happy to take us on to help me navigate puppy stages.

We just had our first session today for “exposure” and “socialization” since shes in the critical windows. It consisted of us going to a local shop, trainer setting a 10 min timer, ordering coffee & taking tons of photos and videos for their socials and then after 10 min was over. Done. Session was called - we go our separate ways.

The trainer is now messaging me demanding I pay them $100 for their “training” even though all they did was meet me at the shop, order a coffee, get content for their page and then left. No constructive feedback. No coaching on how to build her confidence, positive exposure, or engagement.

I never signed a training contract with this trainer - and now after today I feel really ripped off and insecure about it.

To shake off some nerves I went to our local canine shop with her afterwards & had an amazing and constructive conversation with the trainer there about doing early scent and neurological stimulating as well as recognizing her thresholds and how to create positive associations with things. A whole lot more than our “trainer” from this morning went over. I spent over 30 min talking to him and having him freely coach me on how to handle and introduce things to her.

1q7vrf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q7vrf1/trigger_warning_suicide_getting_things_out/,*Trigger Warning -Suicide - Getting Things Out,"I just needed to get some things off my chest, and I have realized that I lost my ability to journal and write down my feelings long ago. I used to write poetry, notes, write songs, etc, but I really can't even bring myself to write anything down anymore.



Trigger warning: this is about suicide.



So it goes without saying that this was a really tough loss (my brother-in-law). I have so many strong feelings about this loss. 



What I wanted to say is that at the end of October, I actually had a night where I was extremely suicidal and was having thoughts of wanting to buy a gun. I fully thought out how easy it would be for me to get one. I went into full-on detail in my head, and I was kind of set on doing just that.



The next day, I left work in the middle of the day. No one checks on me (and they didn't that day either), but that is completely unlike me because I would still know deep down that the moment I leave work someone WILL check on me, so the fact that I just up and left says a lot.



There is a local group here that I have looked into several times, but I have always just kept it in my mind and never taken action. I drove myself to said group (a drop-in peer support place) because I was terrified about the way I was feeling and what I was thinking of doing. I have only had that thought one other time in my life, and I actually reached out to a therapist the day after I felt that way because it scared me so much, so this was another scary moment that I took action on.



Anyway, the drop-in wasn't quite what I thought it would be, but I managed to sit across from a dude I had never met and spill out my feelings to him, and he actually doesn't suffer from depression; he is a recovered addict, but it was comforting to do it and hear his stories as well.



My husband didn't know any of this, and I waited several weeks to even tell him.



Fast forward to November, and my husband and I stopped so I could get a coffee, and I ended up telling him in the car how I had all of these thoughts about how I constantly see people say (mainly on the CPTSD and Depression Reddit forums because I don't have social  media otherwise), ""This (insert the thing here) completely changed my life."" And I said how I see that all the time, but yet, I have tried all of these things, and I couldn't help but wonder, okay, so what about the people that never find the thing that changes their life and helps them, and it dawned on me that those are the people that commit suicide. And I sobbed to him over my coffee about how that scares me.



Fast forward to TWO days before Matt took his life.  I was in a DARK place. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I cried to my husband and just told him that I didn't want to be here anymore (something I have said on many days, but I was more of a wreck than normal on this day). It was a REALLY bad day for me. Like, really fucking bad.



Then two days later, this happened. 



Then, I just spent 8 days around a bunch of people (because I flew out with my husband to be with his family) that have no idea whatsoever what it is like to suffer from debilitating depression. Not the kind where you get depressed every now and then, but the kind where you wake up every single day wishing you did not exist. Wishing you were not here.



The CONSTANT talk of, ""If he only knew how many people loved him!"" ""Look how many people loved him!"" ""Just look at the outpouring of people that wrote on his Facebook page!"" ""We all get depressed, why this?""



Please do not get me wrong. I thank GOD that MOST people do not have any idea what this feels like, but it was EXTREMELY difficult to sit amongst all of these people and their words, and I broke down several times in front of his close family.



As an example (and this is just one, unfortunately, I broke down and said shit I probably never should have multiple times):



(Step-mom): ""He looked so happy in all his photos recently!""



(Me): ""..., let me ask you, did I look happy in all the Vegas photos? Yes? Well, did you know that I was thinking about buying a gun not even a week before those were taken?""



I KNOW that was not helpful to people - the moments I broke down and divulged that I suffer in the same way - but dammit if I didn't feel this strong need to speak up for mental illness and honor Matt in that way. And also, in a very selfish way, I needed people to hear that from me directly should my life ever come to the same conclusion. 



We ended up finding journals of his that he wrote between the ages of 14-19, and it was as if I wrote them myself. Even before the Navy, he struggled with this. He was tortured.



I read back through text messages that were just between him and me (because we were in a LOT of group messages also), but the majority of our messages were us talking about our mental health to one another. 



I haven't even made it past a few of these exchanges (yet) because it broke me down, but in one of them I asked him ""....what is the point of all of this? I feel like I am just going through the motions, I have no purpose..."" and he said a lot of stuff about the purpose part, but then he said, ""...and to answer your question about why? Because you have family that loves the shit out of you. Do whatever it takes. If it's not the right therapist, keep trying until you find the right one. Not the right meds? Keep trying new ones."" 



Like, he was saying this to ME, and what is funny is that the family part is only my husband's family. I am estranged from my family, and all I can think is how I sit here and beat myself up because I have no relationships, but this guy, this guy had nothing but relationships. That didn't matter, and deep down, I know it wouldn't matter for me either. It's a disease. It isn't cured by having more people to talk to or hang out with. 



And I think the point of me saying all of this is that losing Matt broke my heart on so many levels, but a big part of it, selfishly, is that it scares the shit out of me that if this could happen with him, it could most certainly happen with me.



I carry guilt because I think, if I had just done this first, maybe he wouldn't have, and I could have spared this LARGE group of family and friends so much grief because, while I know people would care that I died, it wouldn't be even as close to as many, and it may have saved his life the same way that his suicide may have saved mine for the time being.



I also carry the guilt of realizing how often he and I communicated with each other, and it stopped around the time that he got with his girl. He also used to come to visit us twice a year, but he hadn't been out here since he started dating her, and I realized that I allowed our communication to go stagnant, and I feel guilty for not checking in more often. I know all too well that it wouldn't have changed anything, but it may have saved me from this guilt I am feeling. Again, selfish things, but things nonetheless that I am feeling deeply.



Anyway, I don't know why, but I just needed to get that out to people outside of his family because God knows, I just bombed all of that on them multiple times throughout my stay.



Thank you for listening.

I confessed my feelings as she asked me upfront about my feelings.

We were laughing and talking a lot.

After coming back I replied it was nice catching up so… and she said she doesn’t reciprocate any feelings other than friendship. 

I really hoped we could get to know each other more and then see what happens but now that door is closed.

Well now that I got clear answer my anxiety went away,  little disappointed though.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I have a question about the protein drinks that Starbucks is making. I have been through three stores and each one of them has said something different, and one of them said “Honestly we don’t know what we are doing with this stuff”
So my husband likes the Protein Banana Matcha. He gets it with almond milk which is okay because according to the partners there the protein is in the cold foam. He asked if there was a non-dairy cold foam and they said yes, that it was made with a non-dairy protein milk mixture so he ordered that. I ordered the same thing. At the next location they said there isn’t a way to do the Banana Matcha Non-Dairy because it is made with a premixed Protein Milk with 2%. At the Third Location I asked if it was possible to get a Coffee Frappuccino with the Protein Milk and they said no, but they could put Protein powder directly in the Frappe with Almond milk. They did put the protein powder in and it was delicious, but they said they didn’t know if other stores would do it. They weren’t really sure how the protein recipes worked. All in All we are severely confused. We like the option to add  protein to things, but have no idea what we can order. It has been super confusing. Is there a Non-Dairy option? Can it be blended?",5,1767924810.0,starbucks,19,0.86,False

Hi everyone, so for past two weeks I was talking to my childhood crush. Whom I really thought could be the one.

I confessed my feelings as she asked me upfront about my feelings.

She said will go for a harmless coffee with some conditions of being honest, and no expectations.

We were laughing and talking a lot.

After coming back I replied it was nice catching up so… and she said she doesn’t reciprocate any feelings other than friendship. 

I really hoped we could get to know each other more and then see what happens but now that door is closed.

Well now that I got clear answer my anxiety went away,  little disappointed though.

1q7vlyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1q7vlyh/my_journey_with_lexamlexapro/,my journey with Lexam/lexapro,"A bit about myself, I was self-medicating with weed. Yes, the whole ""self-medication."" blah blah it's not about you, this is about me. I suffer from general anxiety and probably a little bit of OCD. I would smoke, so I would just forget that I had these issues and other personal trauma. For 12 years, every single day without fail, I would have a smoke.

It got to the point where the weed wasn't helping me anymore and exacerbating my anxiety. I was actually getting worse, because I was smoking bush weed, then got onto some stronger stuff, if you're from Australia you will understand what I'm talking about. I couldnt do this anymore I swear. I was going into a drug induced pychosis, mind you, I have had plenty of hard stuff when I was younger. My mind and body couldnt't handle it anymore. I wanted to quit so bad, but I knew that I would struggle for so long.

I have quit before, but I kinda got addicted to alcohol and OTC sleeping drugs. I didn't want to do the same thing.

I went to the Dr in a state of despair and demanded that I get onto Lexam I needed something to help me with my problems. I also went and saw a psychologist to give me exercises to help with my anxiety and trauma.

So here I am, dealing with my problems, taking Lexa, and going through withdrawals. I can tell you right now it was the toughest 2 weeks of my life. My initial dosage was half a tablet for the first week then take a full one after 7 days.

1st week, restless sleep, feeling so fricken tired I could just fall asleep on my feet, come night time it was a different story, i couldnt sleep at all. I have taken Lexam in the morning, thought this would help with my anxiety when I go to work, it was very very rough, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and ears, and any physical exertion I couldn't breathe properly it felt like I was having a heart attack. I spoke to my boss, and he gave me 1 week's mental health leave.

I came to this very forum seeking advice from other people and, people say to take it at night time, so by the 3rd day I transitioned into night time, this didnt help at all, it was the worse sleep of my life, there is a 5 hour release window the serrotonin goes into your system, those 5 hours trying to sleep was the worse ive ever experienced, tossing and turning and always checking the time to see how much time I had left till morning. I kept persevering, though. It got slightly better by day 5 I had a couple of hours sleep ( so this is interesting I would have a crap sleep, but I'd wake up refreshed and not tired the next morning ). Day 7, this is when I started taking 10mg, nothing really changed, I was lucky enough I didn't have to work.

Finally, when I went to work I was still taking them at night time. I would take them about 5-6 PM so i didnt have to feel my anxiety when I got home. Lexam instead of making me tired, it amped me up like I just snorted a line of the good stuff. I couldnt do this anymore, it was messing with my sleep schedule. So I decided to take them first thing in the morning again.

Now this is really weird I searched all through the forums, and I couldn't find anything about why I'm feeling so ""high"". It wasn't a high; it was just because I felt so good. This only really lasted 2 days max. My sleeping went back to normal after 2 weeks. I was having some really good REM sleep, I was having night sweats, just the usual withdrawal symptoms.

6 months down the track i'm back to my normal self. I still get anxiety, but I can squash it pretty quickly with some meditation.

This is the best I've felt since I was 16 years old. I'm turning 36 this year, so you can fill in the rest.

TLDR: just keep pushing through after the 2 weeks, it gets so much better, my main side effect im always tired, but id rather be tired than have anxiety. My tiredness is a lot better now. I find that if you keep busy, you don't really notice it until you stop to rest. I only have 1 coffee in the morning, and I try not to nap during the day as it messes with my sleep.

Just keep pushing through it; it gets so much better. Each and everyone experences things differently; some might take a month, some might take 2 weeks, but once you push through, life is so much better. The thoughts disapear the overthinking becomes nothing, and anxiety is nearly non-existent.",6,1767924702.0,lexapro,1,1.0,False

I am trying to leave before they let me go, either way, I intend to write an email to our Chief HR Officer once I’ve exited. I have been excluded from meetings/trips/coffee with my team, isolated, information not shared that is critical to me, other peers pitted against me by the manager, shown the double standard and rules only apply to me, told my qualifications are worthless and that I’m lazy, access to systems and resources not given to me whilst others have them, reprimanded in front of my team without having the full context, my bonus has been likely taken away from me soon, and my work derailed. Asked why I am smiling???? Goals I had were taken away from me and work shifted to others. I would’ve let it go but I feel someone should know my story as it’s derailed my whole life. 

The only person who is worth sending an email to is the CHRO. The HRBP, SVP of HR, my managers global boss, won’t be enough to really convey how poorly I’ve been treated nor move any needle taking a real look and documenting this for future. Pretty much everyone who resigned in the recent told me it was partly or all because of the environment and urged me to leave. 

I won’t ever come back to this employer unless the management was changed but even then, likely not. My concern is that I am the only person with the guts to go over my managers head by 3.

1q7vger,https://i.redd.it/9o9n54a6e8cg1.png,Expenses: The Costs of Generating Revenue,"**EXPENSES**

**Definition:** Expenses are the costs your business incurs to generate revenue. Every dollar spent on salaries, rent, raw materials, marketing, utilities, insurance, and supplies counts as an expense. These costs appear on your P&L statement and get subtracted from revenue to calculate profit.

**Formula:** Net Profit = Revenue - Total Expenses

Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100

**Why It Matters:** Understanding and controlling expenses determines whether your business thrives or fails. A company generating $500,000 revenue with $350,000 in expenses produces $150,000 net profit (30% margin). The same revenue with $450,000 in expenses yields only $50,000 profit (10% margin). Missing $50,000 in expense tracking creates 25% profit overstatement, leading to disastrous decisions based on false profitability data. Accurate expense tracking also maximizes tax deductions (every legitimate business expense reduces taxable income at 25% rate, saving $25,000 in taxes per $100,000 in properly documented expenses).

**Real Examples:**

1. **Coffee Shop Chain:** Generates $36 billion annual revenue with $32.6 billion in total expenses, producing $3.4 billion net income (9.4% profit margin). Major expense categories include $15.2 billion cost of sales (coffee, milk, cups, food), $12.9 billion store operating expenses (wages, rent, utilities for 36,000 locations), $1.8 billion other operating expenses (marketing, corporate overhead), $1.5 billion depreciation, $500 million interest expense, and $700 million taxes.
2. **Retail Store:** Starts month with $50,000 inventory, purchases $200,000 additional goods, ends with $80,000 inventory. COGS calculation: $50K + $200K - $80K = $170,000 (cost of inventory sold). Generates $500,000 revenue producing $200,000 gross profit (40% gross margin). After $120,000 operating expenses (rent, salaries, utilities, marketing), net profit reaches $80,000 (16% net margin).
3. **Manufacturing Company:** Records $5,000 monthly rent expense by debiting rent expense $5,000 and crediting cash $5,000. Receives $2,000 utility bill (not yet paid), recording debit utility expense $2,000 and credit accounts payable $2,000. Buys $100,000 equipment, debiting equipment asset $100,000 and crediting cash $100,000 (not immediate expense, depreciates $10,000 annually over 10-year useful life).

**How to Calculate/Apply:**

* **Record when incurred under accrual accounting:** Follow the matching principle by recording expenses in the same period as the revenue they helped generate, regardless of payment timing. December rent paid in November still records as December expense when you use the space. Employees working the last week of December but paid January 5 create December wage expense through accrual entry.
* **Categorize by expense type:** Use detailed chart of accounts separating COGS (direct production costs), operating expenses (SG&A, R&D), non-operating expenses (interest, asset sale losses), and tax expense. Retailers track wholesale merchandise cost separately from store operating costs. Manufacturers separate raw materials, direct labor, and factory overhead from office expenses.
* **Review and analyze monthly:** Compare expenses to revenue calculating profit margins. Analyze trends across periods identifying cost increases requiring action. Marketing spending $15,000 monthly generating 100 customers costs $150 per acquisition. Reduce to $10,000 monthly maintaining 95 customers drops cost per acquisition to $105, saving $60,000 annually while barely impacting results.

**Red Flags:**

* Mixing cash basis and accrual basis accounting (creates dramatic timing differences making December results unreliable when wages earned get paid in January)
* Treating capital expenditures as immediate expenses (buying $500,000 equipment and expensing immediately understates profit by $450,000 in year one instead of depreciating $50,000 annually over 10 years)
* Miscategorizing expenses regularly (recording office supplies as marketing expense inflates marketing costs while understating office expenses, making reports misleading across hundreds of transactions)
* Ignoring non-cash expenses in cash flow analysis ($500,000 net income with $200,000 depreciation produces approximately $700,000 operating cash flow, but P&L alone misses this distinction)

\~ Words Afloat \~

Choosing words that fit a situation is what the world is all about, like say for example, during a hospital visit you have to sound caring and avoid any harsh sounding opinions, like stating the fact you being here was never a surprise considering how u had lived without a care about your body, refusing to exercise, eating garbage and so on and on.

During funerals there is an added factor, you have to look sad, if you don’t look sad, morose and depressed, everyone watching you would label you an unfeeling psychopath, which brings me to the situation right now. The man in the wooden box is a total stranger, distant family, never heard his name till today. Dad and Mom were talking to the extended family and Jessie was trying hard to not look bored or indifferent to the situation, in case that would hurt her family, her Dad was a man of respect, mentioned a lot but she never knew what that meant, but there was the general idea that he lived in a way that like as she was doing now, he chose his words carefully, made choices carefully, and in doing so, he was always viewed as an upright and kind person.

The situation she was in was proof of that, even if the man who died was just a stranger to them, the tiny little fact that they shared blood somewhere along the way made Dad feel like he was obligated to be here to see the lifeless body of that person be lowered off into that hole in the ground.

Jessie wondered at that moment, compared to them, her parents, she felt a little bit different, ok the situation was sad and as a family they were doing something nice by being here, but if that invitation came to her, and specifically to her, she would have forgotten and moved on with her life, but still Jessie knew that if she had remembered, she would have come, even if he was in the end a stranger, some parts of her choices are the same but it was in essence the concentration and drive to emulate her parents were a bit low. The upbringing was righteous and wholesomely loving, her views are differing on the fact that she had grown in a different world from them, and she was from a generation that always felt tired and cheated, and it fades into everything, these feelings of misanthropy.

She looked up from her thoughts and saw her Dad frowning next to the casket, he went back to his conversation with another stranger and she got up thinking it was a good enough time to be on her way, she was already late for work. After saying a quick goodbye to her Mom Jessie asked her Mom she tell Dad of the early departure, Jessie knew him well and right now he had some opinions on her behavior loaded into his throat.

\#

Out the gate she hugged the coat tight and shivered, the cold was nearly here, snow and ice, which meant she could no longer bike to work from her apartment for sometime starting this week, Jessie raised her hand and waited for a taxi to notice.

She was now in her late twenties, single, not because she couldn’t find a man or was unattractive, if Jessie had to give herself a ranking out of ten, she would be a seven. Skin wasn’t white went to more of a very light tan brown that was only noticeable when people came close, which she heard a lot, hair was abundantly curly and came down in spiraling springs, and she was short at exactly five foot but had curves and some rude people might say that Jessie was a bit on the pudgy side, something she sometimes reluctantly agreed to.

Her arm felt heavy and she stood there annoyed and pouting before starting her walk along the cemetery walls in the direction of her area of the town, not that she was planning to walk the whole way, that would be a pain and also a lot of walking.

A few cars sped past her but still no sign of one taxi, she crossed the road at the end and was walking along scanning the areas she was moving past for interesting views, cats, birds, people who looked curious until Jessie noticed someone, interesting.

She was at a waist high fence and from it the ground angled down to the train tracks, from where she was about fifty or so feet away was a tunnel with a pedestrian bridge over it, and someone was climbing down, looked like a homeless person. Jessie got her phone out of her pocket, sent a quick message to her boss Noot and when he replied ok to her being late, she placed the phone back in her pocket and watched the homeless person climb all the way down and stand in the middle of the tracks, then he or she sat down.

Jessie had heard of this, and felt something claw at the back of her throat, it was a little bit of sadness, a little bit of pity, and to top that off a little bit of heartache, and with all three combined Jessie felt the decency she was taught by her parents light up and wash away all the thoughts she had at the funeral, doesn’t cost anything to be nice, and even a presence can make someone happy, that person on the tracks probably has no one to help and now was at the point of having given up.

Jessie got one leg over the fence and sat on it, the thing was that she was small, and a woman, the world is cruel to people like them and sometimes they lash out randomly, but fortunately for Jessie because of her overprotective Dad she always had a steady supply of pepper spray bottles in her purse and she grabbed it for strength and went over.

She approached slowly and carefully and remembered that notice she gave her boss instinctively when her mind had pieced the situation together, Jessie had already made that decision to come over and as like always common sense and self preservation kicked in way later, she was known to be stupidly spontaneous like that.

‘HEY!’ Jessie shouted at a good enough distance in which she can run away.

He twisted around startled and his hood went back over his face, a man in his forties, blind in one eye as shown by a silver and fading pupil, light brown and working eye as the next, and he probably had a disease like diabetes or something rarer, as parts of his skin had wrinkled and yellowed over, in other parts they were going a brutish green fading to black and after that the flesh had dissolved to show bone on his face and scalp, there was even a small hole in his chin showing a hint of his lower teeth, it was a grotesque sight.

‘I understand completely, carry on’ Jessie turned around and started fast shuffling almost at a run back to the fence when he called over.

‘I am not ma’am, waiting to catch a ride’ There was a slur in his voice, dejection and weary tiredness, but also a slight hint of chipper annoyance, probably at her for thinking he was trying to end his life, she turned around to see he was still sitting on one of the rails.

‘I was just surprised, sorry if I came off as rude, have a nice day… guy’

‘Edgar, it… was nice that you came, don’t change… lady’ He turned around and kept his hand on the rail.

‘Um… thank you? bye’ Jessie shuffled off faster towards the fence, jumped over, he was still sitting, wasn’t interested in her, a man on a mission, so that would mean he would be jumping on to a moving train, something Jessie knew she could never do, so even with how he looked like, a zombie, the guy must be pretty athletic.

Jessie actually loved the snowy season and always headed out an hour early in the morning, walking on fresh snow, the views, the biting cold, she looked forward to it every year, and more so the fact that with the world in its cold phase, getting warmer felt like bliss spreading all over her skin.

When she arrived for her early morning shift, Jessie placed her hair in a bun, got the hairnet on, put on the overalls then the apron and walked into the kitchen where Noot was already prepping batches of bread.

‘It was by chance’ Noot spotted her and smiled and went back to work kneading. ‘She had come in wanting refuge from a storm’

Jessie stood next to him waiting for him to guide her, she was the kitchen hand and her job was helping him by doing small tasks, like peeling, cutting, moving ingredients and anything else he asked her to do. He pointed at a few things and she went to work, it was almost the same routine in the morning every day.

‘And then she saw him standing at the counter, muscles gleaming, head balding, dripped out in a form fit apron, oh, such handsomeness’ He prodded her with his elbow and pointed at the oven, a batch was ready to come out.

‘And the maiden made a vow, to become a regular and one day ask this hulking gentle giant to reciporc. . . Recipo?’

‘Reciprocate’ Noot spoke out and grunted as he flipped over a giant ball of dough.

‘To reciprocate her feelings, oh, how in love she was, and how kind he was’ Jessie grabbed his forearm and he stopped and looked down at her, a smirk forming but he was fighting hard to keep a serious face. ‘Alas he was already spoken for, as a beautiful angel stood next to him, day by day unyielding in her love, and this angel was short, yet glamorous and sleek’

‘Sleek?’ a little laugh bust out of him.

‘She was elegant and a vision, and that girl knew she had lost’ Jessie sat down on a small barrel in the kitchen and watched him work, he seemed to have a lighter mood now, light and fun banter was a thing she did for Noot sometimes, when he had this dark and tired of life looking mask on the morning.

‘I asked her out’ Noot blurted out before she continued.

‘WHAT?’ Jessie found herself laughing. ‘You were saying like, I am never, its not like that, never gonna, what happened?’

‘She kept trying and trying Jess, and I, it was kinda sad, so I said yes yesterday’ Said Noot sighing.

‘Oh I know, that was the whole bit, I was making fun of you then’ Said Jessie.

‘Ah… I was thinking you were being a bit more loon than normal’ He placed a new tray in the oven and came over for a break and sat next to her, on another barrel.

‘Should have said yes the first time’ Jessie sighed. ‘I hate men who do pity dates though’

‘Its not’ Said Noot.

‘Sure?’ Asked Jessie unable to believe it was anything but.

‘Yes Jess, its not a pity date, I like the woman but I wanted time’ Replied Noot.

‘Sometimes you don’t get time Noot, I hope this works out for you too’ Said Jessie.

‘Enough personal talk, get prepping for the morning rush’ Said Noot now annoyed.

‘Yes Boss man’ Jessie saluted and started working again.

\#

A year later Jessie was out of a job with an intricately made wedding invite in her hand, felt like it was made of ice and the cold was seeping into her arms through her veins and into her heart.

‘I need to talk to my conscience please’ she rolled around on the bed and came to rest on the edge, Max was sitting cross legged on the floor holding a teddy bear and a sewing kit plus other stuff to remedy a childhood.

‘Conscience here, whats up?’ Max had a really soothing voice, lightly sprinkled homely ranch mother type.

‘When did things go so wrong? I did everything right Max, I just can’t understand this?’

‘Your birthday? Maybe?’ Replied Max.

‘Funny’ Jessie sighed ‘I was never inappropriate at work, kept a good distance and healthy conversation’

‘Darling you gave hints for seven years’ Max looked up from her work to give her a you brought this on yourself look. ‘Its been a year and you are over him, this is just that invitation dredging things, throw it away’

‘I can’t throw it away, he’s like still so, something’ Said Jessie.

‘You’re an idiot, and he was an idiot, and I am an idiot too’

‘Oh no Max, you are worse than an idiot’ Jessie threw a pillow down but avoided hitting her, she had a needle in her hand. ‘Bad conscience! Bad!’

‘Its done and gone Jess, you lost from being too nice and not taking a chance you should have, things like that happen when you are brought up, the way you are, though honestly how is it inappropriate to say that you were attracted and wanted to date? That still doesn’t make sense to me’ Said Max.

‘It was work, I dunno, I feel like its a bad thing to do, to talk about things like that eh?’

‘Maybe, but talking about this is gonna make things worse, just throw it away, and stop talking to him, you know what you are doing to yourself can amount to emotional torture, too beautiful to do that to yourself darling’ Said Max softly.

‘Oh be good’ Jessie sat upright on the bed, opened the window a sliver and let the card float down on to the street.

‘Littering!’

‘Stop, I wanted to be dramatic’ Jess went under the blanket and went back to sleep.

\#

Max was a southern beauty, pure white skin, with a large curvaceous frame and round shapely face sporting the most vivid blue/green eyes and reddish black hair, Jess always remarked that the world of men would lament the fact that she was solely attracted to women. Having her as a roommate was a gigantic book of good marks as there was nothing she didn’t excel at, cooking, cleaning, caring for a dejected waste of space, there was nothing she couldn’t do, and Jess ended up getting worse and worse and depending on her more and more as the weight of regrets piled on and multiplied at her 30th birthday, which she celebrated with Max and Sara in the apartment.

The days became longer, the mornings darker, the will to get out of bed and be productive weaker. After Noot announced his relationship it took only a month for Jess to deteriorate, she was all questions at first just surprised at the fact that someone who had come out of such a miserable divorce latch on so fast to someone and so deeply, what was that secret, how did she do it, when Jess had been trying for three years, hinting and hinting, so much hinting, nothing forward as Jess had her views on what was appropriate in the workplace, and it turned out what was appropriate was only going to end up as regrets.

Dad had his own textiles company and had been depositing an allowance that she had never asked for ever since she moved out at twenty, Jess herself was a frugal person and had the view that she only needed to buy what was needed, what will always be used, so the savings had sky rocketed in the ten years she had been living alone, and she could just wallow in this same cost/expenditure situation she had going on for at least three years before it became a problem.

Dependency is a drug, same as any other hard-line ones she keep hearing about people going through. Jess woke up and wandered around looking for Max if there’s no breakfast ready, waits till she’s back to either stay in and watch something, play a game on their laptops together, or nag her as a plus one every time she said she had plans, it became a problem, and Jess knew that it had become a problem, but doing anything else, making any other plan made her chest feel like there was a slow cold burn coming up, not indigestion or gas, a panicky burn if she gave in to would have her heaving in a cold sweat unable to get out of bed, just another symptom of regrets.

And she wondered why this was happening sometimes and her mind answered it, Jessie had a like-able outgoing and funny personality, everyone she met complimented Jess and told her how remarkable she was, but beyond that as the years kept going, people initiated to socialize less and less, and she forgot plans and lost other close friends, doing activities was too tiring as the years went on, planning of things to be done, preparing for things wanting to do, didn’t feel as exciting, just devoid of any accomplished feeling before or after, life was meandering along until her eyes found Noot to save her from the mundane existence to a life of renewed magic, but even that went nowhere as he was too nice and she was too polite, and they went along a looped routine for years before another girl, bolder and ruder than Jess just told him exactly what he wanted to hear, enraging.

Dependency is a sickness, the thing was Jess knew that she was behaving in a way that was detrimental to the rules of cohabitation, people are social creatures by essence, and when one holds another above the value that they hold to themselves and place that worth into words and actions, they tend to form deeper bonds and additional connections, and here-in lies the problem, Max started behaving less like a mother and more like someone who wanted to steal a lonesome chick from another nest.

Jess knew things were changing, the words spoken were becoming softer, she was much more careful of her habits and keeping to what Jess liked doing in the day, Max let go of the things that Jess did that usually annoyed her too easily and she was scarily understanding, and Jess could see this and at first she knew that things had to go back to the previous status quo before they ended up having to have an adult talk about feelings and where they were ending up, and it was a bad place because Jess had none of the feelings towards Max that she had for her, at times when she was alone she thought back on how wrong things were slowly becoming but when Jess thought of the“talk”, it just scared her to thinking that at this point, it was going to end up as distant friends and her alone to fend for herself, and this outcome brought the chill fear back into her chest, and Jess decided to leave it be, maybe it could be controlled to an extent, maybe this would be the farthest it goes and she could just coast along till Max’s girlfriend made the connection and asked for boundaries between them, she thought this was the best outcome and only outcome that could happen, Jess convinced herself of it and placed it at the back of her mind.

Sitting in her desk chair, hugging her knees, staring at the phone, the time said Max would be back in a few minutes, Jess had in the recent weeks started to inadvertently count the minutes to when she arrived back from work, and dispel her day of the gloom with companionship. She heard the door open and close, Max used to knock and ask before entering, not anymore, Jess just smiled back at her when she stood there in the half open door.

‘I saw a new bakery that opened, know you will like these babies’ Max held up a paper bag which she implied was full of pastries, she was right, Jess always had a deep love for baked bread and other confectioneries and tried to find places that sold unique takes on old concepts.

‘I’ll make some tea’ Jess got up and felt knives travel along her right leg, it had been asleep, wincing she hopped on out of the room towards the kitchen/living area.

‘Coffee for me thanks, be right out, need to freshen up’ Max placed the bag in her hand out in the hallway and went off in a happy gait.

For the first time in her life, Jess understood the meaning of profound sadness and the depths it held, she felt sad for Max and what she herself had become.

\#

A few days later Jess was at the dinner table when Max came over and started cutting the crust off her sandwiches, it was a confusing scene as she couldn’t understand why Max would do this, bread was her world and Jessie made these sandwiches to perfection, crust included. When she finished Jess just looked up and mumbled, “Way far with them lovings Max”, translated from Jessie baby speak “why are you going so far with things now, did you fall for me”. Max stared straight at the wall behind Jessie for a few moments, smiled and went over to her side of the table, they ate in silence and as soon as she placed the last bit of food in her mouth, mumbled about needing to go out and left without clearing the table.

Jessie cleared the table, washed the dishes, put them away and stood at the dinner table, she could feel the arrival that is to happen, the arrival of adult talk and boundaries and headaches. Those words would have never slipped out if she hadn’t touched her crust, in the seven years, Jessie had never cut crusts, which was the thing, the main thing about that scene, why would she do that, the crusts for heavens sake.

Fuming she started cleaning the apartment starting from the living area, placed things away, changed the cushion covers on the sofa, vacuumed the living area and went to her room and did the same, but as she finished under the bed, Jessie got an idea, a stupid one but it felt like something that would calm her nerves till Max got back home, and plus it would be easier in that situation. So she cleaned, vacuumed and placed a new rug, checked under the bed for dust and when it was sufficiently clean, placed her pillows and blanket under it and got the area ready for her to sleep, now when they look for her they might think she had moved out, and maybe she could live like a ninja, sneaking food in the middle of the night, staying hidden till the moment was right to come out and have that talk, when she was sufficiently brave, a good enough plan.

She fell asleep under her bed and woke up in the morning to voices, the door to her room was open and the pillow she was hugging was now missing, probably moved to wake her up. Jessie knew what happens when Max starts panicking, she goes straight to Sara and blurts out everything, right from the start, and Jessie could never get along with that woman when she’s angry, she was snooty and uptight plus a very hostile person who swears a lot, too much to be appropriate for any situation, dresses in shirts and pants and keeps her hair short, always looked well groomed, professional, and up for a fight with Jessie.

Both of them entered the room at the same time and Jessie tried hard to stay still and let them think she was still sleeping, thing was Sara just sat down on the floor and bent over, their eyes met and Jessie saw she was angry, so angry.

‘She’s awake’ Sara talked to Max first and then focused on Jessie ‘Get out, we need to get something in order’

‘No’ Jessie replied ‘I live here you can’t command me’

‘Command? What? Stop being a brat you’re thirty, act like an adult and come out for f\~” She was cut off by Jessie who abhorred violent language, as she called it.

‘STOP that Sara, no need for words as such, I’ll come out, MOVE’

When she crawled out Sara was horrified, probably with how she looked, Jessie had gotten lazier and lazier with herself and now her hair was a rats nest because when left alone, curly hair becomes that, a rats nest, skin was dry and awful, and so on and on.

‘Max you are equally to blame for this, look at this woman, she is at the level of needing professional psychiatric help’ Sara went out the door mumbling some more, Max followed with her head down and Jessie straight after.

They sat at the dining table, Jessie facing Sara, Max sat by her side after making coffee, during which time the two of them sat silently, trying not to look at each other, Jessie because she felt a little ashamed with how she was, and Sara probably felt uneasy having to deal with the situation, the situation that was Jessie.

‘So what happened was Jess got depressed with getting old and losing a potential life partner, yes’ Sara started, it sounded like a business meeting, on point with her personality. ‘So Max being Max started coddling you and enabling your self-destructive behavior, which is understandable because when it comes to you Jess, she thinks the world, which brings us to the other problem, Max do you have feelings for Jessie?’

‘No, and to make it clear again, No’ Max smiled at Jess and saw she looked horrified so blurted out. ‘As a friend I love you always baby Jess, but not like the other type’

‘Why are you looking dejected at that? Were you having a fantasy of Max falling for you and looking after you to old age?’ Sara with the knife straight to the throat.

‘Well I misunderstood I guess, I was in a bad place guys, my mind wandered, I am sad about it’ Jess mumbled and took a sip of the coffee and winced, it was still a bit too hot.

‘You need to get your life in order or you can move out and wallow in self-pity alone instead of taking advantage of Max, she’s not your nanny or your caretaker, and you might have not noticed, she has her own life to live, you owe her money too by the way’ Sara took a sip of coffee, there was no smile, Jess felt the coldness of her personality waft over, wondered if it would cool her coffee a bit faster because she was starting to get a headache.

‘Okay, I promise will get my act together or move out’ Jess answered. ‘Can I get some breakfast Max’

‘Of course love, what do you want?’

‘No she can make her own’ Sara interjected.

‘Too far Sara’ Max slammed her cup down.

‘Okay but she needs to understand and start moving and doing things for herself’ Sara told Max.

‘I know just this breakfast, please’ Jessie felt her eyes cloud over with tears.

‘Oh come on’ Sara got up and moved over to the sofa with the cup and mumbling about someone being a weak pansy in a sheltered garden, Max came over gave Jessie a hug and went over to make breakfast, Jessie didn’t stop crying though, she needed to vent all her frustrations, the weird scenarios that were tormenting her and everything else in-between out this way, and the fact of the day was, she was neither getting abandoned like she thought, and things were going to go back to normal again as soon as she started taking the slow steady steps forward, it was time to start moving again, as hard as that was going to be, working against the dark and let the Jessie sun shine inside herself again.

\#

Honestly its shocking how fast things can go back to normal, which adds to the fact once you submit to the decline and accept things that are not wrong about yourself as the normal, it sometimes works hard to become the normal and write over the best person that you were before, to a mediocre, and useless version.

Over the coming days after the intervention, Max approached a few more subjects that she had been afraid to voice due to how she had been behaving in her woe is me spiral of self-absorption and fantasy, major of which was the fact that she had been thinking in terms of what Max wanted, and honestly thinking back it was insulting to her character as well, and Jessie found herself apologizing so much for thinking so. But thinking back on it, it did make her come to terms with a few views about herself, the fact Jessie thinks of herself as a divine beauty in mind and body, hard not to when her parents brought her up like an angel who could light up people’s lives just by being present.

A month or so later she couldn’t access her account and decided to visit the nearest branch of her bank after being on hold for an hour. Hair back to the voluminous springy curls, skin now clean and clearing up, dressed lightly in a cream color white dress for the sunny weather with a wide brimmed round hat, the mood of her life was back to sunny as well. Outside the people were moving along same as her in lighter clothes, cars moving in both directions and she turned and stopped in her tracks, there was a cat sitting slumped at the corner of the building, probably one of them she hears at night wailing in the alleyway between the two buildings. She had one of those angry faces that come prepackaged with some cats, something was wrong though the way she was slumped so Jessie approached her slowly to see that she was mostly skin and bone.

Jessie turned straight around and walked up the stairs into her building, called down the elevator at the end of the hallway, unlocked her apartment, scrounged around in the kitchen cupboards and it was not surprising at all that Max had bought some tuna cans when neither of them really liked seafood, it was probably to feed them, but the other thing was that she loved cats, but were afraid of them as well, mentioned something about their volatile nature. She went out of the apartment with a paper plate and the tuna can already opened and drained of brine, when she came outside the cat was no longer there, Jessie went into the alley and looked around the dumpsters and wooden pallets and boxes to find out that, yup the black cat had completely disappeared. After finding a relatively safe corner, she dumped the can onto the plate and discarded it into a dumpster, paused, went back to find it in the dumpster remembering this was frowned upon, everything needs to be in discarded in properly sealed bags, which meant going back up to her apartment with the empty can in hand, Jessie sighed, and waited to see if any other cats were around, none came so went back into her apartment.

She was on the sofa watching a period drama when she remembered the bank again, tried the phone app and saw it login, and in that same moment the front door opened, Jessie saw the time was half past three, curious, why was Max home so early.

‘Jess I need a favor’ Sara’s voice came before she showed herself from the hallway.

‘How did you know I was here?’ Jessie asked and Sara pointed at the T.v

‘Also you don’t actually have a life right now’ Sara replied.

‘True that’ Jessie straightened herself on the sofa, clasped her hands together resting her chin on the tips of her fingers. ‘What is the mission?’

‘I need you to infiltrate a high profile gathering, and impersonate a high profile member’ Sara sat down next to her on the sofa, took the remote and pressed pause on the drama.

‘Again? Come on, just meet him’ Whined Jessie.

‘Max would kill me if I say something inappropriate, and he still thinks you are, the one’

‘I don’t want to be “the one” anymore, I hate pretending and lying, you both know this’ Replied Jessie.

‘You owe me one Jess, and you owe Max thousands’ Sara pointed at her.

‘I know’ Jessie pouted.

‘Tonight at eight, Max will take you to the place so’ After saying that Sara got back up.

‘Where my thanks?’ Jessie grabbed the sleeve of her shirt. ‘Also keep me company and watch this please’

‘Seriously, can we watch anything else besides that weepy drama bull’ Sara paused wondering whether to finish the sentence or not.

‘HEY!’ Said Jessie.

‘Poo’ Sara relented.

‘Give it a chance, you might like it, actually has depth you know like there are so many hidden motives with how they all behave, plans in the dark and juicy secrets and stuff’ Jessie pressed play and heard Sara groan next to her, but she was no longer planning to leave. ‘Thanks Sara’

‘Hmm’ Sara hummed annoyed.

They spent the next hour and half sitting next to each other, Jessie defending all the comments that came from Sara, and she actually found herself enjoying arguing about the merits of period drama’s and felt like she made some headway in bringing her along to actually enjoying entertainment of this flavor. Max came in and without a word sat next to her and Jessie noticed she was no longer whining and making sarcastic rude comments about the series anymore, understandable.

For the gathering, Jessie chose a black dress with a longer inner off-white lining, which made the black outer clothing stand out more, and for her tan-skinned self it went along nicely, did some light make-up and chose a light pink lipstick.

‘Please Jess not this again’ Max was groaning hard and clutching the door as if she was about to fall over from losing all her energy.

‘Either you two fess up, or I will keep doing this every time till he falls for me’ Jessie finished up, got her clutch purse in hand and walked towards the door.

At the restaurant they stood at the reception waiting for the staff to take their names and guide them to the table.

‘Why is he so good looking’ Jessie whispered to Max eyeing him tapping his watch telling them both they were extremely late.

‘Look at me Jess, I look this way for a reason’ Max was wearing a dark green sleeveless/backless dress showing off her cleavage and hugged her frame till it came down to her waist and flowed out in layers, was striking on such a large frame.

‘I forget the word… hmm… SILVER FOX!!!’ Jessie whispered loudly.

‘Stop please Jess, I want to get this over with and go home’ Max walked off faster and sat down before Jessie.

‘Hello Rich, wonderful weather’ Jess held out her hand, and he got up shook her hand and sat back down, no smile.

‘Lets get this over with Dad, air your grievances, lets eat and go our separate ways again’ Max sounded annoyed, one of the only times anyone would ever hear this tone of voice from her. Jessie sat down and picked up the menu.

‘I need grandkids Max, this situation you are in’ Deidrich Clover started, and Jessie heard his hippie tone in that voice, he was one with Max’s late mother till she passed away after birthing Minnie, Max’s little sister.

‘Minnie has already given you six, and I am not in a situation Dad, I am a lesbian’ Max was still annoyed.

‘That is Minnie, I want to see yours before I go’

‘You’re not going anywhere Dad, try comparing to yourself to other sixty year olds in the world, and see how many still run marathons, surf and dive at your age’ Max sighed.

‘Doesn’t mean I can’t croak tomorrow, don’t be naive Max’ Rich held up the menu for the waiter to see, telling them the table was ready to order, Jessie was planning to just eat an appetizer and leave this battlefield, the less she had to talk, the less she had to lie.

‘So no men at all? I mean I was pretty accepting when I thought it was just a sex thing, but a life partner?’

‘Ok thats it’ Max got up.

‘Sorry, baby I’m sorry please don’t go’ Rich was up too, Jessie just kept sitting, Max would never leave in a huff, all things said and done, she loved her dad to bits.

‘I will stay if you promise not to talk like that again, its insulting to me Dad’ Max sat down before he could answer.

‘I just want to see little Maxies, same as the little Minnies, don’t you Jess?’ Rich pointed to her.

‘Oh yes, they would be so cute and lovely’ Jessie saw Max side-eye her but pretended not to notice.

The waiter came over, they went Italian for the night and Jessie got the same as everyone, no alcohol for her though, her household was one that never partook.

The hard-hitting dialogue stopped at that point and the rest of the night was pleasantries and Max’s dad prodding about Jessie, her work life and interests, and getting to know how far Max was at her job, because every time they had this dinner Max was up a promotion, this time she was at the same position as last which annoyed her Dad, not at Max though, the company she was working at, even recommended leaving that place to a better one with better pay and benefits at a friend of her Dad’s, which Max declined saying that she loved the work she was doing, Max worked at a place called the Giving Factory which made toys for kids, and they do a lot of charity work compared to other companies aimed at kids.

After the dinner was over Max’s dad dropped them off at the apartment building and as soon as Max got in she went straight to the sofa and plopped over exhausted, Jessie walked over, sat down and moved her head onto her lap.

‘Sorry about your Dad… again’ Said Jessie and toyed with her bangs.

‘Its okay Jess, I know he loves me, and he means well, and it is all that old fashioned stuff, but I keep thinking every time we go to those dinners every three months he might have come around and I can finally introduce Sara to him, but its the same thing, and its frustrating, he is the one person I want to share her with and it is… just frustrating, and Sara is just so explosive’ Said Max.

‘The time will come don’t worry, he talks to me much more now compared to last year’

‘I noticed that, looks actually interested in knowing you now, helps that you agree with everything he says’

‘Your kids will be so cute though, its not a lie hey’ Said Jessie.

‘They will won’t they’ Max looked like she was pondering how they could look.

‘Yea… we can try if you want, you know for kids?’ Asked Jessie.

‘Ew…’ She got up from her wheezing at the thought, and spent a few more minutes between the coffee table and sofa just heaving.

‘Hey I’m pretty’ Jessie pouted on the sofa hugging her knees.

‘Yes you are, and a great friend, thank you so much for doing this every time, I know you hate it’

‘I do, so so much, but I will do anything for you’

I've done No Coffee for '23 because I wanted to see if I can actually do something so drastic, and I succeeded. '24, I completely cut soda from my body, and it was such an amazing achievement, that last year, my goal was to lose at least 50lbs by the end of '25, and I destroyed that goal by the summer.

Now for this year, my goal is different. My New Years Resolution is to at least reconnect with people I used to hang out with, people that I've been friends and great acquaintances from back in HS and College until we drifted apart. So far, apart from those 10 people that I talk to every day, I have reconnected with at least 3 people. Granted, there was more that I tried to send a message to, but I either ignored, told that I should never message them, or just straight up block. Maybe they could always reconsider, but for now, I respect them as we're living our lives.

I want to journal what people I've reconnected with again. And by the end of the month, I want to look back at the progress I've made. I've been alone after the pandemic, and yet, I still held my hand up high, and this year, I will find the courage and the strength to make friends again.

And for those who ask, yes, the Amogus Plushie has become a permanent addition to my life and travels since Christmas 2021. Even if I travel solo, just having the plush gives me comfort that the person that's no longer with me in my life would always remind me that its never too late to make new friends and reconnect with others.",23,1767924234.0,MadeMeSmile,4,0.77,False

They met in college, bonding over late-night coffee and endless conversations about life. As time passed, their connection deepened, and they found themselves lost in each other's eyes.

Their love was pure, raw, and all-consuming. They spent countless nights walking hand in hand through the campus, sharing dreams and fears. He promised her the world, and she promised him her heart.

But life had other plans.

He landed a dream job abroad, and she was accepted into a prestigious graduate program back home. The distance seemed manageable at first, but as weeks turned into months, the miles between them grew heavier.

They tried to hold on, but the calls grew fewer, the texts slower. They began to drift, like ships lost at sea.

One day, he called her, his voice trembling. ""I met someone,"" he said, the words slicing through her like a knife. ""I'm so sorry.""

She hung up, tears streaming down her face. The pain was suffocating, like drowning in an ocean of sorrow.

Years went by, and she thought she'd healed, but the memories lingered, a bittersweet reminder of what could've been. She'd see couples holding hands and wonder what was wrong with her.

One rainy night, she stumbled upon an old photo of them. The tears flowed, and she let out a sob. Why did love have to hurt so much?

In the end, she realized he'd been a chapter in her life, but he wasn't the whole story. She closed the photo, and with a deep breath, turned the page.",2,1767924230.0,story,0,1.0,False

However, true joy can be found in the small moments of daily life. By shifting our perspective and focusing on the present, we can cultivate a sense of happiness that permeates our everyday experiences.

Embracing Gratitude



One of the most powerful tools for finding happiness in the everyday is practicing gratitude. When you take the time to acknowledge the positive aspects of your life, no matter how small, you begin to create a more positive mindset. Consider keeping a gratitude journal where you jot down a few things you're thankful for each day. This doesn’t need to be complicated; even simple pleasures, like a warm cup of coffee or a sunny day, can elevate your mood.



By consciously acknowledging what you appreciate, you train your brain to look for the good rather than fixating on the negatives. This small daily habit can have a profound impact on your overall outlook on life.



Mindfulness in the Present Moment



Another effective way to discover happiness in your daily life is through mindfulness. Mindfulness involves being fully present in the moment, actively engaging your senses and appreciating the here and now. Whether you're eating a meal, walking in nature, or even doing chores, try to focus on what you're doing without distractions.



Take a moment to notice the colors around you, the sounds you hear, and the sensations you feel. This practice not only enhances your awareness of life's simple joys but also reduces stress and anxiety. When you immerse yourself in the present, mundane tasks transform into opportunities for joy and fulfillment.



Finding Joy in Simplicity



Happiness often lies in the simplest things. Instead of chasing after extravagant experiences, try to find joy in everyday activities. Whether it’s reading a book, taking a long bath, or enjoying a quiet moment with a loved one, these seemingly ordinary moments contribute significantly to your overall happiness.



Create rituals that bring you joy, such as morning coffee on the balcony or an evening stroll around your neighborhood. By cherishing these simple pleasures, you allow happiness to blossom naturally throughout your day.



Connecting with Others



Human connection is vital for happiness. It’s essential to nurture relationships with family, friends, and even acquaintances. Genuine connections provide emotional support and amplify feelings of joy. Make time for meaningful conversations, whether over a meal or a phone call.



You can also engage in community activities or volunteer work. Helping others not only enriches their lives but also brings satisfaction and a sense of purpose to your own. Connecting with others creates a shared experience that enhances your happiness as you contribute to the well-being of those around you.



Engaging in Hobbies



Finding a hobby that ignites your passion can be a wonderful source of happiness. Engage in activities that bring you joy, whether it’s painting, gardening, writing, or cooking. These pursuits allow for self-expression and creativity, providing a break from daily stressors.



Allow yourself the freedom to explore new interests or dive deeper into existing ones. Hobbies can act as a creative outlet and give you something to look forward to in your everyday life. Setting aside time for activities you love cultivates fulfillment and strengthens your sense of well-being.



Setting Intentions



Start each day with a positive intention. This could be a simple affirmation or a goal for the day. Allowing yourself to focus on what you want to achieve, no matter how small, creates a sense of purpose.



This might be as simple as aiming to smile more, being kinder to yourself, or dedicating time to something you enjoy. As you consistently set these intentions, you may notice an uplift in your mood as you strive to fulfill them.



Reflecting on Your Day



At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on what made you happy. Did you experience a simple joy? Did a conversation uplift your spirits? Reflecting on these moments reinforces the positive experiences you’ve had and helps you appreciate the small feats you might otherwise overlook.



This often leads to a more joyful disposition and sets a positive tone for the day ahead. Over time, this practice can enhance your ability to find happiness in everyday life.



Finding happiness in the everyday is less about grand achievements and more about embracing life's small moments. By cultivating gratitude, practicing mindfulness, engaging with others, and reflecting on your day, you can create a life filled with joy. Happiness is within reach, waiting to be discovered in the small, everyday moments that make life beautiful.

I tried suggesting going for happy hour once and got polite excuses.

Weekends are the worst. I walk around my neighborhood seeing groups of people at brunch or hanging out at the park and I feel like an alien in a new place. I am not the kind of person to spontaneously start speaking to someone so I tried bumble bff twice and deleted it both times cause it’s so weird trying to make friends on apps.

I really miss my friends from back home too. They were people I could call at 2am if needed but now theyre 6 states away and I cant just rely on phone calls and chat. Out of all the loneliness I started showing up to some random card game nights through ludio on thursdays just so I can talk to humans who arent my boss or the guy at trader joes.

I’m heading over in November with my partner (it’s their first time to Japan; my second). We are flying in/out of Tokyo so have booked accommodation there for the start and end.

 

Day 1-5: Tokyo (including day trip to Mt Takao)

5-9: ??

9-11: Tokyo (including day trip to Kamakura)

 

I would love suggestions for the middle section. My ideas so far have been Karuizawa, Kusatsu, Hakone or Kyoto. Or any combo of these!

 

We are late 40s into coffee, easy-ish hikes, mountains, Nintendo, with decent amounts of downtime.

Not so much into coastal areas because we live on an island with nice beaches 😊

1q7v8c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1q7v8c5/one_thousand_eight_hundred_and_third_night/,One Thousand Eight Hundred And Third Night,"Nearly six years after the murder of George Floyd, the american pigs do it again, apparently only a few blocks away. A woman, Renee Good, is shot down by some cowardly whelp with a badge and the best of american is up in arms, or perhaps not in arms given if they actually used their guns like their stupid amendment suggest they should this would not still be happening. And the worst of america, the majority that actual makes things happen, mock the suffering. They keep reenacting the same story over and over and never figure out how to get to the good ending. I don't really care if the states as a imperialist empire ever do, to be frank. The country could and perhaps even should burn itself to the ground for all I care; it is, after all, what its government has done to countless others. But then I think of the individuals. Of George. Of Renee. Another name I should have never come to know. She should just be a face in crowd, remarkable only to those who love her but worthy of the life she should still be living nonetheless. Should be holding her child, cuddling her wife, spending time her parents, laughing with friends, and enjoying all the wonders her life contained even when there was no one around. Beyond being a mother, daughter, wife, and friend, she deserved better by virtue of simply being a person. She deserved the fullness of life that all people do. And it has been stolen from her and she is reduced to a name that deserved to be unknown. But now that we do know her, in a way she never should have been known, all we can do is make knowing her name mean something. Or, perhaps I should not say *we*. I should say *they*. I am no american and they need to clean their streets of their pigs on their own; my country does not currently make a habit of flagrantly intervening on other countries sovereignty. Enough of them chose this to lead to the horrors of today. They, as a collective, need to risk the shallow eases of the present for a better future. Sadly, they even must be willing to risk their lives. But will they? The people, particularly the women, of Iran are certainly doing so. France does it all the time. Hong kong, Ukraine, even as best as they can Palestine at least are willing to stand up for their neighbours as much as they will themselves. Is the 'United' States? I don't believe so but I'd love for them to prove me wrong.

Anyway, when the state of the world was not on my mind, I got a good amount of writing done. I wrote 763 words for I'm Still Sisyphus and I am glad to say that the first scene is finally done and I have made a decent dent into the second. I have already deviate from my outline. A little stroll over the fast road to the scenic street, so to speak. I am still skipping along outside my map now so we'll see where it takes me when I return to it tomorrow. 

What else can I tell you today? I have more tooth problems that I just haven't been writing about and I'd like to get them delt with soon. I have a cavity in my front tooth that I have just accepted to be there since late summer and this morning I started bleeding while brushing my teeth. I suppose it is time but fuck, it is so expensive. My dentist would text me telling me to set up an appointment and that just makes me not want to go back to them specifically; I can't afford it, okay? Dental insurance should be a rite but I don't qualify for the new low-income dental aid that rolled out this year because I don't have any income. So I am just left feeling bad about myself and the cavity is left to get worse. Good thing I don't smile with my teeth, I suppose.

The birds are still a little weary of the hawk out there. Mother apparently saw some but whenever I look out there, they are nowhere to be seen. The bunnies are active though, we saw plenty last night. They feasted on cranberries and seeds all night. We'll put the rosemary bush out soon. Mother and I also need to start planning out the garden this year. Mother is doing some cleaning first to make space for new seedling. There is also the new washer and dryer coming next week so there is that to deal with. Wish us luck with laundry day in the meantime.

Well, I am going to make myself a coffee and try not to look at the news. At this point, it is only making me sick with worry. I'll have to crab bucket to the crabs and hope enough of them learn how avoid being pulled down. Best of luck to the best of them.

Ever feel like your savings are just sitting there, doing… nothing? Like a gym membership you pay for but never use? What if I told you that money could be working *way* harder for you—maybe even funding your dream retirement sooner than you think?

Most of us underestimate how much our savings could grow with the right moves. A few smart tweaks, and suddenly, that ""meh"" nest egg starts looking like a golden ticket. Here’s how to turn your savings from a lazy couch potato into a retirement-funding machine:

### **1. The ""Set It and Forget It"" Myth (Spoiler: It’s Costing You)**
- **Problem:** Parking cash in a low-interest savings account is like feeding your money a diet of plain toast—it survives, but it doesn’t *thrive*.
- **Fix:** Move it to high-yield accounts, CDs, or (if you’re feeling bold) index funds. Even a 1% boost in interest adds up to *thousands* over time.
- **Example:** $10K in a 0.01% account earns *$1 a year*. That same $10K at 4%? **$400**. No brainer.

### **2. The Retirement Calculator You’re Not Using (But Should Be)**
- Most people guess how much they’ll need in retirement. *Big mistake.*
- Tools like [this one](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) show you *exactly* how your savings stack up—and how small changes (like upping contributions by 2%) could fast-track your freedom.
- **Pro tip:** Run the numbers *now*. Future You will high-five Present You.

### **3. The ""I’ll Start Later"" Trap (Your Future Self Hates This)**
- Waiting to invest is like waiting to plant a tree. The best time was 10 years ago. The second-best time? *Today.*
- **Compound interest** is your BFF. Even $100/month at 7% return becomes **$120K in 30 years**. *Mic drop.*

### **4. The Sneaky Expenses Draining Your Wealth**
- That daily $5 coffee? **$1,825/year.** The unused subscriptions? **$500/year.** Redirect *just* those to investments, and you’re suddenly funding extra vacations in retirement.
- **Challenge:** Pick *one* ""money leak"" to plug this month. Your future self will thank you with a piña colada on the beach.

### **The Bottom Line?**
Your savings aren’t just numbers—they’re *opportunities*. A little strategy, a few smart moves, and suddenly, that ""someday"" retirement feels a lot closer.

*What’s one small change you could make today to give your savings a boost?*

1q7v3ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q7v3ss/abyssal_apraisal_theres_a_hole_in_the_sky/,Abyssal Apraisal: Theres a Hole in the Sky,"I have been working as an astrophysicist for years, today was the first time something interesting has happened. The day began like any other day, I woke up, drove up to the lab, and brewed myself a cup of coffee. I took my drink and carried myself through the hall and to the second last door where I would be working on my current project, but there was no one there, where there would usually be machines whirring, fluids bubbling, and just people talking in general. Was replaced by an almost uncanny silence. Most notable was the absence of Lance. Lance was one of my best friends from university, and always stayed late and came half an hour early, he was strange like that. I put down my cup and sat down until I heard yelling down the hall. I ran over and stumbled in to see everyone. They were standing or sitting around the table talking. “What the hell is going on?” I asked them. Patel spoke up. He was a small scrawny man, with glasses and messy hair. He was unconfident, stuttering  and then spat it out in his scared little quiet voice. “There's a hole in the sky.”



“What the fuck? What do you mean there's a hole in the sky?” I tried to yell, but the pure absurdity of the situation kept my voice down. “Last night Lance was looking through the telescope trying to study Callisto, and he saw it right by jupiter, a fucking hole in the sky!” I scanned the room but couldn't see Lance anywhere.  “Where is he now? Did he tell you this?” “Well, we found this on a notepad he wrote, next to his body. He shot himself last night.” I tried to scream, I tried to say something, but before I realized what was happening I fell to my knees and I felt tears streaming down the sides of my face. Next thing I could remember it was the next week. I must have got through the week, I ate and I slept, but it is a complete lapse in my memory. After that I started going back to work. It was quiet there, no one wanted to talk after what happened, but it was hard to ignore. All work there had focused on the hole in the sky. This place has become so surreal and confusing. At least I still had the shitty coffee in the break room to take solace in. 



As I walked I was greeted by my coworkers. “Hi Neil” “Hi John” “Hello Neil” “Hi Patel.” I went over to the machine and tried to pour myself some coffee, it was out but at this point I didn't even care anymore. As I sat down, no drink in hand, I couldn't help but overhear my colleagues' conversation. “What do you think of all this?” “What is there to think about, why would you think about it? God knows I try not to.” “I think it's god punishing us.” “Ok.” I couldn't sit back and listen anymore. I had to interject and ask questions. “What does it look like?” I stammered, they were surprised to hear me, Patel even spilled his coffee a bit. “No ones seen it since Lance, of course.” John answered.”Why not?” “He killed himself.” “Well we’ll need to look eventually and what are we going to do for-” Patel cut me off. “Um, we're trying to get some uh less privileged people to test this out.” I understood, they were going to get homeless people to look at the hole. “Well, more power to you if that's how you're going to do it.” 



Today the first homeless person came in. His name was David, he’s been on the streets for a while and wrapped up in a lot of bad shit, a perfect target for the likely possibility that this goes wrong. He looked through it. “What the fuck is in this tellerscope?” “What the fuck, holy shit what the fuck is that whats in the fucking-” he paused for a moment “This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, Its so beatiful, you have to look!” We looked at each other uneasily, then he got violent. “Look, you have to fucking look!” He came at Patel “Fucking look!” three other men restrained him “Its so beautiful, so fucking beautiful!” He was dragged out screaming. Patel was visibly shaken by this. I was the first to approach him. “You okay buddy?” No response. “Here let's go sit down in the break room.” I held his shoulder and led him into the break room while the rest of the lab just watched solemnly. I wanted to get mad, I wanted to scream at them for how they dismissed Patel, he was a real human being like the rest of them and he was basically being ignored, but when I saw their expressions I decided to bite my tongue. Everyone in that room went through the same thing, we all saw what happened, I was just the only one numb to it all. We both sat down on the old couch, it was comfortable but still a bare minimum for this lab. I was zoning out hearing the hum of the lights and pipes until Patel broke the silence. “I’m going to look at the hole.” 



It’s been a week since Patel looked at the hole, I thought it would be a bigger thing but it just kind of came and went. After arguing with us for hours he ran up to the telescope, looked at it, simply said “Oh” and then left. We didn't see him for a few days then he came back in. When we questioned him about the hole he just said “It is a hole, not much more to it” and wouldn't elaborate. We were at a standstill, one man had looked at the hole and killed himself, one had seemingly gone insane but that may not have been an effect of the hole, and one seemed completely fine. After a long evaluation we decided to cut our losses and start looking. There was no other way to study it, and if anyone was looking it should be us. We started taking shifts looking at it and documenting what we saw. Everyone had a partner, mine was Patel, just my luck. 



The first time I looked at the hole gave me an indescribable feeling. I thought it would just look like a strange galaxy or a colourful circle, but it was a full on hole in the sky. It was black, black doesn't even describe it, it's the blackest black ever observed, it's blacker than the middle of the night, it's blacker than an eclipse with no moon, it's blacker than a night sky, without a single illuminating star. It was noticeably darker than the rest of the sky, and noticeably indented into the sky with small cracks around it, but nonetheless it was beautiful. When my turn ended I was angry at first, I wanted to keep this beauty to myself, no one else should get this, it should be mine! Then I realized how insane I sounded and ran to the break room. I sat down, and I was greeted by John and Gerald. Gerald immediately started questioning me about the hole. “What was it like?” “Deep” “Well, what did it look like?” “Like a hole” “I know it looked like a hole what did it-” “Jesus would you leave him alone, he just looked through the hole!” It was John who finally interrupted him. Weeks started going by, blending together and life finally started to feel mundane. 



The hole started growing. We noticed it yesterday, it's definitely been growing, slowly but definitely. We have been observing the hole, but not learning about it. The hole still is a mystery. Late into one night we started proposing theories. “I think it's something from another world, looking in, trying to see more, but something much too large to truly experience the beauty this world has to offer” This was Lisa, she had been working here almost as long as me, she was smart poetic, and i'm not ashamed to say it beautiful, I held onto every last word. “I think its a fucking hole” It was Gerald “Shut up Gerald” It was John “This whole thing has just made me more religious, isnt this obviously god the rapture is imminent!” “Speaking of religion, what do you make out of all this Patel” it was Gerald again “Gerald I'm an atheist, I think this is a tear in the cosmos just a random possibility of probability that demonstrates the true randomness of the universe.” The rest of the night followed similarly with people proposing everything from aliens to time travel. The next week the hole grew more, then shrank then became larger than ever. 

The hole has gone public. Long story short, Gerald got drunk and told some reporters he met at a bar. To his defence he said she was really hot. We told him he shouldn't come back to the lab and so far he hasn't. It started small, we didn't think anyone would really believe in this hole, maybe a few crackpot conspiracy theorists, but otherwise we would be fine. 



We were wrong. As soon as the story hit the news cycle everything started to crack and crumble. Every country's government has made a statement on it, every podcast has something to say about it and no one knows what to do. Some sort of new religion has started up and is already the fourth largest in america. From what I can tell they worship the hole as some sort of deity. I went to the lab today and there were CIA agents everywhere, looks like we won't be the lead researchers in this anymore. I’m going to call Patel. It’s been a week since the news went public, there's now a constant video public online of the hole, it's getting bigger and can now be seen in the night sky, tiny but still there. I've been meeting up with some of the guys from work, and it seems like we’ve all been laid off. Real shame, but I don't know how much longer this will matter. It seems like every day they predict the economy will collapse, but it's been fine for now. Also there's a million news reports of people who have gone crazy from the hole. The streets are full of them, many preach about the holes in religion, many are just insane the more I speak on this topic, the more dread gets filled through me as I wonder if I can make it to tomorrow. 



I was bored and decided to go to the park today, a bad idea. The parks are just filled with people who aren't inside churches, or other places of worship. These people are driven mad by the hole, and find solace in treating it as though it was a deity, fear is how this religion must grow, fear and anguish. Some of these people seem sane or lucid, but most are just standing there staring ahead barely listening to what the “pastor” was saying. I looked around and jumped when I realized there was a man standing right behind me smiling, silently. “Would you like a flyer?” He reached out his hand and I noticed it was filled with an absurd amount of flyers advertising his religion. “No thank you” “Oh you must take one” “No I’m fine” “You must” Then he put his hand on my shoulder firmly, and I ran. I had to maneuver through the never ending labyrinth of the crowd. No matter how far I got I would look back and see the man following me. As I traveled inevitably deeper through this maze more and more people offered me flyers of a religion based on the discoveries of my deceased colleague, a gross cacophony of flesh and grass, the more men I pushed out of the way the more of an open path I left behind me for him to follow. I ran, and then I walked. I don't know for how long, but I do know that when the chase had ended and I was out of the park, it was dark out. I was sweaty and delirious, but I didn't see him anywhere and then I threw up, right outside the park and then I walked home. I stayed in my home for days just eating out of the fridge and sleeping, and watching the ever changing news cycle, although it stays stagnant on a topic now. 



This was until I ran out of groceries and knew I needed to go out. I walked out, I felt like the last man alive, there was noone around it was uncanny. I felt like I had to sneak around the town. There were people just sitting outside churches, and the parks were full of thousands of people, there were even people spilling into the streets. I went into the store and it took a while to find anything close to fresh, and then it took me even longer to find an open cash register. I would have just stolen it but then I noticed some teenage girl standing at the counter and felt bad for him. “Hey, I'll just get these” “You want a bag” “Yeah I guess” “You want a flyer” “What?” A flyer, what would she have a flyer for? Then she handed me the flyer for this religion. I took my food and ran out without leaving. I looked around and there was no one  around me right until I turned the corner and saw him. I ran home and almost dropped my food, but got there safe. At nine pm there was a knock at the door. It was him again, I didn't answer, and the knocks got louder, and I went to my room, and the news wouldn't work, and the knocks got louder, and I sat down, and I plugged my ears, and the knocking stopped, and he went away. I tried to sleep but I couldn't so I took some melatonin and eventually fell asleep. The next day I barricaded my door. 



Several days later I woke up in the middle of the night to a window breaking. I stayed in my bed and pulled the covers higher. I heard creaking and I knew I couldn't stay put forever. The bed was warm and hard to leave. The bed was safe. I didn't know if I could bear to run into possible danger. Then I decided that if there was an intruder they might not know I was home, and who knows, maybe the glass was from a different house? I spent around a half hour just rationalizing this for myself until I worked up the courage to go downstairs. I snuck around, my own house like I was in some villain's lair, I kept the lights off and made no noise. I patted the carpet, ever so slowly with my feet, I heard a creak, it was from my own feet, and it was the loudest thing I had heard in hours, my sweat went cold, and I froze. I didn't move for ten minutes, ten minutes spent just standing, then I prayed to god, not some hole in the sky, that anyone in this house had not heard me. I stepped, waited then stepped again. This went on for what felt like hours but I’m not quite sure just how long it took. After what felt like an eternity of feeling the walls and sometimes crawling because I couldn't see a thing, I made it to the kitchen. This had been my goal, my end point, I was here to grab a knife from the kitchen, although it didn't feel like mine anymore. I felt around and I found them, the knives, I felt instantly more confident and I grabbed my largest knife. This was my moment of hubris, the single moment in my life where I was so overconfident it could have led to my downfall. 



I yelled. “Try to fucking come at me now!” “Yeah I got a fucking knife!” Then another smaller “You’re fucked.” Then I saw his silhouette in the hallway, smiling at me ear to ear. He was watching me in the dark, I don't know for how long. He could've been by the kitchen the whole time but from his reaction I could tell he had been following me around my house, just out of sight, but I wasn't out of his. Stalking me, treating me like prey in my own home. For all I know he could have been watching me from my bedroom hall, and he likely was there when I stepped on the creaking step, in the darkness watching me thinking I was safe. I stepped towards him, a feeble intimidation attempt, then he stepped back, away from me. I could notice he still had the flyers in his hand, then he rushed at me. It caught me so off guard I almost fell back, and then I did when he pounced on top of me. He said in the most jarring calm voice based on the situation “How about taking a flyer?” I hit my arm on my cabinet and it started bleeding, I felt so helpless in my own home , I wasn't going to die like this I would let it happen. Then the next thing I realized the knife was in his chest, then out, then in again, and again, and again, until his body went limp on top of me. A tear started dripping down my cheek, then again, then again, and then I was crying.



 I've killed someone, I can't come back from this, I can't ever. I didn't know what to do so I called nine one one. I didn't know what to expect, but there was no answer. Then I called the next best thing John. Turns out he’s been staying at his family's old cottage outside of town, he says he can come get me but it will take a few days. I don't feel safe here anymore, but I have nowhere else to go so I just have to stay put in my room. I put a towel over my cut arm, and stayed there. The news still didn't work. I could hear people walking and talking just outside my house but no one came in.



I was beyond relieved when I got the text I’m outside, hop in. I was so happy to see John's car parked on the curb of my street. We drove up for a couple hours and talked. “How's this been for you?” “Horrible those cult members have been following me around, and one attacked me.” “What’s the deal with them? I went up to the cottage as soon as we got laid off and this is the first time I've seen them.” I couldn't believe that he had completely avoided these people while I was subjected to it? It felt bad, it felt unfair. Then I calmed myself down for the rest of the drive. 



We got to his cottage, it was a small place in the woods secluded next to a beautiful lake. We stayed and had an honestly good time. We would swim and cook, there was an insane amount of food there. When I asked where he got it he just said he took a lot when he left town, ominous. I had no objections. One night we made a fire and sat by it talking late into the night. “How do you think the hole started” “I think it's a mistake, an accident by some higher being, living out there in the cosmos, what do you think?” “I think it's a black hole, and if it's growing it might not be good for us” “That would suck” “Aren't the stars beautiful out here? Ever since I was little I've loved just staring up at it, I guess that's why I became an astrophysicist.” I looked up, it was beautiful. I could see all the stars, but the hole in sky was fucking huge, as big if not larger as the moon. “The hole has gotten bigger” “Yeah” “Why do you think Lance killed himself when he saw it, he's the only one” “Well everyone else pretty much has gone insane, have you seen the cult, and I’m sure there's others.” This world had become bleak, not a future worth living in. “You think?” “Yeah, I think and if it makes you feel any better you are really brave for not” “What”? That night at the fire John came on to me. I was taken aback, I’m not gay, I never have been. I ran back to the cabin and went to my room, making sure not to talk to John anymore, I couldn't believe he would use a vulnerable moment like that to get to me. 



I woke up late to someone knocking on the door then breaking in. I got up confused and made my way to the door of my room only to see him. “I thought you fucking dead?” How he was alive it didn't make sense. “You sure you wouldn't like a flyer?” I ran from him, I ran out the door and into the night, he was following me he chased after me into the forest, I ran for hours and even when I was exhausted in the woods leaning on trees. He was still following me. He wasn't slower than me, and he wasn't faster. He would always match my pace. After hours I thought the sun had started to come up, but it was just the hole. It had gotten so large. I fell over. He lept, or pretty much fell onto me. “Would you like a flyer?” The man's mouth frothing saliva all over my face. I couldn't overpower him and I couldn't get away. I finally exclaimed “Fine!” “Ill take a fucking flyer!” “Thank you.” He crawled back on all fours through the woods backwards; it was uncanny. I was going to look at the note but it was night, then I realized it was day and the sun was shining, it was hot, how had I not noticed this? I looked at the flyer but all it read was Kill Yourself! The new age religion, join us! Lance didn't, and you know what happened to him. What? How did the flyer know? Then I woke up. 



It was around three am. I couldn't fall back asleep and when six am came I knew what must be done. I needed to go to one of their gatherings and talk to a religious leader, take the flyer, and make that next step. I got up and took John's car. I felt bad but I really needed to get out of there. I'll apologize to John the next time I see him. I drove back to the city, back to the place I never thought I’d return to. The drive gave me time to think. A place where all of my nightmares come from and all of my friends and family have become distorted versions of themselves, and religion a mockery of the skies, and angels that came before. I’m not sure what's happening in other cities, states, and countries. Similar things must be happening. It was strange, knowing how important I had felt when this whole thing started. We were the ones that discovered this hole, and we felt like we were the lead researchers, keeping this huge secret from the rest of the world. Now I was as insignificant as anyone, I was a nobody, this wouldn't feel as bad if it didn't feel  like I used to be somebody, somebody important well, now where I go I’m going to get answers, whether the answers are true or answers are what I want will be subjective, but I will have a answer and that's what matters to me now. 



I got back into town and pulled into my driveway. Then I started walking to the park. Where there were once huge crowds of people there were buildings, they were like huge old wooden monasteries that must have been built by the crowds, giving them a true place of worship. I went in and was shocked, there were hundreds of more people than there used to be here and they were all packed into this space, just standing there. It didn't look like they had eaten anything, or slept, or moved from that spot in days. I made my way through the crowd. Coming now to the centre of the labyrinth very intentionally sacrificing any self respect I may have had. Once I got to the front I saw someone I never thought I would see again, Patel. “Patel what are you doing here I thought you were an atheist?” “I've decided I might as well take something up this time, everyone in the city has.” “Well everyone else here is crazy, are you?” “No but I stick with the crowd, it gives me food and shelter.” “Well can you take me to whoever the leader is here?” “What do you need?” “I need the answers.” “Ill take you to the prophet.” Patel led me back out through the corn maze with walls of flesh, he knew how to maneuver through it so well. He took me out which took forever, then took me through this park to the only relatively small tent. “I can't go in with you” “Why” “I have been baptized by the cosmos, he will only talk to those virgin to the stars.” 



I thanked Patel and then made my way into the tent. All there was in there was an old man sitting on a rock in front of a small pond. He was completely bald, wearing a long robe, and blind. “Hello” “Hello Neil.” He knew my name already. “Are you the prophet?” “Some people call me the prophet, some the oracle, some the moon man, some lesser minded call me a fortune teller, I will happily take on any of these names for our purposes.” “Ok Oracle” “I have foreseen you coming here, but the future paths split from there, what do you seek from coming here?” “I seek answers oracle.” He just fully launched into an explanation. “The hole opened in the sky, homunculi were not ready for it. The first man to gaze upon this hole could not live with the knowledge it granted, but the knowledge was granted only to him, and now there is no way for him to communicate it, No vessel for the hole. Humans always want answers and the fact the only one who could give it to them couldn't, caused them to find solace in false prophets. Religion is their ultimate form of escapism, they won't allow the questions gone, no matter how they are, no matter what position they place themselves in the will to continue, that's stubbornness, that's the beauty.” “Thank you oracle.” This explanation didn't help me at all. I still have no clue what's going on. I left the tent and went with Patel. “Did you find the answers you seeked?” “No, do you want to leave Patel?” “I would love to” Patel and I left the strange group of wooden churches and just started walking. We walked for hours, we just kept walking, it was night and we looked up the hole was bigger than ever. The hole has grown so large it has eclipsed the moon. I don't know if there is a moon anymore, I don't know how much of anything is still there. 



The abyss eclipsed the moon, the abyss eclipsed the sun. It may have swallowed them, it may have swallowed the entire galaxy. The abyss grew for months, it grew for years, it might have even grown for decades. Humanity changed throughout that time. It didn't develop, it stayed somewhat stagnant. Technology regressed, and people regressed. The abyss didn't care, the abyss kept growing. It eclipsed the stars, it eclipsed the planets, swallowing everything like some, foreign creature from another world. There was no more history, there were no more nations to rise or fall. There was the abyss, and the abyss was all encompassing. As humanity collectively opened its eye to the abyss, it was unable to comprehend it.

However I’m complete newbie and would appreciate your help.

I have been told that the AC has not been in use for last w years and this one is missing the remote.

Can someone advise me on what model this AC is and if replacement remotes can be brought online?

Secondly- can you advise what I need to be aware of if an AC has been sitting unused for a long period of time. Is it ok to turn it on or would I need to call out a specialist to service it?

I’ve been trying to dial in espresso on my Breville Express that I bought myself for Christmas this year and no matter what I do, my shots are **always either sour or bitter**. I’ve gone through **several pounds of coffee**, tons of water, and I’m honestly questioning whether I’m missing something fundamental or if I’ve hit a hardware limitation.

# Setup

* **Machine:** Breville Barista Express
* **Portafilter:** Bottomless (aftermarket)
* **Basket:** Single-wall
* **Scale:** Weighing dose + yield
* **Beans:** Freshly roasted specialty coffee (local roaster, rested appropriately)
* **Water:** Filtered / bottled (not tap)

# What I’ve tried

* Multiple coffees (light → medium → medium-dark)
* Fresh beans vs rested beans (7–14 days post-roast, some 2 months old)
* Grind adjustments across the full range
* Different doses (15g–18g)
* Different ratios (1:2, longer ratios, shorter)
* Temp changes (then reset to factory)
* WDT / distribution tools
* Careful tamping
* Bottomless portafilter to check for channeling

# What I’m seeing

* With fresh beans, I often get **huge crema**
* Bottomless pulls look **even** (no spraying, no obvious channeling)
* Visually the shots look “right”
* But taste-wise…
   * Hot = sharp / acidic or harsh
   * Cooling = bitterness becomes more noticeable
* Very little **body or sweetness**, even when it’s close

I recently went to a good local roaster/café where I bought some of the beans and tasted what I *think* is a properly balanced espresso so now I know what I’m aiming for. That made me realize my home shots are just never quite getting there despite watching every youtube video on the machine.

# My question

At this point, do you think:

* I’m still missing something obvious?
* This is a known **Breville Barista Express grinder limitation**?
* Or there’s a diagnostic step I haven’t done yet that could clearly isolate the issue?

I’m not trying to chase competition espresso, just a **balanced, smooth shot** that isn’t constantly sour or bitter.

I’m genuinely open to being told “it’s the grinder” *or ""you're not doing it right""* but I want to be sure before throwing more money at the problem.

My supplements have shifted over the last year but I take so many things I feel like I own everything at the health food store. In November I started taking molybdenum and things really shifted, my chemical sensitivity’s improved and my brain fog lifted in a big way. 
I have ADHD and wondered if treating it could help further with the brain fog and mental fatigue.  I asked my Dr to trial guanfacine as it can be effective at low doses and I always do better starting out slow.  

What I learned is that a majority of my symptoms are dysautonomia related, once I took .5 mg  of guanfacine I could bend over without getting fatiuged and an adrenalin rush, I tolerated chemicals better and I was able to tackle household chores like vacuuming baseboards and ceiling vents, my pantry got organized and laundry was not a  long the immense struggle.  I could now bend over to switch the loads, reach my arms above my head to fold towels and sheets, and make my bed. I had assumed I was struggling with fatigue, I did not know, more did any of my Dr’s recognize what was going on.  I went up to 1 mg and had increase improvement, but still felt like I was struggling with sensory issues and chemical exposure, my lungs were still very reactive. 

I asked my Dr to try amantidine, I was hoping that adding it in every few days might be enough to get me over the hump. It was a little bit of a struggle to talk my Dr into it, but he agreed to a 14 day trial as long as I got my blood work done to check my liver enzymes. I personally was not concerned as I wanted to try a very low dosage 25-50mg every 3 days. I determine this by the half-life of the medication.

Well it worked I now have my life back, I went to a wedding, rejoined my congragation after almost 6 years. Met up with a friend at a coffee shop. Talked with another friend for 4.5 hours in the phone started  going to the gym.

I am still very fatigued, the additional activity I have been expending it tough, but I can do it. I am functional but exhausted, and I’ll take it! 

I had an appointment today and my Dr was in shock at the change, I don’t think he knows what to think at this point. I am so proud of myself for not giving up, and continuing to dig and search for answers, to try things even if I did not know if they would work, trusting my gut, and documenting well enough my Dr’s had the confidence to follow my lead with most of my treatment choices. The med protocol I am on was custom created by me, with the information from people in this group, years of YT health content, and in the past 18 months Chat gpt. My brain fog was the worst symptom and being able to utilize a tool that allowed me to break everything down made such a difference.

I honestly can’t believe how much progress I have made in the past few weeks, I feel like I have my life back.

**T+04:18:00 (Pulse 172)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

History, Mara decided, smelled like warm plastic and burnt coffee and the faint metallic bite of stress-sweat drying on forearms. It was never incense. It was never parchment. It was fluorescent light heat and the soft, constant whir of machines that did not get afraid, even when the people around them did.

The control room had filled the way a lifeboat fills. Not with panic. With gravity. People who “weren’t on shift” had arrived anyway, drawn by the anomaly like iron filings to a magnet. Their jackets lay draped over chair backs like shed skins. Someone had brought in a bag of pastries hours ago; it sat untouched, growing stale in the corner, a small offering to a normal day that never showed.

Cables braided across the floor. Extra laptops glowed on every flat surface. A few conversations tried to start and died mid-sentence, strangled by the same thought everyone was carrying: if you look away you might miss the moment the universe snaps.

On the wall, the Sun owned the room the way it always did. A disk of impossible brightness made safe by layers of optics and code and human humility. But it no longer felt like a thing they were studying.

It felt like a thing waiting.

It had thrown its tantrum already. The knot had gone. The coronal mass ejection had peeled away with that sickening structural grace, a shell leaving as if it had been unlatched. In a normal day, the Sun would now return to its regular ugly: the familiar, comforting violence of convection and tangled fields and a thousand competing clocks that never agreed.

It did not return.

It held.

Granulation still crawled across the photosphere, but the crawling had lost its teeth. The convection cells rose and fell like they always did, yet the boundaries looked softened, as if stochastic edges had been sanded down. The flows were still flows, but they began to align in small, unearned ways, hints of organization that should not survive contact with a star’s boiling impatience.

Mara had been trained to distrust beauty in data. Beauty was often a pipeline artifact, a calibration error, a human mind forcing symmetry onto noise. But this wasn’t beauty.

This was obedience.

On her second monitor the helioseismology overlay ran like a ghosted hymn. A living cathedral of modes, all the Sun’s murmuring frequencies mapped into peaks and valleys and delicate, wandering lines. There should have been drift. There should have been phase slippage. There should have been the messy humility of a real star doing real star things.

Instead there was the spike.

A narrow, arrogant line rising out of the noise floor like a blade pulled from a sheath. Ninety seconds, unblinking. Not a bump. Not a broad swell. A peak so tight it looked inked on the page.

Pulse 172 arrived, and the disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun with the same phase it had kept for hours, a synchronized inhale that did not care about convection, did not care about differential rotation, did not care about what should happen in a turbulent plasma sphere.

It landed right where it had landed before.

It landed right where it would land again.

Jun stood beside her with his hands braced on the edge of a console, posture rigid in that way of people who have discovered their body has opinions their mind hasn’t approved yet. His voice had dropped into the register people used in churches and courtrooms and emergency rooms. Not because he was trying to be dramatic. Because loudness felt like a violation.

“It’s not decaying,” he said.

Mara didn’t answer him right away. She watched the spectrum, watched the linewidth, watched the stubborn refusal of the peak to broaden. She watched the phase lock. She watched the Sun do the one thing it never did: keep time like it meant it.

Her throat felt tight, not with fear of impact or flare. This was a different kind of dread, colder and cleaner. The dread of an equation balancing when it had no right to.

A coherent oscillation in a star should damp. That was basic. Convection should shred it. Differential rotation should smear it. Magnetic turbulence should chew it up and spit it back out as noise.

This one held as if held.

Mara forced her hands to stay still on the mouse. In her mind, a thought assembled itself from spare parts, snapping together with the ugly confidence of a machine finding its final bolt.

This isn’t relaxation.

This is a hold state.

Pulse 172 completed. The Sun breathed on schedule. The peak remained razor-thin. The room remained full of people who didn’t want to leave, because leaving would mean admitting they had no control over the next tick.

Mara felt the terror that had taken root since the CME tighten its grip, not the familiar fear that the Sun could hurt them, it always could.

Something worse.

The fear that the Sun could be handled.

And that whatever had its hand on the handle was patient enough to wait.

**T+04:30:00 (Pulse 180)**  
*NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, Boulder*

In Boulder, the word syncing had been quarantined.

Not officially. Not with a memo or a policy. It just stopped being said, the way certain words stop being said in hospitals after a bad outcome. A superstition dressed up as professionalism. As if naming the thing gave it teeth.

So people reached for safer language. Persistent periodicity. Anomalous global mode. Continued coherence signature. Phrases with enough syllables to feel like a barrier.

They said them as if vocabulary could reduce amplitude.

It didn’t.

DeShawn Patel’s world had narrowed to screens and timestamps. The operations floor was bright in that exhausting way offices are bright at night, fluorescents flattening everything into the same pale urgency. The big wall display showed the Sun in false color. Under it, a stack of plots that should have looked like weather.

They looked like a metronome.

He didn’t hear the ninety-second beat, not with his ears. The room was too full of phone rings and keyboard chatter and the dry hiss of ventilation. But he could feel the beat anyway, the way you feel a distant bass note through a wall: a repeating pressure that your body starts anticipating.

Ninety seconds.

Ninety seconds.

Ninety seconds.

The schedule board on the side monitor was useless now. Every slot labeled call had become the same call, stretched and braided into a single, sleepless thread. The phone trees weren’t waking up anymore. They were already lit, a permanent fever of headsets and quick voices and the careful cadence of people trying not to infect each other with panic.

A satellite operator from the East Coast came on the line and said, too calmly, “We’re seeing timing jitter.”

DeShawn marked it without reacting. Timing jitter happened. It belonged to the catalog of mundane problems. But then the operator added, “And it’s periodic.”

That was the poison. Not the symptom. The rhythm.

Another liaison cut in: “Sensor baselines drifting. Tiny. Like bruises in the data. Every ninety seconds.”

Then: “Power system ripple. Synchronized across components that shouldn’t be talking to each other.”

Then: “GPS-derived timing chains are clean, but the payload clocks are… responding.”

It was always that word now, slipping into reports like a confession. Responding. As if the machines were hearing something.

Nothing anyone said sounded like catastrophe. No one was yelling about losing vehicles. No one was shouting about cascading failures. The satellites weren’t dropping like flies.

But everything felt wrong in the way hair feels wrong when it stands up before thunder.

DeShawn listened to a NASA liaison try to keep their voice neutral while describing “unexpected periodic perturbations,” and he kept his own face bland because that was what ops people did. Their job was to be the boring surface above a deep, dangerous current. People borrowed calm the way they borrowed flashlights in a blackout.

Behind him, Liz leaned in just enough for him to hear her without the microphones picking it up.

“The internet thinks it’s a heartbeat now,” she muttered.

DeShawn didn’t turn. He didn’t need to. He could feel the public the way you feel pressure change before a storm hits. It was in the tension of every phone call, the new sharpness in every question. The way every conservative sentence they released got shredded online and rebuilt into something unrecognizable, something hungry. Hashtags were now doing what observatories used to do: distributing attention faster than expertise could keep up, making noise louder than signal.

He rubbed his thumb along the edge of his pen until he felt the ridge catch his skin. Grounding. A tiny physical truth in a day that kept becoming abstract.

He leaned toward the microphone and spoke into the living knot of voices.

“We need a predictive statement,” he said. His voice stayed even, not because he felt even, but because the room needed someone to sound like the floor was still there. “Something testable. Otherwise we’re just narrating.”

On the other end of the line, there was a pause. A small, human hesitation.

Then someone cleared their throat.

Not a space weather person. Not a solar seismologist. Not one of the usual voices that lived in this domain.

It was Elias Venn.

---

**T+04:31:30 (Pulse 181)**  
*Particle Physics Lab, University Office with Too Many Coffee Cups*

Elias had started printing his notes because screens felt like promises.

A screen could flicker. A screen could update. A screen could be wrong in a way you didn’t notice until you’d already believed it. Paper stayed where you put it. Paper let you circle a number until it became a bruise.

His office looked the way truth looks right before it gets accepted: messy, exhausting, and deeply unflattering. Preprints in leaning towers. A whiteboard full of half-erased integrals that had started as homework and ended as omen. Coffee cups in various stages of fossilization, the ring stains like tree lines marking the passing of hours.

Across his desk, the printouts lay spread like a nest built by an anxious bird: power spectra, phase plots, timing chains, hand-sketched diagrams of coupled oscillators. Between them were sentences that weren’t quite sentences yet, fragments he’d written as if he could trap the shape of the day by naming it fast enough.

In the center, circled so many times the ink had cut into the fibers, was a number that kept refusing to be coincidence.

320.

He held the conference headset close and spoke with the careful tone of a man trying not to get thrown out of a moving vehicle.

“I know you don’t want to hear tunneling,” he said. He could feel the room stiffen on the other end, the bristle transmitted through fiber and compression like static. “So don’t call it tunneling. Call it a state transition. Call it transport. Call it anything you can live with and still keep your eyes open.”

A solar physicist cut in immediately, sharp enough to draw blood. “You are out of field.”

Elias stared at the circled number like it might grant him permission. He swallowed once, hard.

“Yes,” he said. “I am. The star didn’t stay in its field either.”

Silence tightened. Not empty silence. The kind that gathers weight.

He pressed forward while the door was still cracked.

“This oscillation isn’t just present,” he said. “It’s behaving like a requirement. It’s not wandering the way stellar modes wander. It’s locking. That’s the point. A chaotic system can ring. A chaotic system doesn’t hold phase like this unless it’s being driven or constrained.”

He tapped the paper with his finger. The sound was small in his office, but in his mind it landed like a gavel.

“It’s acting like a coupling condition,” he continued. “Like a lock. And locks have keys. Keys have timing.”

DeShawn’s voice came through the speaker, calm and thin, the way calm sounds when it’s being rationed. “Be specific, Doctor.”

Elias felt his stomach drop because specificity meant you were leaving the safety of theory and stepping onto the ledge.

He looked down at the number again, the circle around it dense enough to look angry.

“Eight hours,” he said. “From the onset of the locked mode. Eight hours at ninety seconds per pulse is exactly three hundred and twenty cycles. That’s… too neat. If the system is being held until an external boundary condition is satisfied, then you should expect a discrete event at a discrete cycle count.”

A pause on the line. Someone breathed too close to their microphone. A faint click as someone muted themselves to swear.

A scientist said, with the flat skepticism of someone protecting their own sanity, “You’re guessing.”

Heat crawled up Elias’ neck, the old flush of embarrassment arriving even when embarrassment was a luxury. “Yes,” he said. “I’m pattern-matching. On the most hostile dataset imaginable. But it’s the kind of guess you can falsify.”

DeShawn didn’t soften it. “What event.”

Elias hesitated. He could feel the social immune system in the room lean forward, ready to quarantine him. He could already hear the jokes people would make to keep breathing. He could already see the emails tomorrow that would say thanks for your input and mean stay in your lane.

He forced the words out anyway because fear didn’t make him careful anymore. It made him honest.

“Departure,” he said. “The Sun leaves.”

For a fraction of a second, the line held a brittle hush. Then someone made a sound that might have been laughter or coughing or the beginning of a denial reflex.

A senior voice snapped, “Enough.”

Elias flinched, but he didn’t retreat. He couldn’t. The number had teeth. The phase plot had teeth. The Sun had teeth.

DeShawn didn’t snap back. He didn’t laugh. He did something worse, something that meant the room had started treating the unthinkable as a checklist item.

“If you’re right,” DeShawn asked, “do we see any precursors.”

Elias’ eyes flicked to his laptop where the metronome video still sat open, paused mid-swing, the toy demonstration that had stopped being a toy. He hated how childish it looked beside the printouts of a star refusing to decohere.

“The phase won’t drift,” he said. “Not even a little. It will stay locked all the way. And near the end… it’ll look over-controlled. Narrower linewidth. Cleaner peak. Less jitter than you have any right to see in a convective star.”

He swallowed and added, quieter, because quiet was how you said the part that mattered.

“And that will be your warning. Because it means the system isn’t persisting. It’s being held.”

Elias waited for dismissal. He waited for the polite dismissal, the professional dismissal, the kind that let everyone go back to pretending this was weather.

Instead DeShawn said, “Noted.”

Again.

Noted, the small word that meant contingency had become a file folder. A plan. A line item. A thing you prepared for without admitting you believed.

Elias sat back in his chair and felt his heart slam once against his ribs, violently human, violently messy, nothing like the Sun’s clean, obscene tick.

He didn’t feel vindicated.

He felt hunted by a number.

**T+05:12:00 (Pulse 208)**  
*Venus Orbiter Operations, Night Shift Room with Dim Lights*

By the time the bulk disturbance reached Venus, the room had stopped smelling like coffee.

Coffee was what you drank when you believed you were managing normal. Coffee was the scent of routine, of checklists and scheduled downlinks and quiet competence.

Now it smelled like sweat and warm electronics and the sharp, dry edge of fear being held in the mouth like a nail.

Night shift rooms always felt like submarines, Rina had thought when she first started doing this. Dim light to keep eyes adjusted. Low voices. Screens glowing blue like aquarium glass. A humming quiet that said: you are sealed in here with the planet.

Tonight the planet did not feel far away.

On the main display, VESPER hung in its orbit like a patient lantern, its sensors pointed down at Venus’ bruised curve. The nightside should have been a subtle thing: faint airglow, quiet chemistry, the soft leak of heat into space.

Instead the nightside was lit as if Venus had become a surface for writing.

Rina watched the induced magnetosphere compress into a shape that looked wrong even in false color. Venus didn’t have Earth’s internal shield. It borrowed one, a temporary umbrella made from the solar wind’s argument with the ionosphere. It was supposed to flex and flutter, messy and alive.

This was not flexing.

This was being crushed.

The first arrival, nearly an hour ago, had been the light-speed slap: radiation, ionization, the sudden tightening of the upper atmosphere. Sharp and immediate, like a bright flash in a dark room.

Now the heavy body came.

The slow punch after the flash.

The plots buckled as if someone had leaned their weight onto the lines. Particle counts surged. The induced tail behind the planet snapped into a tighter, narrower geometry, then reformed, then tightened again, each cycle leaving the model fits worse than before. The system was no longer behaving like a boundary being pushed.

It was behaving like a boundary being hammered.

On the ultraviolet feed, the glow that had started as ribbons became sheets. Bands of emission widened until they were less like aurora and more like floodlight spill, as if someone had poured luminous paint over the nightside and watched it crawl.

A protection banner blinked across the interface, bright and indifferent:

UV CAM: SATURATION THRESHOLD EXCEEDED  
AUTO-GAIN REDUCTION ENGAGED

Then another.

SHUTTER CYCLE LIMIT APPROACHING  
THERMAL LOAD INCREASING

VESPER tripped a protection routine. Then did it again ten minutes later.

Rina’s teammate swore under his breath, the sound muted and exhausted. He leaned closer to the screen, eyes reflecting the pale fire of the plots. His voice came out flat with disbelief, like he was reading a sentence he didn’t accept as real.

“Safe mode risk,” he said. “If the shutters keep cycling like this, we’ll cook something.”

Rina didn’t answer. Her fingers were already moving, flipping through channels, correlating time tags. She didn’t have the luxury of reacting with words. Words were for after.

The event, at this scale, was not rhythmic anymore. It was a storm. The kind of storm that made you forget there had ever been quiet.

But underneath the storm, she kept seeing it.

Buried in the noise. A ghost line threading through the chaos.

A repeating squeeze.

A repeating release.

Every ninety seconds, as if Venus’ borrowed shield had learned the Sun’s new rule and couldn’t stop obeying it.

Rina felt her throat tighten in that precise way it tightened when a coincidence became a pattern. Patterns were dangerous. Patterns meant someone upstream was touching the whole system with a steady hand.

Her eyes flicked to the timestamp and then to the next marker.

Pulse-aligned again.

She swallowed and whispered, too low for the room’s microphones to pick up.

“Boulder,” she said. “They have to see this too.”

It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a prayer. It was logistics, sharpened by dread.

She opened the message template and hesitated for one fraction of a second, because the internet had taught everyone the same bad lesson: if you name the monster, the monster becomes entertainment.

She did not write aliens.

She did not write magic.

She did not write anything that would give the world a story before it had truth.

She attached the packet: time series, instrument metadata, correlation highlights. She highlighted the obscene part, the part that did not belong:

~90 s periodic compression signature persists across storm envelope.

Then she wrote the only honest sentence she could justify.

Persistent global periodic driver still present.

Send.

The transmission icon blinked and the packet disappeared into the relay chain, racing back toward Earth at the speed of a confession.

Rina stared at Venus’ glowing nightside as another surge rolled through the plots, the magnetosphere compressing again like a lung taking a forced breath.

It wasn’t beautiful anymore, not even in the wildfire way. It was instructive. It was the planet demonstrating a principle: when the driver is global, everything downstream becomes an instrument.

She watched another ninety-second squeeze surface under the storm and understood, with sudden cold clarity, what her training had never prepared her to say.

This wasn’t weather.

Weather didn’t keep time.

---

**T+06:00:00 (Pulse 240)**  
*Public feeds, everywhere*

By six hours, the memes had aged.

They didn’t stop. Humor didn’t stop. Humor was a reflex, an involuntary flinch against terror, the mind’s way of touching a hot stove with a glove so it could pretend it wasn’t burning. But the jokes changed tone the way laughter changes tone in a hospital waiting room: still laughter, technically, but threaded with the knowledge that something irreversible might be happening behind a door you can’t open.

At first, #SunSync had been a punchline with a metronome sound. A clock emoji under a solar gif. Someone had edited a heartbeat monitor over a coronagraph loop and called it “the Sun’s Spotify Wrapped.”

Now the edits were quieter. The captions shorter. The humor stopped being clever and started being defensive.

People posted graphs like talismans.

Screenshots of power spectra with a single obscene spike circled in red, shared and reshared until the pixels broke down into blur. Someone would write, I don’t know what this means but it feels wrong, and the comment thread would become a crowd of strangers holding each other up with half-learned vocabulary and borrowed confidence.

They refreshed dashboards they didn’t understand. They learned to read timestamps the way people learn to read EKGs when someone they love is in a bed. There was comfort in the repetition, even when the repetition was the problem. Comfort in seeing the same line land in the same place again, because predictability, even when it’s monstrous, feels like a railing.

Ninety seconds.

Again.

Again.

The word coherence spread the way certain words do online, replicated faster than meaning. People used it the way they used quantum when they wanted to sound brave around something they couldn’t touch. It became a charm you could hold up like a cross.

It’s just coherence. It’s just a mode. It’s just a signal.

As if just could domesticate it.

Livestreams proliferated. Some were slick, ring-lit science communicators trying to keep their smiles from cracking. Some were shaky phone recordings of laptops. Some were nothing but a dashboard feed and a chat moving too fast to read. The world had built itself a collective window, and now it couldn’t stop looking through it.

In one corner of the internet, a prayer circle ran twenty-four hours a day. They streamed a false-color Sun and recited psalms between updates, voices soft and earnest. The chat was full of candle emojis and whispered fear dressed as faith.

In another corner, a doomsday thread collected like a storm drain, sucking in every anxiety people already carried. Prophecy quotes. Radiation maps. Old solar apocalypse movies clipped into thirty seconds of doom.

In yet another corner, calm threads tried to do what calm threads always did: hold the line. People posted explanations. They posted caveats. They posted the same safety warnings until they felt like spells.

Do not look at the Sun.  
Solar filters only.  
Do not panic.  
We don’t have evidence of immediate danger.

Every time someone typed do not panic, the replies grew sharper. Not because the statement was wrong, but because people could smell the effort behind it.

Then came the grifters.

They arrived the way vultures arrive, with unhurried certainty. A storefront link. A countdown banner. A product shot of cheap plastic and false authority.

“SunSync Protection Kit! EMF Shielding! Solar Pulse Defense! Limited stock!”

Comments flooded in, half mocking, half desperate.

This is a scam.  
What if it isn’t?  
Has anyone tested it?

Fear didn’t make everyone gullible, but it made everyone tired, and tired people reached for anything that looked like control.

Meanwhile, actual scientists begged, publicly, privately, in threads and on livestreams, in the exhausted tone of people explaining gravity to a room full of drowning.

“This is a data anomaly we are investigating.”  
“It is not visible to the naked eye.”  
“We don’t know what it means yet.”  
“Please stop staring at the Sun.”

They were answered with the internet’s favorite weapon: certainty.

“It’s aliens.”  
“It’s the military.”  
“It’s God.”  
“It’s fake.”  
“It’s the end.”  
“It’s nothing.”

Certainty was cheaper than fear.

In between the loud camps were the quiet people. The ones who didn’t post. The ones who watched. The ones who stared at a dashboard and felt their heart tick in sympathy with a star.

A nurse on break watched a live plot between patient checks and whispered, “Please stop,” like the Sun could hear her through the screen. A truck driver refreshed a feed at a rest stop and kept glancing up at the sky as if it might look different. A teenager filmed their face reacting to a graph they didn’t understand, tears coming anyway, and the comments were surprisingly gentle.

Under it all, the pulse persisted. Patient. Precise. Indifferent to meaning.

That was the part people couldn’t metabolize: the Sun wasn’t escalating, wasn’t fading, wasn’t behaving like a tantrum. It was doing a steady thing for a steady reason.

And then someone built a website.

At first it was a joke. A little black page with a yellow circle icon and a bouncing metronome. A title that tried to stay funny.

SUNSYNC PULSE COUNTER

It pulled timestamp data from public feeds and counted down to the next ninety-second tick. It had a silly sound effect you could toggle: tick… tick… tick…

It got shared as a meme in the first hour.

Then people realized the countdown hit zero exactly when the next pulse showed up on the plots.

Again.

Again.

Again.

The joke stopped being a joke and became a clock.

People opened it “just to see.” People left it running on second monitors. People put it up on TVs in bars like a sports game. People who had never cared about heliophysics in their lives started measuring their breathing against a star.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

And slowly, across continents and time zones, something changed in the collective posture of humanity: a subtle tightening, a held inhale. The feeling you get right before a roller coaster drops, when the track is still climbing but your body already knows the next shape.

Because when a universe gives you a countdown, you don’t laugh the same way anymore.

You listen.

---

**T+07:12:00 (Pulse 288)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

Mara hadn’t moved much in hours, but she felt older anyway.

Not older in the dramatic way, not the kind you could photograph. Older in the quiet, cellular way you age when your mind has been pressed up against a fact and forced to stay there until it stops flinching. Her shoulders ached from holding still. Her eyes felt sanded. Somewhere in her body a tremor lived, not visible, just present, like a motor running under the skin.

Around her, the room had settled into a late-stage vigil. People spoke less now, not because they had nothing to say, but because language had started to feel like an insult. Cables still crisscrossed the floor. Monitors still glowed. The wall still held the Sun like a pinned specimen. The pastries in the corner had become a small, stale monument to morning.

The Sun did not decohere.

It did not drift.

It did not forgive.

Those were not poetic thoughts. They were the only three lines her brain could form without lying.

Pulse 288 arrived.

The disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun with the same phase it had kept since the lock took hold, a star-sized inhale so consistent it made her teeth ache. The helioseismology spectrum updated, and the peak that should have broadened with time did the opposite.

It narrowed.

It became cleaner.

At Pulse 160 it had already been obscene. At Pulse 288 it was surgical. The linewidth had tightened again, the noise floor looking thinner not because the Sun had gotten quieter, but because the mode had gotten more perfect. The phase jitter, if you could call it that, had been reduced to a whisper.

The Sun was not relaxing into this.

It was being shepherded into it.

A word rose in her mind, unwelcome and exact, the kind of word that once spoken could not be taken back.

Over-control.

She hated it because it implied intent without evidence of a hand. It implied a feedback loop. It implied a constraint being applied with care. It implied that someone, somewhere, had learned how to put their fingers on the Sun’s own couplings and turn them like dials.

She stared at the plot until her vision tried to blur the line out of kindness. It didn’t. The universe did not offer kindness. It offered repeatability.

Jun spoke beside her without looking away from the wall, voice scraped thin from hours of trying not to panic.

“It’s getting cleaner.”

Mara’s throat tightened. She swallowed and tasted stale coffee and the metallic tang of adrenaline that refused to fully leave.

“It’s being held,” she said.

The words fell into the room like a tool dropped onto concrete. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just heavy, because everyone knew what she meant.

Held meant the persistence was not natural.

Held meant the Sun was not merely ringing.

Held meant restraint.

No one asked by what.

No one needed to.

The control room had stopped being a place where denial lived. Denial required slack, and slack was gone. The plots had taken it. The phase lock had taken it. The unwavering ninety-second tick had taken it and replaced it with something colder: inevitability.

Pulse 288 completed. The peak remained razor-thin.

Mara sat very still and felt the shape of the remaining hours gather in the room, not as a countdown on a screen, but as a pressure behind the ribs.

Like the whole planet was holding its breath.

And the Sun, perfectly coherent, kept time anyway.

---

**T+07:40:30 (Pulse 307)**  
*SWPC, Boulder*

By 7:40 p.m. the operations floor had developed its own weather.

Not solar weather. Human weather.

A dry, electric irritability that lived in the jaw and the shoulders. The kind of air you got when people had been holding their breath for so long they started resenting the fact that breathing was still required. The kind of tension that made even the hum of the HVAC feel personal.

DeShawn had kept Elias on the line for hours now, partly because the man’s pattern sense had been useful, and partly because DeShawn couldn’t shake the ugly, primitive superstition that cutting him loose would tempt fate.

Ops people didn’t believe in luck.

Ops people also didn’t slam doors on the only voice that had said the quiet part out loud and then backed it up with a number.

Around DeShawn, the room looked like it had been lived in too hard. Headsets abandoned and reclaimed. Coffee cups with shaky lids. A stack of printed plots pinned to a whiteboard like evidence in a case nobody wanted to solve. People moved, but their movements had started to change. Less smooth. More clipped. As if the Sun’s ninety-second tick had begun to infect their muscles.

Somewhere, someone snapped at a printer for jamming.

Somewhere else, a chair squealed as a scientist pushed back too abruptly and then stood there, hands braced on the desk, staring at the wall display like it had insulted them personally.

The Sun, on every screen, kept behaving.

Kept breathing on schedule.

Kept ticking.

And the longer it ticked, the more it felt like provocation.

That was the part nobody had trained for: the emotional insult of an inanimate thing acting on purpose. A star was supposed to be indifferent chaos. A star was allowed to be dangerous, but not disciplined. Not this. Not an eight-hour demonstration of obedience, as if it had decided to become a device.

DeShawn caught the shift moving through the room in small, ugly stages.

First disbelief. Bright and frantic. The early scramble to find the error.

Then bargaining. The desperate love affair with mundane explanations: timing drift, pipeline issues, aliasing.

Then exhaustion. The long, gray plateau where people stopped trying to explain and started just watching.

And now… anger.

Not theatrical anger. The angrier kind. The kind that sits behind the teeth and makes a person whisper at the screen like it can hear them.

Stop.

As if the Sun owed them that.

On the conference line, Elias sounded different too. Not calmer. Sharper. Like fear had finished burning off everything unnecessary and left only the blade.

“It’s narrowing,” he said. “Look at the linewidth.”

A solar seismologist answered, voice thin and rubbed raw by repetition. “We see it.”

Elias didn’t waste relief on them. Relief was a luxury for people whose universe still allowed ignorance.

“Then it’s not decaying,” he said. “It’s being maintained to a threshold.”

A senior scientist cut in immediately, the tone brittle with the last scraps of denial. “Stop. We don’t know that.”

Elias spoke anyway, because he had run out of patience for politeness and politeness had stopped being a tool.

“You don’t get a star to behave like a metronome for eight hours without a coupling mechanism that persists,” he said. His words came fast but controlled, like he’d rehearsed them in his head a hundred times to make them survivable. “You don’t get this level of phase fidelity without an external constraint or a non-natural attractor. If you need a sentence you can say on record without choking, here it is: the Sun is in a forced global mode that is stable in time.”

Someone on the line made a quiet noise, a sound halfway between scoff and grief. DeShawn didn’t bother looking up; the room was full of those sounds now, suppressed reactions leaking through professionalism like water through a crack.

DeShawn’s eyes drifted to a side screen where one of the analysts had pulled up the pulse counter.

It had started as internet nonsense. A joke page with a metronome icon and a bouncing number.

Now it sat in the corner of a federal operations center like a weaponized calendar.

320.  
A big number, centered, and beneath it a smaller line: pulses remaining.

DeShawn stared at it for a beat longer than he meant to, and felt something sour rise in his chest. Anger again, but not at Elias, not at the staff, not even at the internet.

At the absurdity of having to count down your own star like a rocket launch you never approved.

Elias’ voice came through again, softer now.

And softness, DeShawn had learned, was what people used when they were about to say something unforgivable.

“Thirty-nine pulses,” Elias said.

No one laughed.

The jokes had all died hours ago, not from maturity, but from fatigue. Humor required the belief that the thing you were joking about would, eventually, return to normal.

The Sun was still ticking.

Liz, standing just behind DeShawn’s chair, whispered the closest thing to prayer she ever allowed herself at work.

“Jesus.”

DeShawn didn’t say Jesus. Ops people lived in verbs. Verbs were control. Verbs were the thin illusion that you could still do something.

He pressed his thumb into the edge of the desk until he felt the sting.

Then he spoke into the room, voice level because level was what other people leaned on.

“Prepare for loss of signal,” he said.

A few heads snapped toward him. A couple of people blinked as if the sentence had physically struck them.

Someone said, too fast, “Loss of what signal?”

DeShawn didn’t look at them. He looked at the plots. At the narrow peak that kept narrowing. At the phase lock that kept refusing to drift. At the Sun’s pulse landing with the same indifferent precision, again and again, like a metronome that had never heard of mercy.

“The Sun,” he said, because there was no point pretending now. “Prepare for loss of the Sun.”

The room went quiet in the way rooms went quiet right before bad news became official.

Somewhere a phone buzzed with a notification. Someone else’s hand shook as they reached for a coffee that had gone cold hours ago. The countdown number sat on the side screen like a staring eye.

39 pulses.

And underneath the anger in the air, beneath the irritation and the snapped voices and the clenched fists, DeShawn felt it settle into the room like snow: the next stage, arriving on schedule, the way everything did now.

Grief.

Not for what they had lost yet.

For what they were about to watch happen, and could do nothing to stop.

And the Sun, perfectly coherent, kept ticking anyway.

I’m going to a cafe, having my own solo brunch first, and then slotting these guys in for 30-45 minutes each.

Since there’s a hard stop for each of them, do I be transparent that I have another date coming up? Or telling them my friends is going to meet me after 15 minutes. (Some people might offer nicely to wait for my friends together.)

I think being transparent is not that big of an issue, since coffee date is essentially a quick low effort meet up. I usually don’t even consider it being a real date. And I’d be fine if the other person is going to another date at the same location. Because I consider it being just a meet up. I already told each one of them that they have 30-45 mins. And want to ask them that are they ok with me stacking dates. But my friends are telling me not to be transparent.

If anyone has ever done this, please give me some advice. Thanks!

I used to just decline coffee dates, to me it shows the other person is not that interested, and only wants a low effort meet up. But now I consider it’s a quick casual way to meet people. Should I just decline?

So I just reached NOLA early this morning and I’m here for another 4 days. I’m also vegetarian and celebrating my 30th on Monday. I’m looking for a rejuvenating and empowering trip to start my third decade. I’m an introvert who is slowly easing into socializing. I’ve always been weird about birthdays, but I really do want to celebrate myself and this milestone!

So far, I’ve walked around the French Quarter, had breakfast and coffee at Café du Monde, lunch at Manolito, then went along the Mississippi Riverwalk all the way to the Mardi Gras Museum, which was okay. I did a voodoo ghost tour, got a psychic reading (on Chartres St), and I’m heading over to Commander’s Palace for dinner. I’m staying on Canal St at HI, which has been great.

I’m a little chaotic, but I want to check out some bars on Bourbon and Frenchmen tomorrow and visit Garden District. Other things on my agenda include JAMNOLA, the WWII Museum, and a jazz cruise (the evening before my birthday).

I’m not entirely sure what other recommendations are must-dos so introverts can also have a good time in NOLA. Also, any must-eat vegetarian spots would be much appreciated! I saw OLIVE and Sweet Soulfood on HappyCow.

Thank you all in advance!

* Meetups should be (mostly) free. Ordering coffee, similar minimum items from a menu excepted, but events that charge formal admission or an entry fee cannot be publicized here.
* Some meetups use a sign to give attendees an easy way to see the group and know which to join without too much embarrassment, etc.",3,1767922217.0,exmormon,2,0.8,False
1q7um2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1q7um2k/all_in_the_family_episode_on_the_manson_trial/,All in the Family episode on the Manson trial,"Here’s an original All in the Family episode set in 1971, built around the household watching coverage of the Manson Family trial. I’ll keep the tone authentic to Norman Lear’s style: funny, uncomfortable, politically charged, and ultimately character-driven—using the trial less for lurid detail and more as a cultural mirror.

⸻

ALL IN THE FAMILY

Season 2–style episode

Title: “The Long-Hairs Are on Trial”

(Aired: 1971)

⸻

COLD OPEN

INT. BUNKER LIVING ROOM – EVENING

The TV is on, showing a black-and-white news broadcast. The anchor speaks solemnly.

ANCHOR (TV)
Today in Los Angeles, testimony continued in the Charles Manson murder trial—

Archie Bunker stands in front of the TV, blocking it completely.

EDITH (O.S.)
Archie, you’re standin’ right in front of the television.

ARCHIE
That’s because I don’t wanna see it! I just wanna hear how bad it is!

MIKE (from the couch)
That’s the first time you’ve ever said that about the news.

ARCHIE
Oh, very funny, Meathead. Laugh it up. Meanwhile, the whole country’s goin’ to pot because we let a buncha dirty hippies run wild!

EDITH (carrying snacks)
Oh Archie, they ain’t all hippies. Some of ‘em are just… well… crazy.

ARCHIE
That’s what I’m sayin’! They look crazy!

GLORIA
Dad, looks don’t make someone a murderer.

ARCHIE
Tell that to the judge, little girl.

CUT TO OPENING THEME

⸻

ACT ONE

INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER

Everyone is seated now. Archie grudgingly allows the TV to be seen.

On-screen, Charles Manson appears, smiling strangely.

EDITH
Oh my… he looks so small.

ARCHIE
That’s how they get ya. Like Hitler. Or them Beatles.

MIKE
Did you just compare Charles Manson to the Beatles?

ARCHIE
They all got the same haircut!

GLORIA
Dad, those people murdered strangers.

ARCHIE
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. And whose fault is that? Society’s! You let kids grow their hair, next thing you know they’re livin’ on communes and listenin’ to the devil!

MIKE
Or maybe it’s because people like Manson prey on lost kids who’ve already been beaten down by the system.

ARCHIE
Oh sure. Now the murderers are the victims.

EDITH (softly)
I don’t understand how he made all those girls listen to him.

MIKE
That’s the scary part, Edith. He didn’t force them. He convinced them.

The room grows quiet for a moment.

⸻

ACT TWO

INT. LIVING ROOM – NEXT DAY

The TV shows courtroom sketches of the female defendants, smiling.

GLORIA
I read one of them used to be a straight-A student.

ARCHIE
Yeah? So was Al Capone probably.

MIKE
Actually, Archie, a lot of them came from broken homes.

ARCHIE
Oh here we go—another sob story! When I was growin’ up—

EDITH
Archie… maybe it is sad.

Everyone looks at Edith, surprised.

EDITH (CONT’D)
I mean… nobody’s born wantin’ to hurt people. Something must’ve gone awful wrong.

ARCHIE
Edith, they stabbed people! They didn’t trip over a rake!

EDITH
I know that! I’m just sayin’… I keep thinkin’ of their mothers.

A beat.

GLORIA
Mom…

MIKE
That’s actually very insightful, Edith.

ARCHIE
Don’t encourage her, Meathead.

⸻

ACT THREE

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT

Archie sits alone at the table, reading the paper. Headline: “MANSON DEFENDS HIMSELF.”

Edith enters with coffee.

EDITH
Archie… do you think people like him are born bad?

Archie snorts.

ARCHIE
Course not. Nobody’s born bad.

Edith blinks—this is unexpected.

ARCHIE (CONT’D)
They’re born normal… and then the world fills their head with garbage.

EDITH
So… you don’t think it’s just the long hair?

Archie sighs.

ARCHIE
No.
(beat)
But it sure don’t help.

Edith smiles gently.

⸻

ACT FOUR

INT. LIVING ROOM – FINAL SCENE

The verdict is being discussed on TV.

ANCHOR (TV)
—closing arguments expected later this week.

Archie turns off the TV.

ARCHIE
That’s enough. I can’t watch it no more.

GLORIA
Why not?

Archie hesitates.

ARCHIE
Because… I don’t like thinkin’ about how messed up people can get.

A rare moment of vulnerability.

MIKE
That’s why we have to talk about it.

ARCHIE
Don’t push it, Meathead.

They sit in silence.

Edith pats Archie’s arm.

EDITH
At least we’re together.

Archie grunts, but doesn’t pull away.

⸻

TAG SCENE

INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER

Archie flips channels. Lands on a music show—a long-haired rock band performing.

ARCHIE
See? This is where it all starts.

The band smiles and sings peacefully.

EDITH
They sound nice.

Archie watches for a moment… then reluctantly nods.

ARCHIE
Yeah…
(beat)
But I still wouldn’t trust ‘em with a fork.

FREEZE FRAME. END CREDITS.

⸻

If you want, I can:
	•	Make it sharper or darker, closer to the show’s most controversial episodes
	•	Write it as a full shooting script with stage directions and laugh cues
	•	Do a companion episode where Archie reacts to Helter Skelter becoming a bestseller
	•	Or explore how Gloria personally reacts as a young woman watching the trial
