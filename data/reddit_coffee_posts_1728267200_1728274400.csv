He’s a chef who encountered a guy asking him for 5 euro to drink coffee. Tom said I can buy you coffee just come with me. The guy said “no I drink coffee from a specific coffee shop” Tom asked why, guy sajd “ give me the 5 for coffee or don’t waste my time. Tom gives him the money and the guy was shocked and happy

The guy later explains to Tom that nobody in Germany talks to him.  He says hi to people but nobody bothers engaging in any further convo than a basic hello .

The man who serves him coffee is the only person who talks to him and he gets to share what’s on his heart because he feels crippling loneliness.

So I started my coffee journey not so long ago and pourover in particular quite recently. At first I thought it tested quite weak and bland, but now I love it ! I now mostly use a v60 dripper with freshly roasted and ground beans and the results are regularly very enjoyable. 

I visited Starbucks over the weekend with my wife and as it was late I bought a decaf, hand drip so a pourover method. 

Honestly I didn't enjoy it. It tasted burnt and very bitter. I'm maybe going over the top, but it made me think of cigarettes (tobacco) which I hate. Even my wife who is not a coffee drinker said it was soooo bitter and burnt. 

Now maybe it is because it was a decaf ? I have never tried Black coffee at Starbucks so it was the first time. Usually I get frappucino or juices which I mostly enjoy. But now I'm quite hesitant at experimenting a normal caffeinated coffee there if it tastes the same as this decaf. 

What are your thoughts about Starbucks, reddit People ?

I'm a Male (34)

I met a girl (A) at work and we ended up hanging out outside of work the other day with another coworker (B). Girl (A) was very touchy and did and said things that weren't ""normal"" in my eyes. She cleaned her glasses using my jumper, she touched me subtly over the course of the night until eventually her legs where resting against mine as we were sitting next to each other.

This sounds embarrassing to talk about and the answer is probably so obvious but these situations have never worked out for me because i either never to anything about because i shut down, or eventually realised maybe the girl was interested but by the time i do something about it, i get rejected. Which leaves me even more confused.

Are people generally touchy and flirty like this without romantic intent? Or is she interested in me? I wanted to ask a community as soon as possible this time so i don't keep repeating my reactions and responses to this behaviour.

As for girl B who is also from work, we used to hang out outside of work one on one and i thought we connected very well. She said to me on our first outing outside of work ""i feel like I've known you my whole life"" and planned ""a coffee date"" the following week. But when we went back to work, this were awkward and when i asked if she was still interested in doing something, she asked if she could invite another coworker (funnily enough, turned out to be girl A. But she didn't end up coming along). Girl B also mentioned that we finish each others sentences. So i eventually said i like her and she said she thought this was platonic.

These sorts of situations always leave me paralysed in doing anything because I can never get a clear enough sign (or i do get a clear sign but always miss the moment). I'm always so confused and defeated because i have no idea how to navigate through these moments.

If anyone has any advice, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance 🙏

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case and it was just the beginning of my recovery. Sometime in the first week of September, I had a panic attack due to drinking some coffee and the symptoms very much resembled what greening out had felt like. For that first week of having DPDR, it was HELL. I couldn't talk without this shaking in my voice, the world felt like it was slowly slipping away from me, and I spent all those nights with a pain in my chest from all the panic. However, since that initial week, I have only gotten better. I won't lie though, my biggest breakthrough was right after having the worst panic attack of my life, to the point where I ended up in the ER (a large price to pay just to be diagnosed with chronic anxiety). This was an especially confusing time considering that I had thought I was getting better and nearing the end of this hell. If anything, the DPDR came back stronger...for only two hours though. After that, I found myself always so close, yet so far from finding myself again. I keep pushing myself to go out more and do the things that I love. DPDR doesn't define me as a person right now; it's a phase and my awareness of that is what keeps me going. My only thing now is that while I feel much more grounded in reality, I can actively feel my brain trying to fight off the DPDR. I know that I'm okay and that nothing is going to hurt me, but there's something in the back of my mind that is preventing me from reaching the finish line. I'm sure that I'm probably reaching a short phase of a plateau, which doesn't bother me at all. I'm still optimistic that I will come back to my normal self again because I genuinely feel my happiness and joy coming back into my life again. But for those who have recovered or are recovering, did/do you feel your brain feel like it was trying to break free from DPDR? I can't tell if this is a sign of recovery or not...Either way, I know I'm getting better and I'm going to come out of this stronger! :)

All I know is that I am part of the ""Fix Me."" program.","I’ve been on bus journeys, but not ones with seemingly no destination—ones I didn’t even remember boarding.

I woke with my head against an ice-cold window, overlooking a crystal blue sky. 

The shade was a color I couldn’t name, like it existed only in my mind. 

The sun, more of a blur, sat as a glowing ball of light over the horizon. It was the perfect day, as if photoshopped and stuck to the window.

I can’t remember what roused me from sleep. Maybe the sun in my eyes, its golden rays flickering behind my lashes. 

There were other passengers, but I couldn’t see their faces—just silhouettes, three of them. I squinted, searching for a familiar face, but found nothing but faceless, almost inhuman beings basking in sunlight. Strangely, I didn’t panic. I felt numb.

The good kind of numb.

It’s strange to wake up with no memory, yet enough of one to recognize this feeling—like my veins were filled with stars, like the ceiling tiles I once counted. 

Being a blank slate was oddly relieving. For a moment, I drifted in that sensation, before my thoughts fogged again.

I blinked, counting the squares on the seat in front of me. One. Two. Three. Four. Five… What came after five? Oh yeah, six.

I laughed, a familiar laugh that echoed from memories where I wasn’t used to counting anything without being high. 

I shaded my eyes, but my arms didn’t move. They stayed in my lap, though I could’ve sworn I lifted them. That made me laugh again. Then I pressed my face against the window and realized the road in front of us was bleeding into the sky. 

No real path. That’s when the first pricks of panic crept up my spine, and the numbness began to fade.

I tried to move but couldn’t. Nothing bound me, but it felt like something invisible was holding me down. I scanned the bus for a door. Panic hit in waves. But there was no door.

“We apologize, Kiera,” a mechanical voice crackled from an intercom. “To avoid complications, we ask you stay as still as possible, or we will administer additional sedatives.”

“What?”

My lips felt wrong, the words more mental than physical. In front of me, one of the passengers lunged from their seat in panic, only to blink back to their original position. 

“Attempt three,” the voice said. “Now proceeding with Protocol 45ZE. Welcome, Kiera. My name is Allison, your personal nurse. I am part of the Fix Me program, designed to heal sick minds by entering the hippocampus. I’m here to help you. With my assistance, we’ll revisit polluted parts of your mind where I’ll place a protective filter.”

Her words didn’t make sense. My panic surged. Outside, the sky darkened slightly.

“I don’t understand.”

“It will worsen with stronger emotions,” Allison said. “Relax. You went on vacation with your mother in the fall of 2003. You loved the sky meeting the sea. Would you like to see it? Just look out the window and calm down.”

Tears pricked my eyes—tears that felt wrong.

“That’s why we’re here,” Allison continued. “Your current mental state is severed. Without completing the Fix Me program, you’ll remain here.”

“Where is *here*?”

Allison ignored me. “Five years ago, you experienced severe trauma, Kiera.”

“Stop,” I whispered.

“Kiera, we can’t help you without revisiting these memories so we can remove them. We can only complete this action with your consent.”

A bird slammed into the window suddenly, with a sickening splat, exploding on impact. 

I watched sharp beads of red drip down the pane, my stomach starting to twist. It was just one anomaly. The sky was still bright, and the sun was shining.

But that single crack splintering the perfect world around me had already crept its way into my mind, twisting and contorting my thoughts.

“You can make it go away, Kiera,” Allison hummed. “As you can see, due to your mind starting to process your past trauma, this world will, of course, grow unstable with these thoughts."" she paused. 

""That is a side effect of entering the subconscious mind and the memories we have temporarily filtered for your well-being. But they cannot hurt you. Just like with the bird, you can wish it away.”

I didn't respond. 

“I will now begin attempt three of the 45ZE Protocol. You were in your senior year and were in the school play, correct?""

*Yes.*

""Kiera, if you start to feel discomfort, you are free to stop the procedure. If you are able to proceed, we will begin. Do not worry; it will be like dreaming. If you would like, I can play soothing music or certain songs you have enjoyed. Rain sounds are also optional…”

Allison’s voice was practically white noise in my head because… yes. I was. 

As if a switch had been pulled inside my mind, I was remembering this specific part of my life. 

The backdrop of the picturesque landscape outside of the bus window bled away, and I was seventeen years old again, standing in a mostly empty corridor.

I wasn’t sure how technologically advanced Allison’s program was, but this wasn’t just a memory, like reliving it in a dream. I felt everything my past self did: annoyance, maybe some anger boiling, a headache brewing behind my eyes—and kind of hungry. I had a cereal bar for breakfast and didn’t bother with lunch. 

Now I was deeply regretting rejecting Mom’s pancakes. It was my senior year, and usually, I couldn’t wait to get home from school and nap, but I had drama club.

Initially, I joined because of my raging crush on a senior. When she left for college, though, I found myself kind of stuck.

Still, it was a club.

Mom was driving me crazy about my college applications and making sure they were perfect, so that meant taking extracurriculars. The drama club was the only one I could tolerate. Even if the club was full of pretentious smartasses.

An over-exaggerated sigh sliced into my thoughts.

*“No.”*

Speaking of pretentious smartasses…

In front of me was the embodiment of the kid who asked for more homework, but an enigma in himself. Wylan Cameron was the teacher’s pet, but he was also somehow captain of the baseball team, class valedictorian, and maintained being a fairly popular guy. I couldn’t see why.

Not exactly conventionally attractive, he reminded me more of a sewer rat who just happened to find a sherpa jacket.

The kid thought having greasy hair and an obsession with musicals was somehow a personality. 

Wylan was sewer-rat cute until he opened his mouth—and annoyingly, was assistant director of our third school play. 

All inquiries went through him before they were passed on to our teacher. 

Unfair, because the guy was clearly biased.

As usual, he was taking his role of assistant director way too seriously, clutching his copy of the school play’s new script a little too tight. We had all been in the dark about what the play was, but not Wylan. He had received his copies several days before, and—yep. 

I could glimpse a blur of yellow highlighter. He had already started to edit, even though we had been told multiple times not to touch the scripts.

I spent almost all of lunchtime trying to track down the asshole, and from the look on his face, he had been intentionally avoiding me.

“But…”

His voice was deadpan as usual. “We don’t need new members. I've gotta get to class–”

“You were looking for members yesterday!”

“Didn't you get my text?” He frowned, his gaze flicking to my shirt. His lips curled into a slight smirk. “You've spilled coffee on your shirt.”

Pulling my sweater over the brown stain spattering my collar, I ignored him. “I was asleep.”

Wylan did that annoying fucking head tilt thing. “And that's *my* fault because…?”

I had to bite back a hiss of frustration. “Can’t you tell me face-to-face like a normal human being?""

He made a big show of rolling his eyes. “Okay, fine,” Wylan folded his arms. 

“Your friend is weird, Key. I think I speak for everyone in the group when I say her ‘predictions’"" — he quoted the air with two fingers, mocking a grin — ""are no longer welcome.”

Wylan Cameron was trying to keep a straight face, but even he was unnerved. He stepped closer to me, and I caught a slight whiff of peanut butter cream. 

It had been three days since my best friend dumped her peanut butter milkshake over his head in the middle of the cafeteria, insisting it was for “protection,” and that “he was already going down a dark path, and he needed to be purified.”

*“Purified?!”* Wylan had spat through rivulets of chocolate syrup pooling down his face. *“You've got to be fucking kidding me.”*

Lily only hugged him, squeezing him to her chest. 

“Your safe now!” she squeaked, “From the darkness coming to swallow you up.”

The guy was surprisingly chill– especially when he had a cafeteria full of eyes watching him. He was the class valdictrian, so of course he wasn't allowed to kill her. 

“Thanks *Lily*.”

If looks could kill, my best friend was a dead girl walking. 

Wylan was the third drama club member to get a milkshake dumped over them. 

I managed to avoid it, but only because I followed Lily’s instructions and bathed in a tub full of salt. 

Lily did act kind of strange, but I knew she was doing it because she cared about us. The milkshakes were one thing, but when she started spraying satanic symbols all over our desks and screaming at us to avoid the one named A, I started to get a little worried. It was getting harder to justify her actions.

“Go on,” Wylan was waiting, tapping his feet. “I can't wait for your excuse this time.”

I chewed the inside of my lip. “She was protecting you,” I said, mimicking Lily’s words. “They were, um, protection runes.”

He nodded slowly. “You're the reason why I have no hope for the human race.”

When the boy tried to walk away, I grabbed his wrist.

“Can you just listen to me?”

To his credit, he did actually stop. Sure, he was rolling his eyes and acting like an ass, but he *was* hearing me out. I knew the boy was going to say *it*, and I had no way of stopping him, because in my mind, I was scared of Lily, and her *predictions* too. Wylan sighed, tipping his head back. 

“In case you don't remember–” 

“It was three days ago.” I muttered. 

His lips formed a small smile. “You're as scared as me.” he murmured. I wasn't expecting him to get super close, his breath tickling my cheeks. “Admit it,” 

Wylan’s words were like knives penetrating my spine. “What she said about us– and then specifically you– rattled you to the fucking core.”

I thought back to the day prior. 

Lily was kneeling on the floor, screaming, her hands clawing at her hair. 

“You're all going to fall,” she kept shrieking at us, jumping to her feet and backing away from us, like she was *scared* of us. 

When Wylan tried to hug her, tried to tell her everything was okay, she slapped him across the face, drawing blood. 

I knelt in front of her and cradled my best friend’s face, but her eyes were blank, unseeing, her screams rattling my skull. 

“Get away from me!” she shoved me back, dropping to her knees and shuffling back on her hands, like a wild animal. 

I could still hear Lily’s screams in the back of my head. 

Shaking away the memory, I fixed Wylan with a smile. 

“She was…” I trailed off, my gut twisting into knots. 

“She called us *monsters*, Key.” 

“Yeah,” I said, “But she didn't mean it.”

Wylan did the head tilt thing again, though this time it was more of a sympathy pout. 

“She's out of the club.” he blew a strand of hair out of his eyes, “For all our sanity.”

With a final smile which was more of a grimace, he turned and walked away. “Sorry!”

He spun around. “Actually, I'm *not* sorry. I’m seventeen years old, and over the past few weeks I've been repeatedly told that *I* am the catalyst for the end of the world.”

“We all were.” I said, dryly. 

His expression challenged me. “I was also assaulted.”

“We *all* were!” I snapped, slowly losing my patience. 

He twisted around, walking away. “She's *out*.”

I couldn't resist getting the last word. “You're an asshole, Wylan.”

He didn't turn around. “Nice talking to you as always!”

When I didn’t move, he motioned for me to follow him. “Are you coming?” Wylan waved the scripts. “Miss Beck is revealing what play we’re doing, and I know you don’t want to be tardy..” he paused for effect like *he* was the main character. “Agaiiiiin.”

He was never going to let my one tardy go. 

It was at the beginning of the semester and I had the stomach flu. 

People like him, however, expected me to drag myself to the club, projectile vomiting or not.

But one missed attendance meant being kicked out. The drama club took themselves (way) too seriously. 

“Sure.” I caught up to him, keeping my distance. As usual, Wylan was as douchey as always, corking in his earphones. When I tried to make idle conversation, he made half-assed hand gestures, mouthing, “I can’t hear you.”

Drama club was in full swing when we entered the auditorium. Thankfully, our school was an arts school, so we had a state-of-the-art drama department and a professional-looking stage. 

Mrs. Beck, our drama teacher, a woman in her early thirties who was textbook millennial, sat on the edge of the stage with her legs swinging. 

When Wylan and I hurried in, the group twisted around to frown at us like we had just returned with an extra limb. 

Jesse, the class clown, made an “eyyyy” noise, like it was comedy genius that we were late, while Alyssa and Nina in the front row rolled their eyes and tutted.

Alyssa was every theatre kid cliché, but she was actually nice. 

Nina was the quiet kid. 

It took Wylan a moment to realize we were in trouble, and after shooting an accusing look at me, he quickened his pace into a stumbling run, practically thrusting the scripts in our teacher’s face, and took his seat.

“We’re five minutes early,” he said, when I had jumped into a seat at the front. 

Mrs. Beck was doing that thing she always did when she was making a huge deal of a latecomer. She didn’t speak for a moment, making a point to glare at us.

First, she took a chunk out of Wylan.

“Mr. Cameron, I expect everyone to be at least ten minutes early when I make announcements.”

“But..."" he chuckled nervously. You're not making an announcement, Mrs Beck.""

“When I'm *about* to make an announcement!” she snapped. 

Wylan looked like he was going to cry—which was a plus for me. 

He pretended to go through his bag, but I could definitely see his shaky hands.

“Um, right. Sorry.”

I made the mistake of laughing, and the boy twisted around, shooting me the finger. 

*Coward.* I mouthed back. 

Wylan’s expression crumpled. Under the stage light, each strand of his hair ignite into vivid red. *What?* He mouthed back. 

*You know what!*

Wylan just turned away with a scoff, though I definitely saw his lips twitch. 

When I was smiling like an idiot behind my playbook, the teacher turned her attention to me.

“Kiera.” She made a deal of clearing her throat. “What is your excuse? I’ve said this before: the theatre does not wait for latecomers. If you were in a professional production right now, you would have a stand-in to take your place, and you would be fired and jobless.” 

Jesse burst out laughing in front of me, cackling behind his script, and she threw one directly at his face.

“That is the way the real world works, Mr Emory.""

“It’s not like I even want to be an actor,” I muttered under my breath.

“What was *that*?”

I was about to reply when Jesse dropped a copy of the playbook on his face, blowing a raspberry. “Dude, we’re in high school. it’s not that deep.”

Mrs Beck hit him again. Playfully, but hard enough to rouse his head up. 

“That’s enough, Jesse. I will treat you like adults. The theatre does not employ children.” 

She took an exaggerated breath. “Anyway! Please turn to page one, and I will finally reveal what play we will be performing this year.”

There was a low murmur of voices, and I opened up the playbook.

Mrs. Beck stepped into the light, and part of me, the splintered parts of me, shivered. 

“Introducing: Raw. An original production written and scripted by yours truly.”

I was half-aware of my physical body still on the bus, and the low hum of the engine.

There was a sudden loud noise, what sounded like a splat—and I jumped, partly recoiling from the memory.

“Kiera?”

Allison’s voice was a soft hum. “Keep going. You’re okay. As I said, as memories start to show themselves to you, you will have a negative reaction. The birds are simply your mind’s way of dealing with coming to terms with selected trauma.”

What?

“The play,” Allison said. “As we go deeper, your mind will grow progressively more erratic. Please remember these memories cannot hurt you. It will seem like it, of course, but they are just that: memories. We have also applied a protective layer to ensure you are not directly influenced by them. Your mental state is currently at 46%. We need you to at least be at 98.”

A question dawned on me.

*In the real world… did I do something bad?*

“You are a severe case, Kiera. Would you like to know what you have been convicted of while under this influence?”

*Convicted of? What did I do?*

“Right at this stage in your memory, you are at 100%. What we are going to attempt to fix is where you are 2%... then 1%... and then—”

Her voice seeped away once again, just as sunlight began to illuminate the backs of my eyes.

The memory returned. This time, though, I was far more cautious, easing my way into it. Opening my eyes once again, I was greeted by the stage lights and Nina’s blonde ponytail at the corner of my eye. 

I turned to hiss at Jesse to stop chewing on his pen—and caught Wylan’s eye, who lifted his playbook to hide his face.

“Raw,” Mrs. Beck announced, “follows the story of a group of high school students who, during their summer vacation, get trapped in a small, extremely suffocating bathroom.”

“Wait.” Jesse held up his pen.

“No questions until the end, Jesse.”

“Isn’t this, like, a messed-up manga?”

“Copyright infringement,” Wylan coughed, hiding behind his script.

“You're talking about a creepypasta,” Alyssa said, not turning around, though I could see her smirk. “Which turned out to be fake.”

Jesse scowled. “Yeah, I know that one. I’m talking about the one with the... you know... I saw a YouTube video about it. Didn't they all, like, gruesomely kill each other?”

“Ooh, yes!” Nina jumped in. “I heard about that!”

“Kids!” Mrs. Beck clapped her hands like we were preschoolers. “I am trying to read!”

Wylan cleared his throat, peeking from behind his playbook. “I thought we weren’t kids? You *did* make a huge deal about saying we were adults.” He paused. “I mean, I'm saying what everyone else is thinking.”

I thought Mrs. Beck was going to throw the playbook in his face. 

“Onto the actual work! The story of Raw introduces us to our main leads, Violet and her boyfriend, Ben. I usually hold auditions for main parts. However, this year, we are on a deadline. The parts of Violet and Ben will, of course, be played by our talented…” she made a dramatic pause, and we all collectively leaned forward.

Her smile widened. “...Well, they will be revealed at the end.”

I let out an annoyed breath along with everyone else.

Shooting a look at Alyssa, the two of us mutually decided that we were each the lead girl. I smiled at her. Violet was mine.

As Mrs. Beck continued with the story, however, I started to regret raising my hand when she teased us with Violet’s part. Even Wylan looked kind of sick when I glanced at him as Mrs. Beck graphically described classmates brutally killing each other, then killing themselves in progressively more messed-up ways. 

I’d actually be pretty happy being a background character—maybe the girl right at the start who slammed her head into a mirror and died of a head injury.

“Uh, Mrs. Beck?”

Wylan interrupted her when she started talking about certain needs being met, and the philosophical question of, “What do we need to survive?”

“Yes, Wylan?” Her eyes glittered. No doubt she was waiting for praise.

He stood up. “You did clear this with the principal, right?” I noticed he’d turned half of his playbook into an origami swan. 

“I love the idea, but isn’t this a little...?” He shrugged. “I mean, I’m not trying to be offensive, but isn't it kind of maybe a little–”

“Graphic?” Jesse finished, frowning at his book.

Mrs Beck smiled, and her smile made me feel a little sick. “Children. It is the Lord of The Flies of your generation! Yes, I managed to get approval from the principal, as long as we stay PG friendly.”

Wylan grinned, slumping down. “Cool! In that case, I’ll take the role of Ben.”

“So, they really did all that in the school bathroom?” Alyssa sounded horrified, but a little impressed.

“To survive, yes.”

“Gross!” She laughed. “So, it’s like Lord of the Flies—but worse?”

Admittedly, the play did grow on me, due to the sheer absurdity of the plot, which caused us to start laughing at parts, while others hid behind their playbooks. 

By the end, we gave a standing ovation. Not because it was good, but because we all agreed the play was going to be a blast to be in. Parts were announced. 

Wylan got Ben, obviously. 

His smug smile pissed me off. 

Alyssa got the part of Violet because she was a drama queen, and being Alyssa, she made a huge deal out of it, even making a Vine and dragging all of us into it.

“Hartley High’s 2014 drama class!” we were all forced to say, wrapping our arms around each other like we were in fucking *Friends*.

The rest of us discovered our roles a week later, when they were posted on the notice board in comic sans.

HARTLEY HIGH SCHOOL PRESENTS: “RAW”

Performers as follows:

Violet Smith — Alyssa McIntyre.
Ben Cross — Wylan Cameron.
Ethan Holding — Jesse Emory.
Malia Carson — Kiera Jarret.
Sunny Shields — Wendy Tatum.

Ooh, I was the girl who ate her own brains! Interesting. 

I took a photo for my mom, smiling to myself, when someone tapped me on the shoulder.

The presence sent a shockwave through me, and my physical body was thrown forward suddenly. I sensed splintering glass and a darkness starting to spread in front of my eyes, a darkness I couldn’t fully see. I let out a sharp breath of air, which I could hear and feel in front of me.

*No.* 

*No*. 

*No*. 

*No*. 

“Keep going, Kiera.”

Allison’s mechanical drawl soothed the whirlwind in my mind and my brain's attempt to recoil from the memory. 

“Her name is Lily, and you have to accept she is real. She existed,” her voice wobbled slightly, “She is at the center of your trauma, and we must revisit the memory if we are going to successfully mend 1 out of 89 separate trauma instances.”

No!

I tried to pull away, but the mental grip on me was almost impressive, and when I became aware of it, I was suddenly aware of icy cold air blowing in my face.

My hands bound behind me.

The *real* world. 

The real air, which wasn’t from a simulated bus inside my mind, run by a program that was leeching onto my brain.

For a moment, just a single precious moment, I was aware of myself. 

My twenty-two-year-old self was freezing to death, my hands bound with ones that were familiar, and yet also a stranger. 

I was aware of how cold my fingers were and a deep, cavernous feeling in the pit of my gut. The real world, for some reason, was being blocked out.

What Allison was trying to numb.

As soon as that realization slammed into me, the program was quick. I barely felt it reach into the root of my head and violently yank me back into the memory.

*Lily.*

Her explosion of golden curls made her one of the most beautiful girls in school. 

She was my best friend.

Lily was trembling, her arms wrapped around herself. 

“Please.” she whispered. “Quit the play, Key.”

I tried to smile. I really did. But she was scaring me too, just like everyone else. 

“I’m okay, Lily. We’re all okay.” I turned to point at the poster. “And it’s actually a good story! You should, you know…” I grabbed and squeezed her hands. “Maybe come?”

Lily’s eyes were swollen from crying, clumps of blonde curls hanging in her face.

“I’ve been looking for you,” she whispered, her hands coming down on my shoulders. 

“Everywhere! I looked for you, but I can’t… I can’t see you… anywhere! I look for you, but it’s like you’re being…” 

She trailed off, her lip wobbling. “Drowned.” 

Lily’s voice choked up. 

“You’re being drowned by the thing…” her eyes flicked to my stomach, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

Before I could speak, her warm fingers grazed my belly. “The thing inside you.” Lily shook her head, sobbing. “I can’t see you anymore. I just see *it*.” She stumbled back, her expression growing feral. 

“I can… feel it.” She planted her hands over her ears. “I can hear it! I can *see* it!”

Thankfully, we were alone.

The question only grazed the back of my mind, but I was quick to shake it away.

Could she mean…?

No. I was on birth control, and it was one guy at a stupid party. I would know, right? 

I would definitely know.

“Can see… what?”

*No!*

*No, no, no, no. I didn’t want to see this. I didn’t want to see this!*

I tried to pull away again, using my physical self this time to try and lunge from the chair I was strapped to.

“Kiera, this is a vital memory,” Allison’s voice was like ocean waves in my head. 

“We have made it safe to revisit so we can heal it and make you better. As we do not have the technology to heal these memories ourselves, you must do it manually.”

I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking when I wrapped my arms around Lily, burying my head in her shoulder and inhaling the smell of flowers. “What… what do you mean?” I found myself gingerly stroking my stomach. “What are you talking about?”

I didn’t mean to shake her, but maybe Wylan was right to want to push her away.

She swallowed, stepping back. Lily tried to smile, tried to lie and say she was okay. “Never… never mind…” she hiccupped. “I should go.”

Before she could move, I grasped her hand. “Hey.” I spoke softly. “What did you… you know… see?”

Instead of answering me, she reached into her pocket and pressed a colored rock into my hand, curling my fingers into a fist around it. “On opening night,” Lily whispered. “You are going to fall.” She hiccupped again. “Deep, deep down, Key. So far down I can’t see you anymore.” 

She swiped at her face with her sleeves. “You need to quit. Fake sickness. Go far, far away. All of you. You need to run away.”

*“Like, fall off the stage?”*

Those were my original words echoing in the back of my head.

This time, I stabilized myself in the memory and tightened my grip on Lily. 

But as I did, the memory continued as it always had, with Lily walking away. “Kiera, you cannot change your memories,” Allison said. “It is possible, yes. This is how the process of healing is applied. However, there is a safety protocol in place to ensure you do not do this in the case of the procedure being hijacked.”

*Hijacked?!*

As if the word itself had caused my thoughts to spiral once more, the simulation around me again started to come apart; shadows bleeding from the dark creeping toward me. “Focus on your memory, Kiera,” Allison’s voice said calmly.

I did.

Lily stumbled away before I could question her, and I was left on an eerily empty school corridor with a bad feeling curling in my gut.

“Lily!”

I called after her, but she didn’t turn around, bleeding into a silhouette.

Lily stopped coming to school.

According to her texts, it was the flu. But Lily didn’t use periods in her texts, and the lack of emojis was making me wary.

I spent the next few weeks rehearsing for the play. The kids in the art department built a crazy set, and I felt like a real performer. The day before opening night, I caught the set designer students dragging in a large white bag. They were wearing masks. As I got closer, I could tell why. 

The thing smelled like an actual decaying corpse. When it was dragged on stage for final rehearsals, Alyssa paled. 

“Is that what we’re supposed to eat?”

Mrs. Beck nodded with a wide smile. “Indeed it is!”

Wylan crouched in front of it. “Well, it *smells* authentic. What is it?”

The teacher pulled the zipper, and the group of us leapt back.

A scream clawed its way up my throat, my gut twisting into knots. The prop was… realistic. Way too realistic.

It was a mannequin stuffed with what looked like raw sausage meat and ground beef soaked in food coloring.

I poked the body, my stomach churning.

Yep. Definitely plastic.

“We need to eat that?” Jesse shrieked. “Dude. That’s fucking raw meat!”

Mrs. Beck sighed. “It’s jackfruit, Jesse. Commonly used to resemble human body parts. It’s perfectly fine for human consumption. There’s chicken, too.”

Wylan let out a choked laugh, poking at the prop corpse’s face. 

“Mmmm!” He mocked, shooting me a smirk. “It *almost* looks edible.”

Thankfully, the prop was taken away, and we did one last dress rehearsal. It went as well as you would think. Mrs. Beck’s idea to let us have soda and pizza backfired. 

I messed up my lines, almost giving Mrs. Beck a coronary. 

Wylan fell off the stage twice and miraculously didn’t break anything, and Alyssa and Jesse were found backstage having sex when they were supposed to be, you know… playing their parts. 

Opening night came, and I was almost throwing up from nerves.
 
“Gather around! Gather around!”

Mrs. Beck gathered us in a circle five minutes before showtime and produced a leather-bound bottle. Jesse whooped, and Wylan, of course, started the “But Mrs. Beck, we are technically minors” conversation. He was overruled, as all of us agreed (even him) that it was a treat.

I downed my glass straight away, wincing at the odd taste. I didn’t usually like wine, but this tasted kind of sweet. 

I noticed it perked all of us up, sending us into a sort of frenzy. I wasn’t sure what percentage of alcohol was in one glass, but either these kids were pretending to be drunk and behaving erratically, or Mrs. Beck had accidentally gotten her performers drunk on opening night. 

It started with Jesse, who was suddenly *starving*. 

I caught him backstage stuffing salted peanuts into his mouth, demanding a group of terrified art students go grab him more. I was a little confused why they looked so scared of him. 

Jesse was a jock, sure, but he was *also* a sweetheart. 

Alyssa disappeared for a while and was found lying face down in the school corridor, taking questionable selfies. 

She’d spilled grape juice everywhere. It was dripping from her, staining her clothes and hands and pooling across the corridor.

More screaming. 

This time from students crowding around my drunken friend. 

“Do you know, uhmmmmmm, know what’s going on?”

Wylan, usually the one who was allergic to fun, grabbed me suddenly, swinging me into an awkward dance, while the two of us waited backstage. He, too, was taking advantage of the refreshments, his mouth filled with a combination of chocolate and chips.

Wylan had somehow gotten hold of grape juice too.

I could see it staining his lips and teeth. It was thick and deep red, tainting him.

Grinning through a mushy combination of both, the boy's grasp around my waist, and he spun me into a pirouette, one that I didn't even know I could do. 

But I was spinning and laughing, the two of us falling over each other. He got close, close enough for my stomach to expand with butterflies, a comfortable heat spreading across my cheeks. 

“I'm like… suuuuuupeeeer high right  now,” he chuckled. I couldn't speak, letting my body move for me. I didn't know Wylan could dance– and I didn't know he could dance *this* well. I followed his complicated steps as he dragged me into a staggered limbo.

When he pulled me to his chest, his hot breath in my face, he started to move forward, jaw clenching, eyes suddenly far too blank for me to fully understand. 

I don't think my classmate was supposed to have teeth that were *that* pointy, but there they were, sharp, elongated points sticking from his gums. I should have felt scared, but I didn't feel anything. 

I was numb and happy and dancing, winding my body around his. 

“Hey! What the fuck are you two—woah!”

The set designer kid dropped whatever he’d been holding, slamming his hands over his mouth.

Twisting around, I snapped out of it, and my head felt weird. The kid was definitely talking, but I couldn’t hear him. His voice was being drowned out by ocean waves. 

The air was too thick. I shook my head, but I was already being dragged onto the stage where I somehow managed to kick into performer mode. Mom was in the audience, though when I risked a peek, I couldn’t see anything. Shadows and silhouettes. I noticed there was some commotion right at the back. The doors were open, and whispers were starting. 

But I ignored them. 

The play went better than I thought. Luckily, the wine didn’t go to our heads; each of us delivered a stellar performance. 

It was towards the end, when Wylan was shouting a monologue to the audience, and the group of us were in position, where the girl playing Sunny would sneak under the stage and be replaced with the prop of her body, when I started to smell it.

Roast chicken.

No. Better. My mom’s chicken hot pot, steamed potatoes and gravy, and steamed broccoli. 

“What were we supposed to do?” Wylan asked the audience. His voice collapsed into white noise. If I strained my ears, I swore I could hear… *screaming*.

I could barely sense their footsteps as Sunny’s performer was pulled from the stage, and… there it was. The smell.

So good. An aroma that filled me, eliciting something electric.

The prop was in front of us, and it was the final scene. There was supposed to be a cue, but I couldn’t stand it. I was ripping through the bag and struggling with the zip, and when I had fistfuls of jackfruit and chicken strips, stuffing them into my mouth, I couldn’t stop. Sunny’s body was so well done. I was amazed and a little horrified at how lifelike her flesh was and how easy it was to tear from her bones.

The others dropped down beside me, and I was aware of the whimper that suddenly escaped Wylan's lips before I dragged him down with me, forcing fake flesh into his mouth. Jesse and Alyssa followed suit. 

I was aware I was moaning. Loudly. 

I ripped, pulled, and tore at the prop until I could see pearly white.

I started giggling. There was no laughing in the script, but I laughed, warm red sliding down my mouth and chin. 

When the audience burst into applause, I was getting to my feet, dizzy, grasping the others’ hands and bowing.

I couldn’t stop smiling. I bowed again, warm redness soaking my feet and drowning the stage. It was all over me, dripping from my chin and staining my clothes. 

Alyssa’s mother, standing in the front, fainted.

The mechanical voice was back, but it sounded different.

“No, Kiera. This is not what happened. Go back. Remove the filter they put over your memory and see things clearly.”

I sensed another bird slamming into the window inside the simulation, my body being thrown forward, the bus quaking with me.

“Do it.”

This time her voice was firm.

The memory blurred, and I was back in front of Jesse, right before the play. He was stuffing something into his mouth.

Not salted peanuts.

Fingers.

Fingers that were still moving, poking from his clenched teeth.

Alyssa.

I caught her lying face down in the school corridor. She was covered in it, slick scarlet. Blood. Not grape juice. The girl was mindlessly mauling an eyeball.

Biting through it, she shot me a grin and snapped a pic of herself. 

I stumbled back, only for Wylan to grab hold of me, pulling me into a dance, spinning me around, a maniacal giggle escaping his mouth, leaking thick, deep red scarlet that dripped down his chin. 

His mouth was full of stringy flesh stuck between his teeth as he spun me around and around, and I was aware of the state of myself. My fingers entangled with his were wet and slimy. 

Wylan stumbled, his eyes not quite penetrating me. “I'm pretty sure Mrs Beck drugged the wiiiiiine” he sang, and I giggled along, doing another clumsy spin.

At some point, we were breathless, and my mouth was choking, full of mush. 

His breath was in my face, a panting, hysterical breath entangled with mine. 

“We need to get out of here,” he whisper- shrieked, his eyes unseeing. 

“Hey!”

Turning around, one of the art director students was staring at us, horrified. “What the… what the fuck are you two doing?!” 

He started towards us, before stumbling back, barfing into his hands. “We need to get you help,” he whispered, his eyes wide. “Kiera. Wylan. Who did this to you?”

Everything went fast forward after that, like my memories were being purposely rewound.

We didn't walk on stage. 

We were *shoved*. 

But by then, I wasn't thinking of anything, except how *hungry* I was. 

My body felt hollow and wrong, and so… so hungry. 

On stage, Wylan gasped with delight when a body was brought in front of us.

I dove in, carving my fingernails into already shredded flesh, stuffing myself with… I caught exactly what my fists were full of.

Her.

Lily.

Recoiling in horror, Wylan did the same. But the smell of her was driving me…

Crazy.

So, I grabbed him, forcing a fistful of Lily into his mouth and making him chew on it until he was helping himself.

With my best friend dripping down my shirt and in my mouth, we bowed in front of an audience.

They were… clapping.

No. I squinted.

No, there *wasn’t* an audience.

Instead, our parents and friends were at the back of the auditorium, a blur of screaming masses being held back by cops. 

Jesse was next to me, lips stretched into a wide grin. He was laughing. Howling. 

Wylan bowed again, covered in my best friend’s entrails.

“Thank you, thank you!” he shouted to the imaginary crowd. 

Alyssa was on her knees, giggling, clawing her face. 

His eyes were wide, unseeing, staring into an oblivion I couldn't see. 

So, this was why I was here. 

I was fucking *crazy*. 

“Kiara Sutherland,” Allison's voice cut through the memory. 

“Due to The Kilbride Incident which has since devastated the planet, you were brought here four months ago to undergo emergency treatment. ""

*No.*

""In a private trial between government personal, the judge ruled that it was either you were put through the Fix Me program to revert you to a previous stable mental state before you underwent significant trauma, or be given the death penalty, due to your involvement in the fall of the human race.”

*No!*

“Many parties argued that the cause of your actions were influenced by a second party, and thus, your actions could be justified. After deliberation, the judge agreed, and you were sentenced here to undergo treatment which will *fix* you.”

Four numbers appeared in front of my eyes suddenly.

4879

And a voice pricked into my mind. 

It was so cold, the real world slamming into me. 

There was something metallic encased around my head, something sharp protruding through my skull. 

When I tried to move, my lips were numb, my hands bound to a familiar stranger. 

I reached out, entangling their frozen fingers with mine. 

*“Kiara, sweetie?” The voice grew louder, and the agony of the real world hit, an icy wind blowing my hair from my face. 

“It's Mrs. Beck! Could you read out those four numbers in front of you, please? The dismantling code. There's a good girl! Give me the code, and I will get you all out of there! You're all *perfectly* mentally well!”*

Warm breath tickled my ear.

Ok, so I’m not an employee(does that get me banned or kicked?), but this question pertains to back-house. 
I frequent McDonald’s almost everyday on my way to work for their $1 coffee deal through the app. Been doing it for a couple of years now. I typically get the Vanilla Iced Coffee and sometimes a regular Large hot coffee with 8 cream and 8 sugar.
So far this is the whitest one I’ve gotten.
It tastes really good In my opinion. It’s really smooth but not too sweet. The associate that calculated the ratios put some McLove into it for sure. I wish they always prepped it this way. Sometimes they outright don’t put enough cream and/or the vanilla syrup AT ALL! Even though the sticker on the cup reads “vanilla iced coffee”.
My question is: how can I word my order for it to come this way? More cream than coffee? Is that even allowed or is it extra? I understand is not Starbucks or any other fancy coffee place but this one really upped the standards.
Also, Is the cream used for the iced coffee mix the same as the coffee creamers served with the hot coffee?

1fxyswe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1fxyswe/i_think_i_have_experience_some_synchronicity/,I think I have experience some synchronicity," Hello, All. 

For some time now, I have been more open to spiritual and religious beliefs, especially after getting to know the work of JB Peterson. After this opening, I have experienced some things that sometimes feel extremely improbable. Do you think these might be synchronicities?

The first one is about a girl I met in a coffee shop; she works there as a barista. I felt attracted to her, and one day I asked her out. At that moment, I had only exchanged a few words with her—nothing more—just the regular ""how are you."" On my way to our date, I started to imagine a conversation with her in my head, and in that conversation, I thought, ""She is going to start talking about her drawings and paintings."" When I arrived at the place, she was there, and we started to talk. I mentioned that I thought she might like drawing, and she asked how I knew that. She then started to show me her drawings and paintings and talked about how much she enjoyed it.

The second one happened recently. I started a dream journal, but because it was so personal, I wanted something different. So, I went to a place where they make personalized notebooks to have one made for me. I live in a huge city (CDMX), and this place is about an hour from where I live. I got the notebook and started working on it. The next day, I went to a random coffee shop near my house to write down some notes and dream analysis. At one point, I stopped and looked around, and the same girl who had sold me my notebook was walking about a block away from where I was. I was shocked—what are the odds?

The moment I felt like I was being toxic or crossing the line of being hurtful I tried to remove myself. You being adamant you still wanted to see me was very sweet and I tried to give us a chance. But once I realized you coming on so strong and us moving so fast was scaring me I made that decision to remove myself again. I really truly was trying to do what I could to not hurt you. Even if that meant giving up on a good thing. But I’m not going to lie, you calling me immature and weird and judging my humor did bother me. I didn’t think name calling was necessary or called for. 

You reaching out again made me feel like maybe you coming on so strong was just you being overzealous and maybe you were genuinely serious. You initially asked to be friends and that’s why I agreed to coffee. Then when we saw each other again and you kissed me I thought since the mutual attraction was still there this was something you still wanted to pursue. 

When we got into our relationship and you started saying I lived too far and it cost too much to see me. And you never wanted to call or visit. I made the decision to leave again. From your response, you seemed unbothered by that. And I was truly going to leave you alone and give you peace. But you reached out yet again. Now, since you telling me you never really wanted to be in the relationship, your actions in the relationship make a lot more sense. 

But now you continue to reach out and ask to be FWB. I always knew you were never truly interested in me. But for you to reach out and only want one thing from me, and reduce me to just being a body for you to use is so demoralizing. I understand that you don’t want me. I respect that you do not want a relationship with me. But you have to respect that I don’t want friendship or FWB. I hope you find your person. Now let me move on as well.

No dependency issues whatsoever. The thing is that when I do drink (socially with friends at the bar on the weekend, weddings, parties, family events etc) I drink to excess. I would say that I black out about 6 out of 10 times drinking. It seems like after the 3 or 4 drink mark I just don’t stop. I visited my cousin out of state recently and blacked out all 3 nights I was there (only me, he didn’t)

A beer will go down in 5 minutes or less without even noticing.

I’ve never considered myself an alcoholic since I don’t have any dependency issues but the excessive drinking when I do drink is what’s starting to concern me.

Hi, everyone! Thank you so much for the support and advice! I wanted to provide an update to answer a couple of the common questions that came up in the comments.

One recurring question was whether I’m putting effort into the relationship. I have tried over and over again to initiate things from my end. I’ve called, planned coffee or lunch dates, but he always declines, preferring to hang out when he’s free. It only ever happens at my place or around my area of residence. I’ve also tried doing thoughtful things for him—he loves coffee, so whenever I go on a work trip (which is often), I bring some back for him. However, he’d rather not have it at all than accept it being delivered to him.

When we plan to meet up in the evening, which is convenient for both of us, he’ll show up at odd hours, like 3 or 4 AM, and then the next morning, he’s in a hurry to leave. One incident sticks out—he once brought over chickpeas, and I jokingly asked him to cook for me since I had never had them before. He did a terrible job at it, not because he can’t cook, but later claimed that I “forced” him to do it, and he didn’t appreciate that.

Another instance was when I had really painful cramps at work and couldn’t move from the bathroom floor. I called him to pick me up and take me home. Over the phone, he spent most of the conversation complaining that his mother had been harassed by the cops earlier that day. Keep in mind, by the time we spoke, she was safely at home, and his younger brother also lives there. I only asked for a short trip to get me home, which would have taken an hour max. Later, during the car ride, he continued complaining, and afterward, he told me I’m the most selfish person he’s ever met because I didn’t ask about his mom. I was in so much pain, I couldn’t even think straight.

Writing all this down makes me realize I might just be a side piece. 

For some backstory: I’m an introvert, and he’s an extrovert, the life of the party. We met at a club—he was with his friends for a Friday night out, and I was there with my colleagues for a team hangout. A week later, we had our first official date, which went well, and we’ve had subsequent dates since. I’m not big on texting, but after he expressed he wanted more communication, I’ve made an effort to keep it consistent.

When I say there's no communication, I mean *none*. I believe that couples should at least exchange a text a day. Sometimes, I’ll go a day or two without hearing from him. I understand that life happens, but he never gives a reason. If he could just text something like, “I’m out of commission for a couple of days,” I’d have no problem giving him space. 

I don’t ask for much, even a single text a day would be enough, but lately, there’s been absolute silence. It’s not like he has a busier schedule either—when we met, he had the same routine and still managed to find time for me, even if it was just a quick hello. Now, he’s canceled plans to hang out with friends without any warning.

Whenever he comes over, I cook and take care of him. I don’t bring up arguments, and he gets to relax, exactly what he said he wanted. But at this point, I’m really starting to question if this relationship is as reciprocal as it should be.",4,1728272435.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I take sumatriptan and have been trying one of the  more generic dailies, but the last few months I’ve had at least 10 migraine days and it’s just incredibly tough with work, family, etc. 

I know other meds are an option, but really want to know what else folks have done. How have people figured out what the triggers are (not sure how well I can do a true elimination diet, especially when it’s not an ‘instant trigger’ most of the time)? Or what else has worked for people? I was reading up on long term impacts of what I use (a triptan) and it just feels irresponsible not to want to do less, plus the quality of life difference if I can get it back to 1-2 days a month would be remarkable.

My son is 3 with moderate autism and he’s not enrolled in a daycare. I’ve been working part time in a remote role. I started a full time salary position when I had my son because his father didn’t want to enroll our son into daycare We don’t have relatives to help my mom is elderly and recovering from cancer and my dad passed a couple of years ago my boyfriend just has his dad and he does not help. 
My son was  diagnosed with autism at 2.He does a lot of jumping off furniture and standing on furniture and has screaming tantrums. He probably has about 50 words but he only talks when he wants to and is very demanding avoidant. I listen to crying all day long. 

I watch him from 8:00-4. I work 4-9. I do dishes and I’m also pitching in while I work. I have a phone job. Whatever cleaning I can get done between dishes, preparing meals and snacks, errands, teaching, and trying to potty train. I’ve done all the work toward my son’s diagnosis, speech/ot therapies. Waitlist for ABA and pre-K enrollment.

His dad watches my son while I work and usually takes him to the park. He will give him a bath. 

We have also been cosleeping with our son since he was a newborn. His dad thinks he needs to be monitored all night. He doesn’t even need a diaper change anymore. He’s dry most nights. He insist we sleep in different rooms because I snore even though he snores too. 

Cleaning - he takes out the garbage and mops and cooks occasionally. 

Whenever my boyfriend is home he didn’t want to engage with my son. He expects me to do everything. I typically don’t mind staying in while he mows the lawn or runs whatever errands he needs to do. 

I often find as soon as I go for a walk or go to a hair appointment. He is topically really angry when I come back and he usually completely ruins my whole day. He will often complain constantly about a-z  things he is unhappy about that I did or didn’t do 

I’ve asked nicely if he could not come in the house complaining. I’ve usually had a long day with our son and I just need a minute to breathe before I start work. He  says he doesn’t care and will continue to tell me everything he’s unhappy about and says his favorite line I need to listen because it’s his house. I say I’m not an employee or a child. I don’t want to hear this right now. 

The weekends are usually me making breakfast for everyone. I get my son dressed and ready for the day.  I play with him.  My boyfriend is usually running errands or working on a project and monopolizing the whole weekend for himself. 

If a want to go for a a cup of coffee, catch up with my sister for brunch or go for a walk. You would think the world is about to end if I’m gone for a few hours. He’s has left the house for hours and I have been completely fine. 

I’ve had discussions about alternating and splitting the day up but there is never any compromise. He literally thinks we should clean or do house projects every minute of the day. I feel like I’m more than doing my part but I’m in this constant cycle of being gaslit into thinking I’m doing nothing we it’s not the case at all and I feel like I’m losing my mind and walking on eggshells.  While all of this is going on he has been in denial about our son’s diagnosis off and on and resistant into him doing special education pre school or ABA. He just wants him to sit at home.  I would just like him to put a little more effort into everything.

Today, as I walked by my neighbor's place, I noticed a plant on their coffee sized table, (I thought it was plastic, but I guess it is wicker) that looked really dried out and sickly. Without thinking too much, I poured some water from my bottle onto it, thinking I was being helpful and neighborly, kind of like a nice thing to do for a neighbor.

Right after I did this the neighbor and his wife came home, he noticed some water on the ground, which I think leaked through the wicker. I was standing nearby and I mentioned that I had watered the plant, thinking I was doing a good deed! She actually thanked me, but he was really upset and came back out to check for damage, mentioning that the wicker might have been harmed and if anything were in the table it would be damaged. I told him I was sorry and that was dumb of me. His face dropped as if I had done something REALLY bad.

I immediately apologized, realizing that I had overstepped. I left a note on their door, offering to reimburse them if there’s any damage to the table and apologizing again for the intrusion. I thought I was being neighborly, but now I see how inappropriate it was to touch their things without asking.

Not making any excuse for myself, but I am on the spectrum, and sometimes my desire to do something nice comes off as awkward, it's the worst.

I am relatively new to learning about this condition and I’m thankful to everyone who’s posted their experiences here.

I have largely had normal bowel habits throughout my life with the exception of the onset of my celiac disease - I was throwing up constantly, anemic, and having some other strange issues. Once I was diagnosed, I ate gluten free and have felt pretty normal for years. Until now!

After a lovely vacation to Mexico, I found myself writhing around with a massive headache and horrible fever the final night of my trip. No gastrointestinal symptoms, but the worst headache of my life and a fever that Extra Strength Tylenol didn’t seem to touch. Negative for Covid, and my friend I had been sharing food/drinks and a bed with all week never got sick either. That went away and I wrote it off as a weird virus I got partying at the resort in Mexico. Anyway. 

About a month after my stay, I started noticing I was bloated, like a lot. I ignored it thinking I was just eating too much salty junk food. I also tend to get “backed up” when I travel and thought I just had to level out from a recent weekend trip. Then I noticed I had less and less energy and no amount of coffee or my regular dose of my adhd meds would perk me up. 

In July, I realized half the clothing I normally enjoyed wearing no longer looked good on me, I was getting bloated no matter what I ate, I was exhausted constantly, and decided to finally call a gastroenterologist. When I finally got in to see her, I requested to be tested for H. Pylori and SIBO. My doctor seemed kind and invested in my case but when I asked about testing for other parasites, my doctor seemed to brush me off. I got a very expensive colonoscopy that was thankfully clear, bloodwork is fairly normal, and I am doing a mail in SIBO test next week (had to wait 4 weeks after colonoscopy to submit an accurate sample). Giardia and H. pylori stool test is clear, but everything I am seeing (even on the quest results) is that doesn’t rule out parasites because they are cyclical. Doctor will not give me pharmaceutical anti-parasitic meds. 

I got frustrated and recently spoke to a naturopath who told me more people have parasites than we think and my timeline for everything absolutely seems connected to my Mexico trip. I’m also someone who enjoys their steak rare and a frequent sushi eater. I was suggested to try ParaFy or Cell Core. Has anyone tried either of these? 

I am young, ambitious, and trying to enjoy my 20s. I feel like I have the energy levels of an elderly person these days. I am spending tons of money on bloodwork, tests, and specialist visits. As it is the mail in test for SIBO will cost me $250 and isn’t covered by insurance. I am tired of spending $$$ and getting no answers. 

Is there any harm in trying one of these treatments just to see if I feel a difference? Thanks!",3,1728271522.0,SIBO,3,1.0,False

I've moved here for a new job and I'm flat sharing while my kids finished school/uni and my wife organises a transfer for her job. I live down the southwest and commute into the CBD twice a week. Thirty minutes on the train isn't too bad.

I have been looking at various suburbs and I'm thoroughly confused, it's my opinion that you have far too many and far too much choice (kidding), but it does make the search harder and everytime I look up ""Is X a good suburb"" I get a mixed bag of responses from Reddit/online which makes it twice as daunting.

Last week my wife finally got her transfer to a CBD office and my 19yo son has been offered a spot at RMIT in the CBD and my daughter will finish grade 12 wherever we land.

Despite living down the southwest I'm not super keen on it. Although I really like Altona and the inner west like Footscray and Yarraville but sadly I'm not made of money and I have to be realistic. I have driven out through Eltham and Greensborough and love that area (once again not made of money) but the east/northeast seems a bit more my style (leafy, quieter). I'm struggling a bit to adjust coming from a quiet area with lots of trees and nature.

**TL;DR - My question is, where would you recommend for a family like mine to rent/buy that's not more than 45mins to the CBD on PTV and isn't going to destroy the bank? I am a bit of a shut-in but I like somewhere I can walk my dogs and grab a coffee/breakfast on a Saturday morning that's nice and quiet and has a decent community feel.

1fxy5pp,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fxy5pp/some_of_my_counterarguments_to_the_existence_of/,Some of my counterarguments to the existence of God (First post on this account hooray) ,"I go to a Christian school as an atheist, and I just really had to get this out somewhere. Here are some of the most common arguments Christians use to support the existence of God, so I wrote counterarguments for each one. Here we go. 

# 1. The Cosmological Argument

* Everything that exists has a cause. Since the universe exists, it must have a cause, which many claim is God.

**My counterargument:** 

The origin of the universe can be scientifically explained through the Big Bang Theory, suggesting that a singularity of infinitely high mass and heat exploded possibly due to quantum uncertainty, and expanded outward, creating our universe. Such theory is backed up by concrete, verifiable science evidence, including the red shift phenomenon exhibited by celestial objects and the cosmic microwave background. It explains the origin of the universe through scientific logic and reasoning, without the need to invoke a omnipotent deity. Even if the Big Bang requires a cause, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the cause is God. Quantum physics introduces the idea of events occurring without a specific cause. For example, a proton can randomly decay without any cause at all. Not everything needs to have a cause. 

# 2. The Teleological (or Design) Argument

* *Argument:* The complexity and order in the universe suggest a designer. Just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the universe implies a creator.

**My counterargument:**

This argument itself is faulty as the universe, in fact, does not display order. On the contrary, the concept of entropy in physics points out that everything in the universe is heading towards a state of disorder. Chaos and randomness fills our daily life - campfire burning into ashes and smoke, sugar dissolving in coffee, glass shattering into pieces... Inside the human body, random genetic mutations occur that lead to non-beneficial changes. The reason that life on Earth display patterns is because of natural selection and the fact that structure leads to function - humans maintain the same structure through reproduction to ensure that their offsprings have the same abilities for survival and growth. Exact copies of DNA are created by the cell during mitosis and meiosis. In short, maintaining structure an effective way of prolonging life and the human species as a whole. The patterns in the human body can thus be explained through biological evidence, rather than needing to invoke a deity. 

3. **The** **Free Will Argument (as a counterargument to the problem of evil)**

* **Argument**: One of the main reasons that suffering exists is because God has given humans free will. This freedom allows people to make their own choices, even if those choices lead to harm or suffering. A world of freedom is more valuable than a world without suffering. 

**My counterargument:** 

Even if free will justifies some suffering, it does not explain why there is *so much* suffering, particularly when it involves innocent beings where free will isn’t a factor. Natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes kill thousands without reason or justice. Child diseases and genetic disorders ruin the lives of millions of innocent children without reason or justice. 

To take this up a level, humans, technically, do not have free will at all. Although humans do have the power to make conscious choices, they are simply chemical reactions inside the brain sending electrical signals through the nervous system. From the perspective of a neutral observer of our universe, humans and all life on Earth are no different from the wind or the rain. Elements including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and more make up the human body, just like how the remnants of a supernova made up the Sun and the solar system. They all fall under the category of natural occurrence.

About why I go to a Christian school as an atheist... that's for another story.

I will be 14 weeks tomorrow with twins, my first babies. I was just in the shower a few minutes ago and I had a very strange feeling in my stomach. (Might be TMI but for context I had just had a bowel movement before showering-- more on that in a moment).

I was raising my arms and felt a sensation like something (gas?) moving from the top to the bottom of my stomach. It was weird but painless, and the best way I can describe it was that I was going to either vomit or poop in the next 3 seconds (neither happened). It was very quick but I've never felt it before. Has anyone felt anything like this?

The past few days I have become very concerned that I have miscarried one of my twins. Maybe I'm just being paranoid but I can't shake the feeling. I have no pain or anything like that to make me think this, except for that I've been bleeding brown blood/coffee ground stuff with a SCH for two weeks. It fluctuates on the flow and as of late it's been on the heavier side (maybe 40-50% full of a pantiliner for the day). I have an ultrasound to check on the SCH in two days but I am terrified that I've lost one of my babies.

Sorry for the rant, but it does feel better to write it down. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you friends.",1,1728270502.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Visits never end well, and sometimes never even start well.  We're down to one weekend a year at this point normally.  She was affected by the flooding in NC and no one else offered to take her in, so we invited her up to stay with us.  Her home wasn't damaged but the area around her was, and gas and groceries were going to be hard to get for a while. We live in another state a few hours drive away.  

She stayed about a week, we covered all her meals, loaded her car up with gas and supplies for when she did go back home.  Stuff starting getting tense in our house by Wednesday.  She was upset we weren't waiting on her hand and foot because we have 2 small kids, jobs, busy lives.  She kept bugging me about when would my husband be done with work, kept bugging him about work.  She wouldn't eat at all unless he went to get her food.  Seriously, she had 2 cups of decaf coffee one day, I offered to get her food and she said no.  She waited until my husband got done with work after 6pm and then complained she was starving.  We live within walking distance to 2 grocery stores but she also had her car.

Her elderly dog peed all over our house.  I wouldn't have minded as much if she offered to clean it, instead she got really defensive and yelled at my husband when he mentioned it. 

But the last day she was here, she was acting weird all morning, like hiding away in the room she was staying in much later than normal for her.  She had already been up early, just went back to hide and ignore my daughter who kept asking about her.  When she finally came downstairs, she waited until we were getting ready to leave the house to tell us that she gave our dog something he shouldn't have had like 4 hours prior. 

Things escalated to her getting pissed that I called our vet to ask them what to do, we needed the emergency vet to get him to puke. MIL kept telling me it wasn't a big deal when the vet said it was a big deal. She was acting like we were overreacting and should just stop talking about it. Then she proceeds to start a fight with me over some weird perceived slight from several years earlier that I didn't even know about, while we are trying to come up with a plan of action for our dog.  I had to shut her down several times because I do not do drama, and I definitely don't do it in front of my kids. My husband was already livid with her at this point.

So she ended up leaving and telling my husband to send her a bill for all the food she ate all week.  It was just really bizarre. She poisoned our dog and tried to start a fight with me because I was upset she poisoned my dog.  We haven't heard from her since, not even to find out if the dog was ok.  

My dog is fine now, but both my husband and I are still like wtf just happened?  And no, probably won't be another visit for a very long time after this.",29,1728270361.0,JUSTNOMIL,6,0.97,False

25 Things to Get Rid of Right Now
Declutter. Have more space. Feel more free

By Nicole Pajer,   AARP
104 Comments
Published September 30, 2024
 a person throwing items away in the trash
From paperclips to extra jackets, tchotchkes and beyond, many of us have homes bursting at the seams.
SAM ISLAND
Kim Livengood, a 55-year-old public relations professional in Sarasota, Florida, once considered herself a pack rat. She struggled to part with everything from her childhood magazine collection she’d been accumulating since age 14 to clothing she never wore. But when she and her husband sold their home and moved into a 900-square-foot condo, downsizing became a necessity.

“Once I started giving things away and recycling, I started to feel lighter,” she says, adding if she was able to do it, “anyone can!”

From paperclips to extra jackets, tchotchkes and beyond, many of us have homes bursting at the seams. Research tells us that clutter is not great for our mental health. And wouldn’t it be nice to have people over occasionally without having to start the evening with “sorry our home is such a mess”?

In recent years, minimalism – getting rid of excessive belongings to make more room for what’s important – has been on the rise, especially since the pandemic. “People were at home more and were ‘face to face with all that stuff,’ ” says Ryan Nicodemus, one half of the Minimalists, who, alongside Joshua Fields Millburn, helps people simplify their lives.

Ready to declutter but don’t know where to start? Here are 25 things to start tossing immediately.

1. Anything that doesn’t add value

Fields Millburn says to ask yourself: “How might my life be better with less?” This can help you understand why you want to downsize, which is highly individual. For instance, some people want to quit their buying habit for more financial freedom, while others want fewer items to care for and more time to spend with family and friends.

“Understanding the why behind simplifying gives us the leverage we need to begin to let go and helps us understand what is excess,” Fields Millburn explains.

2. Just-in-case items

To the Minimalists, “just in case” are three dangerous words. “If you look around your house, you’ll likely find thousands of items you’re storing just in case you might need them in some nonexistent hypothetical future,” Fields Millburn says. These items can usually be replaced, if need be, for less than $20 and in less than 20 minutes. The exceptions to this, Fields Millburn notes, are emergency items like first aid kits, which you should definitely keep handy.

3. Photos and paper

“It’s about saving less,” says Courtney Carver, author of the wesbite Be More With Less and creator of the minimalist fashion challenge called Project 333. Give yourself permission to get rid of duplicate, similar or blurry photos, coupons or mailers you aren’t using, bills and statements you can get online, old newspapers and magazines, and things you’ve ripped out of a magazine.

Nicodemus scans photos and tosses physical copies, while Dana White, founder of A Slob Comes Clean, takes a photo of a photo to create a digital version.

4. Seasonal items ... you didn’t use last season

Still holding onto that outfit or accessory that stayed tucked away last spring, summer, fall or winter? Chances are, you won’t use it for the future seasons either. “If you have T-shirts you never wore, swimsuits or flip-flops that have seen better days, an inflatable pool that you bought during confinement and haven’t used since, or three sets of picnic dishes when you only really need one ... it’s time to let go,” says Amélie Saint‑Jacques, home organizer Certified KonMari Consultant, Amelie Organizes LLC, in San Antonio, Texas. And something that you did use last season that’s on its last legs, like a sun hat about to fall apart or a torn summer tablecloth, is ready to get tossed as well.

 damaged items
If the item is broken or missing parts, it's time to let it go.
SAM ISLAND
5. Damaged items

Holding on to a favorite mug that’s chipped or a necklace that’s fallen apart? Time to let go. “Be honest about what things are damaged and toss them,” White says — even if you’ve been meaning to sell them. “If it’s damaged, it probably does not have the value you’ve been assuming it was going to have one day.”﻿ The same goes for things that are missing parts. For instance, White says to store Tupperware with the lids on, and if one is missing a lid, chuck it into the recycling bin.﻿

6. Extras and duplicates

“You always use your favorites but still have extras for a variety of reasons,” Carver says. Maybe something was on sale, or you think you should own more of a certain item, but you ultimately get to determine how much of what is enough. Items that fall into this category, she says, can include coffee cups, measuring cups and spoons, wooden spoons, wire whisks, handbags, sunglasses and pens.﻿

7. Stuff you never use

“If you are holding on, thinking, it’s not hurting anything, reframe and ask yourself how it’s helping and contributing to your life,” Carver suggests. “If it’s not, you don’t have room for it.” This often includes things like random spices and sauces, uncomfortable shoes, empty frames and containers, books you’ve already read or never plan on reading, junk drawer items (or the whole drawer), knickknacks, freebies or gifts you were given but don’t like.﻿

ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT
﻿8. Items from a past phase

If you don’t have a dog anymore and don’t plan on getting a new one, give yourself permission to get rid of the dog bed, bowl and leash. And if you’re retired, pack up the majority of your professional clothes and office supplies. This, White says, will give you more space for items that serve the phase of life you’re in right now.﻿

﻿9. Things that bring up bad memories

If an item doesn’t make you feel good, send it on its way. “Release the unflattering photos, the gift from your no-longer friend or mementos from an ex,” Coraccio suggests. “Clear your space to welcome new experiences and people into your life.” Using sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist and Offer Up is an easy way to list things to sell or give away.﻿

 expired medications
Get rid of expired medications, food and makeup.
SAM ISLAND
10. Anything expired

This includes medications, food and makeup. If you can’t find the motivation to declutter here, do it for your health, says Julie Coraccio, a professional organizer and author of Clear Your Clutter Inside & Out. “Did you know that if you wear bad makeup, you could get pink eye, inflammation that can lead to redness, bumps, a rash or even blisters and swelling?” she says. Properly dispose of expired medications and toss out old food for your safety as well.﻿﻿﻿

1﻿﻿1. Digital clutter

Digital clutter can build up as well, Carver says. Unsubscribe to podcasts you don’t listen to, and delete music you don’t enjoy from iTunes. Drag documents you saved and never access, or email you don’t need, to the trash. Unsubscribe from email subscriptions you aren’t using and from people on social media you don’t want to follow anymore. Delete apps that drain your time and energy, and social media platforms you no longer care about.﻿

1﻿﻿2. Boxes

Old computer boxes, the box that stored that latest version of your smartphone, shoeboxes. “Unless you are moving in a week and there is that one special box that perfectly contains that antique samurai sword you got at a flea market, you don’t need it,” says Jennifer Jarrett, a Los Angeles-based certified professional organizer with Jenuinely Contained.

But wait, you’re keeping a box because you are planning to reuse it down the road, to send something at the post office or to house something you need to store? “Either way, having the box is probably going to be more cumbersome or simply unnecessary,” says Jarrett. And when it is time to obtain a box for such an occasion, a friend or neighbor will probably have one they’d be more than willing to offload.﻿

1﻿3. Mismatched or broken food storage containers﻿

How many times have you gone to the cupboard, taken out the perfect size Tupperware container to house your leftovers and not been able to find the lid? If you haven’t been able to find it in years, chances are it’s not going to reappear. “Take 15 minutes, pull all your Tupperware out and match tops with bottoms and toss anything that doesn’t have a mate,” says Jarrett, who stresses that this museum of mismatched storage containers can build up over time. “This will make it easier and faster when you need a food storage bin.”﻿

1﻿﻿4. Giveaways and tchotchkes

“We’ve all been to events that give away something that looks great and useful at the time you receive it, only to get home and realize you have something similar or that you’re never going to actually use it,” says Emily Preciado-Fonseca, a professional organizer and founder of on-demand assistance service MommyAssist.

Are you really going to wear that trucker hat that has a cleaning product’s name plastered on the front? Do you really need to own five beer koozies? And the party favors that you took home in a gift bag last month that have been sitting on your vanity counter are probably not things you need to keep, right? All of these can go.﻿

 things to donate
Either finish the hobby or donate the supplies.
SAM ISLAND
1﻿﻿5. An abandoned hobby

Be realistic about which hobbies you’ve moved on from and toss the related materials you’re not using. “Maybe you collected stuff for knitting and tried it once and didn’t like it,” White says. Then it’s time to donate the yarn. And if you come across hobby materials and want to finish the project, go ahead. Allowing finishing a project to count as decluttering “is a really helpful mindset shift,” White says. Keeping brushes for a painting hobby you’re never going to have is not.

1﻿6﻿. Random home furnishings

Did you move to a new place and take old furniture with you that doesn’t quite fit the space anymore? Have you changed out some home decor, like paintings, but you’re holding on to the old ones? Free yourself from having to store these things that will likely never see the outside of your closet for the rest of their existence. “Old rugs, side tables that were part of a set, a nightstand that doesn’t match anything anymore — check your home for random furniture that may not fit who you are — or your home! — anymore,” says Preciado-Fonseca. ﻿

1﻿7. Old bedding

That old set of sheets with a pattern you hate and have since replaced, the sheets with the stain on them, the pillowcase with the holes… “Sometimes the back of the linen closet ends up being the place where things go to die,” says Jarrett. “People often have a tendency to just put new things in front of the old things and forget they are there.”

If you buy new bedding to replace old bedding, make a point of tossing the old bedding at the same time. And instead of putting sheets and pillowcases in the bin, donate them to your local animal shelter as bedding to line pet crates — or tear them up and use them as rags. “If it’s something you are never going to use again in its current form, move it out,” adds Jarrett. ﻿

1﻿8. Unknown freezer items

You frequently put leftovers or extra batches of meals in the freezer. But when’s the last time you popped your head in there, really dug around and took inventory of what’s going on? “Consider cleaning out your freezer and discarding anything old or items you would no longer eat,” says Sarit Weiss, founder and lead organizer at Neat & Orderly.

Check out this chart from foodsafety.gov for more information on how long things can stay in the freezer before spoiling (for instance, you can keep leftover pizza in the fridge for one to two months and an egg casserole for two to three months). If it’s past its expiration date, it must go. And if you can’t remember when you put it in there, send it to the garbage disposal stat. ﻿

﻿﻿19. Reusable bags and totes

Most of us have quite the reusable bag collection going on. It’s a favorite piece of swag that’s handed out at trade shows (employers love to gift corporate logo-adorned versions to their staff), and they are often free gifts that come with things we order online. But we’re having to find places to store these bags and often have much more than we need. “Reusable bags have become a standard and are readily available everywhere, leading so many people to have so many bags,” says Preciado-Fonseca. She suggests keeping a few in the car, designating a place to keep a certain amount and tossing the rest.﻿

Your closet should house items you look forward to wearing.

20. Clothes that don't fit

“Many of us have skinny jeans or T-shirts from high school that no longer fit us. Every time we see these items, whether we are aware of it or not, it’s an unpleasant reminder,” Coraccio says. Your closet should house items you look forward to wearing instead of being a place to cast aside what you know you’re not going to wear.

21. Paperwork that you don’t need

“After the statute to hang on to things for tax purposes runs out [typical time is four years], hanging onto old paperwork and receipts is just taking up space unnecessarily,” says Jarrett. And outside of work records, if you’re not going to return something, for instance, there’s no reason to keep the receipt for it. “Hang on to only the things that you know you won’t be able to find online and important documents,” Jarrett adds. “Shred or recycle the rest.”

22. Appliance manuals

You’ve been holding on to the manual for your blender, television and/or hair dryer in case you need to remind yourself how to use it one day. But in today’s digital age, these can typically be found online now and are easily accessible. “It is so much faster to type your question or concern into Google than to find the proper manual, find the page associated with the area in question, and then try to determine what the problem is and how to fix it,” says Jarrett. Tracking down an online manual, she says, takes a quarter the amount of time it takes to locate a manual in your home — and find the right page. And if you can’t find it online, you can always call a brand’s customer service department in a pinch.

23. Old magazines and books

Like Livengood, many of us have extra magazines lying around. It’s so easy to let subscriptions pile up and not read them month after month and have our coffee table be filled with them (of course, you’re not doing that with your AARP magazines though, since the articles are just too enticing!). Or maybe there is an article in there that you wanted to save. “A good way to avoid needlessly hanging on to old magazines is to tear out the pages that you want to hang on to, put them into a file folder and trash the rest,” says Jarrett. “It’s hard to remember where that one article about citrus fruits of the French countryside is, but you’ll have a lot less to go through if you store it with other similar items.”

Books can really pile up as well, especially if you’ve been hanging on to some that you’ve tried to read and just haven’t made progress. Old books that are just sitting on your shelf can be given new life by being passed to friends or donated to your neighborhood’s mini library where other people can enjoy them.

24. Old socks without friends

One of the biggest mysteries of the world is how does the dryer always manage to eat one of our socks but not both in a pair. Lonely socks or socks with holes in them sit in our drawers, taking up space and causing us the stress of having to dig through them to find a pair that matches.

“Unless you are a member of the mismatched sock club, it often doesn’t make sense to hang on to solo socks or socks with holes in them,” says Jarrett. “They will almost always get overlooked for a set of two socks or a pair where your big toe isn’t sticking out.” Old socks, she says, are also great to use for cleaning or for various craft projects, so if you don’t want to part with them, consider repurposing them.

25. Actual trash

It may sound obvious, but items that belong in the trash can or recycling bin often pile up on countertops and other surfaces. “Decluttering is the perfect time to walk around the house with a small garbage bag and pick up any cast-aside wrappers, soda cans, junk mail, odds and ends that are just actual trash,” says Jarrett. Imagine how good you’ll feel to finally use your dining table for meals again and not as a catch-all for things you have been meaning to dispose of.",7,1728269956.0,UnfuckYourHabitat,0,1.0,False

After many years of asking them to consider going to therapy to deal with their issues with anxiety, depression, and a violent relationship with my brother; I decided to go no-contact. There also was a trip my brother and mother took last year to see me that cemented my decision to have them out of my life. I realized their cruelty and blatant disrespect would never end regardless of what I would say.



On to the present day: it's been a year. I have gone low-contact with my brother (from no-contact) frankly because I missed him and he was going through some big life events. But I still have some strong barriers up (no talk of politics whatsoever and talk of family is kept to a minimum where I verbalize when I'm uncomfortable). 



As for my mother? I have spoken to her 3 times this year (once was a holiday, second was my brother's graduation, and third was due to a childhood medical question I needed answered. The third time happened very recently and it turned into a long drawn out 3 hour conversation. During that conversation I learned that my father had felt suicidal at one point during this estrangement (she didn't use those words but that's what I gathered from her description of a conversation they had had), my father believes he has Borderline Personality Disorder (this wasn't a surprise to me because he had texted me that a few weeks earlier), that he's experiencing night terrors every night, and that he wants to start going to therapy. My mother admitted to me that she still didn't understand the fight we had last year and that she knew she could've left when I asked her to but decided to stay for the rest of the week to ""screw me over"" (my husband described me as semi-comatose for the rest of that week). My mother also admitted that she blocked me on social media because of something I posted that said ""what it feels like when you're not struggling so much anymore"" because she thought it had something to do with her... 



During this entire video call, she cried and was pretty emotional. My dad popped in at one point and I immediately panicked and turned the screen off. I could barely say anything other than ""this is too much, I need to go"" but he left pretty quickly while saying ""I love you so much"" and then I didn't see him anymore afterward (honestly, I haven't been able to have a face-to-face conversation with my dad in 2 years). The rest of the call was fairly uneventful and it was nice talking about more lighthearted things and vacations planned. And I mistakenly told her I'd talk to her again soon. 



Now a week later, I feel immense regret having said that. I don't want to be close and the comment she made about last year's visit and the ""screwing me over"" still feels incredibly icky. Like, she hasn't changed. I wound up going to therapy to discuss this (I've been attending regularly for 1.5 years) and my therapists suggestion was primarily to do what feels right and perhaps decide to call them every major holiday for 30min or less to assuage the guilt I feel over the effect estrangement has had on them. 



Frankly? I don't know what to do and all of that was compounded by an early birthday gift I received yesterday that wound up being from my father (a coffee cup with a sweet message inscribed). FYI, I never received a happy birthday message from my dad last year because he had decided to stop speaking to me a year before that due to a disagreement about a gifted apartment and a difference in politics). Now, I just feel incredible guilt all the time. I can't stop thinking about the things my mom told me over how my father is suffering and I can't look at the coffee cup he gifted me; I immediately get emotional. I know I have a major problem with guilt regarding my father (and we've touched on this a little during therapy) but all I've heard is that his consequences are not my fault (but it doesn't help how I feel). 



I know I'll be hearing from my parents for my birthday soon but I don't know how I feel about it. I can't say if I'm dreading or looking forward to it. I just feel....too much.



Does anyone relate to what I'm going through or have a book on guilt they can recommend?",5,1728269717.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

Howard's eyes widened in surprise and fear. ""Dad! Mom!"" he yelled, his voice echoing through the room.  
  
The ring seemed to panic, its light flickering erratically. ""No, wait!"" it exclaimed, darting to a corner of the ceiling, trying to hide in the shadows.  
  
Within moments, Toni and Bruce burst into the room, their expressions a mix of concern and readiness for action. ""Howard, what's wrong?"" Bruce asked, scanning the room.  
  
Howard pointed to the corner where the ring was trying to conceal itself. ""It's back. It was whispering to me.""  
  
Antonia's eyes narrowed as she spotted the ring. ""You again,"" she muttered, stepping forward. ""What part of 'he's not ready' do you not understand?""  
  
The ring pulsed, its voice trembling slightly. ""He has potential. The Corps needs him.""

  
The next morning, the Wayne manor was bustling with activity. Hal Jordan, Jon Stewart, and Thor had come over for a visit, each bringing their unique presence to the grand estate. As they gathered in the living room, sipping coffee and catching up, a strange sight caught their attention.

Outside the window, the Green Lantern ring was hovering, following Howard as he played in the garden. The ring’s green light trailed behind him, moving in sync with his every step.

Hal Jordan, the veteran Green Lantern, was the first to notice. He nearly dropped his coffee cup in surprise. “Is that… a lantern ring?” he asked, incredulous.

Jon Stewart, another seasoned Green Lantern, leaned closer to the window, his eyes widening. “It sure looks like it. But why is it stalking the kid?”

Thor, standing tall with his mighty hammer Mjolnir resting against his side, frowned in confusion. “This is most unusual. Rings of power do not typically behave in such a manner.”

Toni and Bruce entered the room, noticing the trio’s bewildered expressions. “What’s going on?” Toni asked, following their gaze to the window.

Hal pointed to the ring. “That ring has been chosen for Howard. It’s been trying to recruit him.”

Bruce sighed, rubbing his temples. “We know. It showed up last night and wouldn’t take no for an answer.”

Jon shook his head in disbelief. “I’ve never seen a ring this persistent. It must really see something special in Howard.”

Thor nodded thoughtfully. “The boy must possess great potential. But he is still young. Perhaps it is best to guide him carefully.”

From his pocket, the ring’s soft green glow began to pulse. “Howard,” it whispered, its voice barely audible over the TV. “The television is temporary, but your destiny is eternal.”

Howard groaned, his frustration mounting. “Can you please just give me a break? I’m trying to watch my show.”

The ring pulsed again, its light flickering. “Your potential is too great to ignore. You are destined for greatness.”

Howard rolled his eyes, muting the TV and turning his attention to the ring. “I get it, okay? But I’m nine. I just want to enjoy my cartoons and do my homework without you constantly reminding me about my ‘destiny.’”

Dick Grayson had invited his best friend, Wally West, over to the Wayne manor for the afternoon. The two boys were in the living room, laughing and joking as they played a video game. Howard, curious about the older boys, sat nearby, watching them with wide eyes.

As the game grew more intense, the Green Lantern ring in Howard’s pocket began to stir. Its green light flickered, and it whispered, “Howard, your destiny awaits.”

Howard sighed, trying to ignore the ring. But it wouldn’t be silenced. “Howard, you must prepare.”

Wally, noticing Howard’s distraction, paused the game. “Hey, little dude, everything okay?”

Before Howard could respond, the ring’s light flared brightly. “Piss off, Wally West,” it declared, its voice sharp and commanding. “I will not let a worm like you interfere with Howard’s destiny.”

Wally’s eyes widened in shock, and he took a step back. “Whoa, what the heck was that?”

Dick, equally surprised, turned to Howard. “Is that the ring talking?”

Howard nodded, his face flushed with embarrassment. “Yeah, it won’t leave me alone.”

As the boys continued their game, a sudden gust of wind swept through the room, signaling the arrival of the Flash. Barry Allen, in his iconic red suit, appeared in the doorway, raising an eyebrow at the scene before him.

“Hey, guys. What’s going on?” Barry asked, his tone light but curious.

Before anyone could respond, the Green Lantern ring in Howard’s pocket groaned audibly. “Great, a bigger worm has shown up,” it muttered, its light flickering with annoyance.

Barry’s eyebrow shot up even higher. “Did that ring just call me a worm?”

Dick nodded, trying to suppress a grin. “Yeah, it’s been pretty rude to everyone. It doesn’t like anyone interfering with Howard.”

Barry crossed his arms, looking at the ring with a mix of amusement and disbelief. “Well, that’s a first. Usually, the rings are a bit more… respectful.”",2,1728269624.0,DCcomics,1,1.0,False

28F, married (30M) 

Looking at acreage outside of town 

Politically moderate (maddening in the current climate...) 

Not big drinkers (will have a glass here and there, but definitely not going out partying)

Work remotely (freelancer) so finding work is not an issue for me

Outdoorsy and active: I know there are a ton of beautiful outdoor areas to explore, which is one of the main reasons I'm interested in Cookeville. I also like CrossFit and have participated on and off for 10 years or so. I know Rich Froning's gym is there. I am a triathlete as well and interested to know if there is a multisport club! 

People: more so than the actual activities available, I want to know about communities of people who do them: Will my husband and I be able to make friends easily through activities such as hiking, biking, running, and paddling? Are there any active clubs/groups of people who get together often?

Infrastructure for such activities, particularly biking: what's the trail situation like? gravel? singletrack MTB?  back roads that I can ride. road bike on and not die? 

I also love local shops: coffee, art, books, plants. Overall we are very chill people who like to be active and spend time outside, eat good food (I'm from Louisiana), and hang out with good people. 

So, what do the people of Cookeville think? Should it stay on the list? ",2,1728269608.0,cookeville,3,0.75,False

My fiancé on the other hand, worries me. He isn't as organized, type A, tidy as me, he never puts back things where he got them, rarely charges his phone before bed or sets an alarm. Has gained a little bit of weight this past year but continues to not watch his diet for the most part. (He does work out which is a plus.) I have to usually ask him to clean anything. Food crumbs are constantly on the couch, floor, coffee table and I clean a lot more than I should for 2 people I feel like. He drinks 6-7 times a week. I truly don't remember the last time he didn't drink everynight. I mean wine and beers. I have started drinking more and its effected my mood, physical looks, because I always give in because he is.  Whenever I tell him all of this bothers me, he reminds me how much he does for me like paying for more bills, (He makes more than me), buying me weekly flowers, etc. He does do a lot for me, which to me is expected in a relationship. I feel I do a lot for him too, but he is not stepping into the adult he promised me he would be 3 years ago.

Scrolling social media the moment you wake up breeds procrastination. On the other hand, getting out of bed and moving is conducive to productivity.

And I had an obvious suicide attempt at 18. But back when I was 15 and he died, I do a hard drug, I don’t die immediately. Therefore I felt like drug warnings lied like I was gonna die from cocaine or meth immediately. I grow up and I’m now dying quite literally. I’ve been vomiting upper GI blood for 3 years. My doctor or family doesn’t even believe it anymore. My severe anxiety disorder from the PTSD has been cry wolf for many symptoms of hypochondria. But now it’s real, and nobody believes me. I’m the only one who truly understands that I’m 24 and spewing blood left and right. My mother said “you were always fine before so unless you are on the floor don’t quit work” I don’t bame her for saying that. Anxiety was been a constant cry wolf. All these tests that were fine, all these ambulance calls and I was fine from past panic attacks. But now, I’m older and dying and I’m the only one who knows it. I’m Sorry. My mother herself is even fooled by my anxiety’s cry wolf symptom. I know what coffee ground vomitis and fresh blood looks like. It’s in my vomit, it’s in my stool in fresh red and somehow, it feels like nothing. I look at internal  bleeding and I feel like I deserve it somehow. I went and got a full time job, I’m thriving in school, yet I know my drive is gone. And nobody will believe my health concerns. I am 24. Why am I dying already? It’s bullshit.

1fxxp4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fxxp4x/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"📌Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have several doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? 

HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people.

 I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; he made assumptions that even after I responded, he didn’t believe, especially if it didn’t perfectly fit his understanding.

 He didn’t question me the way I questioned him. But maybe what he did was worse; he jumped to conclusions and acted based on that. He asked if my breast augmentation was done with the intention of working in pornography, for example. I said no, it was to improve my self-esteem, so I would feel good wearing a bikini (the bikini was just an example), but he replied, 'It doesn’t make sense for someone to get breast implants just to wear a bikini.' Well, in my country, people commonly do this for aesthetic reasons; it’s quite normal. But according to his world, where he might only know about porn actresses who do this, it makes sense for him to think in those terms.
This wasn’t serious, but he did something similar by giving up on our relationship without telling me anything after an argument. Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral. It’s all very confusing.""
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

As you've seen from the tittle I wanna break up with my boyfriend. We really aren't a good match at almost anything. 
For some context: We live together, we lived together for 4 years, which wasn't really my choice. 
For some backstory:We met online through Ig I wasn't in the market for a boyfriend, but he was very persistent he wouldn't even get me back home after our date was over and he wanted to prolong it. I'm not the type that likes to go to other people's places cause i feel like im intruding (I'm AuAdhd so my brain is wired dif). After our date and the begging for me to stay with him longer I got home ghosted him for days. Not gonna lie i went to that day with the condition that hed buy me cigarettes, he already knew that he didn't mind. After ghosting him I needed a lift to the bank so I went out for coffee with him and hed take me. After that I felt obligated to hang out with him. He kinda forced me to his home, even though I didn't wanna go but I'm not really the complaining type from the beginning. And you know how things went from there. I didnt really like the aftermath so I faked that I was in pain to get it over with and just wanted to go home. We kept hanging out and it was nice getting to know him. 

Things were chill and interesting for a while before him deliberately not taking me home spiked a huge fight with my mum who kinda threw me out. He knew that would happen I warned him. So I started living with him. 

Due to trauma I can't sleep with other people in the same bed and sometimes in the same room, so I got my own room. 

After living with him I started feeling that Im 35 and he is more like 15. He is so immature. He has that need to be the certain of attention in everything in bed in life even when his mates have issues. For example it might be raining outside and his first reaction would be ""It's not my fault"", his friend broke his leg ""When I broke my leg"", when I was trying to open up about my childhood he'd be like ""I this. I that. My parents were nice. They got me this and that."". It's just I, I, I. 

I cant deal with it. I tried leaving lots of times but I keep coming back. And I'm not shy, like i told him face blank I dont see myself being with you in 10 years time I'd be miserable. We cant even have a conversation together. We dont match at all. We dont have any chemistry. He might think we do I don't know. 

He recently told me sideways that the only reason he keeps me around is cause he is old and cause he games chicks dont like it. He keeps me around cause im also a gamer i also watch soccer and don't bother him. Which is true tbh. 
I don't know if he knows that I don't bother him cause subconsciously I feel that spending time with him would be a waste even if in that time I'd be sitting looking at the wall. 

I don't know if he is like a toxic masochist or something cause we talked about this a lot. And I'm not the type to sugarcoat. I speak my truth and almost always it comes out harsh. 

I'm sure we are not a match. We can't have a conversation thats not about him or his job. We dont do anything together. He takes everything personally. And i find him less intelligent than me which is a huge turn off for me. We dont have chemistry in bed even though he thinks im awesome but thats only cause I'm kinky. And i cant take the constant fighting that only happens cause i dont wanna have sex with him. For some more context we recently moved to another house and now ive been sleeping on the sofa for almost a year. My health is deteriorating and im on edge all the time. I'm very impulsive and whenever i got in this situations in the past i ended up doing stupid things like drugs disappearing etc. 

How do I break up with him and never come back. I know its the right thing to do. But I domt know how. This would be my seventh try probably so I'm asking you guys. ",1,1728268962.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Symptoms haven’t gone away since. Should I be worried?","Doing my best to keep this as short as possible since there's a dozen stories like this a week in here. 

I have a DVT in my leg from a bad injury but am otherwise a healthy, active and athletic 23-year old male. I've been on Eliquis for over two months now. I've been a competitive runner for 10+ years and in that time my doctors have repeatedly commented on my fantastic lung capacity and heart health. I don't smoke, have maybe 1-4 alcoholic drinks per month if I drink at all, and caffeine gives me migraines so I don't drink coffee or soda. I don't mean any of this as a flex or anything, just context for my concerns with my ER visit.

Yesterday I got hit with sudden shortness of breath and dizziness while working (in a restaurant so I was moving around quite a bit) after feeling a twinge in my leg where the main clot is. Following the orders of EVERY doctor I've seen since they found the clot, I immediately headed to the ER.

The staff in the ER didn't seem to take me seriously at all because of 4 things:
    1. I forgot my Eliquis for the first time that morning so it MUST be anxiety (I fully understand that it stays in your system so I wasn't worried this would be an issue)
    2. My blood oxygen came back at 99% and my heart rate was consistently between 55-65 my whole visit there. My bloodwork showed everything in the optimal ranges
    3. I was told multiple times that I'm ""low risk"" due to my age and general health (the same thing they said when I made them check for a clot the first time)
    4. I have sports-induced asthma and a prescribed inhaler. The issue with this is that I almost NEVER have to use my inhaler even if I'm running 5 minute miles on end. I've only ever had asthma attacks a few times in my life and this feels very different.

Despite originally telling me they wanted to do a CT Scan and prepping me for one, they changed their minds and refused to do it once my bloodwork came back clean. I was quite literally laughed out of the ER after 4 hours of waiting for my blood results and my parents asking why we weren't doing the CT scan anymore.

Well now it's been over 24 hours and the pressure in my chest is still there and my COVID test came back negative. I have no symptoms of a cold otherwise. It's like I can take a full breath but something just *feels* wrong and I'm not getting enough air sometimes. 

My concern is that my lungs might be working well enough that even with the clot in there I'm getting plenty of oxygen. Since the clot was caught early, it's small so maybe the damage isn't that noticeable. They refused any further tests so is it possible for them to have missed it? Has anyone ever had a pulmonary embolism while still having otherwise good oxygenation? Or is it just flat out not possible, the doctors were right? 





Sorry for sounding extra hostile and doubtful, but the nurse taking my blood was incredibly condescending and rude the entire time and the doctor wouldn't even let me speak about my symptoms whereas in past visits everyone was fantastic. Every doctor I've seen has remarked about how uncommon a blood clot is in someone my age with my health and no family history of them. It took a second ultrasound a week after the first to find the clots after I saw bruising traveling up my leg and became convinced I had one. I'm fully willing to accept I'm wrong here, I just need confirmation that there's no way at all it reached my lungs considering my results before I go spend money I don't have on another visit to the doctor.",1,1728268856.0,ClotSurvivors,6,1.0,False

Other times people act completely bewildered that the 24 pack of Benadryl that’s usually $6-$7 at other grocery stores is not actually $1.25. I understand everyone was used to stuff being $1, and then the whole $1.25 thing was upsetting, and now we have items up to $7 and sometimes more. I’m just asking everyone to please use common sense. No, the name brand large size pack of Oreos you got is not $1.25. The Febreze, Folgers coffee and large box of Capri Suns are also not $1.25. We’ve been low on $1.25 toothpaste lately, so I’ve had a lot of people grabbing the big box of Crest and Colgate. When I ask them if they know it’s $5, they act like I’ve completely offended them. Like $5 is literally comparable to the regular stores. I know it’s hard to read the price strips, and I even understand sometimes stuff is put in the wrong spot. I’m just begging people to please stop getting mad. If you don’t want it that’s totally fine. Please just don’t look at me like I killed your first born when I tell you the large sized, name brand item you just picked up isn’t $1.25. Thank you ",15,1728268610.0,DollarTree,3,0.89,False

How can I talk to my friend about why I no longer want to be around her husband and that I'm worried how this will impact our friendship?,"I am new to reddit, so please forgive any mistakes. I'm trying to format this in a way that follows the rules. This might be considered a long read, so please take that into consideration now. I am looking for outside opinions and advice about how to constructively talk to my friend about what happened last night. I'd also like to know if people think I'm unreasonable for how I feel about this situation. Maybe some of you can help? 

For some background context, I have known my best friend (who I'll call BF) since we were 11 years old in elementary school. She has been with her now-husband for over 10 years, but they just recently got married this summer (July 2024). My sister and I were bridesmaids in their wedding. We have known BF's husband since the beginning of their relationship, and have never really had an issue with him (as far as I was aware...) before last night. 

Yesterday, I went over to BF's apartment that she shares with her husband. We started the day at the gym together and then went to get coffee (something we do pretty frequently on Saturday mornings since we joined the same gym). After that, we went to BF's apartment to hang out for the rest of the day. We had planned to hang out, cook dinner and dessert, have some wine, and just enjoy each other's company. My sister had planned to come over and join us later that evening. The idea was that, since we were going to be drinking, if my sister and I didn't feel comfortable driving home, we could stay the night in BF and her husband's second/guest bedroom and leave in the morning. This was ALL planned ahead of time. BF had invited me for this hangout a week ago. Her husband knew all of this was happening a week ago. BF had advised me and my sister to bring an overnight bag and that we were welcome to stay the night. 

When BF had originally invited me over, she mentioned her husband was going to be out with his brother on a long drive to a campsite where some of their friends were camping. She said she would like to have me and my sister over for some girl-time while her husband was going to be gone. At first, I was under the impression that her husband was going to be gone overnight, but my BF clarified for me a couple days before yesterday's hangout that he was actually going to be coming home later that night. I'm not entirely sure if that was always the plan and I just misunderstood, or if her husband and his brother (who is also married and has a 1 year old at home) changed their minds about camping overnight. This was not a problem for anyone, or so I thought... It certainly wasn't a problem for me. I fully understand that we're in his home, too, and that he is free to come and go as he pleases. He is also free to not want company over at his home he shares with his wife, and to express that to his wife. He deserves to have a say in what guests come into his home and when. I have always tried, as I do when I'm an invited guest in anyone's home, to be knowledgeable and respectful of people's boundaries and when the welcome is over. 

Me, my BF, and my sister hang out quite frequently and we talk/text almost daily. We're very close and have been for many years. We do also frequently (maybe once a month or every other month) have sleepovers that almost always happen at BF and her husband's apartment. THIS IS MY BF'S PREFERENCE. I have invited her (along with her husband if he's ever interested) to hangout at my place lots of times. I'm not in a relationship and don't have any roommates, so it's pretty much always available as an option, but she always wants to have these hangouts/sleepovers at her place. I make a point of asking EVERY TIME if her husband is ok with me coming over and BF always tells me it's fine and that he knows I'll be there. Since we are always at me BF's place, her husband often hangs out with us. I have always tried to make sure that BF's husband doesn't feel pressured (at least by me) to hang out or not hang out with us when I'm over. I'm genuinely fine either way. Or, I was...

On to the situation:
It's now the evening. My BF, my sister, and I are all having a great time at BF's place. We've just finished eating some of the dinner we made, we've got dessert in the oven, we're all a couple glasses of wine in. At about 8-9 pm, BF's husband comes home. We all say hello, but immediately he starts acting pissed off and a bit aggressive. He's walking around us three sitting at the table in the dining area and through the kitchen asking ""what the f--- is the sh--?"" about everything from the food we made, to the music we're listening to, to the conversation we're having. He's making pointed prolonged wide eye-contact with no other expression on his face to me and my sister. He asks my sister why she's not hanging out with this guy she's been on and off seeing. He stands over us all sitting at the table asking if he's ""in [our] space?"" and if he's interrupting what we're doing. He paces back and forth through the kitchen and declares ""I'm the man, I pay for this house!"" (My BF and her husband split all bills, including rent, equally.)

At first, we all kind of think he's joking around. It's not un-ordinary for BF's husband to make these sort of ""I'm the man!"" jokes and to say things facetiously. But it quickly becomes obvious to me and my sister that this is not his normal joking. He's being way more aggressive than I've ever seen him act before. To me, he is clearly angry and doesn't want me and my sister in his home. I even asked him if he wanted us to leave, and he just stared at me with that weird wide-eyed look. The whole time he's doing this, my BF is asking him what's wrong, and to stop, and telling him he's making us uncomfortable, and telling him my sister and I are uncomfortable because we ""can't tell that [he's] joking,"" and the whole time he's responding ""I don't care"" or ""I'm not sorry."" He did also loudly inform his wife that he hadn't drank any of the water that he'd brought with him, only beer, and that he also hadn't eaten. He then lays on the couch in the living area right next to us and watches TV loudly while my BF, my sister, and I make Halloween-themed cookie houses at the table in silence. The air was really sucked out of the room after that. We had planned to watch an already chosen movie to end the night. We had actually decided to wait for BF's husband to get home, because the movie was a little expensive to rent and my BF wanted to make it ""worth it"" by having more people watching.  

When we finished decorating the houses, my BF asked her husband if we could watch our movie after the episode he was watching was over. He agreed and we waited. Then, when his episode was over, BF asked him if he was feeling better, if he wanted to watch the movie with us, and if he could ""share space with us."" He says ""No,"" then quickly follows with ""fine,"" then says he's going to bed. 

At the point BF's husband came home acting strange and aggressive, I had decided there was no way I was staying the night, so I didn't pour myself anymore wine and began downing my water. After BF's husband went to bed, BF, my sister, and I ended up watching a few episodes of Impractical Jokers instead of the movie we had planned on. After I was sure I was sober, I drove home.

(All ""quotes"" are exact words/phrases I remember being said.)

Advice I'm seeking:
What is the best way for me to talk to my life-long best friend (whom I love, want the best for, and don't want to burden) about how her husband's behavior last night A.) made me so uncomfortable I don't think I want to be in his home ever again, B.) has completely shattered my good opinion of him, and C.) seems like a huge red flag that makes me a little worried for her? Is it unreasonable for me to feel this way? I'm not and have never been worried he would ever hurt her physically, but I am now a little worried that he's decided to dictate who his wife can hang out with and that he doesn't like her hanging out with me and my sister. If his problem is that he just doesn't want me over in his home so much, that would be perfectly fine and reasonable in my opinion. He could have said this at any point and I wouldn't have taken it personally or had any problem with it at all. He's never acted like this in front of me before and I was very shocked, as was my sister.  I've always thought he was a pretty genuinely nice guy up to this point. From my perspective, he was like a different person last night. I'm now also wondering if he acts like this with my BF often when it's just them home alone. 

My BF is clearly disappointed and upset about how all of this went down, but she seems to be excusing his behavior saying he was off with the guys, shooting and doing other ""guy stuff,"" and he came home grumpy and tired so that's why he was so amped-up and aggressive. She apologized to me last night before I left, and I told her she did nothing wrong to apologize for and that I hoped everyone got the rest they needed. I texted her this morning around 10:30am asking how everything was over there. She said her husband had got up around 8am, gave her a kiss, then left their apartment and hadn't come home. She didn't know where he went. They were supposed to go to her parents house at, like, 11:00am and since he hadn't come home or contacted her yet, she was going by herself. 

I really don't know what to say at this point. I feel so bad for my friend and I'm scared that this incident will effect our friendship negatively. I absolutely do not want, nor I have I ever wanted to come in between my BF's relationship. I don't want to make my best friend's life harder. But... what the actual fnck happened here? And how do I constructively talk to me best friend about why I no longer want to come over to her apartment? Or about how I'm a bit worried her husband may have flipped a switch now that they're married and decided he doesn't want her hanging out with her friends so much?

Tldr: 
My sister and I went to my best friend's apartment to hang out and drink wine, her husband came home acting uncharacteristically angry and aggressive, especially towards me and my sister, and now I don't feel comfortable around my best friend's husband. How do I constructively talk to my best friend about me not wanting to be around her husband, especially in his home, and how I think his behavior was a red flag and I'm scared this will negatively impact our friendship?",1,1728267996.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

The coffee shop would become the primary site for the hockey community to meet off the rink for reasons associated to the connections it has to professional hockey which will raise revenue, if I'm right about this.

Either Mcdavid buys it or I buy it (not really).

Edit: Having looked into it the ability to purchase Tim Hortons for the sake of taking it private I am correcting my approach by pointing to the business community in the hockey community as becoming partners working together to have Tim Hortons become an extension of the hockey community as I wrote out in the post.

1. The Stew Crew was booked and busy this week and spread so thin that for the first time in forever they couldn’t release a vlog telling us how exciting and awesome everything was. Carlin had canned content ready to role when Katie went into labor. We saw more of Layla at dance class and a family hug where Carlin turned into stretch Armstrong to film herself crying tears of joy, right there in the dance studio waiting room. Of course Carlin was with Katie as she checked in to labor and delivery. The nurses stopped her from changing into a hospital gown and made her stand beside the bed, although she really wanted to be in it. Evan tagged along to sit in the waiting room bc he certainly couldn’t be expected to stay home with his children. Kelly Joe praised Carlin for being such an amazing sister to drop everything and stay by Katie’s side…. Until all of the vlog was filmed and the Duggars hit town. Layla had to give up her room for Joy and Austin Forsyth, and Jessa and Ben Seewald also stayed with the Stewarts. It’s a shame the only person in that house who works had to give up their bed. Ten kids and 6 adults all packed in for a Duggar wedding that this time, Carlin had no problem talking about. Carlin took the Dugs late night shopping for a birthday basket for Katie. She captured and shared a picture that included Lauren Duggar, which according to DuggarSnark is like photographing Bigfoot. Carlin told Travis to get the tripod set up and push record bc she was dropping by at exactly midnight to wish her sister Happy Birthday. Finally it was time for the Duggar wedding, where Carlin wore clear plastic heels and Evan wore a white TShirt with a blazer. We get to see the Forsyths in the hot tub, all the kids swimming and there seems to be a flirtation between Jeremy Voulo and Evan as they tag each other and send lots of emojis back and forth on IG. Jessa and her passel of kids join The Stewarts at the Knoxville Zoo and then Carlin and Evan head to another wedding. This time it’s for a boutique employee. In exchange for room and board, Jessa offers up the services of Jana and her new husband Steven, and Carlin happily accepts. She puts them to work doing the one home improvement project we all thought Evan could handle… installing a light fixture. That’s right… the dude will not so much as screw in a light bulb.

2. Harvey Clark is here and made his social media debut at less than 24 hours old. Katie and Travis were able to churn out tons of social media and a full part one birth vlog, even though the baby was transferred to the Children’s Hospital and was struggling to breathe. Proving that they do not believe in germs we see Zach and Whitney, Kelly Joe, Carlin and Evan and Michael and Brandon all holding and kissing the newborn. Ellie was in charge of Hailey and Kelly Joe, Carlin and Whitney were all in the room as Katie labored. Evan sat in the waiting room and went to the airport to retrieve Travis’ parents. At least 46 times one of the women say how exciting this is and Kelly is practically coming out of her skin. The woman is just really into pregnancy and birth. Travis is wearing a huge sweatshirt and meanders around like a giddy high school kid rubbing his hands together. Katie cries and thanks everyone and the labor progresses quickly. Katie has the same delivery doctor as Josie and the same nurse as well. Travis is upset that his necklace push present for Katie has the wrong birthstone.  After 6 days in the hospital Harvey comes home. Katie turns 24 as a mother of 2. Kelly Joe gushes over their movie nights and secret telling and it sounds like they are 7th grade BFFs. Talk about arrested development. Travis says it is the  6th birthday he has spent with her. He decorates the empty apartment and has cake and pizza, but he can’t top Carlin, and frankly seems too exhausted to even try. 

3. Josie really got back to her fundamentalist roots this week on a work trip to Orlando for Kelton’s plumbing business. Bobby had to attend, which meant Tori and the kids could come. Erin was close enough to show up for a playdate and a free meal, and Jackson and Emy came by also. Michael was also there… maybe as the babysitter, bc I never spotted Brandon. Josie seemed natural and happy surrounded by the most conservative family members and Kelton cooked for everyone. Josie didn’t wear her pool noodle once the entire week and humbled herself enough to make a Goodwill trip with Tori and Erin. After flying home from Florida, Josie tells us she has been craving wings, so Kelton made her some wings… she shows us the wings and they are, in fact, frozen chicken tenders coated with Frank’s Red Hot Sauce. Does this chick think that Buffalo Hot Sauce makes chicken a wing?? I am scared of the answer. Josie is home just long enough to shill her usual links, repack their bags, wash off the culty stench and hit the road again. This time the Balka’s landed in New York to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary. They rented a car and drove straight to Emma Langdon’s home in Connecticut. We see lots of dreamy snaps of the New England Autumn, including Josie with her eyes closed in bliss… on a hay ride. Next stop is Vermont for more dizzying excitement. 

4. With SO many Bates sisters in Orlando this week, surely they all saw Alyssa, right? At least some of them saw Alyssa, right? Nope. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Alyssa has met none of her new nephews and many of her siblings have not met Rhett. If she wants to get her numbers and engagement up… she should start spilling the tea. Instead we get a lukewarm return to IG where she tells us how busy their September was bc of church, karate, and John’s softball. They did go on the yearly beach trip with the Taliban Dan crowd and she says the girls were beside themselves with excitement. I can’t imagine why. She shares a late night Costco run where all 5 children and John tagalong and it’s still light outside. Michael sent the girls cute little handmade aprons and Alyssa pushes links for body oil but not for Michael’s store. We haven’t heard a peep about the sad hat since Alyssa last promoted it in mid September, but while she was at the beach she threw it on the sand and filmed it sitting there. That helped her sell exactly zero hats. During the week, Alyssa tries out lots of different influencing tricks… we see coffee, an unboxing of $68 PJs that got tons of backlash in the comments, cooking that featured some shoe leather beef slices in a pan, one of the girls feeding Rhett an apple and finally she shared a code for the super expensive sheets everyone else has been selling. She mentions that Carlin told her about the sheets. What I really think Carlin told her was to ditch the sad hat and focus on pushing links. This week’s vlog was the family beach trip except Alyssa can’t really show John’s family. Rhett whines and cries the entire time and Alyssa has to work taking everyone’s pictures. Allie skips into frame at one point and tries to add to the commentary but Alyssa pushes her back and ends up having to apologize for being a tad too aggressive. The beach trip sounds about as much fun as karate or watching school on a dvd player… or listening to John Webster prattle on about anything.

5. Whitney Bates really thought she was a top level influencer this week when she dropped a brand new reel linking both Huffy electric bikes AND WalMart while also giving marriage advice. Her caption told all about how their recent trip to Hawaii reminded them they needed to spend time alone, just the 2 of them and lazy days of long romantic bike rides.  Is that what most couples with 5 kids and a mortgage do? Anyway, they ate her up in the comments, calling her materialistic, a sellout, and tone deaf to post such a thing while so many nearby were suffering with nothing after the hurricane. She went quiet for a few days and Zach agreed to appear in a reel for Medicorps and help them beg for money. They barely had to twist his arm. He must have been big mad about the comments bc he didn’t even take to the Bates Kitchen this week to slop around some mayonnaise and boxed cake mix. Whitney did shill her earbuds and shared pictures from the BSB employee’s wedding and the Duggar I do’s. We see little Lillie Joe toddling around at the wedding in a velour bubble with knee socks and hopefully a cute baby will calm down all of the negative comments so Momma can get back to hawking her links. 

6.  Trace and Lydia dropped Ryker with her parents and hopped a plane to Hawaii. Ryker should have gotten to go on the trip since he paid for it. This was their 2nd anniversary celebration and we see them on the island in a convertible. They are gone for a week but Trace is able to phone in for the Medicorps fundraising video. Kelly Joe says she is overjoyed they are married and they are her best friends.

7. Erin and Chad happily packed up their six kids and went to squat at the Balka’s Orlando vacation rental. Tempers flared when Kelton explained to Chad that they only rented the house for a week and the Paine’s could not move in permanently. Seriously though, Erin was tickled to see her soul sister Tori and posted a pic of all of the children together. The cousins seemed happy. 

8. Lawson Bates is in absolute heaven. He finally got to leave his extended paternity leave and go cosplay rescue hero. He didn’t have to be in Nathan’s shadow bc Nate had to sit this one out while waiting on the birth of his new son. Lawson was boots on the ground doing the hard and dangerous job of… filming, providing commentary, delivering pizza and sticking a microphone in traumatized people’s faces. The back of his head made it into a picture with Ivanka Trump who showed up as window dressing and for the rest of the week he mentioned “EYE-vanck-UH”. Lawson interviewed a man who had just been rescued by local firemen. The man mentioned the volunteer firefighters and Lawson interrupted him to say “WE ARE HELPING TOO. WE ARE VOLUNTEERS TOO.” Kelly shares every Medicorp post she can. They use interesting wording like “facilitate” and “assist” and “on sight”. They film lots of destruction and meetings but they aren’t heading anything up, and Lawson is not a medic. Or a cop. Or a police officer. No matter how much he pretends. He is a volunteer(fan). We do see him riding on the helicopter as someone rescues a 94 year old lady. Anyway, back at home, Tiffy is beside herself with happiness getting to hold and cuddle her baby as much as she wants and however she wants. 

9. Michael posts with Baby Harvey and Brandon and then takes JebJud with her to Florida to spend time with the sisters and his cousins. I think Kelly and Gil have turned him completely over to her at this point. She attends the Duggar wedding possibly without Brandon. His new job must be taking up lots of time. He didn’t even have time to film himself coloring this week.

10. Bits and Bytes… Alyssa reported that Janie and Bill’s farm was still without power midweek… Josie and Grace worked a wedding together…Kelly Joe and Gil appeared in the Medicorp fundraising video… Kelly is now tucking her shirts into her denim skirt.

Have a great week friends! As a Carolina girl, I ask you to keep the Carolinas in your heart and help if you can. It’s a long road to recovery.

Finally it was time for the Duggar wedding, where Carlin wore clear plastic heels and Evan wore a white TShirt with a blazer. We get to see the Forsyths in the hot tub, all the kids swimming and there seems to be a flirtation between Jeremy Voulo and Evan as they tag each other and send lots of emojis back and forth on IG. Jessa and her passel of kids join The Stewarts at the Knoxville Zoo and then Carlin and Evan head to another wedding. This time it’s for a boutique employee. In exchange for room and board, Jessa offers up the services of Jana and her new husband Steven, and Carlin happily accepts. She puts them to work doing the one home improvement project we all thought Evan could handle… installing a light fixture. That’s right… the dude will not so much as screw in a light bulb.

2. Harvey Clark is here and made his social media debut at less than 24 hours old. Katie and Travis were able to churn out tons of social media and a full part one birth vlog, even though the baby was transferred to the Children’s Hospital and was struggling to breathe. Proving that they do not believe in germs we see Zach and Whitney, Kelly Joe, Carlin and Evan and Michael and Brandon all holding and kissing the newborn. Ellie was in charge of Hailey and Kelly Joe, Carlin and Whitney were all in the room as Katie labored. Evan sat in the waiting room and went to the airport to retrieve Travis’ parents. At least 46 times one of the women say how exciting this is and Kelly is practically coming out of her skin. The woman is just really into pregnancy and birth. Travis is wearing a huge sweatshirt and meanders around like a giddy high school kid rubbing his hands together. Katie cries and thanks everyone and the labor progresses quickly. Katie has the same delivery doctor as Josie and the same nurse as well. Travis is upset that his necklace push present for Katie has the wrong birthstone.  After 6 days in the hospital Harvey comes home. Katie turns 24 as a mother of 2. Kelly Joe gushes over their movie nights and secret telling and it sounds like they are 7th grade BFFs. Talk about arrested development. Travis says it is the  6th birthday he has spent with her. He decorates the empty apartment and has cake and pizza, but he can’t top Carlin, and frankly seems too exhausted to even try. 

3. Josie really got back to her fundamentalist roots this week on a work trip to Orlando for Kelton’s plumbing business. Bobby had to attend, which meant Tori and the kids could come. Erin was close enough to show up for a playdate and a free meal, and Jackson and Emy came by also. Michael was also there… maybe as the babysitter, bc I never spotted Brandon. Josie seemed natural and happy surrounded by the most conservative family members and Kelton cooked for everyone. Josie didn’t wear her pool noodle once the entire week and humbled herself enough to make a Goodwill trip with Tori and Erin. After flying home from Florida, Josie tells us she has been craving wings, so Kelton made her some wings… she shows us the wings and they are, in fact, frozen chicken tenders coated with Frank’s Red Hot Sauce. Does this chick think that Buffalo Hot Sauce makes chicken a wing?? I am scared of the answer. Josie is home just long enough to shill her usual links, repack their bags, wash off the culty stench and hit the road again. This time the Balka’s landed in New York to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary. They rented a car and drove straight to Emma Langdon’s home in Connecticut. We see lots of dreamy snaps of the New England Autumn, including Josie with her eyes closed in bliss… on a hay ride. Next stop is Vermont for more dizzying excitement. 

4. With SO many Bates sisters in Orlando this week, surely they all saw Alyssa, right? At least some of them saw Alyssa, right? Nope. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Alyssa has met none of her new nephews and many of her siblings have not met Rhett. If she wants to get her numbers and engagement up… she should start spilling the tea. Instead we get a lukewarm return to IG where she tells us how busy their September was bc of church, karate, and John’s softball. They did go on the yearly beach trip with the Taliban Dan crowd and she says the girls were beside themselves with excitement. I can’t imagine why. She shares a late night Costco run where all 5 children and John tagalong and it’s still light outside. Michael sent the girls cute little handmade aprons and Alyssa pushes links for body oil but not for Michael’s store. We haven’t heard a peep about the sad hat since Alyssa last promoted it in mid September, but while she was at the beach she threw it on the sand and filmed it sitting there. That helped her sell exactly zero hats. During the week, Alyssa tries out lots of different influencing tricks… we see coffee, an unboxing of $68 PJs that got tons of backlash in the comments, cooking that featured some shoe leather beef slices in a pan, one of the girls feeding Rhett an apple and finally she shared a code for the super expensive sheets everyone else has been selling. She mentions that Carlin told her about the sheets. What I really think Carlin told her was to ditch the sad hat and focus on pushing links. This week’s vlog was the family beach trip except Alyssa can’t really show John’s family. Rhett whines and cries the entire time and Alyssa has to work taking everyone’s pictures. Allie skips into frame at one point and tries to add to the commentary but Alyssa pushes her back and ends up having to apologize for being a tad too aggressive. The beach trip sounds about as much fun as karate or watching school on a dvd player… or listening to John Webster prattle on about anything.

5. Whitney Bates really thought she was a top level influencer this week when she dropped a brand new reel linking both Huffy electric bikes AND WalMart while also giving marriage advice. Her caption told all about how their recent trip to Hawaii reminded them they needed to spend time alone, just the 2 of them and lazy days of long romantic bike rides.  Is that what most couples with 5 kids and a mortgage do? Anyway, they ate her up in the comments, calling her materialistic, a sellout, and tone deaf to post such a thing while so many nearby were suffering with nothing after the hurricane. She went quiet for a few days and Zach agreed to appear in a reel for Medicorps and help them beg for money. They barely had to twist his arm. He must have been big mad about the comments bc he didn’t even take to the Bates Kitchen this week to slop around some mayonnaise and boxed cake mix. Whitney did shill her earbuds and shared pictures from the BSB employee’s wedding and the Duggar I do’s. We see little Lillie Joe toddling around at the wedding in a velour bubble with knee socks and hopefully a cute baby will calm down all of the negative comments so Momma can get back to hawking her links. 

6.  Trace and Lydia dropped Ryker with her parents and hopped a plane to Hawaii. Ryker should have gotten to go on the trip since he paid for it. This was their 2nd anniversary celebration and we see them on the island in a convertible. They are gone for a week but Trace is able to phone in for the Medicorps fundraising video. Kelly Joe says she is overjoyed they are married and they are her best friends.

7. Erin and Chad happily packed up their six kids and went to squat at the Balka’s Orlando vacation rental. Tempers flared when Kelton explained to Chad that they only rented the house for a week and the Paine’s could not move in permanently. Seriously though, Erin was tickled to see her soul sister Tori and posted a pic of all of the children together. The cousins seemed happy. 

8. Lawson Bates is in absolute heaven. He finally got to leave his extended paternity leave and go cosplay rescue hero. He didn’t have to be in Nathan’s shadow bc Nate had to sit this one out while waiting on the birth of his new son. Lawson was boots on the ground doing the hard and dangerous job of… filming, providing commentary, delivering pizza and sticking a microphone in traumatized people’s faces. The back of his head made it into a picture with Ivanka Trump who showed up as window dressing and for the rest of the week he mentioned “EYE-vanck-UH”. Lawson interviewed a man who had just been rescued by local firemen. The man mentioned the volunteer firefighters and Lawson interrupted him to say “WE ARE HELPING TOO. WE ARE VOLUNTEERS TOO.” Kelly shares every Medicorp post she can. They use interesting wording like “facilitate” and “assist” and “on sight”. They film lots of destruction and meetings but they aren’t heading anything up, and Lawson is not a medic. Or a cop. Or a police officer. No matter how much he pretends. He is a volunteer(fan). We do see him riding on the helicopter as someone rescues a 94 year old lady. Anyway, back at home, Tiffy is beside herself with happiness getting to hold and cuddle her baby as much as she wants and however she wants. 

9. Michael posts with Baby Harvey and Brandon and then takes JebJud with her to Florida to spend time with the sisters and his cousins. I think Kelly and Gil have turned him completely over to her at this point. She attends the Duggar wedding possibly without Brandon. His new job must be taking up lots of time. He didn’t even have time to film himself coloring this week.

10. Bits and Bytes… Alyssa reported that Janie and Bill’s farm was still without power midweek… Josie and Grace worked a wedding together…Kelly Joe and Gil appeared in the Medicorp fundraising video… Kelly is now tucking her shirts into her denim skirt.

Have a great week friends! As a Carolina girl, I ask you to keep the Carolinas in your heart and help if you can. It’s a long road to recovery.

I’m not a sound professional, so I probably don’t belong here … but I’ve searched Google and can’t find anything that directly addresses my issue, so I’m turning to the real pros in the hope that someone will “take pity” on me! 😉 I’m just a small-time, amateur performer … local coffee houses and small restaurants. I perform with a vocal mic, an instrument mic, a reverb box for the vocals, a small mixer, a powered speaker, and a Martin D-18. I don’t plug the Martin in … it goes through only the instrument mic. The vocal mic is connected to the reverb box which is then connected to the mixer. The instrument mic is connected directly to the mixer. The mixer output is connected to the powered speaker. All pretty standard stuff … Tinker Toys for the members here. I was recently gifted an ART Tube MP preamp (original version) by someone who doesn’t need it anymore. I’m thinking about trying to incorporate it into my rig, but I really don’t know whether to use it for the vocals or the guitar … or maybe neither? And if on the vocals, before or after the reverb unit? I’d appreciate any thoughts/advice on this. Many thanks in advance to any/all who reply.",1,1728267570.0,livesound,5,1.0,False

I would not say that I have a stutter as in stuttering my words. 
My problem is that I literally go to say the word and I can’t even get the first letter out my mouth to say it, but then I can replace it with other words after thinking of them and stumbling around words for about 5 seconds. (Which feel like the longest 5 seconds of my life every time) 

It comes and goes and I think it has to do with anxiety and stimulants and also alcohol. 

This probably started around 4 years ago for me, I am now 34 year old. 

I started drinking coffee when I was 28 and had no problems at all for the first two years. 

From 30 it was only coffee or very high stimulants like cocaine (only being honest) that would do this. 
I could cope with this because I could either decrease my coffee intake or just keep away from drugs which was fine for me. 

I still drink coffee (no more than two shots a day) But recently it has also been as little as having 1 pint of beer or 1 glass of wine that has set me off not being able to talk and as far as I know alcohol is not a stimulant. 

I don’t know what’s going on and feel like my speech is deteriorating by the week. 

Let me know if any one has any similar experiences please. 

Thanks. ",1,1728267543.0,Stutter,1,0.99,False

I messaged her week later to grab dinner but no response. Why would ex suddenly ghost me?,"Randomly ran into my ex almost one year after no contact and breaking up. The breakup was nothing bad, we just didn’t communicate well and it lead to misunderstandings. Well, she didn’t communicate her issues and made a decision to break up after a really healthy relationship. Anyways, I Kept it short and sweet for about a minute and I went on my merry way. About three weeks later my friend encouraged me to reach out and just to meet up since we’re both in our early 40s and we’re adults and there is nothing to lose. So I did and few days later she responded with yes so we met up for coffee for a few hours . It went fine, we just caught up. Afterwards, I gave her a gift of something I was holding onto before we broke up. I did tell her that I certainly missed her right after we broke up and it wasn’t easy, but I’m happy to see that she’s happy and that I would love to see her again. She didn’t really respond right away to that but she did linger and smiled and she said that maybe we’ll see each other again.

About three days later, I texted her saying it was great to see her and it brought back great memories and I’d love to do dinner with her. Again, we are adults and I have nothing to lose. I haven’t heard from her for five days since I sent that text…

It’s sad that two ppl who cared for each other, that one of them is probably going to just ghost me instead of just saying no. This has caused me to be so annoyed all week and frustrated all over. It doesn’t matter if they are 20 or 40, ppl can still be shitty. I will never message her again.",1,1728267533.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

The issue I’m having now is that I’ve recently joined two new social groups, a book club and a more general one. Both of these have a mix of ages and I know would appeal to her. I’m just dreading her inviting herself along as I want this to be my thing. I don’t want to hear the in-depth lives of my new friends as second hand information from her.
