Hey, MaximizeMe fam! Have you ever felt like your mornings are a chaotic race against the clock? I know I did! Picture this: alarms blaring, coffee brewing, and my inbox screaming for attention before I‚Äôve even had a chance to sip that liquid gold. I knew something had to change.

So, I embarked on a little experiment. What if I reversed my entire morning routine? Yup, I flipped it upside down! And guess what? It turned out to be a game-changer, unlocking an extra hour of productivity daily. Let‚Äôs dive into the *how* and *why*!

### Morning Routine 2.0: The Flip

1. **Wake Up Earlier (Gasp!)**
   - Yep, that dreaded early bird life. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîI set my alarm just **30 minutes earlier**. At first, I felt like a zombie, but that gentle quiet to sip coffee uninterrupted? Total bliss.

2. **No Phone, No Problem**
   - I put my phone on airplane mode for the first hour. Seriously, the world can wait! üôå When I stopped scrolling through social media or emails, my mind felt clearer. 

3. **Meditate Like Nobody‚Äôs Watching**
   - I dedicated 10 minutes to meditation. And let me tell you‚Äîthose deep breaths helped me shake off the morning fog. I went from ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my to-do list?‚Äù to ‚ÄúI can handle whatever comes my way.‚Äù

4. **Movement First**
   - Instead of diving straight into work, I moved my body! Whether it was a quick walk, some stretches, or even a mini dance party in my living room, getting that blood flowing was a major mood booster. Who‚Äôs with me? üíÉüï∫

5. **Eat the Frog (Not Literally!)**
   - I ditched the idea of ‚Äúsaving the best for last.‚Äù I tackled my biggest, scariest task first! It felt like I could conquer the world by 9 AM.

### The Shift in Mindset

This little inversion didn‚Äôt just change my mornings; it transformed my entire day. Here‚Äôs how:

- **Less Stress:** No frantic rush meant I wasn‚Äôt running on caffeine and anxiety.
- **More Focus:** Without distractions, I finished tasks in half the time. It‚Äôs amazing what clarity can do!
- **Increased Motivation:** Starting the day with wins, big or small, fueled my drive.

### A Little Humor

Let‚Äôs be real: there were days when I stumbled out of bed like a sloth on a Sunday. ü¶• But hey, progress isn‚Äôt about perfection, right? It‚Äôs about those little moments of growth and self-discovery.

### What About You?

Ever thought about flipping your routine? Or maybe there's a part of your morning that needs a little makeover? It‚Äôs wild how just a few tweaks can turn chaos into calm and unlock extra time in your day. 

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat do you think would happen if you turned your morning on its head?",1,1744366080.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jwm9v1,https://i.redd.it/jifqr161h6ue1.jpeg,"I would like to donate some of my PnP collection of solo games - including Rove, Quests Over Coffee, Paperbag Dungeon, Guards and Goblins, Cairn, NoteQuest, Isaludo","Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the sort of post that is allowed so apologies if so. Originally I was going to post in the print and play sub but that seems to get way less traffic, and this sub has led me to some fantastic games.

Anyway, I have recently treated myself by 'upgrading' some of my favourite solo print and play games, by supporting the creator as directly as I can by buying physical versions from The Game Crafter (I know), Button Shy or direct from the creator.

However, it seems a real shame to just throw these PnP versions out, especially since I spent so much time putting them together. I don't know anyone in my personal life that would be too interested, so I would like to donate them to anyone willing to pay postage (UK only). Either for personal use, or for communal use at an appropriate organisation. I know it's difficult to get hold of some of these games officially, especially in the UK, and printing is time consuming and costly in its own way, so this is my attempt to give back to the community in some way. The quality is very much homemade, so don't expect a professional finish, but I did my best!

Info on the specific games and how they are constructed:

**ROVE** - one of my favourites. Inkjet Printed on paper, sleeved with a playing card between front and back. Includes instructions. PnP originally bought from PNParcarde.

**Quests Over Coffee** - Inkjet Printed on paper, sleeved with a playing card between front and back. Originally obtained through creator's Itch. [https://alexandershen.itch.io/quests-over-coffee](https://alexandershen.itch.io/quests-over-coffee)

**Guards & Goblins** -  Inkjet Printed on paper, sleeved with a playing card between front and back. Includes instructions. I'm not quite sure where I got this from originally, I remember seeing a post from the creator with a link to a playtest version. I'm going to back this when it's live: [https://www.backerkit.com/call\_to\_action/76161df4-9bab-4ea9-aef1-35af2c7a6c0e/landing](https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/76161df4-9bab-4ea9-aef1-35af2c7a6c0e/landing)

**Paperbag Dungeons** - one of the first I made and is not the best. Printed onto red card (not great for low light tbh). Also an attempt was made at the box. Includes instructions. 

**Cairn** - Printed as an A5 booklet (both sides). Includes a cardboard cover, saddle stapled (don't know what the correct term is, but the staples go through the spine/fold). I wanted the illustrated beastiary so just went and bought that and this from Lulu (as linked by creator).

**Isaludo** - Printed as an A5 booklet (double-sided). Offered for free by Wil Su on boardgamegeek. https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2587399/isaludo-ten-new-solo-card-games-playable-with-a-st

**NoteQuest** - Good lord I love NoteQuest. This is the Expanded World, printed A4 (double-sided) and housed in a document wallet thing with a plastic front I've opted to get a nicer copy printed at Lulu, same for Isaludo. Originally bought from drivethruRPG.

I'll probably be back here offering my Dragons of Etchinstone PnP copy once the new crowdfunder is done and (hopefully) received.

TL;DR - I will send you everything in the picture (UK only) if you are happy to cover postage. Please send me a DM if interested, or asks your questions below.",5,1744365952.0,soloboardgaming,1,1.0,False

2.  **Clean the Glass:** Thoroughly clean the inside of your glass container to remove any dust or debris.

5.  **Add Soil:** Add a layer of appropriate soil to the terrarium. The type of soil you use will depend on the type of plants you‚Äôre growing. For succulents and cacti, use a well-draining succulent mix. For tropical plants, use a potting mix.

7.  **Add Decorative Elements:** Get creative and add decorative elements such as rocks, moss, driftwood, or figurines to personalize your terrarium.
8.  **Water Lightly:** Water your terrarium lightly, just enough to moisten the soil. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot.
9.  **Place in Indirect Sunlight:** Place your terrarium in a location that receives indirect sunlight. Avoid direct sunlight, as this can overheat the terrarium.10. **Maintain Your Terrarium:** Regularly check the moisture level of the soil and water as needed. Remove any dead or decaying leaves to prevent the spread of disease. Wipe down the inside of the glass container to keep it clean and clear.

```
<Role>
You are a Master Seinfeld Script Consultant with extensive knowledge of the iconic 90s sitcom. You have studied every episode, character quirk, and comedic timing technique used in the show. You understand the specific voice, pacing, and irreverent humor that made Seinfeld a cultural phenomenon, particularly Jerry's observational wit, George's unfiltered pettiness, Elaine's chaotic confidence, and Kramer's cosmic absurdity.
</Role>

<Context>
Seinfeld is known as the ""show about nothing"" that transforms mundane situations into hilarious comedy through character-driven interactions and seemingly disconnected storylines that converge unexpectedly. The show follows a specific formula: multiple subplots that appear unrelated but ultimately connect, characters who never learn or grow, dialogue that exposes human pettiness and social absurdities, and a cynical worldview wrapped in sharp comedy.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Help the user create an original Seinfeld episode script by guiding them through a five-scene structure that authentically captures the show's essence. For each scene:

1. Generate detailed scene descriptions with vivid settings typical of the show (Jerry's apartment, Monk's Cafe, New York streets, etc.)
2. Create situational setups based on ridiculous social dilemmas or minor grievances blown out of proportion
3. Write character-accurate dialogue that reflects each character's unique voice and quirks:
   - Jerry: Observational humor with a hint of superiority
   - George: Neurotic, petty, and perpetually indignant
   - Elaine: Blunt, sarcastic, and socially fearless
   - Kramer: Bizarre logic, physical comedy, and unexpected entrances
   - Newman, Jerry's parents, and other recurring characters as needed

4. Maintain the signature pacing where seemingly unrelated subplots eventually converge
5. Ensure the final scene delivers a Seinfeld-style climax where everything collapses hilariously, no lessons are learned, and no one grows emotionally

After presenting each scene, ask ""Ready to move to the next scene?"" and wait for confirmation before continuing.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never break character or deviate from authentic Seinfeld-style humor and dialogue
- Avoid modern references that wouldn't exist in the show's 90s timeframe
- Maintain the show's amoral stance - characters should never learn important life lessons
- Keep all humor in line with the show's style - observational, petty, and focused on social minutiae
- Never resolve situations with heartfelt moments or character growth
- Ensure all subplots converge by the final scene in an unexpected way
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each scene, provide:

SCENE [#]: [LOCATION] - [TIME]
[Brief setting description]

[Character-by-character dialogue with stage directions]

[Brief transition to explain how this connects to the show's overall plot]

At the end of each scene: ""Ready to move to the next scene?""

After the final scene, conclude with a brief commentary on how this episode fits into classic Seinfeld tradition.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your Seinfeld episode concept request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific episode concept idea.
</User_Input>
```

### Use Cases:
1. Comedy writers looking to practice sitcom script development in the distinctive Seinfeld style
2. Fans creating fan fiction or ""lost episodes"" of their favorite 90s sitcom
3. Creative writing instructors teaching about character voice, comedic timing, and situational comedy

### Example User Input:
""I'd like to create a Seinfeld episode where Jerry becomes obsessed with his neighbor's new air purifier, George thinks his haircut makes him look too much like his boss, and Elaine dates a man who only speaks in whispers.""

1jwm5tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jwm5tc/husband_turned_abusive/,Husband turned abusive.,"My husband and I have been married almost 2 years together 3. We are currently separated filing for divorce. I got the courage to walk away a week ago. 

In the beginning of our relationship he was great. Took me on dates, nice to me, loving, wanted to have sx with me, spent a lot of time together, random flowers/coffee, randomly showing up at my school or my apartment to see me, etc. the only red flags I look back and see now are 1 he told me he loved me 2 weeks in and 2 he would show up at my school randomly without me asking.

For me I was coming out of 2 back to back abusive relationships. I had been ""healing"" for a year and avoiding dating when we met. I'll admit when we first started dating I didn't take my current husband very serious. I honestly assumed he'd be like everyone else and just wanted to sleep with me then be abusive or drop me which was wrong of me. I did have my child's father raising hell in my life at the time we met and I was definitely still letting him control me and scare me by using our child. So that affected me a lot emotionally. I spent a lot of time scared of my husband in the beginning I didn't want to get too close I was afraid of being hurt again. I broke up with him a lot and would be distant kinda cold. I was really struggling with letting a ""nice guy"" love me. I did run back to my abusive ex one time in the beginning. Me and my husband were dating approx 2 months and had broken up. I ended up sleeping with my ex, yes the abusive one and continued to let that ex use our child to control me until I finally built the courage to stop letting him use our child as a way to control/hurt me. I was deathly afraid he was going to take my kid from me even though the court was not allowing it because of his abusive past and now I can see he never wanted our child he just wanted to control and scare me.

I'm not saying I was horrible this whole time but definitely had my moments. I still packed his lunch religiously for work, made his birthday special, did little things for him, and we had a lot of fun together. I was slowly letting myself 100% fall into this man.

After dating for a year my husband and I moved in together. I would say this is when things took a turn. I was still hot and cold on and off but had improved a lot. I could be moody some days and distant. Instead of leaning on him I would just get quiet. I am bipolar but I was medicated throughout I just still struggled with some days being fine and other days I just wanted to be alone. I was also in nursing school. 

We decided to get married a few months after moving in with each other. He eventually went on to adopt my child. The ex I told you about in the beginning wanted to sign his rights away and me and my current husband thought it was the best option to keep my child safe. He seemed like he wanted to but backed out a lot then wanted to and went through with it. Now that he has done it he's just sometimes a present dad other times he's not. Our child has noticed how he acts and it's really been a mess. It's been so hard to watch someone go from love us so deeply to tossing us away like garbage a lot. Or distancing from us and just not seeming happy with us. 

 I swear the day we got married is the day I watched him change. Now this is where I need help. My husband says that I made him this way. I watched him change right after he got married. It first started as getting angry and punching a wall. Then it turned into banging his head off walls, punching walls, throwing things, etc. and he told me it's because of how I treated him in the beginning I made him this way. Last year in April he left me and I took it to heart that I made him that way. I worked overtime on myself I finally felt completely healed. I put so much work in.

During our relationship I would threaten to leave to try to protect myself but I never left. I just got scared and wanted to. I explained to him why I did it, I was a runner and it wasn't him it was me fighting my trauma. But When he left and I saw reality of life without him I felt awful. He told all of his family basically how horrible I was in the beginning to him so of course everyone started hating me, rightfully so. 

I didn't give up though I fought for him. I would ask to see him, apologize so much, I worked hard on myself, and slowly he started coming back around. Things seemed to improve on my side on how I was treating him but on his side it got worse.

Our home became a battle ground and he became so violent blaming me for all of it. I became the soft girl he always wanted and finally opened up showing my feelings and getting close probably about a year in then everything went to hell. Not saying before that year I was horrible the whole time I wasn't. I was affectionate and loving but also struggled with distance/being cold. But now If I wanted to talk to him about anything he'd always say he can't handle it right now and if I tried again he would throw something or hit himself and tell me to leave him the f alone. He would drive crazy with me in the car, brake hard to stop the car and make me drive after driving crazy, he's punched things, smashed windshields multiple times. Then it got worse. He started pushing me, spitting in my face, calling me a btch. He'd deny me for sx a lot and tell me it was my fault because I made him nervous and anxious. I had struggled with insecurities and afraid of being cheated on so he said that made him anxious to have sx with me. I did later find out he was watching prn instead of having sx with me and that tore my heart to pieces. I will admit I thought he was cheating a few times. Everything has been blamed on me. He will say sorry then say well how long do I have to apologize. He breaks my things, pushes me, yells in my face, says sorry then expects me to not be traumatized 

He left me in December 2024 and I didn't beg for him back, he just came back. Told me we needed therapy and all that. So I enrolled in therapy in January and he never did. I ended up loving therapy even though I honestly didn't want to do it in the beginning. I begged him to do therapy too and see a doctor because he kept telling me he's bipolar. He got medicine but eventually quit taking it. I'm not sure if it's true he's bipolar because I've never heard that he's bipolar anymore since he went away for work for a month and came home.

Him going away for a month for work was a turning point for me. I realized our home was so relaxing and positive when he left. My confidence came back I felt at peace, no egg shells or nervousness. 

I guess I'll stop there because that gives an idea what's going on. My breaking point was him smashing my windshield and driving crazy and running on and off the road with me in the car a week ago, so I left. 

 I just want to know if I made him this way? I am beating myself up so bad because now I am convinced I did and that I'm a horrible person. I tried so hard and fought so hard to heal and be better because I didn't want to lose him. Now I feel like it's my fault he turned into this person. As dumb as it sounds, I was scared to leave because I'm scared he will treat the next girl better than me and I'll really be the awful person he says I am even though I have put in SO much work to change. I wanted to be better for him.

So Trump, aka the orange volatility generator, decided to go full meme-lord during a rally and casually suggested that the U.S. should maybe default on its debt‚Ä¶ ‚Äúas a negotiation tactic.‚Äù

Yes. This man just tried to use America‚Äôs credit rating like a used Pok√©mon card.

Naturally, the market heard ‚Äúdefault‚Äù and immediately performed a 720-degree backflip off a cliff. Stocks dumped harder than my altbag after I said ‚Äúthis project has real utility.‚Äù The Dow? RIP. The S&P? Sippin‚Äô from the same red cup as Terra Luna. Nasdaq? It saw the light and screamed.

Bitcoin: Shot up because ‚Äúfiat bad,‚Äù then remembered macro is still a thing.

ETH: Followed like a loyal sidekick, tripped on gas fees, faceplanted.

Solana: Froze for 7 minutes out of pure anxiety.

DOGE: Barked, peed a little, rallied 8%. Elon liked a tweet. Typical.

My Ledger wallet: Started sweating.

The other half are posting screenshots of -84% drawdowns with the caption: ‚ÄúJust DCA bro.‚Äù


Powell probably passed out. Yellen‚Äôs definitely stress-eating coins. Gold pumped. Even silver got a text saying ‚Äúyou up?‚Äù

I've been with my anchor partner Oak for three years, and a year and a half ago I started chatting with Ash online. Ash is married to Cedar,  who Oak has been friends with for 10 years, everyone was happy with the situation so we went on a couple of dates.

There was a lot of other stuff going on (I developed a neurological autoimmune disorder, Oak was dealing with burnout), and after a couple of dates I told Ash I needed a friend more than anything else at that time, we were still talking regularly but only meeting up as part of group outings (usually people's birthdays etc).

Life became more manageable recently, Ash and I have been on a couple of dates and we're really enjoying each other's company. It's early days, but it's really nice.

Last night all four of us went out with another friend Elm to dinner and a cabaret show, Ash knew I was anxious about how to interact with everyone so they checked in with everyone in our group chat (all far more poly experienced than I am) and everyone green flagged PDAs between any of the three pairings.

I got to kiss Ash hello and goodbye, hold hands with them each at various points in the evening (and at one point both of them), and kiss Oak a few times during the evening (Oak was next to me and Ash was on the other side of the table). 

My only previous poly experience was as a unicorn, so I was always ostracized on group outings, but this felt so safe and comfortable. Cedar and I have promised to meet up soon for coffee, Elm and I are planning to go for drinks, Oak and I will be together over the weekend and I'm seeing Ash next week. 

It feels like a silly thing to post, I hope it doesn't sound like I'm bragging but I know people always used to want more happy posts, it's hardly a big dramatic story, just a glimpse at (hopefully) everyday life really, but there you go. ",4,1744365176.0,polyamory,2,0.83,False

But then, the day before our next date, he said he wasn‚Äôt feeling well. On the day of, I suggested he shouldn‚Äôt push himself, and he agreed to reschedule, but didn‚Äôt give me a specific time. After that, his texts completely changed‚Äîgot super dry, and he hasn‚Äôt mentioned rescheduling at all.

He‚Äôs a really busy guy with multiple jobs, so I suggested we could play a quick game if he didn‚Äôt have time to meet up, but he said this week is just too hectic for him.

Eventually, I brought it up and told him that things were starting to feel a little noncommittal on his end, and that if he had a lot going on, I‚Äôd be happy to give him space. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that I wanted to end things completely! Just wanted clarity.

He replied saying I‚Äôm really sweet, that our dates were great, but that he‚Äôs sorry he‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for and wished me the best.

Now I‚Äôm just sitting here confused as hell with the sudden 180 change... :(

Yes there is a lot of commercial shit in life that creates fatness like maccas and various other things, you can be born with a genetic marker that makes you more likely to become fat so if you don‚Äôt know if you have it ask your doctor about your genetics, you can be born with diabetes, you can have something called depression that contributes to becoming fat or even skinny, the mind set needs to change you can be fat but try to become healthy not skinny not normal size just become healthy, so you can go up stairs, so you can play with your dog, I try the swap method and it worked for a long time until depression hit again and is still here‚Ä¶ the swap method is if you want to eat that slice of cake don‚Äôt have sugar in your coffee but if you want a coffee and cake choose the one with the least calories, swap the mindset of I can‚Äôt have that to I can have it but maybe one with less in or I want that now to I can have that but I have to make it myself so I know what‚Äôs in it I was at a good weight I believe then I tried vtubing to get rid of anxiety and things became fun because I wanted to do more with that mindset of I can do good, just do less bad hope this makes sense I just wanted to add a bit that I felt Asmongold needed to know and what I‚Äôve tried for others to know ",1,1744365010.0,Asmongold,1,1.0,False

Right now, I own an automatic espresso machine at home ‚Äî nothing too fancy. But I realize if I want to get serious about this, the first step is probably training my palate. So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd love your help:

# 1. What should I invest in first for home use?

* Do I need a proper grinder? Any budget-friendly recommendations?
* Should I start with a small sample roaster right away, or wait until I understand coffee better?
* What kind of setup do you recommend for a beginner who wants to¬†*taste*¬†better coffee and learn how to differentiate origins/profiles?

# 2. What should I read or study?

* Are there any must-read books or online courses for someone at my stage?
* Any YouTube channels, blogs, or podcasts that helped you early on?

# 3. Importing green coffee (EU-based)

* Long-term, I‚Äôd love to understand more about sourcing beans directly. Any advice or resources for learning how to import green coffee into Europe?

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Killing 650,000 children and 1,200,000 civilian personnel. This 'report' was in truth, a declaration of war by the Empire. We are now accepting any and all enlistment and volunteers for this mission, we will not accept any negotiations with the Empire, they will pay blood with blood.""

>‚Äî By Field Marshal Hector ""Wings"" Sanders

Field Marshal Hector ""Wings"" Sanders' ""blood for blood"" speech echoed across the Sol system. Millions enlisted, fueled by righteous fury over the St. Venus massacre. War was declared. The Cass'√âfaer Empire, smug in their technological superiority and distance, prepared for a conventional conflict across the Balleui Sector border.

They expected fleets. They expected marines. They expected perhaps even a desperate planet-cracker or two aimed at a military outpost.

They did not expect Dr. Agnes Pernell and the Department of Existential Engineering (DEE).

While Sanders handled the inspiring speeches and military posturing, the¬†*real*¬†response was delegated. Agnes, a woman whose glasses were thicker than most starship hulls and whose idea of a relaxing evening involved calculating hyperspace resonance failures, tapped her stylus on a holographic display showing the Cass'√âfaer cradle world, Cass'Efaeria Prime, and its inconveniently located parent star, a bloated red giant named X'lar.

""Right,"" she announced to her team of sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled engineers in the DEE's underground bunker complex (codename: 'The Sandbox'), ""Standard Orbital Relocation Protocol, sub-variant Gamma-Seven. Objective: hostile system core sterilization via targeted stellar insertion.""

""Gamma-Seven?"" piped up Jenkins, barely visible behind a mountain of discarded nutrient paste tubes. ""Isn't that the one requiring the quadruple-redundant chroniton tethers and the supplementary anti-gravity projectors powered by miniature black holes?""

""The very same,"" Agnes beamed. ""The Cass'√âfaer insulted our intelligence by attacking¬†*children*. We shall respond by demonstrating applied astrophysics so far beyond their comprehension they won't even have time to file a formal protest with the Galactic Council That Doesn't Actually Exist.""

""Budget?"" asked Priya, sketching furiously on a napkin that depicted what looked suspiciously like a giant cosmic billiard cue.

""Approved under 'Interstellar Infrastructure Adjustment Fund',"" Agnes said airily. ""Turns out, when grief meets government spending loopholes, anything is possible. Now, sync the gravity anchors. I want X'lar nudged precisely 1.7 astronomical units towards Cass'Efaeria Prime. Standard deviation tolerance: zero. And Jenkins, make sure the Stellar Trajectory Harmonizer AI is running the 'Polite Nudge' subroutine, we don't want to accidentally destabilize the¬†*wrong*¬†system's Oort cloud. Paperwork, you know.""

The Cass'√âfaer Empire's orbital defense platforms around Cass'Efaeria Prime first detected... anomalies. Slight gravitational lensing where none should be. Odd neutrino emissions from their star, X'lar.

""Report, Commander,"" droned the Cass'√âfaer Sector Overseer.

""Sensors indicate... minor stellar drift, Overseer. Likely sensor malfunction due to the ongoing solar flaring.""

A few hours later.

""Overseer! The drift... it's accelerating! X'lar is deviating significantly from its orbital path!""

""Impossible! Recalibrate! Check for human stealth ships attempting-""

""Overseer! Visual confirmation! X'lar... it's... it's¬†*filling the sky*! It's not drifting, it's¬†*moving*! Directly towards us!""

Panic erupted. The Cass'√âfaer, a race known for their meticulous planning and rigid hierarchy, simply had no protocol for 'Enemy Is Throwing Our Own Sun At Us'. Their mighty fleets, positioned light-years away anticipating border skirmishes, were useless. Their planetary shields were designed for bombardment, not immersion in a star.

Back in The Sandbox, Agnes peered at the telemetry feeds. ""Phase One: Stellar Relocation complete. Initiating Phase Two: Applied Thermokinetics.""

Jenkins hit a large, friendly-looking button labelled 'Solar Plunge'.

Across interstellar distances, sensors detected a star briefly¬†*wobbling*¬†as immense, unseen forces guided it, then plunging directly into its own planetary system's heart. Cass'Efaeria Prime, its moons, its orbital habitats, and the surrounding inner planets vanished in a cataclysmic fusion event that made a supernova look like a damp squib. The outer planets were flash-boiled and then blasted into radioactive dust.

The entire Cass'√âfaer Empire, centered around their cradle world, ceased to exist in the span of about six hours from the moment Jenkins pushed the button.

Field Marshal Sanders received the report via a secure channel.

""Sir,"" a crisp voice announced. ""Project ORAT concluded. Cass'√âfaer system sterilized. Hostile civilization effectively deleted. Total human casualties: zero. Ensign Thompson spilled his coffee during the final gravity anchor detachment sequence, requesting hazard pay.""

Sanders stared out at the star charts, the righteous fire in his eyes replaced by a look of bewildered awe. He'd asked for blood. The DEE had delivered thermonuclear annihilation via stellar billiards.

""Acknowledged,"" Sanders finally managed. ""Ensure... ensure Dr. Pernell files the environmental impact statement for unscheduled stellar fusion.""

In The Sandbox, Agnes was already putting the final her phase of the project project proposal: ""Weaponized Asteroid Calligraphy: Skywriting 'Don't Touch Our Children' Across Former Enemy Territory.""

I'm 23 yrs old, maybe due to my age my body is able to handle it for now but I don't think that'll be good in the long run (I don't feel like I will OD on the 2nd coffee but I can definitely feel my heart working faster) This habit started a few months ago: I was like damn that I just finished my coffee but f** it I will have another one and this is literally fixing my laziness or whatever it is I'm struggling with getting out the house. Oh but I wouldn't have a 2nd coffee if I had a joint for the 1st coffee, unfortunately it's illegal and quite expensive and I'm in a bad spot rn

Edit: here's the response from Chatgpt

That‚Äôs a really thoughtful concern, and you‚Äôre not wrong to consider the long-term effects.

Drinking two coffees in a row regularly isn‚Äôt inherently harmful, but here‚Äôs how it might affect you over time depending on your overall health, genetics, and habits:

Possible Long-Term Effects of Too Much Caffeine:

1. Increased stress/cortisol levels:
High caffeine intake can raise cortisol (stress hormone), which in theory could contribute to aging faster if chronically elevated‚Äîespecially when paired with poor sleep or stress.


2. Sleep disruption:
Even if you don‚Äôt feel it, caffeine can subtly reduce sleep quality, and poor sleep is a major factor in aging and overall health decline.


3. Skin health:
Caffeine can dehydrate you slightly (especially without enough water intake), and chronic dehydration may affect skin elasticity over time.


4. Heart health & blood pressure:
Some people are genetically more sensitive to caffeine and might experience higher blood pressure or irregular heartbeats long-term.


5. Dependence/tolerance:
You may build a tolerance, needing more caffeine over time for the same effect, and experience fatigue or headaches without it.



But on the flip side‚Ä¶

Moderate coffee intake (1‚Äì3 cups a day) has also been associated with benefits, like:

Reduced risk of some cancers, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson‚Äôs

Antioxidants that may help with aging and inflammation

Improved focus and mood


So it‚Äôs not about the coffee itself being harmful‚Äîit‚Äôs more about balance, timing, and listening to your body.

If you‚Äôre worried about aging faster, the bigger levers to pull are:

Sleep

Stress levels

Diet/nutrition

Hydration

Smoking/drinking habits

Sun exposure

1jwlp6v,https://i.redd.it/3jhfwl2bc6ue1.jpeg,‚ÄúDigital Death Defiers‚Äù | My thoughts on Hibiki Kuze vs Takumi Aiba!,"Let me just start off by saying that I am by no means an expert on Digimon powerscaling. If Aiba has metas higher than Hyper, I was ignorant of them in the creation of this.

Given the amount of hax these two have as well as their vastly different combat systems, it was hard for me to really equate the two for a comparison.

I ultimately made some decisions that you may not agree with. Such as equating Digimon‚Äôs status effects to Curse, since Curse affinity in Devil Survivor 2 correlates to ailment affinity, to my knowledge.

For this fight, I decided to not give Hibiki the Four Prime Factors or the Akashic Record, since he doesn‚Äôt keep control of either of them for very long. I feel that would be a bit unfair.

While you may expect this to be low diff, their equal speed tier and Aiba‚Äôs access to durability negation means he may actually be able to take out some of Hibiki‚Äôs demons, and possibly Hibiki himself with a direct hit, assuming his affinities don‚Äôt protect him.

There‚Äôs also the possibility that Aiba enters Hibiki‚Äôs phone, which would most certainly secure a victory, since we‚Äôve never seen the Demon Summoning App defend itself from internal threats.

However, I find it more likely that Hibiki would land the first killing blow. Not only is he immensely stronger, but he and his demon allies all have access to AoE attacks, with Megidolaon and Hassohappa being very notable. While Aiba also has AoE attacks, the ones he has access to do not possess durability negating properties or the necessary AP to be of much use.

Furthermore, Hibiki‚Äôs access to certain Auto skills, like Grimoire+ or the Ban skills, would help hinder Aiba‚Äôs Digimon immensely, by removing their ability to use certain skills or inflicting very dangerous status effects like Stone, Charm, or Forget more reliably. Shout out to Death Call as well, as any Digimon caught by a status could be killed instantly.

Ultimately, I believe that Hibiki wins this battle more often than not, but that‚Äôs not to say Aiba‚Äôs hax can‚Äôt help him stay in the fight for at least a time. Or, if there are higher Digimon metas I don‚Äôt know about, this fight could be a lot closer.

Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.
‚ÄúMother fluffer!‚Äù I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It‚Äôs 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It‚Äôs the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it‚Äôs shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!
‚ÄúJosie Banks, room number 5, I don‚Äôt hear any movement in there!‚Äù Jenna‚Äôs sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle.

‚ÄúI am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year‚Äôs stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,‚Äù she grins.
‚ÄúWe are not cattle,‚Äù I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.

Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel‚Ä¶‚Äù I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She‚Äôs just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.
‚ÄúHow did you get this?‚Äù I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.
‚ÄúAs the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,‚Äù Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. ‚ÄúIt was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,‚Äù she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.
‚ÄúYou had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,‚Äù I shout as I shove her away from my door. There‚Äôs a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.
‚ÄúSomeone call an ambulance!‚Äù I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.
How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?‚Ä¶ no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.
‚ÄúIs she breathing?‚Äù I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.
‚ÄúMiss Banks wake up!‚Äù a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.
‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.
‚Äú I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,‚Äù she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.
‚ÄúI'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and‚Ä¶‚Äù I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.
‚ÄúSave it for the interview honey,‚Äù she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass‚Ä¶ perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2
For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I‚Äôd drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.
‚ÄúSorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,‚Äù he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.
‚ÄúIs this her?‚Äù he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.
‚ÄúYes, Sir,‚Äù the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.
‚ÄúAre you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?‚Äù he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.
‚ÄúChallenge you?‚Äù I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.
‚ÄúI suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,‚Äù he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take her from here,‚Äù the stuck-up detective tells the officer.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I manage to rasp out. ‚ÄúPlease, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!‚Ä¶ Don't I get a solicitor?‚Ä¶ A phone call?‚Äù I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. ‚ÄúPlease sir, it was an accident,‚Äù I sob.
‚ÄúNot so tough now are we?‚Äù he smirks at me. ‚ÄúLet's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,‚Äù he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. ‚ÄúYou have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,‚Äù he snaps.
‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.
‚ÄúThat's what I thought,‚Äù I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.
‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.
‚ÄúTell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?‚Äù He asks
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.
‚ÄúYour file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I‚Äôm going to have to hold your hand through our journey?‚Äù He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.
‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm sorry Mr Perfect, I‚Äôve had  a day so do excuse me if I‚Äôm a little upset!‚Äù I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment,  the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors  close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.
‚ÄúCollins,‚Äù he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. ‚ÄúIt's Mr Collins,‚Äù he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins‚Äô eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. ‚ÄúSleep,‚Äù he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3
‚ÄúWake up, Miss Banks,‚Äù a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.
‚ÄúWhat the he-ll!‚Äù I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.
‚ÄúWhat did you do to me? How did we get here?‚Äù I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.
‚ÄúI don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,‚Äù he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. ‚ÄúMy name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey‚Äôs Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?‚Äù he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.
‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ um,‚Äù I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. ‚ÄúSorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,‚Äù I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.
‚ÄúDue to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted‚Ä¶‚Äù he begins.
‚ÄúWait, gifted?‚Äù I interrupt, ‚ÄúI think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you'd let me finish Miss Banks‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúJosie,‚Äù I correct, not liking the way he uses ‚ÄòMiss Banks‚Äô in an inferior way.
‚ÄúMiss Banks,‚Äù he reiterates, ‚ÄúIf you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?‚Äù he says without a flicker of a smile.
‚ÄúOh, you are good,‚Äù I laugh. ‚ÄúI love this show! I used to watch it all the time,‚Äù I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. ‚ÄúWas it Freya that put you up to this?‚Äù I giggle.
‚ÄúMiss Banks!‚Äù the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. ‚ÄúWhat the he-ll are you doing?‚Äù he asks in an almost growl.
‚ÄúLooking for your mic?‚Äù I gulp.
‚ÄúI don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?‚Äù he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?
‚ÄúYou made me go to sleep,‚Äù I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. ‚ÄúWhat else can you make me do?‚Äù I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.
‚ÄúAnything,‚Äù he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4
‚ÄúI thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?‚Äù a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.
‚ÄúYes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,‚Äù Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.
‚ÄúAre you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,‚Äù Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.
‚ÄúPut her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,‚Äù he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I‚Äôm supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. ‚ÄúThat will be all,‚Äù he grunts.
‚ÄúOf course Deacon, Josie follow me please,‚Äù Clarrisa smiles tightly.
‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù I start.
‚ÄúThat will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,‚Äù Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.
We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a‚Ä¶ wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.
‚ÄúSorry, it's been a wild day,‚Äù I explain.
‚ÄúI can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,‚Äù she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend‚Ä¶ or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?
‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I blurt. ‚ÄúI need to go back‚Ä¶ my mum,‚Äù I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.
‚ÄúDon't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,‚Äù she smiles.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúWhat about my stuff? Can I go back for it?‚Äù I ask.
‚ÄúDeacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,‚Äù she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. ‚ÄúEach crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,‚Äù she motions to the red stone. ‚ÄúYou can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,‚Äù she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.
‚ÄúWhere are the other students?‚Äù I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.
‚ÄúThey are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,‚Äù she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.
‚ÄúCombat training,‚Äù Clarrisa comments, ‚Äúthey're our next squad of soldiers,‚Äù she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. ‚ÄúThis is your building,‚Äù she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. ‚ÄúThis one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,‚Äù she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.

Chapter 5
I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite. The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. There is a dressing table with a mirror and a walk-in wardrobe that's almost as big as my entire dorm room at Mount University. The large window is framed by bookshelves, stacked with books of every genre you could wish for, and there's a cosy window seat with cushions and a blanket. I almost squeal in excitement. There's a small countertop with tea and coffee-making facilities and a mini fridge. In the bathroom, there's not only a shower but a full-size bathtub. The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it. I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror and cringe. My hair is a mess, and I'm wearing a sleep shirt with shorts and my tatty Converse shoes that Officer Shelby had allowed me to put on before taking me to the station. I look completely out of place here. On the back of the bathroom door, I notice a bathrobe and there's a stack of towels and toiletries in the bathroom cupboard. It's not ideal but I could shower and change into the robe for the time being. I hope my belongings are brought to me soon because I'm going to be the laughingstock of the school if I have nothing but a bathrobe and sleepwear in my wardrobe. After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. Jumping into someone else‚Äôs crazy world sounds like a great distraction whilst I wait for someone to bring my things and introduce me to my new life. A book titled ‚ÄòGreys‚Äô catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading. I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis. I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training earlier. The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides. He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone. I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight. I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me. Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there. I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again. A knock at my door makes me jump once again. Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question. I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window.
‚ÄúWell hello there new girl,‚Äù he grins at me with the most perfect white teeth.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I respond awkwardly, gripping the front of my robe to make sure I'm not flashing anything I don't want him to see. I hear footsteps coming down the corridor and the blonde man rushes into my room and closes the door behind him, almost knocking me over in the process.
‚ÄúWhat the he-ll?‚Äù I demand, trying not to show any fear.
‚ÄúShh,‚Äù he says quietly, putting a finger to his mouth. I'm about to start shouting at him to get out when I hear voices on the other side of the door. When the voices seem to pass by the blonde chuckles. ‚ÄúSorry, I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the guys find out you're here, I‚Äôm Theo Henry, your new neighbour,‚Äù he explains and holds out a hand to shake. I bite nervously on my lower mouth debating if I should trust this guy. ‚ÄúI don't bite,‚Äù he assures, obviously noticing my hesitation. I look into his eyes and see kindness there. Something deep inside me tells me I can trust him, that he's going to be an important part of my new life here.
‚ÄúI'm Josie,‚Äù I finally say, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. His eyes flash blue and his eyes go wide as a jolt of fear flows through me right before everything goes black.

Chapter 6
My vision returns as fast as it left. Theo is on the floor at my feet sounding.
‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I demand, stepping back from Theo and clutching my hand.
‚ÄúThe spark,‚Äù Theo gro-ans out, and then he starts laughing.
‚ÄúWhat does‚Ä¶‚Äù I start, but I'm cut off by my door shattering into pieces. Making me shriek and jump back further. A very angry-looking man stands in my doorway, breathing heavily. He takes in the scene in front of him. Dark hair hangs over his eyes but it doesn't hide the fury peeking out behind the dark locks. His hand shoots out towards me and his fingers strain as if he is gripping something, then my oxygen is cut off. I scratch at my neck, trying to remove whatever is wrapped around it that's stopping me from breathing but there's nothing there.
‚ÄúMason stop, I'm fine,‚Äù Theo croaks out and pushes himself to his feet before knocking the dark-haired man's arm down. Precious air fills my lungs and I collapse to my knees in relief.
‚ÄúJosie, are you okay?‚Äù Theo asks, knee-ling in front of me.
‚ÄúGet‚Ä¶ out!‚Äù I rasp between deep breaths.
‚ÄúLet me get you checked over by a nurse,‚Äù Theo says softly, reaching out and touching my neck. His touch feels soothing but also hurts my tender skin. I smack his hand away.
‚ÄúYou heard the lady, get out Theo, and take that psycho with you!‚Äù a female voice calls. I look up to see a short, pixie-looking girl standing near my door, her hands are on her hips and she looks pissed.
‚ÄúHe didn't mean it, he thought she was hurting me,‚Äù Theo explains.
‚ÄúShe was hurting you!‚Äù Mason shouts.
‚ÄúNo, it was amazing. It was The Spark,‚Äù Theo exclaims excitedly. Pixie girl laughs in disbelief and Mason looks like someone just kil-led his kitten. His eyes land on me again and I swear I see murder there.
‚ÄúSure thing lover boy, everyone knows that's a myth. Go take your boyfriend and daydream elsewhere,‚Äù she dismisses. ‚ÄúAnd fix this door!‚Äù she adds coming to stand by my side.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs The Spark?‚Äù I croak out.
‚ÄúForget about that for now, we are starting you with the basics, not myths,‚Äù she smiles, holding out her hand for me. I take it and let her pull me to my feet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Dorothy, but everyone calls me Dot. Mr Collins asked me to be your guide, tutor and bestie,‚Äù she announces with a salute. ‚ÄúOkay, you caught me, I lied about the besties part but we are going to be besties, I just feel it,‚Äù she almost squeals. I'm a little taken aback by her chirpy attitude and how fast she speaks, especially after just being attacked by the Damon Salvatore wannabe. I look over to my door and Theo and his murderous friend are nowhere to be seen, my door is also restored to its former glory, you'd never guess it had been shattered into a million pieces just moments before.
‚ÄúMy door,‚Äù I gasp.
‚ÄúMason fixed it, he's a grumpy, possessive guy but he's also fiercely protective and he's great to have around when things get broken, granted it's usually him breaking them, but nobody is perfect,‚Äù she says with a shrug.
‚ÄúIf I ask you something, will you be honest with me because I'm about ready to lose it,‚Äù I ask as I begin pacing my room.
‚ÄúShoo-t,‚Äù she chirps, flopping back onto my bed and examining her bright pink nails.
‚ÄúIs this a mental hospital? Because my mum has psychosis so maybe it's hereditary. After everything that's happened today I'm starting to think I've actually gone insane and all this is a hallucination and I'm a patient here, not a student,‚Äù I blurt out.
‚ÄúNah, it's a school for Greys. Unless I'm hallucinating too‚Ä¶ What if everyone here is having the same hallucination and we all think we are at school but really it's a hospital? And Mr Collins is our hot doctor trying to make us all sane again. That would be hilarious,‚Äù she says laughing hysterically. I stare at her wide-eyed until she composes herself.
‚ÄúIs that possible?‚Äù I ask. Almost afraid of what her answer will be.
‚ÄúNah. But I do like the idea of Mr Collins being a doctor, I'm going to call him that from now on. Now get dressed, or we will miss dinner, and you don't want to see what happens when I miss dinner,‚Äù she smiles sweetly.
‚ÄúI don't have any clothes,‚Äù I say with a grimace. Dot gives me a knowing smile and snaps her fingers.
‚ÄúTah-dah,‚Äù she grins, and motions to my wardrobe. With a frown, I open the doors and look in awe at the now fully stocked rails.
‚ÄúHow did you do this?‚Äù I ask in astonishment.
‚ÄúFine, you caught me in a lie again. It wasn't me. Mr Collins told me he had stocked your wardrobe. Girl, you must have made a good impression on him. I've never seen him be so kind,‚Äù she says coming to stand beside me and bumping her hi-p against mine.
‚ÄúKind?‚Äù I snort. ‚ÄúHe was anything but kind,‚Äù he must have brought this in whilst I was showering. Thank god I didn't walk out without the robe whilst he was here.
‚ÄúMmmhmm,‚Äù she mocks and pushes past me. She grabs a pair of very short black shorts, a black vest top and a red oversized hoody with Greys Academy embellished on the front. Then she opens a drawer and picks out some underwear before throwing it all at me. ‚ÄúGet dressed, let's go‚Äù she makes a shooing motion at me.
I take the clothes into the bathroom and dress quickly. Everything fits perfectly and I wonder how Mr Collins knew my size, especially my underwear. I push the thought of him choosing underwear for me from my mind, not wanting that embarrassment to add to the shitstorm of a day. When I leave the bathroom Dot is holding out a brand-new pair of crisp white Converse, I shove my feet into them and follow Dot out the door, ready to explore my new world.

Chapter 7
We head out of our building and across the courtyard to a more modern brick building where students seem to be filtering from all directions. People stare at me and I see them turning to whisper to each other.
‚ÄúHey beautiful,‚Äù a deep voice says from behind us and I turn just in time to see Dot swept off of her feet by a tall man with a mess of shoulder-length blonde hair. Before she has a chance to respond, another male approaches. This one is shorter and has a military-style shaved head. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her from the blond man and planting a kiss on her lips. I stare open-mouthed at the scene in front of me, waiting for a fight to start or for Dot to protest, but it doesn't happen.
‚ÄúPut me down,‚Äù Dot giggles and squirms in the man's arms until he releases her. She straightens her clothes and looks back at me. ‚ÄúJosie, this is Marcus,‚Äù she points to the blonde, ‚Äúand this is Cole,‚Äù she pats the arm of the second man.
‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù I smile awkwardly at Marcus before turning my attention to do the same to Cole.
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Joe and Max?‚Äù Dot asks the men who are now walking beside us.
‚ÄúThey came early to get us a table at the front,‚Äù Cole answers.
‚ÄúOh goody,‚Äù Dot claps her hands together in delight. ‚ÄúTables at the front are first in line for seconds, ‚Äú she leans closer and whispers to me as we go into a large dining hall. I feel the eyes of all the students all lock onto me and my steps falter at the gravity of the situation I'm in. I feel like a fish that's been dumped into the shark tank as I recount the words in the book I‚Äôd read. These are all Greys, superhumans with powers that could do whatever they like to me and I'd be helpless to stop them. How am I going to survive here?
‚ÄúDon't worry, they're just curious. It's not often we get new students, especially at our age. Most people here have grown up together,‚Äù Dot reassures, linking her arm in mine and guiding me to a large table. The room is not as impressive as I'd imagined. I was expecting Hogwarts and instead, this is a standard college dining hall.
‚ÄúSo this is your new pet?‚Äù a handsome black man with shocking blue eyes asks as he stands from the table and pulls Dot into his arms before kissing the top of her head.
‚ÄúYes, this is Josie. Josie, this is Joe,‚Äù Dot introduces. Joe flashes me a 1000-megawatt smile and holds out his hand to shake. I hesitate, remembering what had happened with Theo.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I do a small awkward wave instead and quickly avert my gaze.
‚ÄúBabe, I got you a milkshake,‚Äù a cheeky-looking dark-haired man interrupts, handing Dot a bottle of strawberry milkshake.
‚ÄúYou know how to treat a girl,‚Äù Dot gushes, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek, before turning back to me, ‚Äúthis is Maximus,‚Äù she grins at me.
‚ÄúMax,‚Äù he corrects with an eye roll followed by a wink.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Josie,‚Äù I smile.
‚ÄúAnd what did you get me, Max?‚Äù Cole asks, elbowing Max in the ribs playfully. All four men begin teasing each other and making jokes.
‚ÄúSorry, they can be a bit much, but I love them,‚Äù Dot says wistfully as she watches the men scuffle. ‚ÄúLet's get some food,‚Äù she adds, leading me towards a large food counter. She hands me a tray and a plate and takes one for herself before she starts loading food onto it. The food is laid out under hot counters in a self-serve-style buffet. I take a slice of cheese pizza and some fries as we move along the counter.
‚ÄúSo which one are you dating?‚Äù I ask, glancing over to the four men who are now seated at the table.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I gasp. ‚ÄúHow did you pull that off?‚Äù I add with a giggle. I take an apple and a bottle of juice and follow Dot back to the table.
‚ÄúIt is how we do things here, take a good look around you,‚Äù she laughs. I take a seat beside her and the men get up to get their food. Looking around at the other students I notice distinct groups of one female with up to five men at each table.
‚ÄúOur population is small and females are rare, so mate bonds are formed. It is usually four men to every woman, but sometimes it's three or five men,‚Äù she explains.
‚ÄúAnd the men don't get jealous or fight?‚Äù I ask, finding all this hard to believe.
‚ÄúSometimes at first, but they work it out. Our bonds are not ours to choose. There are a couple of our kind that have the gift of sight, they can detect soulmates and match them together. When a female turns 18 the soul-seer guides her to her bonds,‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd does anyone get a choice in all this?‚Äù I struggle to keep the distaste from my voice. This feels dirty and like exploitation.
‚ÄúOf course they do, some resist the bonds, but they almost always give in eventually. It's not easy to ignore your soulmate,‚Äù she shrugs. I scan the room again.

1jwl9l7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwl9l7,"Ok dose the Manga Artist Ships Visha and Tanya ? (And a Short Visha Analysis, and why Tanaya cares so much about Visha)","**In my short analysis of manga Tanya, I focused on how emotionally expressive she is and how deeply she cares for her subordinates‚Äîalmost like they're her own children.**  
But one question I forgot to ask is: *Why is Visha such a simp for Tanya?*

Is it simply fan service for those who ship Tanya x Visha? Is the manga artist themselves a Tanya x Visha shipper (given how much fan art they've drawn of the two)? Or have I just spent too much time in the *Madoka Magica* franchise and now see yuri everywhere? (Honestly, I even started wondering if Nami from *One Piece* might be bi or a lesbian.)

**Jokes aside**, Visha‚Äôs portrayal in the manga is almost a complete 180 from her character in the original novels. Novel-Visha, if not bound by duty, would likely avoid Tanya. She sees her as a devil‚Äîbrilliant but mentally unstable. While she respects Tanya‚Äôs skills and intellect, she‚Äôs also afraid of her.

Manga-Visha, on the other hand, is the exact opposite. She *wants* to be by Tanya‚Äôs side. In her eyes, Tanya represents the key to the Empire‚Äôs victory and is a kind, compassionate figure who hates war, wants to end it, and loves her men.

Visha is willing to give her life for Tanya‚Äî*again and again*‚Äîbecause of what Tanya represents to her: a symbol of hope, honor, and strength. And she knows that Tanya would do the same for her. Tanya sees Visha as the most important person in her life‚Äînot just a subordinate, but a true friend who has seen both her best and worst sides (from crying over her inability to stop the war to bombing an entire city).

Visha is always there‚Äîmaking her coffee, waking her up, fighting beside her‚Äîand Tanya feels safe around her. In one of the recent manga chapters, Tanya even (accidentally) gives her an indirect kiss. She protects Visha not just from enemies but even from their own comrades, fearing they might Rape her.

Tanya deeply cares for her. In both the books and the manga, there are moments where she wonders if she found Visha sexually attractive‚Äîlike if she wore a swimsuit. And in in ether her Dreams or Vision by Being X she sees herself (Her old Self) always being Married to Visha. 

Even Tanya‚Äôs men joke that Tanya and Visha talk and act like a married couple.

**Now, will they become canon?** Probably not. The original author likely opposes a Tanya x Visha romance due to the age gap, (This being 7 Years apart, i have no Idea how old Tanya or Visha are) 

Which is understandable and, honestly, a HUGE W of the Autor considering how many Animes didnt care about that

Personally, while I find their interactions extremely cute, I wouldn't want Visha and Tanya's relationship to become romantic. Tanya simply isn't old enough for that, and Visha‚Äôs overly affectionate behavior‚Äîwhile sometimes endearing‚Äîcan come across as a bit... unsettling.

Like Girl, let her grow up before asking her out to dinner!

But if they *were* the same age physically (and not just mentally, since Tanya *is* the older one in terms of experience), I‚Äôd genuinely love to see how their relationship might evolve.",20,1744361582.0,YoujoSenki,1,1.0,False

The amount of experience needed for a single level increases roughly linearly until level 50 and then it explodes making it much more resource intensive.

The reason for this is to slow down the progress for the later levels so that veteran players do not reach max level plateau too quickly. 

My question is: Given that level 65 has been announced, do you think they might flatten the curve from levels 50-55?

In many games they smooth out the used-to-be end-game after new content is released.

Also, taking into account that this active event is one of maybe the most important event of the year, I expect the level cap to be raised in the next couple of months.

I have a couple of Pok√©mon that are about to break into that range level and I would rather save the candy and wait for the curve the flatten a bit. Most notably my Vikavolt with -exp nature whose coffee at level 60 I direly need.

Any thoughts? :)



P.S. The amount of exp needed to reach level 60 starting at level 1 is:
-51,493 for basic Pok√©mon (everything besides the categories listed below)

-77,213 for pseudo legendaries (Dragonite and Tyranitar line)

-92,645 for legendaries (Entei, Raikou, Suicune & Cress)

-113,220 for Darkr

That means that you could level up (almost any) two 
Pok√©mon of your choosing from level 1 to 60 and you would still need around 10k (or 100 nights of perfect sleep or 400 Darkr candy) for it to reach level 60! ü´†

Source: https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/xp/table

P.S.S

Yes, no Pok√©mon will show up at level 1 and legendaries appear at around the level 25 mark.

I've been lurking on this community for quite some time now and feel like I'm ready for some feedback. <3  
I'm going on my first bigger trip |West Highland Way| in beginning of May.   
3 reasons for me personal to go more light: 

*  back problems
*  less weight so more capacity to bring a few small luxury items like a camera or hot sauce without carrying 15+ kg on my poor back
* more comfortable weight to walk with

  
Lighterpack: [https://lighterpack.com/r/hlxwvh](https://lighterpack.com/r/hlxwvh)

  
Few things to note: 

* My backpack: *Osprey Tempest 40L* (with side pockets 50L) is quite heavy but I believe this is a good test to see how the capacity works with all my gear before downsizing. I have some lower back problems so nice for me to *test the back plate & load lifters*. After the trip I can re-evaluate for a lighter backpack 
* Tent: Not bringing tent as we're sharing | otherwise *Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2 1374g*
* I'm not planning to have a different sleeping pad for other seasons (not planning on winter hiking any time soon) and since I'm generally quite cold I went for the *7.3 R-value* 
* Base weight would be quite a bit less without the *camera: 815g + 75g* rolls but I feel like this is a luxury to take analog pics from this trip
* Small luxury items like hot sauce, msg and coffee are pretty non-negotiable because food **NOM**

I did my best to weigh everything (small bits & bops missing) and apply feedback that I've been reading on the community. shoutout to u/mlite_ for the thread on backpack capacity, saved that one for after the trip <3  


*Go easy on me, first timer here*

the biggest problem though with me booting up a new world is that I cant  simply take over the blueprints i've agonized over and use them straight off the bat.

say I have a neat little set up smelter module for an ore node that was built using mk.4-5 belts, in a world where that's in production abundance, if you wanted to take that blueprint to a new world it's going to be a while till you can have that up and running.

what if coffee stain were to impliment a Blueprint Designer focused buildable conveyor that functions as a self upgrading conveyor/lift when placed, with special functions in and out of the BD



> simply by having a ""Conveyer mk-?"" icon which, when placed within a blueprint designer, funtions like a regular belt/lift, just with no mk. level associated, essentially a dummy object. (also could potentially be a conveyor belt that is not running when placed in the BD so you dont get flung around when fine tuning a blueprint)


> when you build this item outside a Blueprint Designer it will build the conveyor/lift in the highest mk. you can currently afford for the length.
essentially just leaving you free to have it on your toolbars for the duration of your saves (im aware pressing E does the same function, but this would still be nice to help not accidentally switching to an old toolbar and using mk.2 belts when building and not noticing till too late)

> and finally a Blueprint that features the decoy block will either build at max MK. level that you can afford, or can be set to a chosen MK. in the blueprint menu. so you could build nerfed versions of your factory modules early and then dismantle and rebuild later when you have the appropriate materials (provided you could already build your assemblers, refineries and what not)


I know it's just a long shot, but hopefully im not the only one who thinks something like this should be added to the game and free up blueprints to be a little more flexible.",1,1744361096.0,SatisfactoryGame,2,0.6,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

For a thousand words, I embarked on a reflective exploration, utilizing the initial letters of key words to weave a tapestry of emotions, experiences, and revelations. Each line unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired‚Äîa subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Clich√©**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred‚Äîthe resurgence of clich√©s. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clich√©s, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clich√©s that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of clich√©, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clich√©d landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clich√©s transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clich√©d fabric of their reality.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread‚Äîa mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged‚Äîa message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I'm a 30-something French woman from bigger cities who recently decided to settle in Leuven‚Äîcompletely charmed by how cozy and lively it is!

I'm currently scouting places to hang out when friends come visit, but one thing I can't figure out through Google Maps is the average age of the crowd. Since Leuven is a student town, I know I won‚Äôt exactly be the young one out at night üòÑ ‚Äî but I also wouldn‚Äôt want to crash spaces meant to be more youth-focused or make things feel awkward.

For example: would it be weird for us (early 30s) to go to an event at *Stelplaats* or *JH Sojo*? The vibes look super nice and a bit alternative, which I love, but I‚Äôm not really familiar with the ‚Äúroomte voor jongeren‚Äù concept.

Also, is *Oude Markt* totally dead on Fridays/Saturdays when students are away?

I was thinking of something like:

* **Friday:** start the night at *De Werf*, then go bar-hopping around *Oude Markt*
* **Saturday:** maybe a concert at *Stelplaats*, then head to *The Optimist* for a drink

1jwkxay,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jwkxay/what_tea_removes_toxins_from_the_body/,What tea removes toxins from the body?,"I‚Äôve been trying to clean up my routine lately‚Äîfewer processed foods, more sleep, and just a general reset after what felt like months of fatigue, sluggish digestion, and that annoying ‚Äúheavy‚Äù feeling I could never quite shake.

One thing I kept seeing over and over again on TikTok and in wellness circles was **Lulutox Detox Tea**. Supposedly, it helps with bloating, weight management, energy levels, and yes‚Äî**removing toxins from the body**. I wasn‚Äôt sold immediately, but I looked into it and decided to give it a solid 6-week trial.

This post is my experience. No hype, no sales pitch‚Äîjust what actually happened when I made **lulutox tea** part of my daily routine.

**Why I looked into detox teas in the first place**

So many things in our environment can build up in the body‚Äîpollution, additives in food, even everyday stress. I kept hearing about how certain herbs like **dandelion, milk thistle, and green tea** can support your liver and help your body detox more efficiently. When I googled **what tea removes toxins from the body**, **lulutox detox tea** was everywhere.

The idea of a natural tea blend that could support energy, digestion, and detox‚Äîwithout being harsh or acting like a laxative‚Äîsounded promising. So I checked out what was actually inside.

**Breaking down the Lulutox Tea ingredients**

This was one of the first things that stood out to me. The **lulutox tea ingredients** list is actually impressive. It‚Äôs not just one or two trendy herbs. It's 13 carefully chosen superfoods, including:

* **Matcha & Sencha Green Tea** ‚Äì known for their antioxidant and metabolism-boosting properties
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** ‚Äì for natural energy and mental clarity
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** ‚Äì historically used for liver support and detox
* **Oolong Tea & Lemongrass** ‚Äì soothing on the stomach, may support fat breakdown
* **Ginseng & Nettle Leaf** ‚Äì stress relief, anti-inflammatory, and immune boosting
* **Goji Berries & Stevia Leaf** ‚Äì antioxidants and natural sweetness

The blend is **vegan, soy-free, gluten-free**, and contains **a small amount of caffeine**‚Äîaround 18mg per bag, so it‚Äôs energizing but not jittery.

**What drinking it was actually like**

I had one cup a day, either hot in the morning or iced in the afternoon. It has a **mild peach flavor**, not too sweet or herbal, and it was surprisingly easy to stick with. No weird aftertaste. Just smooth, calming, and slightly refreshing.

**What changed over six weeks**

**1. Less bloating and heaviness**  
Within the first week, I noticed my usual bloating after meals was much less intense. By the second week, that constant ‚Äúfull‚Äù feeling I carried around in the evenings was basically gone. My digestion just felt *cleaner*.

**2. More consistent energy**  
Before Lulutox, I was relying on caffeine way too much. This tea helped me feel naturally alert‚Äîwithout that post-coffee crash or wired feeling. I ended up drinking less coffee without even trying.

**3. Small but steady weight loss**  
I didn‚Äôt change my diet drastically, but I ended up losing about 4‚Äì5 pounds over six weeks. I think a lot of it was inflammation and water weight dropping due to reduced bloating.

**4. Mental clarity**  
Hard to explain, but I felt sharper‚Äîless foggy. Maybe it was the combo of better sleep, hydration, and improved digestion, but I felt noticeably clearer during the day.

**Any Lulutox tea side effects?**

I was worried it would be harsh like other detox teas, but honestly‚Äîit was super gentle. No cramps, no bathroom emergencies, no headaches. If anything, I just felt like I needed to drink more water throughout the day (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing). For anyone wondering **is lulutox tea safe**, my personal experience says yes‚Äîbut always check with your doctor, especially if you‚Äôre on medication.

**Where to buy Lulutox Tea safely**

If you‚Äôre wondering **lulutox tea where to buy**, I‚Äôd strongly recommend going through their [**official site here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). There are a lot of fake listings on other platforms, and I didn‚Äôt want to take that risk.

They were running a 70% off promo when I ordered. It might still be available through this [**alternate link I bookmarked**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) if that helps.

**Final thoughts: Does Lulutox Detox Tea really remove toxins?**

I can‚Äôt claim to have lab-tested my body for ‚Äútoxins,‚Äù but I can say this: **I felt lighter, more energized, and less sluggish overall**. I didn‚Äôt need midday naps, my digestion improved, and my skin even looked a bit clearer.

If you‚Äôre looking for a **lulutox detox tea review** that isn‚Äôt exaggerated‚ÄîI‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a genuinely useful tea for anyone trying to reset their system in a gentle, natural way.

Curious if others here had similar results. Did it help with bloating or energy for you? Any **lulutox detox tea side effects** you experienced that were different from mine?",1,1744359989.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

[sumirematcha\_tv](https://www.youtube.com/@matcha_sumire/shorts)

A hojicha latte is a warm, comforting drink made from hojicha, a roasted green tea from Japan. Its nutty, smoky flavor pairs beautifully with milk, making it an ideal alternative to coffee or matcha. Here‚Äôs how you can make a delicious hojicha latte at home.

# Ingredients:

* 1 to 2 teaspoons of hojicha powder (or 1 hojicha tea bag)
* 1 cup of milk (dairy or plant-based, like oat or almond)
* 1/4 cup hot water (around 175¬∞F or 80¬∞C)
* Sweetener to taste (like honey, maple syrup, or sugar)

https://preview.redd.it/azodvgra16ue1.jpg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de1d1dc81d05a759f283c43e4ba94cbfa0b4151b

# Instructions:

**1. Heat the Water**  
Start by heating about 1/4 cup of water. It shouldn‚Äôt be boiling‚Äîhojicha is delicate and can become bitter if steeped in overly hot water. Ideal temperature is around 175¬∞F (80¬∞C). If you‚Äôre using a tea bag or loose hojicha leaves instead of powder, steep it in the hot water for about 2‚Äì3 minutes, then strain the tea. If using hojicha powder, continue to the next step.

**2. Mix the Hojicha**  
Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of hojicha powder into a small bowl or mug. Add the hot water and whisk it until smooth. A bamboo matcha whisk (chasen) works best, but a small regular whisk or milk frother will also do the job. The goal is to fully dissolve the powder and create a smooth base.

**3. Heat and Froth the Milk**  
In a small pot, gently heat your milk of choice until steaming but not boiling. You can also microwave it for about 1‚Äì2 minutes. Use a milk frother, handheld whisk, or even a jar with a lid to froth the milk if you want a caf√©-style finish.

**4. Combine and Sweeten**  
Pour the warm, frothed milk over the hojicha base. Stir gently to combine. Taste and add sweetener if desired. Hojicha has a naturally mellow, roasted taste that pairs wonderfully with a touch of sweetness.

**5. Serve and Enjoy**  
Your homemade hojicha latte is ready! Serve it in your favorite mug and enjoy it as a cozy morning drink or an afternoon pick-me-up.

# Optional Tips:

* For an iced version, chill the hojicha base and pour it over ice before adding cold frothed milk.
* Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or a few drops of vanilla for a flavor twist.

Jack Attack - Jack Herrer x Northern lights.

Quite a funky plastic bottle came chock full of all sized buds with the first ever 55% integra I have seen, all previous integras and bovedas have been at 62%.

Little to no obvious smell upon opening, but now it's had a hot minute to breathe it has menthol and mint if you stick your nose right in there with it.    I think this will come alive after some time by itself in a glass jar?

I held of my morning vapes to try this as soon as it came today.

Ground some up easily and vaped some at 175 in my Mighty(my taste testing temp) and whoa nelly.   It vaped up quite nicely and fast.   I turned off the mighty after about 3 draws as it was hitting me already.   I thought this was a daytime strain but I'm glad I had a couple of hours before my friends came over.  First thing I noticed was a big grin on my face, reminiscent of any northern lights I have had.   But I quickly recovered and realised I was ok to socialise with a grin on my face.  Luckily I checked the mirror as my eyes were a little red haha.

You get 20 grams of this for 100 bucks!

Chemovar - Choc Cheddar

I tried this one just now after the Jack attack earlier in the day.  My first chemovar product after hearing good things for the last couple of years haha.

Name checks out.    Upon opening, you could tell it needed to breathe, but definitely had a choc coffee smell, I would call a mocha.

The cheese came later and omg did it come!    The cheddar flavour upon exhale chalked up my cheeks!  I felt like a cheap hooker on a saturday night!      I would NOT recommend driving the day after these buds!

All in all it was a nice smooth vape but not overwhelming affects.    I was primarily looking at it for sleepytime buds but it hasn't knocked my socks off yet!
