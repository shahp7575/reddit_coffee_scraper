I recently got a Breville Barista Express for Christmas and I need some help creating a baseline for how a correct expresso should taste like. Assume that I know nothing about making expresso (which is basically true). 

I've tried making a few different shots and the expresso is either too bitter or too sour tasting. I hope what I'm making isn't how expresso generally taste...or else I probably won't be using the machine much. I hope someone can...

1. recommend a brand of coffee (ideally purchasable through Amazon or somewhere else that's easily accessible),  

2. how should set the grind size on the machine (a number for the dial would be great)

3. the amount of coffee (either in weight or the notches that are on the machine)

4. anything else that you think I should know for getting the perfect expresso for the brand that you recommended

The main thing I want to take away from this is that I simply don't know what a good shot of expresso tastes like, so I hope to create an experiment where I at least have a baseline or ""control group"" to compare to. I understand that a lot of this is personal preference, but since I basically have know idea what an good expresso is suppose to taste like, I thought this might be a good way to get started.

I’m 24 and a married mum of 2 who just moved to Sydney from Melbourne. A little about me, I’m your standard 4’10 woman who wishes she was taller🥲, I love coffee and was a barista for 4 years whilst in uni. I’m a qualified nurse but currently don’t work as we’ve decided for me to stay home and look after the kids for now. Silly facts about me is I love Italian food, I used to play a lot of soccer until I was 16 and broke my arm and that I really only learnt to swim last year but have been loving it. I was hoping to find a long term friend on here as I like sometimes find there’s things I don’t bring up with people I know in person even my closest friends because I don’t think it’s kind of socially accepted yet. One of the things is quite nsfw I guess it’s that I used to be a hotwife before kids and got out of that scene once I had my kids who are now my world. I’m not looking to get back into the scene just looking for people who I can share my experiences with and just chat about everything!

If that isn’t your cup of tea and you’d like to talk about other things and maybe even a bit deeper of a conversation. My background is Filipino but I can’t speak Tagalog even though my parents speak it. I’ve been to the Philippines before as we have family there but I just speak broken English with them sadly. I’m an only child and have felt that I don’t belong to either race or group before and definitely felt very isolated because of it. Not sure if there’s others who can relate and would like to chat about it!

Hope to meet some of you and make some great long term friends!",3,1735291679.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

1hnb91j,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesTrips/comments/1hnb91j/how_much_money_do_you_need_to_visit_la_for_a_week/,How much money do you need to visit LA for a week?,"Hey everyone! I recently spent a week exploring Los Angeles, and I wanted to share my experience and break down the costs for those planning their own LA adventure. I know budget planning can be tricky, so I'll give you the real scoop.

Let's start with accommodation. Hotels in LA can range from $150-$400 per night depending on the area and luxury level. I stayed in a mid-range hotel in Hollywood for about $200/night ($1,400 for the week). If you're on a tighter budget, there are hostels for around $50/night or Airbnbs starting at $100/night.

Food costs really depend on your style. I spent roughly:
- Breakfast: $15-20 (coffee + quick bite)
- Lunch: $20-25 (casual restaurants)
- Dinner: $40-60 (mix of casual and nice spots)
That's about $80/day or $560 for the week. You could definitely spend less by grocery shopping or more if you're hitting up trendy spots.

Transportation is another significant cost. While rental cars run about $50-70/day plus parking ($20-30/day), I actually found a better solution. I booked this awesome full-day LA tour (https://athometouch.com/LA) for $99, which covered all the major spots like Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, and Venice Beach. It was honestly the best decision - saved money on car rental and parking, plus the guide knew all the local secrets and best photo spots. They even picked me up from my hotel!

Other expenses to consider:
- Attractions: $150-200 (Universal Studios, museums, etc.)
- Shopping: $200-300 (totally optional but come on, it's LA!)
- Entertainment: $200-300 (shows, clubs, etc.)

Basic breakdown for one person:
- Hotel: $1,400
- Food: $560
- LA Tour: $99
- Attractions: $200
- Shopping/Entertainment: $500
- Misc (Uber/Lyft): $200

Total: Around $3,000 for a comfortable week in LA. You could do it for less (maybe $2,000) by choosing budget accommodation and eating cheaper, or easily spend more if you want luxury.

Pro tip: That full-day tour I mentioned earlier really helps optimize your time and money. Instead of spending on rental cars and trying to figure out parking in Beverly Hills (nightmare!), you get to see everything in one day with an expert guide. Plus, they take you to spots you'd probably miss on your own. I learned more about LA history in that one tour than I did the rest of the week!

The city can be expensive, but with some planning, it's totally doable. Just make sure to book activities in advance - especially that LA tour, it tends to fill up quick during peak season!

I managed to brew an acceptable cup using boiling water instead of waiting 10-20 seconds (stovetop kettle), but I think it's waste of good coffee beans to brew an OK cup.

I want to know if more people are having the same shifty life as me because of the constant guilt for not playing with my boy as much as he requests it?

I mean he is extremely attached to me, I can not even take a shit without him crying at the door, constantly knocking so I can finish faster and get out to play with him. 

I'm already more than exhausted, and just dropped the depression pills I started to take since the parenting hit me. I got in a deep depression as I realized that I do not matter anymore, I could easily be dead for what I am concerned or my dreams are concerned, I am here just to be a slave for my kids. I accepted that, that's not the reason I am writing. 

But this constant demand of playing, he does not play alone ever. We bought the most expensive toys, he has everything he wishes, more than I could even imagine when I was a kid, but he just ignores everything, he wants me and me only, he doesn't want my wife or anybody, he wants to sleep with me, eat with me, go with me everywhere, play with me, bath with me. This morning I woke up at 7 AM and was very happy cause I could have some time for myself, I made myself a coffee, the minute I sat down at my computer to read the news he started crying cause he did not feel me in the bed and I needed to stay with him there, otherwise we would have a tantrum.

I was the one taking care of him when he was little as my wife is a fucking aggressive bitch, so I was the one making him food, washing him when he pooped, play with him, while also being in business meetings with senior stakeholders around the word as I am a corporate manager. I literally washing shit while I was in meetings. I also got fired when he was like 2 years old cause I could not handle everything, I had to take him out as in the house my wife was crazy, I skipped meetings, I had a short temper with my business partners, etc. I am taking my anger to work, my wife it's taking her crazy ass on her family but is an angel at work. I am trying to learn to love her again, but she is just despicable, always angry always unsatisfied, always disgusted.

And me, I constant feel the guilt that I am a bad parent, that my son will grow up with the feeling that I do not love him since I am always so depressed while trying to play with him constantly. I end up just laying there on the floor in his room looking at the ceiling after some minutes of play out of exhaustion. He does not even play, just just wants to see me play...

My father died when I was 12 and he was always away with his C-level job, and I always thought that I will be there for my kids when the time will come but I can not do this anymore...I fantasize of leaving every minute of my life...I feel trapped and whatever I do, it's going to be bad for my kids. If I stay I'm giving them and abandonment feeling, like my son feels, because I do not have enough energy to be as available for them as they need me to be. If I leave, they will feel abandoned again.

What the hell am I doing? reading this post again before posting, it's like I don't even make any sense

# I’ve a great educational solution for freelance writers to take them a powerful and joyful journey in the new year.

Dear freelance writers, solopreneurs, and aspiring entrepreneurs,

First, Happy Festive Season! 🎉

Some of you may have wondered why I’ve been so quiet lately, especially about gaming, movies, and juicy media stories. I promise I haven’t vanished into a black hole or gone off to relive the 1960s with sex, drugs, and rock and roll (though my uncles might approve).

Instead, I’ve been on a mission — a quest, if you will — to create something meaningful for the writing community.

# Why I Care So Much About Freelance Writers

Before we dive in, let me share a little secret about why I’m so invested in freelance writers and solopreneurs.

Over the years, I’ve served as a volunteer editor, a content curator, [boost nominator](https://medium.com/illumination/i-will-no-longer-be-a-boost-nominator-but-still-will-continue-curating-non-boosted-stories-b86e7852280f), and a passionate amplifier of stories — both on Medium and Substack.

I’ve read countless stories from writers struggling to find their voices, reach their audiences, and make their mark. And every time I’ve helped someone polish their story or get the spotlight they deserve, I’ve felt a deep sense of fulfillment.

But my journey as a mentor and guide wouldn’t have been possible without [Dr Mehmet Yildiz](https://medium.com/u/dd3942a5498a) who took me under his wing, mentoring and coaching me for free to help me find my voice as a writer.

He didn’t stop there. He helped me create two publications one for gaming and one for videos/podcasts on Medium, made me an editor and curator, and gave me the opportunity to shine through his own publications.

As a volunteer media coordinator, I supported his Slack workspace, YouTube channel, Discord server, and tailored social media platforms on LinkedIn, Quora, Reddit, Pinterest, X Premium and more — all while witnessing him amplify the work of hundreds of writers by making us [guest bloggers ](https://medium.com/illumination/heres-why-i-opened-my-website-to-freelance-writers-as-guest-bloggers-on-multiple-platforms-39c03d8c8409)and providing valuable backlinks through his website and [community blogs.](https://digitalmehmet.com/blog-posts-by-dr-mehmet-yildiz-on-digitalmehmet/)

Inspired by his generosity and guidance, I’ve mentored around 50 new writers in 2024. My goal for the new year is to do the same for 100 writers on Meidum/Substack and support thousands of students via platforms like Udemy, Skillshare, and others.

This is my new strategy and commitment to paying it forward and making a difference in the lives of writers everywhere.

# Why I Went Dark on Medium

Medium used to be my arena. I poured my heart into hundreds of stories, gaining close to 20K followers. But then, something soul-crushing happened.

Medium’s algorithm decided I wasn’t its favorite anymore, and my content barely saw the light of day.

At first, I was frustrated. Who wouldn’t be?

But instead of letting the algorithm’s antics crush my spirit, I turned that negative energy into something positive — a project to help writers like you thrive.

I can no longer make you a Medium hero as it is impossible to be one nowadays but I can hep you become a Substack hero with my education programs in 2025💡

# Leveling Up: The Substack Journey Begins

Inspired by [*Substack Mastery*](https://books2read.com/substackmastery) by Dr. Yildiz, I spent weeks crafting a two-level training program for freelance writers and aspiring content entrepreneurs. Think of it as a power-up in your writing career, taking you from a beginner to a Substack hero.

Here’s the cinematic twist:

This isn’t your typical dry, academic course.

With my media background, I’ve transformed Dr. Yildiz’s insights into something fun, engaging, and refreshingly relatable — more like a co-op mission than a boring lecture.

And because I despise boring classes, I’ve packed these courses with humor, gaming metaphors, and light-hearted analogies.

After all, learning should be as joyful as discovering a hidden treasure chest in a game. According to adult learning theories, humor not only entertains but also helps information stick — so expect plenty of laughs along the way!

# The Gift of Growth in 2025

Now, here’s where the festive spirit kicks in.

To celebrate the new year, I’ve teamed up with Dr. Yildiz to offer these courses **at the lowest possible price** on Udemy. But there’s a catch — Udemy only lets me keep this offer live for **five days.** They say our way or high way! So as a junior in there I cannot say “no way Jose!” They might ban me so I will follow their rules.

So, if you’re ready to start this exciting adventure with me, here’s your chances with the **lowest possible fees** and **highest possible discounts for the next 5 days**:

* [**Level 1**: From Zero to Substack Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/from-zero-to-substack-hero-for-freelance-writers/?couponCode=NEWYEAR)
* [**Level 2**: From Zero to Substack Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/from-zero-to-substack-hero-for-freelance-writers-level-2/?couponCode=NEWYEAR)

My gaming friends said “Good on ya, Aiden, you reduced your courses to the cost of a cup of coffee or your favourite Red Bull in Australia.”🍵

I’ll also be rolling out Level 3 before New Year’s and plan to create **Levels 4 through 10 in next few months**, covering advanced strategies for seasoned writers. I am pleased that [the Advanced Substack book ](https://medium.com/illumination/preface-a-powerful-toolkit-for-advanced-substack-mastery-ef3f66750bed)by Dr Yildiz is now available in multiple formats.

I finished listening to the audio version on [my Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/audiobooks/details?id=AQAAAEDy42ejhM) today. It was exceptional content and narration for me. 5 hours 27 minutes was like a minute to me. He will upload the audio chapters to his [Content Marketing Strategy Insights](https://drmehmetyildiz.substack.com/) for his subcribers.

# The Book That Impacted My Creative Writing Life!

Here is a brief background on the birth of this education program:

Dr. Mehmet Yildiz’s [***Substack Mastery***](https://medium.com/illumination/listen-now-the-audio-version-of-substack-mastery-is-available-for-subscribers-bd2b91adacdf)***:*** *Insider Guide from a Seasoned Content Strategist and Author* wasn’t just another book or a how-to manual. It was like a flashlight in a dark tunnel for me. No wonder it became a best seller so quickly.

I remember reading the chapter on “Owning Your Audience” for the first time. It was like a light bulb went off in my head. Of course! Why was I spending so much energy trying to please algorithms when I could focus on connecting directly with readers?

Inspired, I decided to test the waters. I set up a Substack account and wrote my first post. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt right. And when the first subscriber replied with, “I really needed this today — thank you,” I knew I was onto something.

>I decided to turn his book into an interactive training program with his permission. This idea now turned into reality, and I am here today to share the introduction with you.

1hnayop,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnayop/a_silent_night/,A Silent Night.,"How did I get here? That is what I ask my self every day, this bunker that belonged to an old friend who was a Vietnam veteran, he died 6 years ago. I remembered it when I ran from my home, how it all happened still does not register but honestly how would it. I live in the Appalachian region and like most lived in the barest minimum because the government does not care for us veterans.

My story began at my home a few weeks ago and it was just a normal evening for me, I used my skills as a mechanic to make some money, the town is about 40 minutes away so many farmers and normal fold would come to me or ask me to go to their place to fix their machines and things. Bettie, my wife, died 10 years ago due to cancer so being alone get tiring for an old vet. I was sitting in my kitchen reading a book I had gotten from Gillian, sister-in-law, and sipping my coffee when I heard a knocking on my door. Looking up at my clock I saw it was close to 10 so anyone who comes at this time must be desperate.

I got up and walked to the front door and opened it, what stood in front of me forced me to take a step back. The girl looked like she just came in from a warzone, her clothes were like ribbons hanging on for dear life and where there was skin there were streaks of blood. The old memories of was threatened to resurface but her falling forward stopped that and instinct kicked in, my hands flew forward to stop her fall. I managed to stop the fall and carry her into my home, I pulled her in and set her down near my door and I turned to look out the door to see if there was anyone else behind or who was chasing her. The night was still and so were the sounds of the night, I closed the door slowly and turned to the girl. She looked young like maybe 23 years old, I gingerly picked her and walked over to my sofa and set her there.

She did not wake up and any attempts at waking her did not result in any reaction. I decided to treat her wounds and maybe clean her as best as I could so I went to the kitchen and filled a basin with warm water and took a few towels, looking around I remembered my coffee sitting on the small table and I juggled the towels and managed to carry that also. Setting the basin on the coffee table next to the sofa I set about trying to clean the wounds and could see that many were scratches from running in the woods. There was a real wound on her back that looked like it had stopped bleeding but from my touch it was hot, so an infection. It was a long cut like it was made by a claw of some kind, bears were prevalent in my area but given that it was October they were closer to their caves and streams. There were 2 other cuts next to the one I was treating and they were deep maybe the animal wasn’t able to catch her.

I finished with the treatment as best as I could and covered her with a blanket. I then decided to call the sheriff and let them know about this. I pulled the phone and dialled the number; it rang a couple of times and a lady picked the call. She asked if there was anything she could help with and I told her about my guest and if there were any deputies who could come by and maybe an ambulance. She told me the sheriff was in my area as there were reports of animal attacks at the Pine Peak Camp, so she will let the sheriff know about the girl. I thanked her and let her know to call if anything as I was 15 minutes away from the park anyway.

Animal attacks? I know the park was prone to animals prowling close to their boundaries but honestly an attack was rare, if ever. I decided to sit and wait in case the sheriff did decide to show up, being a vet meant sleep was something we got after taking pills because normal sleep was like being sent back to the battlefield and watching your buddies being torn apart by the enemy traps. I fished out my old shotgun, checked if it was loaded and took a few spare ammo.

I sat down on the armchair that looked out the window in to night and waited, the girl did not stir but I could hear the steady breaths she was taking. Whatever attacked her really did a number on her mind, as the thoughts of the old war floated into my mind I was woken in an instant. There was a sound outside like someone was trying to quietly walk around my house, the steps were heavy though like the person weighed over 300 pounds. Thump thump… they went but as quietly as possible, my hand tightened on the shotgun as I waited. It stopped and then nothing, I sat still and waited, the sounds of the clock were getting louder with every tick. Nothing, yet I could feel the air getting thicker and the night darker.

Outside the light outside my garage and workshop light up its space along with that it had its host of flies flickering about it, there was no wind but it was getting cooler now. I approximated the time to be around 1 and there were no sounds of the night. Just then a shadow darted past the window, too fast for me to see what it was, there was a noise at my front door like someone trying to push it in then nothing. The shadow then darted past the window again, then the light thumps of footfalls outside, my hand gripped the shotgun tighter with every thump to the point I actually hand to release it on account of getting a numbing sensation on my elbow.

Then I hear the light thumps again and then there was a shadow in front of my window obscuring the light outside, I saw nothing at first and dared not to move a muscle. The girl was still out and did not move either, I sat and watched the window. It was like a big man looking in, it stood there then hunched down and that is when I saw that face. Like one of those large monkeys my wife would show me in those nature magazines. This face was filled with hate, the eyes were sunken in but there was like a dull red glow in them and the mouth was open, I could not see inside and did now want to. It lay there for what felt like hours but was maybe a minute before it pulled away, I looked like it was about to punch through the window but flashing lights from behind startled it and it darted. It was the sheriff, from the red and blue I knew it was him and he was followed by another car.

I got up and walked to the window and waited for the cars to park, still holding my shotgun tight and waited. The cars stopped and 2 men came out of the first car while the single had just 1, who I supposed would be Doc Wilman. The sheriff wore his hat and walked up to my front door; I knew he could see me but decided to know any way. I light my room and the lights outside and opened the door. The sheriff looked tired and from what I could see the deputy behind was the same, the doctor however looked like he was recovering from the shock of his life. No greeting just a nod in the direction of the sleeping lady and I stood back, I knew niceties would just piss them off so I stood back and waited for all three to enter and then again a pocked my head to see if my other guest was there.

Nothing, so I stepped back in and closed the door behind me and bolting it. The sherif stood behind the sofa while the doctor sat on the coffee table to examine the lady, the deputy had made his way to the kitchen. I stood next to my window and waited. Nothing was spoken for a few minutes then the doctor said she was in shock and should be taken to his clinic, the sheriff nodded and called out to his deputy. He then turned to ask me what happened and I told him everything, the look on his face told me everything.

“Listen Mason, whatever attacked this girl’s camp left us just parts of people to pick and identify, how she escaped is a miracle but honestly, I need more than just a few boys with guns to hunt whatever did this. You need to either come with us or find a better place to stay safe, I got reports that another camp was attacked few miles away a week ago. This sasquatch or whatever the fuck they are calling it looks like it’s on a rampage.”

I nodded and mentioned that I will figure something out but also mentioned that I was a vet so I am prepared. He nodded and motioned for his deputy to help him pick the lady and they left. I watched them load her in to the police car and the doctor into his own car. After that they left, and the night was silent again. I sat back on the chair and waited for the dawn. The shadow returned but this time I was ready to fight.",4,1735290095.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hnaspd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hnaspd/why_is_hydrogen_water_good_for_you/,Why Is Hydrogen Water Good for You?,"Hydrogen water has been gaining popularity in the health and wellness world, but why is it considered so beneficial? That’s exactly what I wanted to know before trying the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle**. After a few weeks of incorporating hydrogen water into my daily routine, I’ve learned a lot about why it’s worth the attention—and the science behind its health benefits. Here’s everything you need to know.

# What Is Hydrogen Water?

Hydrogen water is regular water that’s been infused with molecular hydrogen (H₂) gas. While it looks and tastes just like plain water, the added hydrogen molecules provide potential health benefits that regular water doesn’t offer. These molecules act as powerful antioxidants, helping neutralize harmful free radicals in your body and reduce oxidative stress.

A **hydrogen water bottle**, like the **lifewater hydrogen bottle**, makes this process easy and accessible by infusing your water with hydrogen at the press of a button.

# Why Is Hydrogen Water Good for You?

Research and user experiences suggest several compelling reasons why hydrogen water is worth adding to your routine:

1. **Powerful Antioxidant Properties**:
   * Free radicals in your body can cause oxidative stress, leading to aging, inflammation, and chronic diseases. Molecular hydrogen acts as a selective antioxidant, neutralizing these harmful molecules and supporting overall health.
2. **Improved Hydration**:
   * Hydrogen molecules are tiny, allowing them to penetrate your cells more efficiently than regular water. This means better hydration at the cellular level, leaving you feeling refreshed and less thirsty.
3. **Reduced Inflammation**:
   * Chronic inflammation is linked to a variety of health issues, from joint pain to heart disease. Hydrogen water’s anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce symptoms and support long-term wellness.
4. **Boosted Energy Levels**:
   * By improving cellular function, hydrogen water can naturally increase energy levels without relying on stimulants like caffeine.
5. **Faster Recovery**:
   * Athletes often use hydrogen water to reduce muscle soreness and recover faster after intense workouts. It may also help repair tissue damage caused by exercise.
6. **Enhanced Skin Health**:
   * The antioxidant effects of hydrogen water can improve skin clarity, reduce dryness, and promote a youthful complexion.

# My Experience with Hydrogen Water

Using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle**, I noticed several benefits over a few weeks:

1. **Better Hydration**: I felt genuinely hydrated throughout the day, even when drinking less water. No more dry mouth or constant thirst.
2. **More Energy**: My afternoons felt less sluggish, and I relied less on coffee to stay focused.
3. **Clearer Skin**: My skin looked more hydrated and felt softer after a week of consistent use.
4. **Reduced Joint Discomfort**: I have mild knee stiffness, and while it didn’t vanish, it felt noticeably less bothersome.

These changes weren’t drastic, but they were consistent and added up over time.

# How Does Hydrogen Water Work?

The benefits of hydrogen water come down to the science of molecular hydrogen. When you drink it, the hydrogen molecules travel through your body, entering your cells and targeting oxidative stress. Unlike other antioxidants, hydrogen is small enough to penetrate cell membranes, making it highly effective.

A hydrogen water bottle like the **lifewater water bottle** makes the process easy. It uses electrolysis to infuse your water with hydrogen gas, creating a drink that’s rich in antioxidants and ready in just three minutes.

# Who Can Benefit from Hydrogen Water?

Hydrogen water is great for anyone, but it may be especially beneficial for:

* **Athletes**: For faster recovery and reduced muscle soreness.
* **People with inflammation**: Conditions like arthritis or gout may improve.
* **Busy professionals**: For sustained energy and focus throughout the day.
* **Skin-conscious individuals**: Antioxidants can help improve skin clarity and hydration.

# Why I Recommend the LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle

There are many hydrogen water bottles on the market, but the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** stands out for its quality and ease of use:

* **Simple Operation**: Just fill, press a button, and wait three minutes.
* **No Maintenance**: No filters to replace or complicated parts to clean.
* **Portable Design**: Lightweight, leakproof, and easy to carry anywhere.
* **Durable Build**: Made with high-quality materials for long-term use.

# Final Thoughts: Why Is Hydrogen Water Good for You?

Hydrogen water offers a range of potential health benefits, from better hydration to reduced inflammation and improved energy levels. While it’s not a miracle cure, it’s a small change that can make a noticeable difference in your day-to-day wellness.

If you’re thinking about trying hydrogen water, I recommend starting with a reliable hydrogen water bottle like the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle**. It’s easy to use, effective, and a great way to experience the benefits firsthand.

It’s  been years since we last spoke ..  You requested space, and I completely respected your wishes. Since then, I’ve focused on personal growth, and I’ve changed a lot.

I wanted to apologize to you first. I hate that I tried to burden you with my problems back then and placed pressure on you. I didn’t take into account your feelings or how my actions and words made you feel. That’s what I regret the most – how I used to be.

Stephanie, the reason I was so overwhelming during our conversations is because I was frustrated and couldn’t handle the fact that we were just texting. I craved a deeper connection, which led me to share really personal things that I probably shouldn’t have. I didn’t handle my emotions well back then, and I truly regret that.

The reason I’m reaching out is because I came across a picture you sent me when we used to talk, and it really made me think about you. Circumstances have changed this time, and I live in Sa , so the distance is no longer an issue.

I understand things have changed for both of us, and it might feel a bit awkward at first, but you’re someone I truly value. Even though we mostly communicated through text, those conversations meant a lot to me. If you’re open, I’d love the opportunity to get to know you again. No pressure at all – just whatever feels comfortable for you. Maybe we could grab coffee or lunch to catch up? Lol

We parted on good terms we were friends but I kinda liked her. Lived in diff cities hence why we stop talking ..",3,1735289005.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Option 1 - Stay in a studio (350-400 BD per month approx) apt which is walkabale distance from office. (less than 1km). Avoid the need to rent/lease a car (saving almost 150-200 BD per month)

Option 2 - Stay in Juffair/Seef or similar areas in Manama for lesser ( Studio or 1 BHK  for 250-280 BD per month) and rent a car for another 150-200 BD.

Which would be a wiser decision? Money wise, life wise.

P.S - I dont travel out much, so I don't mind living without a car if shops/office are all at walkable distance. I am a bit lazy that way! I am living alone.

But anyways, since it might be folic acid absorption issues or maybe even other vitamins, these are the following steps i have started to take:
- Eliminate coffee. I usually had it first thing in the morning on empty stomach and that is capable of harming my gut a lot.
- Eating pro biotic yogurts, drinks
- Taking 4 mg of folic acid
- 300mg of choline
- 500mg of inositol
- Usual prenatals with omega 
- Vitamin D and b12
- Avoiding lots of sugary and oily food.
- Was pretty active pre ivf and will start again once better.

Ofcourse not doing great on sugary things because i am in hell right now. Will get back to it.
I am hoping inositol, choline and folic acid automatically helps me get pregnant naturally. 

Next steps after 1-2 months:
- Get tested for vitamins
- Get tested for hormones. 
- Get tested for gut issues (ibs, ibd)
- Genetic testing is already happening, will get results in 6 to 8 weeks.

First and most, get mentally stable and then get my body up and running.

First time I watched porn was when I was in 5th grade or 10/11 yrs old. I just watched it and didn’t do anything just curious. At 12/13 yrs old, I over hear some classmates from 8th grade saying how jerking off felt so good and I tried it. Which was my first time doing it, and that opened a whole door I wish I never opened. Back then I would jerk off twice a day 7 days a week. But I was able to reduce it over the time. Whenever I would get a GF I would quit porn because I would get nudes or do sexual acts with my GF at the time. But the moment the relationship ended I would get back to my porn addiction. When I try to quit I can only go 30 days before I succumb to the temptation. Now that social media promotes OF girls left and right it’s harder to fight it. I’m now 20 and I have recently move to university to a big city (I use to live in a small town with no hookers or strip clubs). Where I learned about bikini baristas where I would just go to see naked chicks make me coffee and would pay extra to even see the show. A buddy of mine invited to me a strip club which was my first time and I paid for lap dances. And even started to paid for hookers. Now that I’m on winter vacation and back at my parents house I’m just watching porn nearly everyday hoping to go back to university and go straight to pay for a hooker. I’m obviously single but my porn addiction is starting to lead to other addictions such as paying to see woman naked or even hookers. I genuinely want to quit but I can’t go longer than 30 days. I don’t want this stupid addiction that started when I was 10 to continue get any bigger. Obviously no one knows I have a porn addiction because I’m ashamed of it and I want to put it to an end. So how can I go on to combat this stupid addiction. I recently starting to research how to quit and I read that Reddit has a nofap which is this one and now I’m looking for help here.

To give background, he’s financially stable as he had a job and was working full time whilst I was a university student. Since I’m at uni and my course is financially demanding, I work part time at a coffee shop that pays a bit over minimum wage to help with my tuition but most of my financial stuff comes from my parents.

He asked me out for lunch on Christmas day, he offered to pay since he was the one who asked me out and he knew I wasn’t as financially stable as he was. Lunch went well, he was on time and picked me up from my house, we talked about our lives and laughed a lot. 

However, it did give me an ick how he was bragging about how much money he has and how good of a job he has and even said that it was why he took me to that restaurant. I thought nothing much of it as I didn’t care about how much he makes a month but I honestly should have seen the early red flag.

I was a bit hesitant to order anything from the restaurant he insisted on taking me to, it was a bit pricey and was dead smack on my budget. One meal and I won’t be able to get home if I didn’t have someone dropping me off. But since he insisted, I did but I kept it within my budget since I did feel bad about him paying and I decided I was going to pay for my meal instead.

After lunch, we received the bill and he took one look at the total before passing it over to me. Confused, I asked him why he passed it to me when he insisted on paying. He said that my meal was more expensive than his when in reality, my meal was the same price as his and he said it was the side dishes that I picked and we decided to split and share that added to my meal. 

He refused to pay even for his meal even when I offered to pay for my meal and the side dishes just to end the argument that was slowly starting between us. He still refused and was adamant that I pay since my meal was ‘more expensive’ and ‘I was the one who ordered the side dishes’. In the end, I took a bit of extra from my savings account just to pay for the entire thing.

He offered to drive me home but I was upset at that point and he told me that it wasn’t a big deal and repeated the whole side dish thing. I told him no and that I was gonna stay in the area for a while, he left and I asked my dad to pick me up since I had no more cash on me at that point and I didn’t want to touch my savings account anymore. 

When I got home, I received a text from him saying he enjoyed lunch and said that he was ‘joking’ about making me pay, he was going to actually pay but I paid first and he couldn’t do anything as it was too late. I blocked him and now I’m pissed, wallet empty and a chunk missing from my savings account, disappointed in myself that I even decided to go out with that guy in the first place.

Background: Boyfriend and this girl (whos quite clingy to him) are really close. She would rant to him on the phone at night, go to him at the end of the day in his area at work to rant, almost everyday asks him to get coffee with him and sometimes even lunch break. 

I just found it off on the girls part cus she never invited me and was doing that whenever I’m around or when I’m not around. 

I voiced out my concern to my BF. He did set some boundaries. And eventually the girl found out that I felt uncomfy about her cus of my past. 

2024 was the worse year of my life cause of the stress I felt because of both of them. Its so unfair that I’m not even doing anything yet I’m the one experiencing this hurt. 

My feelings: I just am so disappointed with my boyfriend, like sure maybe it was platonic but he never bothered considering how I’d feel or if I’d misunderstand. I realized he’s not really a sensitive person. Like he will say he considers my feelings but when it comes to action I honestly don’t feel it. 

What should I do? My mental health is important to me but if he’s not helping me heal but allowing it to be triggered again and again when I see them interacting thats not work related then what do I do?

This christmas was probably the worst in a long while. I've been having health problems that effect my hormones, and I'm right back to being that troubled teen I was over a decade ago. You tell yourself that you live and learn, but apparently my brain is always capable of getting upset over something so stupid. 

So I don't even like presents. It makes me anxious asking for things, and I hate when people watch you open things and eagerly await your reaction. If I like the gift I always feel like my gratitude is too forced, and if I dont like it theres like a gun pointed at your face to lie convincingly or be The Asshole for making someone feel shitty over a gift. 

But my mom still likes to do christmas stockings, and my sisters always say she does the BEST ONES and all their friends agree. I guess its apart of her whole christmas identity? and like she does so much work on christmas and she tries so hard to make it amazing for everyone. But I'm also her only boy and she has no idea what to put in mine. Its always just a bit depressing to hear her talk with my sisters over the makeup products by name or the ring from that artist that she knows they wanted and then my turn is just sorta. A vague gesture to nerd properties I don't even like. 

I know apart of it is that they know what they want and just like. Tell her. and so its kinda my fault she doesnt know what to do and what kind of asshole makes their mom feel shitty over a christmas stocking? 

So I tried to give her a list of what I wanted: Enamel Pins, fridge magnets, and some kinda fun desk toy. I know i didn't specify what kind I was still pretty vague. But I thought maybe she'd just get some things shaped like an owl (my favorite animal as a kid) or something with my name or our city or our state on it. Or maybe just something she thought looked cool in one of those gift/knick knack shops. Hell I would have even liked the merch from the goddamn coffee bean chain. We dont have it where I live and I always make a big deal about how much I want a coffee from there. You know, just *anything* that shows she can name one thing about my personality.

But instead I got a Star Wars: Mandalorian sticker, a pocket lego set, and an even bigger Jurrasic World Lego set. 

And like, theres nothing wrong with those things. I'm sure people who like Star wars or played with legos in the last two decades or has ever even seen a jurrassic world movie would think those things are great. But for some reason it just like. broke me. 

My family thinks I'm a child. An 'idk get anything from the toy aisle' child. 

I am 30 years old and I draw and I write and I like clay face masks and novelty mugs and visiting old castles and learning about medieval, viking, and mongolian civilizations and I don't watch tv and am boycotting Disney+ and I watch maybe one movie a year if my older sister says its good. 

I feel like they should know. And even if they didn't know, I would have liked it better if they just got me something THEY would like. at leas tthat would be welcoming me into their lives a little bit. My older sisters each got matching travel bag sets, just like the one my mom has. I got a jurrasic world lego set that I'm pretty sure was an extra gift for my nephew last year. 

It just sent me into a spiral for the rest of the day. It didn't help that no one laughed at my jokes, every time I tried to talk about something I like the conversation would die, every time I tried to participate in what was already being said I'd just be ignored, and whenever I asked my family members questions they'd give single word answers and then go back to ignoring me. I had to follow my sisters around like a pathetic puppy. I spent the whole day trying so hard, and they dont even know that I fucking hate sci-fi and have pretty much my entire life. 

I called the hotline once everyone went to bed, but didn't even know what I could say. 'Im sad because my mommy's christmas stocking sucked?' what the hell is the matter with me? 

I don't know if im just hormonal or if I should just give up. Next year I don't want to come to christmas at all. It sucks spending the entire year convincing myself that its all in my head, that my family loves me and wants to see me of course, thats what families are for and they'd be 'So devastated' if they knew i felt like this only to come back and have it be shoved in my face how little they know me and how little interest they have in knowing me. 

I'm a grown man who wanted to kill himself over a lego set. I just wanted to get that off my chest. ",4,1735287282.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.84,False
