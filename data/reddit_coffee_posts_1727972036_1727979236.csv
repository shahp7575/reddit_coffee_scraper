Nothing is optimal, village shop only had Lazy Sunday beans, I'm I was too impatient to wait until we did a big shop...and my brother-in-law was out of what he uses in his shop. Grinder is a Bodum Bistro (with the metal burrs) which I thought would be better than my Krups I was using for aeropress/pour over but know not ideal for espresso...and scales only turned up tonight... 
While not great I've managed to get a passable coffee out of it and thanks to the hits and tips on here I'm getting a less sour shot each time.
With the scales and the dual wall basket I managed to get something drinkable espresso wise. Still on the sour side but we tend to drink coffee with milk so not too fussed. 
I may look at modifying the Bodum Bistro in the future as it's not cost me anything.

This is a great option for me because: 

* It's low cost, & I have a limited budget for dating 
* It's quick, so I can fit it around my busy life 
* It's easy to leave if they're not a good match - there's no sense of obligation to spend a whole evening together
* We get to have a conversation & find out about each other
* We see how we vibe in person (if we met on an app)
* There's opportunity for light flirting if we feel that way inclined 
* We both get to see if we're a good match

I'm on date 7+ with the person I'm seeing now, and we still often do a coffee and a walk. We both enjoy keeping fit & being outdoors, & it's a great way to spend time together.

But I've seen that some folks on here really *don't* like coffee as a first date.

1fvdt4e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvdt4e,From getting fired by my favourite irl team in the first season to becoming untouchable and writing literal unprecedented history at another by season 3:An FM Story,"So, yeah. This is only my second ever save, the first one having been abandoned due to computer issues 4 seasons in, now that FM was free on Epic I decided to give it another shot. I started at FCSB and did really well initially, only lost 3 games by late November (2 of those were simmed games in the league, 1 was against Hammarby in an ECL group consisting of Fiorentina, AZ and them), we beat Toulouse in the knockout playoff round and then it went to shit. 8 straight losses, including to Midtjylland in Europe and Rapid (2nd place team turned 1st place) in the league twice, one of those being after we went 2-0 up even after a stupid red card (my player did trip up an opponent trying to get to the ball on a counter but it was at the halfway line to the side of the field, there was another CB further back to cover and a RB sprinting back as well, imo that should have been a yellow but anyway) but conceded 3 goals in 10 minutes and lost 4-2. I get hauled into a meeting by the board. Save scummed it once because I have never been in this position before and it is only my second ever save (nothing else besides that was save scummed as it would hollow any achievement and the whole point is to take what you are given, I promise), I survive. Then we win 4 out of the next 6 games including beating Craiova twice, one time 4-0 in the league, making the Cup final (speaking of the Romanian Cup, the cup groups are completely fucked up, you don’t even play opponents from your own group in game when you are supposed to irl) AND beating Rapid with an 88th minute header from my CB to come within 4p of them who are sitting in 1st with four games to go. Then the board fires me for some reason. 

FCSB loses every game after that except one draw and finishes 5th. Rapid (who btw, has Mircea Lucescu in charge that promptly retired after that) wins the league. I start applying for jobs but no one is willing to take me on (might be because I am a Sunday League player). I load in a bunch of extra leagues including the VNL. By September I start to actually get interviews from a VNL club. They ask why I am stooping so low. I want to tell them “BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT WOULD GIVE ME THE DAMN JOB” but I abstain myself (only because SI didn’t code that into the game).  “Are you willing to work with our DOF?” Yes. I have no clue who he is and I will do my own signings even if it takes hours (the most agonising part of FM for me as I suffer from major indecision issues lol) but yeah, I will go for a coffee with him or something. “What about our financial issues?” I will spend whatever I am allowed to as always, I know this is not the Premier League lads. They reject me anyway. Holy hell. At least I am not as bad as Xabi Alonso that somehow got fired in November of the first season for leading Leverkusen to 15th in my save. Then others come in like Fylde. By this point I had my eyes set on Hartlepool as I led them to PL and CL glory once in a FIFA 22 save but I couldn’t afford to wait for long.

 **SEASON 2**

They fired their coach and finally, on 4th November 2024, the managerial comeback was on as I signed with the Monkey Hangers (that s their actual nickname lol). The players react amazingly to my starting meeting, filling up the atmosphere bar immediately. Come on lads, that s a team properly behind their manager (They would later kick off a bit over me not playing a veteran and constantly over some training issues but club atmosphere never went below slightly positive). Hours were spent trying to figure out a formation from the versatile and unknown players at our disposal. The only one still at the club from my FIFA save is the GK Ben Killip. We have some 19 year old Iraqi winger on loan (Ali Hayder) that has 19 flair, 13 crossing, 14 dribbling but literally 1 passing for some reason. The man still gets called up to the NT and misses games due to it lol. We started with a 4231 but eventually settled on a flat 433 that is varyingly described as “wing play” and “direct counter attack “ by the game. Keep in mind, goals is what wins games not possession. We steadily climb up the table and go on a massive run to finish the season. On the final day only a win would guarantee playoffs (and that only because we made up the GD on another team while Gateshead that had a far superior GD slipped up and was a point behind). The winning goal came in the 84th minute. The semi saw an 90+2 long shot wonder goal to send us to Wembley. By now we were up to 11 straight wins to finish the season. Well, we conceded a 90+2 OG from a corner in a very uneventful game (only one other key highlight) to lose promotion. Gutted. Absolutely gutted. I tell the boys I am proud of their efforts. 

**SEASON 3**

On the bright side the board has just increased our wage budget and even gave us some transfer budget (40k up from 33k we were spending last season which was very slightly over budget at that and 100k transfer budget respectively, I moved it to scouting budget and targeted free transfers anyway) and we do have about 500k balance including a small board injection so the finances aren’t that bad. On the other hand, we still have 5% transfer retention so it is what it is. By this point I kinda hate the VNL, only 5 subs on the bench does seem really tiny and only 1 sure promotion spot really sucks, hopefully we do go up this season. 

A lot of upheaval took place this season as one of our best players, midfielder (BBM) Callum Cooke wanted out to League One Portsmouth (I initially said no but then agreed to let him go for 500k, they came back with a 450k offer but with add ons for 575k and a friendly thrown in for no reason and I accepted), none of the parent clubs of our loanees that had helped us last season were willing to renew their loans to me and with Cooke and another midfielder gone there was a massive hole in the middle of the park. The fact that the window is pretty much always open in this league is weird but I do get in a bunch of signings like 20 year old Ryan Battrum (RB with 17 acceleration, 15 pace, 16 determination and agility but only 9 marking and passing tbf, 3.5 star CA and “could improve significantly”) from West Ham, Charlie Allen that I initially panic bought to be our BBM due to his 14+ passing, first touch, technique, decisions and determination but would end up relegated to the bench after we got in 2 more CMs, our only loanee Brandon Cover from Leicester and a really well rounded (only long throws and leadership are below 8) Harry Wood (we only got him in November too!), Harry Boyes (a 24 year old “decent League Two player”) as a LB from Sheffield United, Luke Molyneux that was a legend in my FIFA save but not so good in FM and others, 8 free transfers and a loan in all with only 4 out, two of them being loans. Vice captain Daniel Dodds (RB/CB, backup RB after we got in Battrum for me) also wanted out but I agreed a 220k price tag with him that no one was willing to pay so he stayed. During the summer our training facilities have also degraded to “below average” (btw, why doesn’t FM just show the number or at least have consistent descriptors for ALL types of facilities?) but the board doesn’t want to invest in them (probably doesn’t want to risk the money to be fair to them) so it is what it is.

We actually started badly, 3 draws in our first 3 league games, lost the friendly to Portsmouth and continued erratically for a while, any win being inevitably followed by a few draws as we found ourselves sitting around 10th. Now, my supposed target was still the playoffs but with the media predicting us to finish 2nd and the stress the playoffs entail you can’t blame me for wanting more. The xG table, for it s part did have us in 2nd when I looked at it but mostly due to other teams (notably Fylde, who were the early leaders) overperforming theirs by a lot while we were actually fairly consistent. In the middle of this, our first FA Cup tie took place, we played FC United of Manchester and beat them 5-3 away with a goal from retiring CB Luke Waterfall (the one that I initially pushed to the wayside. Man has literally 5 acceleration and 4 pace by now, sorry mate). Very romantic tie for the Fourth Qualifying Round ngl, bit sorry to have to eliminate them. 2 draws from 3 games later, we play in the FA Cup again and we are again drawn away, this time against fellow VNL side Southend. We beat them 4-1 in a match in which we were already ahead by 4 after only 26 minutes. This sounded a league revival as we started picking up wins before it was time for our Second Round tie against…Lewes from the 7th tier away. We dispatch them 7-2. However, in the FA Trophy I send out the second team, sim the game and lose to Blyth Spartans 6-1. Oh well, I never cared about that shit anyway. 

Another rough patch in the league follows (3 wins in 7 games, including a barely rescued 3-3 draw away at Fylde) before the cup starts again and it throws us…recently relegated from the Prem Wolves. I mean they may be 9th in the Championship, in bad form and we may be at home this time but still, it s fucking Wolves in Round 3. Not a Prem side that I was really worried about but still, this is class opposition, no more non-league shitters. Well…we win 2-0, goals from one of the new signings Remiero Moulton formerly of Brighton (he is a 19 year old natural AMC that can play ST and MC as well with 15 acceleration, 13 passing and decent(9) jumping reach, I bought him to be the starting striker but he was in and out of the team due to having patches where he didn’t really score) and Joe Grey, our starting striker the year previous. He is a typical mobile but shit in the air-type that apparently doesn’t feel comfortable in big matches (proper red, not orange) but I can’t say I have seen his morale indicating that he is nervous or anything.  THAT IS THE MAGIC OF THE CUP LADS!! In case you are wondering, there were other VNL sides as well still left in the competition as Gateshead lost to Spurs 4-1, relegated from League Two the previous season Cheltenham took League One Charlton to penalties in the replay and lost, Rochdale lost to Middlesbrough while the last remaining VNS side in Boreham Wood also lost a replay to League One Wycombe. Oh, and Arsenal drew United, taking a replay to beat them. 

For the Fourth Round, we watch as so many other teams get drawn instead of us (no kidding, there were like 8 teams remaining to be drawn when they finally drew us) but eventually we get…Chelsea or Swansea. Swansea only had 2 wins from their last 20 games. Surely this was going to be Chelsea, right? Nope, it was Swansea, some CDM named Matt Grimes scoring the only goal of the game in the 116th minute. Then they lost another game to Bristol City and drew 0-0 to Sheffield United and it was off to our ground the Suit Direct for the cup tie. WE ELIMINATE THEM TOO, GOALS FROM THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND DYLAN STEPHENSON (23 year old, 4 star CA player that had just joined Hartlepool when I arrived. He s a natural at AMR, AML and ST, I play him as an Inside Forward on the left despite my assistant still counting him as a ST) IN THE 3rd MINUTE AND JOE GREY IN THE 70th. They pulled one back in the 71st but it was not enough. Hold on, so you are telling me the Monkey Hangers are in the last 16 teams in England? Yes. LET S FUCKING GOOOOO!! But wait, what is Hartlepool s highest historical result in the cup, even? Only Round 4? **WE VE LITERALLY MADE HISTORY LADS.** HOLY SHIT. What. Just what? 

5 more wins in the league, including a 3-0 win over Mark Hughes Oldham Athletic (to be fair two of the goals were pens that looked really soft if not dives to me) and 2 losses later it is cup time again, our Fifth Round opponents are…midtable Championship side Huddersfield at home again. They had eliminated Everton (that is actually fighting for CL in the Prem somehow) to get this far but they were winless in their last 5. Unfortunately, Dylan Stephenson had gone out injured early in our last game, a 4-3 thriller against Cheltenham and he will miss the next 3 weeks. We actually score in the 17th minute. We hold on really well in terms of xG. We even dominated the first half. Then we concede from a cross in the 66th minute. Well, it s fine, come on lads, we can still do this! Unfortunately it just wasn’t to be, goals in the 88th and 90+4 minutes knock us out despite the super even 1.4-1.49 xG. I am super proud of the boys. Just imagine if Dylan had been fit for this game…

Somewhere along this run my u18 assistant manager wanted to leave so I started looking at my staff and I got in former FCSB player and FCSB HOYD Marius Petre, now out of contract for a while. Man has 19 mental, 16 level of discipline, 13 attacking and defending. He is even the same as a fitness coach as our dedicated fitness coach despite that no being a strong suit by any means (6). Then I look for HOYDs and I find an English one with 20 Working with Youngsters. Holy hell. This costs the club like 170k in termination fees for our former staff but I made more than that with the cup run. The u18 guy is nothing special but I tried to convince him to stay anyway and it worked. Btw, my assistant manager is Antony Sweeney, a dude with 4 people management but 18 Working With Youngsters and a Hartlepool legend with 444 league appearances for the club. By this point we were 7 points off the top but firmly in the playoff places, competing against Bromley, Fylde and Halifax for that all important champion spot.  We drop 2 draws immediately following the FA Cup loss but then pick up steam   following a week break as Dylan drops a hattrick on his comeback (that I rushed him for as we needed every point we could get at this point and were dealing with a few other injuries too) for a 4-0 win to Kidderminster Harriers (they got relegated). Joe Grey also contributed a goal. Then wins with Gateshead (in the playoffs themselves) 2-0, Woking 2-1 (Dylan with another goal and my backup LB Paterson that s only 1.5 star CA popping up in the 90th min with the other), Yeovil Town 3-1 (hattrick by my starting AMR Jonas Mukuna, apparently he s only a 2 star CA too), and, crucially for our GD, 7-1 away at Scunthorpe allowed us to keep gathering points, but Bromley and Fylde weren’t letting up either, at least now we had the GD advantage over them. At this point we were playing once every two days despite having just had a big 10 day break and fitness issues were getting brutal but we somehow avoided getting injuries. We did, however, slip up and only get a draw in the next game, however we went back to winning ways after that. One game before the end of the season, the table looked as follows:
1. Bromley  88p, 35 GD
2. Fylde       87p, 32 GD
3. Hartlepool 86p, 43 GD

So basically, we need a win AND Bromley AND Fylde to not get more than a point in order to finally get promoted. We were playing 13th place York City, Fylde was playing 10th place Cheltenham and Bromley was playing 7th place Aldershot (the only one that had a reason to actually try as they could lose their playoff spot if they lost and Woking won). It starts well, as we score twice early via Harry Wood (min 2) and Moulton (min 22).  Now it s all about waiting. And waiting. Highlights happen in our game but they come to nothing. People are probably glued to their phone notifications. Minute 41…red card for Aldershot. Still 0-0 in both other games, but can they hold on? Halftime comes and I tell the boys they are doing well. Then a red card for our opponents York right after halftime. Our match should be safe now, all about the others. Minute 56, Fylde scores, it s 1-0. NOOOOO! I wish I had a button to shout at the Cheltenham team right now. Back to our game, where York is starting to have chances despite being down to 10 but I am barely even watching. Minute 78. GOAL FOR CHELTENHAM!!! IT S 1-1!! STILL NO NEWS FROM BROMLEY SO AT THIS POINT WE ARE TOP, COME ON!!! Then we concede a minute later, 2-1. Guys, we re going to cautious, we will waste time, just fucking hold on to this. As time ticks down, we actually do, Cheltenham fights on to put another one past Fylde and IT S ALL OVER, THE MONKEY HANGERS ARE VNL CHAMPIONS, WE ARE BACK UP TO THE EFL LADS! I check up on the club vision, they are so delighted I am now considered untouchable, we were only supposed to get promoted next season. Me and Dylan Stephenson are favoured personnel now. My reputation bar is at 35% and 2 stars from the measly amount it had before. All is right with the world. I look at League Two rules. Holy hell, we can now get ESC slots for foreign players now? And we now have 5 subs with 7 named? YEESSS!!! Transfers? We have a proper limited window…but free players are extempt from that so no change. Now the tough part of preparing for a new season starts, deciding on the new squad and all. But for now we celebrate. WELL DONE MONKEY HANGERS! And hope I haven’t written too much for you all lol. In case you are wondering how FCSB is doing, they did finsh 2nd in the 2nd season but then fired their manager again and are now in the relegation round. They can still play in Europe from there because the Romanian league is dumb but holy hell.

TLDR:got fired from FCSB in the 1st season despite being 4p off the title with 4 matches to go, went to 18th placed Hartlepool in the VNL in November of the second one, made the playoffs and got to the final after an 11 game win streak, lost due to an own goal, came back the following season and won the title along with making Round 5/RO16 of the FA Cup which Hartlepool has never done in their entire history irl

- I live in the west : USA
- I’m not speaking for the whole of the Somali community 
- I live in Midwest (if ur somali U know the state I live in 😅) 
- I’m 22 

A. Right after I meet him (no private communication)
B. After we start texting for a few days
C. After a few weeks of texting and calling
D. After we’ve met in a public place for coffee
E. After a few public meetups, texting for a few weeks, and phone calls

Is it okay to find out what they do for work, where they live, their likes and dislikes, etc., before sitting down with my parents?

I’m asking because I don’t want to bring home every guy I find cute or think could be a potential match. Additionally, my parents have told me to only introduce a guy to them when I’m 1000% sure. They don’t want me to “waste” their time or be seen with multiple men. On one hand, my dad told me he doesn’t want to interfere in my romantic life and that as long as the guy can provide for me and I like him, that’s enough for him. My father is a very old-school Somali man, and he doesn’t want to see his daughter interacting with men. He would rather ignore his duty to help me find someone in a halal way than accept that I have natural halal desires. I spoke to my mother and grandmother, and they both said that in our culture (not Islam), telling your father you’re interested in a man is considered shameful.

I have two older sisters. The oldest is actually my first cousin, whom my mom raised after she lost both of her parents when she was just six months old. When she started dating or getting to know her now-husband, it wasn’t a secret. She would get ready for her dates while chatting with my mom. She made no attempt to hide that she was dating him. He visited our home several times while she was in high school, and he even came over to eat a few nights during Ramadan. Yet, my parents and uncles (her rightful guardians) didn’t get involved until my sister and her then “boyfriend” decided to get married.

Now my other older sister is doing the same thing. I love and adore my sisters. They are very smart and beautiful, but they dated, or are dating, in a way that’s haram but normal in my culture. As long as you don’t bring shame by being seen with too many different men, and keep things under wraps, you’re good to go. Every girl I’ve met in my community and city dates this way. All of my aunts dated this way. Involving your father early is considered extremely old-school.

No one in my community would ever admit this openly, but men in my community do not offer their women their Islamic rights. We’re shamed if we ask our fathers for help, yet we’re expected to be married before 30.

How are we supposed to navigate this? If men don’t offer their women their Islamic rights, and they don’t communicate with their of-age, adult daughters about relationships, and it’s culturally taboo to introduce marriage prospects to your family unless you’re absolutely certain… and you can’t be seen in public with any man romantically. It makes it seem like what’s halal is considered haram, and what’s haram is tolerated as long as it’s hidden. 

I also have a hard time getting to know Somali men in my city because they tell me, “Let’s get to know each other before we involve your parents.”

How have I avoided falling into haram despite coming from such a culture? Well, I’m very shy, and I was a kid for a long time. I only started feeling serious attraction to men at 21. I spent my time watching K-dramas, memorizing K-pop dances, arguing in TikTok comments, fighting with my little brother, watching TV shows, and working a part-time job as a teen. I never felt pressured to hide anything from my mother or family, so I never “rebelled”. 

I’ve never had the confidence to speak to a man on my own. I think I’m very pretty, and I’ve never struggled to get attention from men. But I can’t help feeling unbelievably paranoid when a man doesn’t court me in a halal way. If he can easily text and call me, he can easily text and call other women. I also doubt he’d ever let his future daughter do the same. I know I’m a beautiful, funny, smart girl, and it angers me to be nothing more than a haram fling. Maybe it’s my ego or insecurity, but haram is not enough for me.

How can I explore my options in a halal way without constantly fearing that I’ll disappoint my father?

P.S. If you’re a Muslim man with a father like mine, and you have a sister, please be the man for your sister that your father can’t be. Please, please give us our Islamic rights. Please make halal easy for us. Please openly communicate with your future daughters. Please be kind to us women. We often feel ashamed for having natural, human feelings.",1,1727977890.0,MuslimCorner,3,1.0,False

I've been really struggling with gnats and flies laying eggs in/on my fabric planter, and it feels like nothing is working long-term. I've tried pesticides, insecticidal soap, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, neem oil/essential oils, mosquito bits, a UV light trap with bait and a fan that sucks bugs down onto a sticky trap, letting the pot dry out, going on a flip-flop rampage and taking out any adult bugs I could find—you name it. Despite a lot of regular treatments and even a full repot and change of potting material/new grow bag, I'm still finding larvae crawling along the outside of the pot, so I'm really hoping someone here has some advice.

     For some more context, I have some coffee tree saplings growing indoors, and after several other set-ups, at this point I'm using a fabric planter bag, a homemade potting mix that's about 40% LECA (really porous clay balls/rocks) with the other 60% mostly a mixture of coco coir/husk and fluval stratum, along with some horticultural sand, worm castings, and mosquito bits. The mix is really free-draining, there's no root rot, and none of my other plants are affected since they're either mounted or fully in LECA semihydro. I also occasionally soak some fresh mosquito bits in water and water with that, since I'm not sure how long the ones I mixed in with the potting material will necessarily last.
 
     The bag is super breathable since it's made of fabric, and I have it on a stand with plenty of holes so it's elevated above the saucer underneath. I always empty the saucer once any water is done filtering through, and I let it dry out as much as I can without hurting the plants. I even tried letting it dry out with no water for like three weeks, which almost lost me the plants, but the bugs still came back. I also tried bottom watering it with wicks, but it was staying wet for too long so I switched back to top watering. I keep the airflow going strong in the room, and besides the HVAC fan I also put in an extra air circulator. The humidity is pretty high since I live in a basement unit, but I have a dehumidifier and some moisture absorbers and I've gotten it down to around 60% RH.

     It feels like I've tried almost everything there is short of just tossing the plants, but they're my buddies and I'd be really sad to see them go 😭 There must be something I'm missing here that'll help me get rid of these bugs, so if anyone's got any suggestions I'm ALL ears!",1,1727977883.0,houseplants,0,1.0,False

I have been a happy Breville Barista Touch owner for the better part of 3 months. It took a few days to get my espresso recipe right, I eventually settled at grind size 8, with 19sec of brewing time for a single shot. I have been using [Passalacqua Cremador](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005IDW23M?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) beans pretty much since I got the machine, I never had issues -it's a popular brand used by cafes in my hometown (Naples, Italy). Last week I pulled a watery shot, but packing another puck and brewing again seemed to sort the issue. Today the machine started consistently pulling watery shots -I tried using the cleaning tablet, flushing the machine, replacing the filter. Nothing worked. I read somewhere that it could be a problem with the gasket, but I could not find a conclusive answer or knowledge base from Breville.

I called customer service -we tried several things, using the dual wall filter, changing grind size, and even taking apart the grinder. They insist it's an issue with the beans, but that seems like a cop out answer? I was pulling normal shots with the very same beans (same bag!) until yesterday. I even tried pre ground espresso, I got similar watery results. The person on the phone kept insisting it was the beans. I am no coffee machine engineer, but it's peculiar that they wouldn't even entertain the idea that their product could be malfunctioning. I am now waiting for a manager to reach out -I'll probably try a different brand of beans in the meantime.

I (30M) have been in a relationship with my gf (26F) for about a year. We moved in together about 3 months into the relationship. She is studying and doing some part time work on the side, making about 700-1100 monthly. I have a very good career and make about 10x what she does and have been paying for everything thus far: rent, utilities, car (which she sometimes uses), food (we mostly eat takeaway), vacations, dates, etc. She sometimes pitches in for a coffee or buys some groceries, but rarely. My expenses tripled while I'm with her. I do my laundry, she sometimes does it for me too, I do a majority of the cooking or order in, take out the trash. I get a maid in once in a while to clean up, which I pay for too.

I have been feeling that this isn't a fair way to split responsibilities. 5 months ago I asked her to put more effort in, by either pitching in some amount (200-300 USD, when rent + utilities is 1400) or by taking on the responsibility of keeping the house clean (either doing it herself or paying for a maid). She said she doesn't want to be my 'servant', which felt off, because what am I then - a wallet? It isn't about the financials here as I can fully pay for everything and have a bunch left over, I just feel like we aren't putting in an equal amount of effort into our household and day-to-day.

She does clean the house now, except for the room where I work, but constantly complains that she has to do it. She doesn't do it really well either and the house, while clean, ends up being quite disorganized after, I try to gently suggest alternative ways of organizing things, but she doesn't take criticism well. At one point I just took it upon myself to fully reorganize the apartment, throw out old boxes, and useless garbage, and labeled where we should put things. I feel bad about it and honestly makes it feel like I'm 'forcing' her to do this and we keep coming back to the same argument, with her saying I make enough to pay for a maid so why not do it. Sometimes I order a maid in again to just help her.

It feels like I'm putting in a lot, with very little gratitude and reciprocity. I get that she is currently quite busy with university and part-time work, but I feel exhausted and used. What would be the right way to split responsibilities here? Is asking her to do most of the cleaning at home, while I take care of food and financially cover everything reasonable?",1,1727977447.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False
1fvdjgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooManyLosingHeroines/comments/1fvdjgw/more_removed_moments_from_anime_specially_for/,More Removed Moments From Anime! (Specially for Lemon),"# Episode 5

Before meeting Shikiya, Nukumizu actually have a moment alone with Komari just ignoring him. Nukumizu wanted to feel less awkward started talking nonsense to Komari for 20 minutes until she finally started to talk to him.

After Yakishio left the clubroom she actually left her socks and Nukumizu had to use his handkerchief because he didn't want to touch it and threw it in her bag. 

  
When Nukumizu received the message from Yanami, Kaju got so happy she sat on her brother's lap...



On the anime in the restaurant scene, Nukumizu and Yanami have 2 glasses of water while in the novel there's only one. It's Nukumizu's water which he already drank from and Yanami took it and chugged it down:

*Yanami stole my glass of water, chugged it in one go and then slammed the cup onto the table again.*

*“They have already gone that far, get it!? They are already at the calm newlywed stage now! It’s only been a month! How far do they want to go!?”*

*They can go as far as they want girl.*

*Yanami is running out of breath. I asked the waitress to refill our cups.*

*“Oh, and can you change my cup as well?”*

*“…Huh? You don’t like the fact I used your cup so much you need to get a new one?”*

According to Nukumizu he doesn't like drinking on something someone else have drank from.(Same for eating)

  
When they saw Yakishio and Ayano. They didn't actually went out immediately since Nukumizu had zero interest until he got blackmailed by Yanami:

*I poured milk into my iced coffee. I purposefully added milk after finishing half of it. This allows me to enjoy the rest as milk coffee.*

*I enjoyed the coffee. Yanami gave me a cold, hard stare. She tapped on the check.*

*“I’ll leave without paying.”*

*“…Seriously?”*



On Nukumizu's house Asagumo introduce herself while calling Nukumizu by his first name causing Kaju to misunderstood the situation and think that her brother is interfering with another couple.

Before Ayano caught Asagumo and Nukumizu they actually have a longer moment in the light novel:

  
*“I didn’t know Nukumizu-san is this kind. It looks like I had a pretty deep misconception of you.”*

*Is there some weird misunderstanding about me spreading through the entire grade…?*

*Asagumo-san looks confused. She raised her head and looked at me with watery eyes.*

*“What’s wrong?”*

*“I wonder what kind of person likes Nukumizu-san? I want to meet her.”*

*With that, she chuckled again.*

# Episode 6

Before the drama scene, Yanami checked the handout and misunderstood that Nukumizu has a plan for her(Romantically):

*“Hey, is this what Nukumizu-kun plans to do as well? Indeed, you’re still a guy, after all.”*

*I don’t understand, but did she just say something impolite?*

*“I’m not planning anything. What do you mean, Yanami-san?”*

*“Hehe, no need to get embarrassed. I know you.”*

*You don’t know shit about me.*

*Yanami stood up and put her hand on my shoulder intimately.*



# Episode 7

They removed Nukumizu's conversation with Lemon's Grandma and her shipping Lemon with Him.

Now then for every Anime only watchers who got sick of people talking about how bad they did Lemon here you go:

Before they started talking Nukumizu was actually shy and sat really far away from her:

*“Going your way out to visit me this late, do you have- …aren’t you sitting too far away!?”*

*“Ah, but-“*

*Yakishio moved closer to me.*

*“We couldn’t talk like that. Moreover, it hurts me when you purposefully distance yourself from me.”*

*Yakishio protested calmly. I gave her a genuine apology.*

*“Whatever, I forgive you. Well, you’re here because of what happened earlier, right?”*

  
They started talking about the relationship of Ayano and Asagumo and how they could have kissed but all lemon wanted was for him to think that she was cute. Lemon's feelings for Ayano was cut short in the anime while in the novel she went into details.

*“Aren’t my hair and clothes always soaked with sweat after my club? Even though I used to go home without a care, I started worrying about whether I smelled when I had to meet with Mitsuki. Yet, I didn’t want him to think I spent extra time preparing myself. So, I went back home, changed my clothes, and went back to school to pretend that I had just finished my club. I even prepared another set of uniforms in the clubroom to avoid getting home late.”*
  
After she stopped crying Nukumizu told her about his friend(Yanami) about her experience is the same as her.

*“Nukkun, you have a friend…?”*

*Please don’t worry about that.*

*“Yes, for real. That friend is just like Yakishio. Her closest boy got a girlfriend.”*

*“…Yes.”*

*“She did give them her blessings, and she didn’t try to intervene. However, from my perspective, she seems…”*

*“…What’s wrong with her?”*

*“…She’ll swoop in if she even has the slightest chance.”*

*“Swoop in!? She is a bad girl! Nukkun, you befriended a bad girl!?”*

*Regrettably, yes.*

*“Yet, she doesn’t want to ruin their relationship, so she decides to construct a new one. To enable herself to support those two sincerely, she’s still searching for a new distance between the couple. It’s because she doesn’t want to deny her feelings, but she also doesn’t want to deny how much she wants to stay next to her.”*

*“You try to sugarcoat it, but she’s just looking for an opportunity, right?”*

*Well, I guess.*

*“What’s the conclusion of this?”*

*Indeed, I looked to the night sky and started pondering about it.*

*“Let me think. Compared to her, Yakishio is definitely a good girl, alright? What do you think?”*

*Yakishio also stared at the sky.*

*“…Maybe. I think I feel better now.”*

*Glad you feel better now. Thank you, bad girl.*

  
**And for the Kazuhiko x Lemon moment:**

I stood up and patted my pants.

*Yakishio thought of something when she planned to stand up. She sat down again.*

*“Hand.”*

*Yakishio reached her hands out toward me.*

*“What’s wrong? Did a bug-“*

*I bitterly smiled in the middle and reached my hands out to her.*

*Then, Yakishio held my hand and stood up.*

*“Nukkun is getting reliable.”*

*“It’s midnight, after all. Yeah, it’s because it’s midnight.”*

  
After this she promised to apologize to Asagumo and talk to her properly.

**Another Kazuhiko x Lemon moment after that:**

*Yakishio grabbed the bottom of my shirt tightly with both of her hands.*

*“So, can you go with me!? I’m not saying that you have to watch me. I just think that I can muster my courage if someone’s there. Well, I’m really sorry for causing you trouble constantly, but I-“*

*“Yeah, I don’t mind.”*

*Yakishio froze for a moment upon hearing my answer.*

*“…Eh? Are you sure? That’s a half-hearted reply.”*

*“Just because I answer half-heartedly doesn’t mean I think about this half-heartedly. How should I explain this to you?”*

*“What do you mean?”*

*“It’s not that big of a deal. …That’s what I think.”*

*“Heh, I thought you would say something cool.”*

*“I only say cool lines at key moments.”*

*Yakishio put her hands on her waist dumbfoundedly. She even sighed explicitly.*

*“That’s why I don’t like this part of you, Nukkun.”*

*Yakishio turned around and strolled forward with light steps.*

*“Which part are we talking about here…?”*

*She seems to have heard my mumbles. Yakishio turned around and showed her shiny teeth toward me.*

*“I’m not telling you.”*

*After that, Yakishio walked faster.*

  


Before they met up with Ayano, Nukumizu stopped by the bookstore and Yakishio went to find him after stopping by their house. The plan was to meet up near her house before meeting Ayano. Yakishio then held his hands and asked him if he plans to walk there but being dense...

*“Uh, I’ll kill time for a little bit and take the tram.”*

*“I see.”*

*Yakishio mumbled disappointingly. She kicked the ground with her shoes.*

*“Sigh, this can’t be helped. I’ll jog for a while and head there.”*

*“Got it. Well, let’s meet at the promised time.”*

*Well, I do notice that Yakishio’s attitude seems to be strange.*

*I scratched my head and looked away from her.*

*“Ah, …but we’ll be right on time if we walk over there now. I need more exercise recently. Let’s walk, alright?”*

*My tone is pretty blatant. Yakishio followed up with the same attitude.*

*“Ah, come to think of it, my muscles are cooled down after reading. I guess a walk sounds better than a jog right now.”*

*I glanced next to me. Yakishio and I are looking at each other. Both of us can’t help but laugh.*

*“Right, Yakishio is heading to the same place as I do.”*

*I continued unnaturally.*

*“I guess. You can’t be helped. I’ll do my good deed of the day and go with you.”*

*Yakishio put both of her hands behind her head. She shot me a flirtatious glance.*

*I looked at her with a bitter smile. We then walked shoulder-to-shoulder.*

  
Mitsuki wasn't actually the one who was supposed to walk Yakishio back home. But Nukumizu as he and Yakishio made a promise. But like in the anime Nukumizu instead made Ayano walk her back home.

  
Shikiya appears to fix Nukumizu's tie. And gave Nukumizu a single strand of Kaju's hair she found. 



So I guess its a pretty bad idea to force 2 chapters into a single episode... Anyway that's Volume 2  and correct me if I get things wrong! All the quotes and Dialogues is from SkythewoodTL! Check out the novel for special intermissions and more moments!!!

In the Aftermath, I questioned our Cursed Creator on why such devastation that I personally have never experienced caused at minimum for most around here An Intermission. 911 was down, non emergency lines were down. We had no power and some not even water, and during the night I had to play the role of protector: Asserting Dominion for mine and my own. Each day was Servitude to my own basic needs: Food, water, shelter. All in all, we were not hit as hard as 45 minutes up the road wherein Chimney Rock used to exist but now has been wiped from existence as if by the Mammoth's Hand, the town now decimated back to a near Transcosmic Blueprint. The ones that have prepared for this for years actually enjoyed this Utopia Black, but for me and mine, I'm glad to be back at some type of normalcy. Even though we regained power (and internet, through my phone). I'm finally able to enjoy the album and love every second of it, and I now realize how lucky I am to be alive and be able to enjoy this art the dudes created for us.


Keep us Blast Fiends in the Southeast USA in your thoughts because we haven't experienced anything like this in generations, and it's tough. Grocery stores are being hit hard and look a lot like they did during the beginning of Covid, but worse, and I'm just lucky some family members are preppers and have a lot of homemade canned goods. Others are not so lucky.

We are still out here though, helping neighbors, delivering food, hell, even ice to keep things like insulin cold for diabetics.

A little boy was killed Saturday when a tree fell onto him through his home as he slept, and the same happened to a nearby elementary school teacher. She was only mid 30s, and went to go to bed only to be awoken by giant oak pinning her to her bed. Her husband could not get ahold of emergency services, so he assured her he'd return with help. I'm not sure how long he ran or even how long it took to get assistance for her, but it was too late. She had died. Her name was Annamaria Fletcher.

He is from Eastern Europe and was likely raised in the toughest of circumstances. From his accounts - he’s won and lost a lot in his life and is a man of little irony.

Now for the details. 

He has never bought me a beer, a coffee, taken anyone out for dinner including wife or grandkids , offered a penny for fuel, or even thanked me for the countless times I’ve driven him to the hospital, work, store, picked him up, given him a place to stay, paid for his groceries and the likes. At an anniversary dinner I had for my wife and kids the inlaws came and ran up my tab and didn’t offer to even buy me a drink or pay a penny for anything. Ok they were guests but in general I consider this unbelievable. 

I myself am not rich but I have a car, savings, some moderate things and a house. My wife has always lived with the family and they came as a package deal. Literally. We live with them. Previously they did pay for all the utilities in house and my mother in law has cooked for me many times and asks what I want for dinner and she always makes what I like. Father in law like I said is a good guy, but it’s very hard to believe regardless of his finances that he wouldn’t at least sometimes offer “hey you drive me hours today, let’s stop and grab a bite or a tea”. Maybe this is culturally something I’m not getting.

I would assume that they do, and that the atmosphere of a quiet store would be much better than one that plays every Bruno Mars hits from the last 10 years on loop over a short period of 2 hour. Even if you're just casually walking into the store, you probably come to work with the construction work around the city, the car noises driving the work and all the honking and then you get to work and you have to listen to Walk the Moon and the most bubblegum pop music for 8 hours on end, every single workday, then you get home and the children are crying or your upstairs neighbour makes a ruckus until you finally get some sleep at night if the headache doesn't keep you up for the rest of the week.

How is that not hostile no matter your neurodiversity?

I need detailed advice on how and what to say to ask her out, as this feels like my only shot, and I really don’t want to blow it.

  
P.S I might be wrong but she is completely different from every other girl it's something so unique and different about her

Should I upgrade my 1 year old Encore to M2 burrs, or sell it and buy new grinder? If new, which one?

In theory I have no budget, but in reality I’d like to spend no more than $2-300 on improving my grind. I did the calibration on the Encore, but it still is not fine enough, and I regret returning the Breville my husband got a year ago because “I won’t get into espresso anytime soon” (ha!).

So…

I’m faced with two options:
1. Buy the burr replacement for the Encore ($60) and possibly STILL not be satisfied with the grind.
2. Sell the Encore for $50-75 and put that towards a new grinder. 

Girl math says that I just net $100-130 towards a new grinder, so I comfortably am willing to spend up to $300 if I get a new one (if it’s seriously worth it). 

My only other requirements would be that it could grind coffee for drip/pour over/ French press, and has a relatively small footprint (similar to the encore).

My own research has me looking at the Mazzer Lux D, as well as Brevilles line of grinder. I don’t need a ton of frills, just a consistent and fine grind.

Also interested in some of the grinders that allow you to set the basket down or have space for a scale under the shute.

She didn’t really respond back but said I’m sure  we’ll see each other again. I messaged her a couple days later saying it was nice to see her and brought back fond memories and asked if she wanted to grab dinner.

There was no drama, no big break up, he even asked me to stay friends because it was rare to meet people you have a real spark with, but I needed some space after what happened. All very amicable. Anyway we really got on in terms of conversation and I figured I'd reach out last month just asking if he still wanted to be friends, no pressure: he's smart and funny and I have loads of platonic friends. He replied immediately saying yes, he hoped I was doing well, and we should have a coffee when he's in town so I can fill him in with what's been happening in town. 

I said 'sure, sounds good. :)': no flirting, kisses, nothing. Anyway I didn't hear from him for about three weeks so I texted again saying ""hey just letting you know I'm away for the last week of November, but I'm otherwise free, let me know!"" (again, no flirting at all). I swear that's all I texted: not loads and loads of messages. He replied saying: ""Hi Suse, It's time to move on. I have a girlfriend. No more communication. Have a great life."" 

I was stunned and really surprised because I hadn't said anything flirty or even pestered him. Did I do something wrong? What changed his mind? I don't understand the u-turn at all.

My mother, Carrie has never gotten along with James. She has made comments directly in front of him saying how she wishes he were black or taller. (I’m biracial, my mom is white and my dad is black  this’ll be important later) I have always been the one to tell her she was rude or make snide comments back, James has always remained quiet or would sometimes just leave the room instead of arguing. Well, in the beginning of June my mother asked if I would give her $300 (She asks for money a lot, and never pays it back.) It was around the beginning of the month, and I have my own bills due. I probably could have given it to her, but that would have put my family in a tight spot, so instead I told her that I didn’t have it at the moment. I didn’t think she was upset, but a few days later she posted on Facebook “Maybe if I were an unhinged drug addict I would get some money.” This was a shot at James Mom, Becca who I’ve never loaned money to and who also has a crap ton of money so ??? Becca is an ex-addict who is now 37 years clean. It obviously pssed off James, but we had told my mother earlier that week she could watch our daughter that weekend and decided that it would still be okay for her to go over there.  Well, we dropped her off Friday night and picked her up Saturday afternoon. James chose to stay in the car while I went inside to grab Allison, he was still upset and didn’t want to speak with her. As I was putting Allison into the car my mother came outside and walked towards the car shouting at James “We need to talk!!! I know you’re mad at me but you need to understand why I did it!” I quickly got into the front seat while shouting at my mother “No, not right now! Allison is right in the back seat! This is not the time, JAMES drive!” James started the car, but by that time my mother was already standing at the passenger seat window. She leaned into the window and repeated, “We need to talk!” James sighed and said, “Yeah you’re right we do need to talk. We need to talk about how you treat me.” My mother started slapping her hands together saying, “I  POSTED THAT BEC-“ James interrupted her and said “Because you needed money.” My mom started screaming honestly it was so loud idk what she said, but James said “No, No, no, you’re rude to me all the time telling me how I’m not good enough for your daughter, you make fun of me for being a construction worker but the moment you need something fixed you’re fake with me and now I’m you’re best friend.” My mom then started to punch the car screaming “I’m fake mfer! I’m fake?!” James started screaming “Get the F- off my car! I’m leaving!” He then shifted gear to reverse but never let his foot off the brakes so we didn’t move. My mom grabbed the door and said “You ain’t going no where!” James jerked the car and said, “Get the F off I’m leaving.” My mother who is about 375lbs attempts to jump through my window to hit him, she couldn’t reach so instead she grabbed the two large coffees we had gotten on the way the there, and threw them around the car. One of the coffees hit Allison on the head she was 10 months at the time, and the other hit James. My mother then hopped out of the window, opened my door climbed across my lap and started punching James. My older sister ran over to the drivers side and started punching and hitting James with her keys through the driver window. While James was trying to get them off of him the car started to roll backwards, it went back about 10 feet before I grabbed the gear stick and put it in park. I looked down to see my mother on the ground holding the car screaming, “Drag me mfer! Do it! Drag me btch!” She jumped up and tried to hop back in the car, I slammed the door shut and James drove off.  When my mother found out she couldn’t press charges on James for her falling, she got on Facebook and took a picture of James she found online and titled it “Warning local PED”. She then posted private mental health information of mine, and making it seem like I was too mentally unstable to be around my daughter. She then called multiple friends, family members and my job told them I was on drgs, I was getting beaten by James, and told them how she thinks I lied about getting SA by my Stepdad for 4 years. She threatened to fight me, and while I was pregnant tried to jump me with my older sister and her friend (I miscarried a few days later, I was never hit I stayed inside and called the police) She called the police and told them she believes James is holding me hostage in our house, and also called Social Services on me 3 times. She made up lies saying I was giving my daughter edibles to help her sleep, and that James and I were always high. She also said that when my daughter was 6 months old she had gotten ahold of a bag of coke and oded. She also said James called her the N Hard R word Snd told people he was racist. A lot of Wild sht, both James and I get drug tested at our jobs, hell I’m a federal employee! Now that she is done lying and ready to see Allison again she is trying to act like nothing happened. She won’t apologize, told me James isn’t allowed in her house, and said allison getting hit in the head with a coffee was James fault. No accountability, no apology nothing. I told her that I wanted an apology, we would need to speak in a public setting, and Allison isn’t allowed to be around her without one of us there. she has tried isolating me from my family, having my siblings not speak to me, now she is trying to guilt me. I’m not budging and this is the first time I’ve ever actually stuck with a boundary I’ve set, so her reaction has been dramatic. ",3,1727976303.0,AITAH,4,0.8,False

1fvd1gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/trektalk/comments/1fvd1gi/book_review_trekmovie_nana_visitors_expansive_new/,"[Book Review] TrekMovie: ""Nana Visitor’s expansive new book exploring the female characters and experiences of women who worked on Star Trek in front of and behind the camera is out. It’s almost a disservice that this is a coffee table-style book. It’s large and heavy with glossy pages, ...."" ","""and while the beauty treatment is deserved, it’s almost a contradiction to the type of book it actually is. [...]

Then again, that’s partly what the book is about anyway: what happens beneath the pretty packaging. Nana Visitor has taken a deep dive into a fascinating, underserved subject and gone where no one has gone before—you knew I was going to say it at some point—to take a look at the history of women in Star Trek, both from a fictional and real-world perspective. 

She approaches this momentous task with a balance of research, context, and personal experiences, seamlessly weaving them all together to paint a full, rich picture…. or rather, multiple pictures, because another part of the takeaway is that everyone is different, and Visitor has respect for each and every story she’s been told. She thoughtfully sets the stage for each interview, reminding readers of what was happening in the world, what prevailing attitudes were towards women and gender, and where Hollywood was, women-wise, at the time.

Visitor didn’t take the easy way out on this one. She could’ve written a book about inspirational Star Trek women and filled it with uplifting stories, which was the original idea. Instead, she pulls back the curtain on Star Trek both onscreen and off, trying to chart the progression (or regression, in some cases) of the portrayal of female characters and then going behind the scenes to find out experience of the women playing them.

Sometimes the stories of conducting the interviews are just as important as the conversations themselves. With the three female cast members of The Original Series gone, she invited a group of TOS guest stars to her home to talk, along with Voyager‘s Irene Tsu (who, I learned from this book, used to date Frank Sinatra; who knew?). Because Visitor describes the gathering and her guests’ general reluctance to dig into the topic, the reader gets a more holistic view of how complex and layered their stories are.

[...]

In addition to actresses, Visitor also spoke to women who wrote for the different shows (including Voyager co-creator Jeri Taylor) and, with exactly the right touch and in exactly the right amount, some of the men who could provide additional information, insight, and—most importantly, perhaps—hindsight. Brannon Braga talks about the kind of feminist work Kate Mulgrew was doing during Voyager‘s filming and admits there should have been a lot more communication with the cast when Jeri Ryan was hired, which would have saved everybody a lot of misery.

She also speaks to women who were influenced by Star Trek, including their comments throughout and then devoting a section at the end of the book to them to illustrate just how important this franchise has been to the world. And her exploration of it includes women from the new Star Trek Universe TV era too: Strange New Worlds, Discovery, and Lower Decks are all represented (with Gates there for Picard). The fact that Visitor wasn’t able to get to absolutely everybody (like Rebecca Romijn, Michelle Hurd, Linda Park, Celia Rose Gooding, Alice Eve, Zoë Saldaña, and more) means that we’ll see more from her in the future, or at least that’s my hope.

All of the stories told in these pages will stir emotional responses: sympathy and outrage, compassion and frustration, love and dismay, and it’s easy to imagine the author being similarly stirred as she researched and wrote. The book will stimulate your thinking about our roles and how we all fit (or don’t fit) into society far beyond Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Star Trek fans will get the behind-the-scenes details they want, but I don’t think you have to be a Star Trek fan to find this book impossible to put down and lead you to  think deeply about both the individual and collective experiences within no matter what your background or gender. On a personal level, this is the book I’ve been waiting to read my whole life, and my brain hasn’t stopped spinning since I did so. [...]""

13 years ago 7 different antibiotics taken against a chronic bronchitis (which was eventually cured by an asthma enhaler) destroyed my intestinal flora. I was a dumb kid and nobody told me about probiotics, so I lived with terrible gas bloating for around 7 years.

Then, I moved out from home into a very old appartment. I was used to drinking tab water (where I live, it is safe to do so... usually). I drank big amounts of tab water against the bloating. Well... something with this old house's  tab water was not ok. Not at all. Bloating got a new companion: nausea. This miraculously went away when I left for a holiday (and did not drink the godforsaken water). I suffered through it for around 6 months until I noticed a reddish film growing in one of my (cleaned) glass bottles. I started buying water and, for the first time, took a probiotic. It worked. Great. With the blloating gone, I drank less. Much less. Around 1 year later I started developing reflux. My whole esophagus was on fire. PPIs did nothing, so I turned to my doc. Got a gastroscopy done - nothing. Not even the feared h.pylori. However, he pointed me towards drinking more, which I did and it worked. For the past few years I was mostly fine, only getting reflux when not drinking enough water. But something has changed. My stomach started burning lately. The symptoms match a gastritis according to my doc. I eat home cooked foods, low processed, lots of veggies, hardly any alcohol, one small cup of coffee in the morning. I have made tests for fructosis/ lactosis intolerance - both fine. I work out a fair bit. I just do not see any cause for this new development. I stopped the probiotic a while ago (around 1 year)... maybe I should use it again.

For years I have been stumbeling from one issue into another.

For about a year I took collagen, glucosamine and msm to help an injured knee in the healing process. I  stopped around 6 months ago and I am wondering whether I should probably start taking these supplements again. If anyone has pointers on what to do/ which supplements can help, I am all ears.

  
edit: I forgot to mention: The burning sensation gets worse when I lie back/ lean back. Sleeping on my stomach makes it much better. I am wondering whether it can be related to muscel tension in the upper abdomen.",1,1727975888.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

The guy that see on the bus everyday, a barista that makes your coffee, the cashier at the grocery store, your dentist even? Everyone has a story.

“sonder- the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”- The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows

I started sonder stories because I love the concept of sonder. To us it’s the guy on the bus every day, but to him we’re the stranger that gets on everyday two stops after his, the person that makes the same coffee order every morning, the person buying pickles at the grocery store, and a 2:30 appointment for a teeth cleaning. All of these people have a life just as complex as your own, where did they grow up? what were their parents like? what was the dream job as a child? what are they most afraid of? Everyone has a story, so what’s yours? 

I’m looking for any stories I can post on my TikTok and instagram, whether it’s your whole life story or just what you ate for breakfast, any story is appreciated.

My dad died in 2019. He had a massive heart attack while walking across the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. I honestly think he was fine before he even hit the floor. 

I’m not completely certain of the time, probably about 6:30 am. His wife called the ambulance who directed her to do CPR. It’s a very rural community so I estimate at least 10-15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive. When they did, they intubated Dad and worked on him until they reached the hospital (another 15 minutes away), where he was pronounced dead. 

I received the phone call from his wife a little after 7 and made it to the hospital before 8. Dad had been placed in a room with a small sitting room attached for family to visit. Dad was cold when I arrived. No machines were attached. He was lying on the bed naked under the blankets and was still intubated. 

His wife was a mess, so I began calling family members, including my children. I also asked the hospital to please remove the tubes. I was informed that they couldn’t because Dad indicated on his drivers license that he wanted to be an organ donor. 

His wife hemmed and hawed on it. I explained to the hospital that my dad’s brother had died of Kreutzfeldt-Jacob syndrome. None of us could even donate blood so I wasn’t sure if his organs would be considered viable. 

I was told that the coroner pronounced Dad’s death to be natural (the coroner did so over the phone without seeing my dad). I asked again for the tubes to be removed so that my kids didn’t have to see him that way. I was told no, because of possible organ donation. 

We all sat in that sitting room until after 2 pm waiting for all family to arrive. Dad had started to go into rigor by that time. The funeral director finally arrived. Organ donation was mentioned again, and his wife refused to allow it. Dad was taken to the funeral home for cremation, and my last memory is of him with those huge tubes in his mouth. 

I’m sorry this is so terribly long, but my question is: were Dad’s organs even harvestable after lying dead for 7 hours? Why did they refuse to remove the tubes for us? This has been hurting me for so long. I need to know if I can let it go. ",7,1727975557.0,askfuneraldirectors,9,0.89,False
1fvctn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1fvctn6/need_help_losing_weight_on_busy_schedule/,Need help losing weight on busy schedule?,"Hi! I'm a 32 y/o female, 5'3, and I have PCOS, insulin resistance, and I donate plasma twice a week. I would really love some advice on how to realistically lose weight as a busy person (my goal is to eventually lose 100lbs, but I want lose weight slowly and permanently rather than do a fad that sheds it for a month or two).  
  
Since I started donating plasma (a little over a month ago) I've been eating a lot of protein-dense salads, my water intake has gone up, my coffee intake has gone down, and my meals have been well regulated. I'm not necessarily calorie counting, just making sure my macros are met and not eating when I'm full. While these changes are positively affecting my health, my weight unfortunately is still steady.  
  
I know that the next step is exercising, and I get some cardio walking my 8 month-old puppy every day, but a big factor that's stopping me from establishing a proper routine is **time**. Factoring in my job (approx. 50hrs a week at a desk), my dog, sleep, donations, time for meal prep, and having a social life, I have about maybe 6 hours a week total to properly exercise, and I'm not sure where to start. My condo complex has a gym, but it's very bare-bones and the walking machines and bicycles are ALWAYS taken, so what's left is usually weights, which I can't really use while I donate plasma otherwise I risk tearing my donating vein.

I'm also really worried about my PCOS & insulin resistance. It's so hard to lose weight with both conditions, and I'm kind of scared that I might accidentally *gain* weight instead. I also want to make it clear that I'm not in a position to stop donating plasma right now, as the money I make from donating is helping me to pay off loans while the cost of living keeps going up. I'll be able to stop once my loans are gone, or when the cost of living goes down.

Any advice would be appreciated!! Thank you <3",0,1727975549.0,WeightLossAdvice,9,0.5,False

1fvcsxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1fvcsxv/im_so_sad_and_hurt/,I’m so sad and hurt. ,"The past year has been the biggest roller coaster of my life.

And also the most lonely for me and my fiancé.

I thought I had friends. I do not. We have a marriage planned for the end of this month. Not a wedding, just us getting married. 

I had ideas and everything, but I haven’t talked to anyone I asked to be in the “wedding” for about six months. 

Nobody reached out. Nobody asked. They say things in passing if I mention it but it’s been months since that has even happened.

Me and my fiancé both come from really toxic family’s who have told us they hope we die. So we have no family. 

He moved 1500 miles and doesn’t know anyone.

We only have each other.

The last few months have been hard on my friends. They have asked me for help and I have been there for my friends and their kids.

All of my friends have been going through their own relationship problems. So I think I just haven’t taken that into consideration.

At this point we don’t have anyone showing interest. I asked on FB for addresses for invitations and three people responded…..

I cried the whole time I even made my registry. I only put things under $20 on there. Just cheap little things we haven’t gotten yet. Like a mop or measuring cups.

We didn’t even make any invitations because we didn’t have anyone to give them to. 

We feel so alone. And so depressed. We don’t have kids, so this is the one moment we really had to share with people. And nobody wants to be apart of it. Nobody cares. 

If I would have taken the last six months to only focus on me and my fiancé, we could have had a honey moon maybe. I really messed this year up. 

I drove over 30 minutes each way to help my friends and their kids as they needed to go places and pick up things or whatever it was. As long as you let me know a day before I can make it work. I took off work and didn’t not want or ask for anything in return. 

I really was hoping for a little get together. I asked to get coffee and meet up. I invited them to my new home with all the new furniture. It’s kid friendly. 

I even told them if they needed somewhere to go they could always come here with their kids as well. I have places for them to sleep and an extra two bedrooms and bathroom.



I have never in my life felt so alone. I asked on Facebook how to even get married. I have nobody to talk to. Everyone is busy. And I’m really starting to see that I’m the last resort friend. That is the most lonely thing ever I think. To be the last person someone calls because all their other friends were busy. 

I feel so stupid for thinking that I was going to be someone’s best friend. That maybe for once I could be that friend to someone. But I’m not. I’m just the background friend. I’m there for when people feel lonely. I’m there when they need a hand or food or a ride or a place to stay. 

But I’m not the fun or cool person. I don’t get invited anywhere. Nobody tells me happy birthday. Nobody gets me a gift. I have tried to throw a party before and when I showed up nobody even knew…..

I can’t even begin to describe how lonely and depressed I am right now. I have been crying for two days so I’m sorry if this is all out of order. I’m in such a bad place and it’s supposed to be a happy time. 

I just hate myself right now. I swear I tried. I did everything I could to be there for my friends. I just wanted to get coffee one day to talk about my life. We had been talking about theirs for a while, I really wanted their opinions. 



I have my outfit and stuff. That’s all I got. I really like it and it makes me feel pretty. And it was super cheap cause I ordered it off one of those apps. So we have that. We are getting married on Halloween. I think they will have people at the court house who can witness it for us. I am happy to be marrying my fiancé. He’s my best friend. And I am his. We only have each other right now and I know one day we will find friends who genuinely like us. Maybe right now is a bad time. 

I’m sorry I just needed to vent. I tried to on other social media but some people got mad at me. The people who got mad at me are not the people I am even talking about. So that was interesting. 

I lost my mom and dad at the same time. Now my friends. My home. Everything. We are rebuilding our own things now. But it still hurts. This year has been filled with hurt. I’m determined to move on. But it’s just not easy. All I can do right now is cry. ",1,1727975497.0,lonely,5,0.67,False
1fvcst0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1fvcst0/no_one_believes_i_love_my_wife_or_she_loves_me/,No one believes I love my wife - or she loves me (AKA I married my dream girl),"When I was younger (25) I met a woman that I truly loved, but to be completely frank, was not my ideal. We had big religious differences (she was devout and I was on a ""Christmas Only"" schedule) and different life goals (she wanted to live in the suburbs and I in a big city). 

As we grew up, we just grew further apart. My ex-wife made a lot of sacrifices for me. A lot. I will never discount those or discredit those. I was working long hours and taking long business trips. My wife was a SAHM and I can attest to the fact that she has the hardest job on the planet. 

The assumption from everyone, I assume including her, is that I had extra marital relations during this time, I can say with my hand on a bible that I never touched another woman during the entirety of our marriage - okay, maybe a shoulder bump here and there but you get what I mean. I will be transparent and say that there were moments of women hitting on me in bars that I indulged in the attention for a few minutes, but always ultimately told them ""thank you for the flattery, but I am married."" 

I come home from China two days early to surprise my first wife, flowers and everything, and see her in bed with another man. That feeling is unmatched, everything boiled up inside of me. Insecurity, guilt, shame - I blamed myself. 

We did couples therapy for a year, but I still felt as though I was floating away from her, like I was flushing 25 years down the drain. During that year, one of the companies I founded IPOed, my ""new worth"" went from 1-2 million to multiple hundred million literally overnight. For another year, I tried to make things work, but every time I hugged her, I felt as though I could smell another man on her, so one day, I sat her down and told her I was buying a place in Boston. Not divorcing, just taking some space. 

That was the honest-to-God intention. Maybe some part of me wanted her to pull the divorce cord then, I felt like I could not leave her -- I justified that at this point I had no reason -- she had to be the one. 

Boston: 

I am living in Boston for about six months. I see my wife on the weekends, sometimes. Work is good, consistent. It kept me sane after the discovery, so I decided to keep at it, despite not really needing to. 

I am in a coffee shop when some girl stomps up to me 

""What do you think you're reading?"" She says, this playful tone about her. Confused, I tell her the title of the book ""that is supposed to be MY favorite book"" she says, a playful grin on her face. I was stunned. The most beautiful woman I have ever seen and she was talking to me. I stumbled, spilled coffee on her. 

The rest is history. I went on dates with her, learned about her, she had to go away for some time and the entire time, we texted and called -- the flame never died. I felt like I was in high school gain. The more I learned about this girl, the more I fell in love. Her worst qualities are still some of my favorite bits about her. They feel like little secrets only I know. 

We have been married now for five years. Our ""private"" life is amazing. I wake up everyday excited to be with my best friend, I no longer feel that I need to work for my anchor, but just that I need her. I am ashamed to say that I never felt this way about my first wife. 

I never knew someone could take the breath out of you the way she can still do it to me. If I were to have written out my list for my dream girl, she would check every box and then some. 

Before her, I believed ""we are adults, fairytales do not exist, everyone compromises."" People who have been married as long as I had been know that half a decade is still somewhat ""honeymooning"" -- but I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that I met my soulmate. She is my end and my beginning. 

Why does no one believe that she loves me? 

Well, I met her 3 months before I filed for divorce. Yes, it was related, no it was not ""for"" her. 

She is also 33 and I am 63, and my daughter is 34 - no, I do not see her as my daughter, yes I love them differently. 

It is frustrating to answer all the same questions again over and over. Maybe that is the compromise. I am tired of having to ""prove"" my love for someone - not even to her, but to the rest of the world. My wife, beautifully accomplished in her own right, constantly gets called a gold digger (despite her being unaware of my income prior to me telling her many months in). 

Theres no fixing this, and this is more a shout into the void more than anything. ",0,1727975488.0,Marriage,2,0.5,False
1fvcsna,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fvcsna/upgrade_from_gcp_to_dual_boiler_2000/,Upgrade from GCP to Dual boiler [$2000],"I’ve had my Gaggia Classic Pro and Sette 270 going on 5 years and they have been rock solid for me. Just recently added the Barista Gadgets PID and have noticed significant improvement in my shots. That said, the steam power has always been lacking with the Gaggia and seems to be worse since installing the PID. I generally make 2 capps each for my wife and I daily with occasional straight shots or americanos. For milk drinks I really struggle to get good milk texture, taking almost 2 minutes just to get the milk to temp. I usually pull back to back shots, then steam milk for both our drinks.

So with this in mind, I’ve been looking at an upgrade for some time and have been debating between the Silvia Pro X or Profitec Pro 600. Love the build quality of both but leaning toward the PP600 for the joysticks and lever, but I have a small coffee corner and not sure it will fit comfortably (plus the obvious price difference). However, I recently stumbled upon the refurb Lucca M58 from Clive Coffee and it checks all the boxes, but know nothing about the machine. A barista friend of mine let me tool around behind the bar on a La Marzocco Strada and I was completely blown away with the steam power. He has a strong bias toward the Silvia Pro X since it’s a commercial brand but I am really just looking for the right machine to suit my needs. I probably won’t plumb the machine right away but like having the option since we plan to remodel our kitchen in the next few years and I could plumb it and hook up a drain line down the road.

I know this sub has a strong bias toward ECM and Profitec, rightly so, but curious to hear from those who have had hands on experience with these machines.

First of all - thanks for all the tips related to Airlink - it was much faster (and cheaper!) to use it.

I'm in Bangkok for two days now and this place is way, way too loud, too busy for me - it is just not for me and I'm fine with that.

First of all flying there is expensive and it looks like it is a place with a crazy nightlife while I'm looking for a place where I can walk in peace, sit down and relax, go for a coffee and so on.

Also I have to do a bit of work from 14.10 to 28.10 and finding a cheaper place to stay for that time would be good.

Whether you’re a frequent flyer, a weekend adventurer, or someone planning their next big trip, mastering the art of smart backpack packing is essential. With the right strategy, you can maximize your space, stay organized, and reduce stress throughout your journey. In this article, I’ll share my favorite tips for saving space and keeping your items orderly, all while highlighting the best travel backpack options for different needs.

When packing smart, the ultimate goal is to fit all your essentials in a well-designed travel backpack without feeling overloaded. From organizing your clothes to selecting the right backpack, we’ll cover every aspect to help you prepare for your next trip.

# Why a Travel Backpack is the Best Option

Before diving into packing techniques, let’s take a moment to appreciate why a travel backpack is such an excellent choice for various travel needs.

# 1. Hands-Free Convenience

When using a travel backpack, your hands are free to navigate the airport, hold onto a coffee, or take a few photos on your phone. Unlike suitcases, backpacks allow you to move through crowds without dragging anything behind you, making them a top pick for city travelers and outdoor adventurers alike.

# 2. Flexibility in Tight Spaces

One of the biggest advantages of a backpack is its ability to squeeze into tight spaces. Whether you’re hopping on public transportation or stowing your bag in an overhead bin, a compact **best travel backpack** will fit easily, reducing the hassle of finding storage.

# 3. A Place for Everything

Many **travel backpacks** are thoughtfully designed with a wide range of compartments and pockets. This makes it easier to stay organized, even when packing for longer trips. You can separate your clothes from your toiletries, electronics, and even travel documents, ensuring everything is easy to find.

  
The [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-travel-pack.html) is one of the most popular choices for those seeking a sleek and spacious design with numerous compartments. Its versatility makes it the perfect all-rounder for long-term travel or quick weekend getaways.

# Tip 1: Start with a Packing List

The first step to smart packing is creating a detailed list of everything you need to bring. This will help you avoid over-packing, which is one of the main causes of wasted space in your **travel backpack**. It’s easy to overestimate what you’ll need when traveling, but a concise packing list will keep you on track and ensure that every item in your backpack serves a purpose.

# Break Your List into Categories:

* **Clothing**: Pack based on your itinerary and the weather forecast for your destination. Bring versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched.
* **Toiletries**: Bring only the essentials in travel-sized containers to save space and avoid going over TSA limits for liquids.
* **Tech Gear**: Bring chargers, adapters, and any necessary electronics, but avoid bringing unnecessary items.
* **Miscellaneous**: Don’t forget important documents, medications, or a small first-aid kit.

  
The [Osprey Farpoint 40](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/osprey-farpoint-40l.html) is ideal for those looking for a **best backpack for travel**. Its 40-liter capacity makes it perfect for those who like to travel light, and its multiple compartments allow for easy organization of your packing list essentials.

# Tip 2: Utilize Packing Cubes for Efficiency

Packing cubes are a game-changer when it comes to saving space and staying organized. These lightweight fabric containers help you group similar items together, making it easier to find what you need without unpacking your entire **travel backpack**.

# Benefits of Packing Cubes:

* **Compression**: Some packing cubes offer compression, which can further minimize the space your clothing takes up.
* **Organization**: You can organize by category—shirts in one cube, pants in another. This helps when looking for specific items during your trip.
* **Easy Accessibility**: No more digging through your entire **best travel backpack** to find that one pair of socks!

# How to Use Packing Cubes:

Start by folding or rolling your clothes (more on that in a minute) and placing them into the cubes by type or day. Label the cubes if necessary. This way, you can grab the exact items you need without disturbing the rest of your belongings.

  
The [BAGAIL 6 Set Packing Cubes](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/bagail-6-set-packing-cubes.html) are lightweight and durable, providing different sizes for easy packing. Their high-quality material makes them a great investment for anyone serious about organized travel.

# Tip 3: Roll, Don’t Fold, Your Clothes

Packing efficiency largely comes down to how you fold your clothes. Rolling your clothes instead of folding them flat is one of the most effective ways to save space in your **best backpack for travel**. It also helps to reduce wrinkles, which is a huge plus, especially if you have limited access to an iron.

# Why Rolling Works:

* **Maximizes Space**: Rolled clothes take up significantly less space than folded ones, allowing you to pack more efficiently.
* **Reduces Wrinkles**: Rolling keeps your clothes smooth and wrinkle-free.
* **Compact**: Rolled items fit neatly into small compartments or packing cubes.

Rolling is particularly useful when paired with packing cubes, which further compress your clothes, making the most of the space inside your **best travel backpack**.

# Tip 4: Choose a Backpack with Multiple Compartments

Organization begins with your backpack itself. A well-designed **travel backpack for women** or **travel backpack for men** should offer multiple compartments to keep your items sorted. When everything has its own place, not only does it help with organization, but it also saves time when you need to find something quickly.

# Important Features to Look For:

* **Dedicated Laptop Sleeve**: If you’re carrying a laptop, a padded sleeve is a must.
* **Quick-Access Pockets**: These are useful for stowing items like your passport, phone, or travel documents.
* **Water Bottle Holder**: A side pocket for your water bottle keeps you hydrated on the go without needing to dig through your bag.
* **Compression Straps**: These straps help reduce the overall size of your packed bag, ensuring you don’t exceed carry-on size limits.

  
The [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-navigator-travel-backpack-32l.html) is ideal for travelers who need plenty of storage and organization features. It comes with RFID-blocking pockets, a cord pass-through for chargers, and durable, water-resistant material, making it the **best backpack for travel** for those who prioritize security and convenience.

# Tip 5: Utilize the Bundle Method for Bulky Items

Even the most organized packers sometimes need to bring bulkier items like sweaters, jackets, or shoes. Instead of packing these items individually, try using the bundle method.

# How to Use the Bundle Method:

1. **Layer Bulky Items**: Start by laying bulkier items (like jackets) flat at the bottom of your **travel backpack**.
2. **Pack Around Smaller Items**: Place smaller, lightweight items (like socks or t-shirts) in the center and wrap the bulky item around them.
3. **Keep it Compact**: This creates a compact “bundle” that takes up less space and prevents bulky items from dominating your backpack’s interior.

# Tip 6: Invest in a Travel Toiletry Bag

A good toiletry bag can make all the difference when packing for a trip. Look for one that is compact, has multiple compartments, and is made from waterproof material to prevent leaks from ruining the rest of your belongings.

# How to Pack Toiletries:

* **Liquids**: Opt for solid alternatives where possible. For example, use a solid shampoo bar instead of a liquid one to avoid spills and TSA restrictions.
* **Compartments**: Use a toiletry bag with multiple sections to keep your items organized. Separate items like toothpaste, soap, and lotions from your makeup or razors.

  
The [Sea to Summit Traveling Light Hanging Toiletry Bag](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/sea-to-summit-travellinglight-hanging.html) is a durable and lightweight option. It features multiple compartments and a hanging hook, making it easy to use in any bathroom.

# Tip 7: Organize Your Electronics

If you’re like most travelers, you probably have at least a few electronics in your backpack—whether it’s your phone, laptop, or camera. Keeping these organized and protected is key to avoiding tangled cords and damaged devices.

# How to Stay Organized:

* **Laptop Sleeve**: Most modern **travel backpacks for men** and women include a dedicated laptop sleeve for extra protection. If your backpack doesn’t, invest in a padded sleeve.
* **Cable Organizers**: Velcro straps or dedicated cord organizers help keep chargers, headphones, and other accessories neat.

# 

Packing smart can transform your travel experience. The key is to stay organized and maximize the space in your **best backpack for travel**. By using packing cubes, rolling your clothes, and selecting the right **travel backpack for women** or **travel backpack for men**, you can ensure that everything has its place. Plus, investing in smart travel gear—like a [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-navigator-travel-backpack-32l.html), [Osprey Farpoint 40](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/osprey-farpoint-40l.html), or [Sea to Summit Toiletry Bag](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/sea-to-summit-travellinglight-hanging.html)—can help take the stress out of packing.

With these tips, you’re ready to pack efficiently, save space, and stay organized for your next adventure.

I came from a family with congenital heart disease, 4 of us have ICD/ pacemakers and 2 of them with open heart surgery (my mom being one). Two years ago an undiagnosed cousin died from a heart attack, after that the whole family decided to get check. In the past (as teenagers) the doctors had me and my sister check, but they say everything was fine  with us. Well I get checked and they found something abnormal with me, I do used to have symptoms but thought the were just panicking attacks or anxiety. From that moment everything went really fast, I´m a really active person and they just suddenly ask me to stop all forms of activity until the ICD/pacemaker being implanted, they used to call me and ask me to get all the diagnostic imaging as urgent, even calling me to tell me to stop drinking coffee and then the doctors were really cold while giving the diagnosis. After that, I just start panicking at every abnormal heartbeat or other symptom, I didn´t want to be alone, thinking something could happen to me (I live in a different country and have no family around). Well, this year I have my ICD/pacemaker and everything went really great and I do feel the difference, but as I´m trying to do my normal activity and sports, I´m always thinking of what could go wrong, any abnormal beat or just my heartbeat going up during exercise make me panic, I don´t know what to do. 

Does anyone of you know is there a special pshychologist that deal with this kind of things? My life is just starting to get affected by me not being able to deal with my diagnosis. Or does anyone of you had to deal with something similar?

I have now finished my treatment. I rang my best friend of 40 yrs and told her of my diagnosis in May she lives locally a few miles away. Since my diagnosis & and treatment I have seen her face to face 5 times to date, 1st time June 2023 for a coffee, 2nd time she came to my house after my surgery in Aug did not see her until I went to her mother's funeral in Dec 2023, 4th time Feb 2024 went out for a pub lunch, 5th time Aug 2024 she came to my house. She did promise to meet up for a coffee earlier in Aug when she was off but didn't arrange anything, when I asked her why she said she was helping her daughter with her garden, her daughter has just bought a flat. Imbetween the very infrequent face to face meetups we keep in contact by phone every 5 to 6 weeks. She usually asks what I've been doing and if I've been out with my husband if I say yes she responds that's good I've told her I miss our friendship especially after what I have been through but nothing changes. Last Sept whilst I was waiting for oncotype x results to see if I needed chemo (I had told her via,text about this & that the consultant thought the score would be low & chemo not needed) but I was still worried, she decided that she would invite a friend of hers an acquaintance of mine to my 21 yr old daughters 21st birthday party. My daughter invited her and her husband hw could not make it, I told my friend to come on her own, she said she would come. Then I receive a text message asking what time the party started so she could tell this person. I was in a very awkward position stressed about everything so I rang and politely told her the other person was not invited by my daughter it was up to her who she invites. She then said she wouldn't be coming I told her the invitation still stood. On the day of the party she sent a text stating she would not be coming!!! We sort of moved on from this although I am still annoyed with her I have tried to move on.  I am now contemplating either . Gradually end the friendship 2. Try to find out why I have had no support or much contact from her face to face 3. Put up with this as we have been friends for 40 years. When I see groups of ladies out enjoying themselves I think this could be us. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

1fvckzd,https://i.redd.it/p4m49weooksd1.jpeg,[Click] Living on Purpose: Embracing Life's Fullest Potential,"## The Art of Wholehearted Living: Maximizing Your Life's Journey

Life is a precious gift, a canvas waiting to be painted with vibrant experiences and meaningful moments. But what does it truly mean to live life to its fullest? It's about embracing every opportunity that comes our way, pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zones, and constantly seeking growth and self-discovery.

Living life to its fullest means waking up each day with a sense of purpose and passion. It's about setting ambitious goals and relentlessly pursuing them, not letting fear or self-doubt hold us back. Think of people like Malala Yousafzai, who risked everything to fight for education, or Elon Musk, who continually pushes the boundaries of what's possible in technology and space exploration.

When we live life to its fullest, we open ourselves up to a world of benefits. We experience deeper satisfaction, create lasting memories, and leave a positive impact on those around us. It's about finding that sweet spot between work, play, and personal growth – a delicate balance that allows us to thrive in all aspects of our lives.

Taking risks is an essential part of this journey. Remember, every great adventure starts with a single step outside our comfort zone. Whether it's starting a new business, traveling to an unfamiliar country, or simply striking up a conversation with a stranger, these experiences shape us and add richness to our lives.

Connections and relationships play a crucial role in living life to its fullest. Surrounding ourselves with supportive, inspiring people can elevate our experiences and push us to be our best selves. These bonds provide a safety net that allows us to take bigger risks and dream even bigger dreams.

Mindfulness and gratitude are powerful tools in our quest to live life fully. By staying present and appreciating the little things, we can find joy in everyday moments. It's about savoring that first sip of morning coffee, marveling at a beautiful sunset, or feeling grateful for good health and loving relationships.

Living life to its fullest isn't always easy. It requires courage, persistence, and a willingness to learn from both successes and failures. But the rewards are immeasurable. When we look back on our lives, we won't regret the chances we took or the adventures we embarked upon. We'll regret the opportunities we let slip by.

So, let's embrace each day with enthusiasm and purpose. Let's push our boundaries, nurture meaningful relationships, and approach life with a sense of wonder and gratitude. Because in the end, a life lived to its fullest is a life well-lived – a tapestry of experiences, growth, and joy that we can look back on with pride and satisfaction.

1fvckw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1fvckw8/anxiety_about_contact_from_nc_bpd_mother/,Anxiety about contact from NC BPD Mother,"Hello! Been lurking for over a month, and this is my first post. I'll try to keep this background info short(ish):

I've (37/f) had a contentious relationship with my dBPD mother all of my life. She and my dad divorced about 5 years ago, and now she lives in the same city as me, and he and my GC sister live about 5 hours away. I mistakenly believed my mother was actually diagnosed Bipolar, and she has had 4 su!cide attempts in my lifetime - none in the past 10 years. I did not learn until about two months ago (from my dad) that I had the diagnosis wrong, and that she was actually diagnosed BPD. No treatment other than depression/sleep medication as she is pretty vehemently resistant to any therapy.

A couple years ago, I survived a DV incident and moved in with her for a couple months, as I needed somewhere to go. I was already traumatized by that experience, and she made it absolute hell on earth - picking fights, blaming me for ""putting \*her\* through this"", screaming at me, and even the on-brand car attack (driving erratically, trying to hit me while driving... when I had just recently survived a DV assault). After I left her house, I thought things had gotten better for us. I wanted to put that whole time period behind me, so I tried to forget how awful she had treated me and moved forward. I would typically make time to visit her once a week or every other week. She is much closer with my GC sister, but like I said, my sister lives states away.

In August, some of her texts to me seemed a little odd, but I thought I maybe was just reading into them. I mentioned this to my dad, and he told my GC sister. As I would come to find out, GC sister then told all of this to my mom. My mom suddenly gave me the cold shoulder and was very abrupt in her texts, so I knew something was up, but also my feelings were a bit hurt. After about 2 weeks, she invited me to come over because she wanted to talk. I got to her house, she starts off by saying I had upset her but ""she thought there was an easy solution."" I said, ok great, I would also like space to talk about my feelings too. She responds with ""Well I don't want to sit here for an hour."" Long story short - she demanded I never speak to my dad about her, and when I told her I felt that was not her call, she launched into screaming me about how horrible I am to her and my sister, how much I put her though when I lived with her, how I'm always the victim, and plenty of other terrible things. At one point she got up and I thought she was going to throw a coffee cup at me, but I firmly said ""Don't you pick that up."" She said she did not want to see me for a long time, so I got up and left.

That was mid-August, and we have not spoken since. She has unfriended me from her social media. Luckily, shortly after that visit, I found this sub. I felt very validated reading many of our shared experiences. I had already been seeing a therapist, and telling her about my mom's diagnosis has helped us in working through childhood trauma (definitely physical and emotional abuse - nearly always when my dad wasn't home). I have found our mutual NC very peaceful, and I plan on continuing it.

However, my birthday is next week, and I am starting to feel very anxious as I am concerned she will try to contact me in some way. I don't know how I would respond, because part of me is concerned with her reaction should I reject her, even though my dad said he was told by her last psychiatrist after her last \*attempt\* that they were attention-seeking and not serious efforts. If she does try to reach out, it will likely be through text or email. All I know is I feel much more at peace without her in my life. Looking for guidance/advice for anyone who's experienced similar feelings.

Tl/dr: Newly NC with my dBPD, but feeling anxious that she will reach out to me for my birthday next week, and I don't want to reinstate contact.

Are you tired of the same old morning routine? Want to start your day off right with a delicious cup of coffee in the comfort of your own home? Look no further! In this article, we'll explore the ultimate guide to creating a stunning coffee bar in your home, complete with inspiring ideas, practical tips, and expert advice.



# Why a Coffee Bar at Home?

In recent years, the trend of having a coffee bar at home has gained immense popularity. And for good reason! Not only does it provide a cozy and inviting space to enjoy your favorite coffee drinks, but it also adds a touch of sophistication to any room. According to a survey by the National Coffee Association, 68% of Americans drink coffee every day, with 44% of them brewing their coffee at home. With a coffee bar at home, you can take your coffee game to the next level and create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for family and friends.



# Choosing the Perfect Location

When embarking on the design of your coffee bar, selecting the ideal location is a crucial first step. Various factors should be taken into account to ensure the success of your coffee bar setup:



**Traffic flow:** Opt for a location with high foot traffic, such as the kitchen or living room, to naturally attract people and create a social hub around your coffee bar.

**Lighting:** Adequate lighting is essential to showcase your coffee bar's aesthetics, including the coffee makers, cups, and accessories. Consider incorporating both natural and artificial light sources to create an inviting ambiance.

**Electrical outlets:** Placing your coffee bar near electrical outlets is essential for the seamless operation of your coffee-making equipment. This ensures that your coffee makers, grinders, and other appliances are conveniently powered and easily accessible for use.

By carefully considering these factors, you can design a coffee bar that not only looks visually appealing but also functions efficiently to enhance the overall coffee-drinking experience for yourself and your guests.



# Coffee Bar Essentials

Now that you've chosen the perfect location, it's time to think about the essentials. Here are the must-haves for any coffee bar:

**Coffee maker**: Invest in a high-quality coffee maker that suits your needs, such as a drip brewer, French press, or espresso machine.

**Coffee beans**: Store your coffee beans in an airtight container to preserve freshness and flavor.

**Mugs and cups**: Display your favorite mugs and cups on a decorative shelf or in a cabinet.

Sugar, creamer, and syrup: Keep your coffee bar stocked with sugar, creamer, and syrup to cater to different tastes.

# Designing Your Coffee Bar

Now it's time to get creative! Here are some inspiring coffee bar ideas to get you started:

**Rustic charm**: Create a cozy atmosphere with reclaimed wood, vintage signs, and warm lighting.

**Modern chic**: Opt for a sleek and modern design with a minimalist color palette, stainless steel appliances, and a geometric backsplash.

**Farmhouse style**: Bring the outdoors in with a farmhouse-style coffee bar featuring natural materials, vintage decor, and plenty of greenery.





# Expert Tips and Tricks



To take your coffee bar to the next level, consider the following expert tips and tricks:

**Invest in a coffee grinder**: Freshly grind your coffee beans for optimal flavor and aroma.

**Use a coffee scale****:** Measure your coffee and water with precision to achieve the perfect brew.

**Experiment with flavours****:** Try new coffee flavours and recipes to keep your coffee game strong.



# Common Questions and Concerns



We understand that setting up your coffee station can raise some questions and concerns. Let's dive deeper into some of the most common ones:



**How much space do I need?**: When planning your coffee station, it's essential to allocate a minimum of 2-3 feet of counter space. This will ensure there's enough room for your coffee maker, mugs, and other accessories without feeling cramped.



**What's the best coffee maker for me?**: Choosing the right coffee maker can be a daunting task. Factors to consider include your budget, coffee preferences (such as drip, espresso, or French press), and the number of people you typically brew for. Understanding these factors will help you narrow down the options and find the perfect coffee maker for your needs.



**How do I keep my coffee bar organized?**: Keeping your coffee bar organized is key to a stress-free brewing experience. Utilize baskets, bins, and shelves to store your coffee essentials neatly. Consider designating specific areas for different items, such as a section for mugs, a shelf for coffee beans, and a bin for filters. This organizational approach will not only keep your coffee bar clutter-free but also make it visually appealing and functional.

I just had our son six months ago and we both started attending small group. He goes at the same time as I do, but I bring my son because I breastfeed. 

I greet on Sundays and an incident happened while greeting. My husband had bought me some coffee and asked me to hold his as well while he finds something for my son in my bag. As I’m saying good morning to people I see a lady whispering to another lady and pointing at me. I immediately became red because I didn’t know what was going on. Well long story short I got in trouble for holding coffee in my hands. Apparently that is not allowed despite other greeters doing the same exact thing. For some reason this lady had decided I was the only one breaking the rule. I was never told this and they told me I needed to not have coffee and they embarrassed me in front of people I was greeting. 

I honestly, felt like I was picked out of the group because of this woman not liking me. 

Anyways, I brought up in my small group that something happened on Sunday that really upset me but I didn’t say what, or who with. Just that I was really disappointed and confused. 

I got a call the next morning from the woman on Sunday telling me why she did that and next time come to her about any issues. She was trying to be apologetic and I just told her maybe go about it differently and don’t point out one specific person when other people are doing the same thing. 

Well, she proceeded to tell me that someone from my small group told her and that’s why she called me. I was confused because I didn’t say names or what happened and the lady on Sunday said they knew I was upset but they thought I would get over it and when someone from my small group heard I wasn’t over it they decided to tell the woman from Sunday (I hope that makes sense.) 

I’m really hurt that someone from my small group didn’t just come to me instead of telling someone. Honestly the whole situation has left a really bad taste in my mouth. I no longer want to attend because I’m worried if I say anything people will just tell others about what I’m going through.

Brewing a single origin roast on the lighter side of medium that works really well for espresso, almond/citrus/creamy kind of tasting notes. 

Didn't adjust the grind for the single, just dosed the basket with 9g and pulled the lever. Stopped it at 18g, looked good on the bottomless PF but was very pretty in the cup, less crema than usual and kind of patchy looking. But holy crap, it was delicious. Great texture and a sweet butterscotch kind of finish that I don't think I've ever tasted from that coffee, including the shot I pulled from the same bag at the same ratio an hour before. 

Both the baskets are IMS, 18g Big Bang and 8g Renato. Could be a difference in the basket or how the dose/basket interact but holy shit, it was an outstanding shot from a long time favorite coffee.

So much so it turns out I’ve downloaded over 30 apps over that time and have continued to use them for the same habits until this month.

Husband and I are discussing CICO dieting because neither of us are very healthy right now and part of all of that I decided to start pulling my bank information for how much we had been spending eating each month and the average came out to a horrifying $1750. Now, there were some grocery trips in there ($600) and some nicer eat outs ($140 over three meals) but the grand majority was just fast food, sometimes 2-3 times a day.

It was a little funny because to some extent I looked it up to try to guide my budgeting for healthy food because veggies can be soooo expensive and I at least, a 5’0” female, would want a lot of volume friendly foods for CICO. No. We actually sat down and planned a month of food from the grocery store alone and we could eat so much healthier and spend only $700/ month. And some of that is smarter shopping habits like buying meat and eggs in higher bulk, switching energy drinks for coffee, etc. but this also includes eating a nice steak dinner once a week and stuff like that that we know will keep it enjoyable as well.

I’m just so shocked and impressed. I was recently laid off which has really compounded some of the things I feel bad about in life and to knock two birds out with one stone (eat healthier and work on my budget) is making me feel better already.


TL;DR I was spending almost $1800/mo on food, mostly fast food, and was able to both wildly address my diet and my budget by planning some grocery lists",71,1727974419.0,CICO,23,0.97,False

It did feel great to hear that at the time and I have been putting more efforts to allow myself to feel the butterflies reaction. I have found myself thinking about her multiple times which I doubt is wrong cause hey, I do like her afterall. My friend has said that's a good thing I feel this way. 

However, I have also been feeling really afraid of something going wrong. A feeling that the date might get called off. It makes no sense why that would happen but it still bothers me. This is very much the insecurity I mentioned before in my previous post.

I have been trying to put the advice of occupying my mind with something else to use. Be it via work, checking in on a friend (his mother had a serious health emergency), maybe listening to music. 

I have tried to remind myself that she is also interested in me as confirmed by a friend. I was honest with her about hoping I could have asked her out sooner, about being shy and she called me sweet for this.

I also reminded myself that she clearly mentioned that she is busy relocating, something my friend told me weeks ago since she skipped a party she was also invited to (my friend asked for me). 

Most importantly, I have been reminding myself to trust her. I have really been putting emphasis on this after what happened to the guy from the animal shelter who was seeking advice here, whose relationship ended because he struggled with this. If I cannot trust her now, this problem can resurface in different forms if we do start dating. I don't want to make the same mistake.

I was talking about her saying yes to coffee with my mom that day (she has been mad at me for not sharing much about my life so I share once in a while) and it struck to me that I have never felt secure in the entire process of planning the date.

I have been on 3 dates (2 women) my entire life. All via Tinder and I felt the fear of the person ghosting/unmatching even after saying yes. I have received a yes to a date once from a person I asked out offline which eventually got called off. 

I feel like it is the same fear which is haunting me again even though it makes no sense to me why.

I have been trying my best to not act on these fears. I wish I could stop being afraid of this.

I thus seek advice on the following -

The webshop included that is was a ""DF83 V3"", which they called ""DF83 V2"" a few weeks ago on the same URL.

So I wanted to verify that it really was a V3, and not the V2.

But to verify it, I first need to know what ""V3"" exactly means.

[https://miicoffee.shop/products/miicoffee-df83-coffee-grinder](https://miicoffee.shop/products/miicoffee-df83-coffee-grinder) says about version 3:

>The current version is V3.1 Now it comes with new exit chute design and chute cleaning brush.

>Previous versions:

>**V3 comes with anti-popcorn disc, new bellow and DLC espresso burrs.**

>V2 includes a plasma generator and new declumper.

Notice the inconsistency. ""Version 3"" of [Turinggrinders.com](http://Turinggrinders.com) is the same as ""V2"" from MiiCoffee.shop.

The G-IOTA that I have (which the webshop sold as a ""v3"") does not have the black Anti Popcorn Disc as displayed at [https://portakeeper.com/products/df64-ep-anti-popcorn-disc](https://portakeeper.com/products/df64-ep-anti-popcorn-disc) It does seem to have a plasma generator and modified declumper.

So it looks like the ""Versions"" are not comparable among different rebrands. That's the ugliness of Chinese white label products. They rebrand it and can call it whatever they want. It's even worse. Turinggrinders previously called it ""Version 2"" then they probably noticed that MiiCoffee was using ""Version 3"" so Turinggrinders changed the text from ""Version 2"" to ""Version 3"" while keeping the same changes at version 2:

The guy that see on the bus everyday, a barista that makes your coffee, the cashier at the grocery store, your dentist even? Everyone has a story.

“sonder- the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”- The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows

I started sonder stories because I love the concept of sonder. To us it’s the guy on the bus every day, but to him we’re the stranger that gets on everyday two stops after his, the person that makes the same coffee order every morning, the person buying pickles at the grocery store, and a 2:30 appointment for a teeth cleaning. All of these people have a life just as complex as your own, where did they grow up? what were their parents like? what was the dream job as a child? what are they most afraid of? Everyone has a story, so what’s yours?

**What this app does**

* It connects to your free account on [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and to its API
* You can search for keywords (""bullet shells"", ""lofi kick"", ""lofi snare"", ""cow moo"", ""lighter"", ""piano loop"", etc. - the default keyword if you dont put one yourself is ""foley"") and the app will connect to freesound collection, get a random sound that corresponds to your keyword, and assign it to a pad on the app.
* Additionally you can set a maximum duration for the retrieved samples (defaults to 5 seconds if you dont put anything), so you get mostly shorter sounds if you want.
* You can do this multiple times with the same or different keywords per pad, then trim the sample to your liking (since some samples are long and you may want just a bit of it), and you can preview it using the play button.
* When you are done, you can ""Save Program"" and it will create a folder in your computer including the Akai MPC program (if MPC Live series (One, Live, Key, etc || previous versions untested)), along with the individual samples, trimmed and normalized to max volume.
* You can then copy that folder to your hardware MPC or to the Akai software (i guess) and the kit will be loaded for you, with the sounds assigned to the pads. Now you can further finetune the kit, add fx, etc.
* Here are a couple of quick and dirty videos of the app: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csvy9ALG97s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQfM-oCc5vI)

**Why this is cool (imho)**

* It´s free if you want it to be.
* Most of us have our own samples, mostly drumkits and instrument samples, but getting some extra foley sounds and sound fx can really spice your creativity - it does for me.
* It is a free sound library with +600.000 sounds

**First things third**

* This is a release of the first version of the MPC Program Creator app;
* Download quotas may apply since these are dropbox links;
* The reddit community for this app is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc\_program\_creator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/)
* In case you want to test it i´d ask you to join this community so we can keep in touch regarding its future development, possible new features, release of version 2 (with waveform display, pad deletion, and other new features), and also for me to know who is interested to fuel this.

**Instructions**

* Download the appropriate app below:
* Windows: [Click here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d6fgs00f7bz2t1k2dv76x/MPC_0.9_Program_Editor_WIN_NO_KEY.zip?rlkey=my4e16d2rodomb1iwpqxizlqw&st=slpx1wmg&dl=0)

* Then go to [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and create a free account and login
* Then go [here](https://freesound.org/home/login/?next=/apiv2/apply) to get yourself an API Key (no need to fill anything else)
* Copy that API Key , you will need it in the next step.
* Open the APP, it will ask you for the API Key, put it in.
* Check the brief manual [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/comments/1frkgbk/current_manual/)

**Troubleshooting**

* Windows should work fine.
* Apple (some OS´s) will tell you ""app is broken"" or ""can't open"" etc.:
* First try Right Click + Open
* If that doesn't work, you have to unquarantine the file, follow these instructions:
* Change the app name to just ""mpc"", and place it on your Desktop
* Open ""terminal""
* Write ""cd Desktop"" (or whatever your desktop name is)
* Write ""ls"" (LS in lowercase), and check if [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/) shows on the list
* If it does, write this on your terminal: ""xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/)""
* It should just go to the next terminal line. No worries. App should open now
* If app opens and doesnt allow you to press a pad to download a sample and gives an error:
* Go to settings on your mac,
* Search for ""privacy"" and ""allow full disk access"" to the [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/),
* Since it will try to save samples to your computer, it demands you previously authorize access.

**Kudos**

* This app consumes a lot of my free time. But I don't demand anything in return, however i´d very much appreciate it if:
* You provide me with some feedback (community or PM) on your experience getting it to run, for me and others to see, and maybe with some videos with kits created with this app, it would mean a lot.
* Also, if it doesn't work, let me know via PM or community post, providing your computer OS, your MPC and it's OS, so i can check wtf is going on.
* And if it works, and you really enjoy it and are using it to make kits, I believe you'd buy me a coffee if we met in person. So do that, and buy me a coffee please :) as this will fuel my interest in further developing and supporting it. You can do that on a button inside the app, or [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/redsquares)

**Disclaimer**

* I am not a pro developer, so bugs may happen
* I will use my free time when possible, to address peoples messages and assist them
* Have patience

Ok, that's it for now!

Have fun beatmaking with alien farts!

If youre on a fitness quest and looking for extra support, this might be just what you need.

What I Love About Hydroxycut Hardcore:

* **MAXIMIZE YOUR FIT GAINS**: This formula seriously ramps up my workout sessions. The extreme energy it provides has genuinely pushed me to get the most out of my workouts.
* **SCIENTIFICALLY RESEARCHED**: The key ingredient, **C. Canephora Robusta**, is backed by two scientific studies that show real weight loss results. It makes me feel confident that Im using something effective.
* **DOUBLE THE WEIGHT LOSS**: In those studies, folks who took Hydroxycut lost nearly double what the placebo group did – around **10.95 lbs** vs. **5.40 lbs**. While everyones results may vary, its something to think about if youre serious about shedding extra pounds.
* **EXTREME ENERGY + FOCUS**: With **265 mg** of caffeine anhydrous and **200 mg** of green coffee extract, it gives me the jolt I need to stay focused during workouts and feel energized throughout the day. Goodbye, afternoon slump.
* **SENSORY EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT**: Hydroxycut also contains yohimbe extract, which has added a nice edge to my workouts. It helps me feel more in tune with my body and effort level.

A Few Things to Consider:

* **Can Cause Jitters**: If youre sensitive to caffeine, you might want to ease into it. The energy boost can come with a bit of jitters for some people, especially if taken on an empty stomach.

I'm really impressed with Hydroxycut Hardcore. 

It has provided a significant boost in my workouts and energy levels, which has been fantastic for my fitness journey. If you're looking for a supplement that can help maximize your results, I highly recommend checking it out.

The Power of Gratitude
----------------------

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by life’s daily challenges, only to find solace in the simplest of things? I remember a time when I was caught in a storm of stress with work, family, and seemingly endless responsibilities. One evening, sitting quietly on my porch and listening to the gentle rustling of leaves, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude that lifted my spirits. It was a reminder of the power that gratitude holds in shifting our perspectives and enriching our lives.

The Biblical Foundation of Gratitude
------------------------------------

Gratitude is not just a fleeting feeling; it’s a profound biblical principle that can transform our hearts and minds. The Bible is rich with teachings on gratitude. One of the most poignant is found in 1 Thessalonians 5:18: “Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.” This verse emphasizes that gratitude should not be conditional on our circumstances but a constant in our lives.

Reflecting on biblical stories, we see characters like David, who often expressed thankfulness through psalms, and even Job, who found reasons to be grateful despite immense suffering. Their examples teach us that gratitude is a discipline that strengthens our faith.

Practical Ways to Cultivate Gratitude
-------------------------------------

Implementing gratitude into our daily lives can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be.

- **Start a Gratitude Journal:** Each day, write down three things you’re grateful for. Whether they’re significant achievements or small victories, acknowledging them brings awareness to the good in your life.
- **Practice Mindfulness:** Take a few moments each day to pause and appreciate simple joys, like a sunny day or a warm cup of coffee.
- **Express Thanks:** Tell someone why you appreciate them. It can be as simple as a text or a handwritten note. Spreading gratitude can strengthen relationships and build community.

What steps can you take today to incorporate more gratitude into your life?

The Transformational Effects of a Grateful Heart
------------------------------------------------

Living with gratitude has profound effects on our well-being. Studies show that a grateful mindset improves mental health, enhances relationships, and even bolsters physical health. From a spiritual perspective, Psalm 100:4 invites us to “Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.” By practicing gratitude, we draw nearer to God, experiencing His presence more fully.

When we focus on what we have rather than what we lack, we shift from a mindset of scarcity to one of abundance. Take a moment to reflect: how has gratitude changed your life or the lives of those around you?

Your Journey of Gratitude
-------------------------

As we conclude this devotion, I challenge you to embrace gratitude daily. Start this week by setting aside time each day to reflect on the blessings in your life. Consider sharing your reflections with a friend or loved one and encourage them to join you on this journey.

Please share your experiences in the comments below. How has cultivating a heart of gratitude impacted your relationship with God and others? Your stories can inspire and uplift those around you.

Remember, gratitude is not merely an action; it is a lifestyle that aligns us with God’s will and opens doors to His overflowing blessings. Let’s walk together in thankfulness and watch how it transforms our lives and the world around us.

I've been living proper downtown Seattle for the last few years, but I'm thinking about moving to the outskirts or suburbs. I'm hoping you can help me find a neighborhood that fits most of my wishlist. Here's what I'm looking for:

  
1. **Safe & welcoming**: Clean streets, minimal visible homelessness, an area where anyone would feel comfortable walking at night.

2. **Affordable**: Renting a space that's 2bed, 2bath, >=1000 sqft, in-unit washer/dryer, off-street parking, etc., under $2,500 (I know, I know, but a person can dream, right?)

3. **Strong community vibe**: 

* Lots of local businesses with history (Prefer local shops > big chains)
* Free indoor & outdoor ""third places"" with frequent community events. Examples: Around the Table Boardgame Pub in Lynnwood, WA and Austin's Coffee in Winter Park, FL.
* Bonus for historical landmarks, museums, board game shops, and free classes. 

4. **Vegan-friendly**: 

* At least 3 different restaurants with unique vegan entrees. 
* Quality over Instagram-ability - looking for good value and tasty food I can't easily make at home. 
* Bonus points if the neighborhood has vegetarian or vegan restaurants. (Examples: Portland. Milk District in Orlando, FL)

5. **Commuter-friendly**: Walkable downtown area (it's okay if it's a drive away), solid public transportation options. (Example: Downtown Seattle). Ideally should be less than an hour away from Fremont area in rush hour traffic.

6. **Artsy atmosphere**: 

* Plenty of public art, quirky decorations, seasonal charm. 
* Art galleries are a big plus - the more unusual, the better. 
* Think less corporate-feeling than South Lake Union, more organic and community-driven. Examples: Downtown Edmonds, WA. Park Ave in Winter Park, FL. Fremont in Seattle. Historic Beaverton, OR.

Basically this, along with the various other ways coffee grounds/stains get onto and into your skin, has caused my hands to look like the picture I took and have attached here.  

This is with me constantly washing my hands every 10/15 mins. The pic was taken not long after I got out of the shower as well, so it does seem to just be  permanent staining, which is annoying because it looks filthy - not just to customers which is awful but to coworkers! 

Ofc coworkers have something similar, but I genuinely believe I get it the worst out of all of us. Granted I work the most hours but still! 

If anyone has any tips/idea/recommendations for how to keep the coffee out of your skin, and how to clean it up, it would be greatly appreciated!

The guy that see on the bus everyday, a barista that makes your coffee, the cashier at the grocery store, your dentist even? Everyone has a story.

“sonder- the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.”- The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows

I started sonder stories because I love the concept of sonder. To us it’s the guy on the bus every day, but to him we’re the stranger that gets on everyday two stops after his, the person that makes the same coffee order every morning, the person buying pickles at the grocery store, and a 2:30 appointment for a teeth cleaning.

- 2&4 A couple of bonds for schools and water, but they’re very expensive (10B each). Opponents main argument is why didn’t we include this in the state budget? Valid. It’s a toss up. 

- 32 Another increase in minimum wage to $18. It’s a tall order. And, I think, probably too much too soon. 

- 3 Fixing California laws to strike old language that did not allow gay marriage. Cool.

- 6 Removes prison mandatory labor, and makes it voluntary instead. Its unopposed. Slavery sucks.

- 35 Making permanent a tax on some healthcare plans that would end in 2027. It’s unopposed. I guess it worked as intended and is a net positive to keep.

- 33 A rent control proposition that also repeals most of our fair housing protections from the 90s. I think it’s pretty sneaky. It’s also the prop that the news says is bankrolled by a giant housing slumlord, AHF, which you can Google search. (It’s an AIDS foundation that’s massively profiting off its patients.) I think it does more harm than good with its deregulation. Literally the text strikes out the entire Rental housing act from 1995. I almost spit my coffee out when I saw it in black and white. Plus the same proposition has been voted down twice before. Wolf in sheep’s clothing.

- 34 A healthcare proposition that puts a bunch of spending requirements on healthcare special interests who take Medi-CalRX discounts and don’t pass it on and have massive violations, literally ONLY the above AIDS foundation. The main argument against is that the state already targeted the bad actor, and that this proposal could undermine a future good actor. But at the same time, it makes permanent the Medi-Cal RX program, which is working well but only alive because it’s an executive order from Newsom. It’s also billed as a revenge petition since it’s funded by the California renters association and only targets the AHF. A lot of mud slinging going on here. I hope neither of them pass (33 or 34).

- 36 Fixing theft under $950 and hard drug possession from being misdemeanors to felonies on the third conviction. Opponents are likening it to the ‘war on drugs’ crime laws that didn’t work the first time around and will crowd our prisons. But nothing much has been done about the theft loophole in recent years, so at this point, I’m kind of willing to try anything that discourages it. 

- 5 Lowering the percentage to pass new bonds locally to 55%. It’s currently 2/3 majority has been this way since forever (150 years). The main argument against it is that it shifts the burden to raise state funding to localities by having to pass bonds. Will probably result in a bunch of local taxes for necessary improvements because they won’t be being covered in the annual state budget. I don’t like diluting voting power, but we do live in a really polarized society right now and getting 2/3 majority on anything probably involves a lot of grift these days. But then again, I don’t want to weaponize local boards and communities anymore than they already are. I guess I’d rather have the state just do its job and not shift the burden.",53,1727973402.0,sandiego,33,0.84,False

Today's review is focused on [**Café Pronto**](https://www.cafepronto.ca/), [located ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mKnYjamezS3wuVVw8)on Rideout Street, where [Asmara Coffee House](https://www.asmaracoffeehouse.com/) used to be. In terms of bikeability, it was easy to find—so easy that I actually discovered it while biking the TVP, taking a slight detour around the Harris Park construction. There are two bike posts located at the side of the building for easy parking - but if you like to keep an eye on your ride the whole time this place might not be for you!

Café Pronto is a quaint little shop with only few seats along the window inside, and 2 tables on their front stoop. Both seating options give you a direct view of the historic [Eldon House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/98ofuDEevkTDK1128),which pulls you out of the hustle and bustle that other parts of the downtown bring due to it having limited traffic passing by and out of view of the the apartments. Nearby, there’s also the beautiful yellow-bricked building (formerly [Blyth Academy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h4DjTwqqZZVAbu628)), [Harris Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3w7RuVrAMQcKGNzj8), and [Museum London](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qtvh38fz8qNMpg348), making it a great area for some light exploring and photography.

When i went in first I had a very warm welcome as I was immediately roped into a conversation with the Owner / Barista, and the 3 other customers within - was a great sense of community simply bonding over coffee (learned what a Blackeye and an Italian Soda are!). The warm welcoming wasnt a fluke either as when I went again It was just me, the owner and his $1 freshly baked Penut Butter Cookies (cant beat that!) where we stiked up some light hearted convo while he was making my drink.

Coffee wise - something that surprised me was he was using two consumer grade home espresso machines (I would guess it to be the Duo-Temp Breville), but seemed to have a nicer grinder which I find makes the majority of the difference anyways. Cortado wise - he actually gave me the traditional 4-5oz so he gets a +1 in my books. Only thing I can knock is that the espresso shot itself was kinda weak even with it being that small 4-5oz portion, and he hasnt quite gotten the art of micro foaming the milk - but for the price of $2.80+tax - I'm more forgiving on that compared to if it was a $4.75 drink. This Cafe is affordable enough that going for a cup a few times a week wont really break the bank which is a nice change - and you can feel good supporting such a new cafe run by a very nice gentleman.

To answer the question - Can i make a better cortado myself at home - id say yes I can, but you cant beat the value and slice of community that this little shop brings so i would deffintely reccomend you come by. He offers Panninis, Pizza, and other sandwhiches that sound quite good !

Hi all, after some suggestions on the above issue.  I look after my mum (89). She has lived with us (my husband and I) since 2016. Over the years I have taken on all the food prep as mum has mobility issues and can’t stand long enough to make food anymore. She needs to lose about a stone in weight (14lbs) as her knees and back are giving pain. We were at her doctors yesterday where this was confirmed. Apart from weight, her health issues are scoliosis and a slightly high cholesterol (which she is on tablets for). Her blood sugar is fine. She walks with sticks (inside) and a wheeled mobility device outside (she pushes it). 

She is 5’ (used to be 5’4”) and weighs 13 stone (182lbs or 82.5kg). Her food, we think, is pared back to the bare minimum. I put her daily food through one of those online calorie counters and it’s about 1400 to 1600 daily. A typical days food is; breakfast of banana, handful of blueberries, 3 heaped dessert spoons of vanilla Greek yoghurt, some chia seeds and a sprinkle of granola, with a cup of lemon tea and a sweetener; lunch is a brown bread turkey and cucumber sandwich with 5 cherry tomatoes and a pro biotic drink; mid afternoon she’ll have a cup of coffee and a small orange; dinner is whatever I cook, e.g. chicken thighs with veg and gravy (she won’t eat potatoes/rice apart from once a week).

I personally think there is too much sugar in her diet, but she won’t budge on the breakfast (I’ve tried loads of different things) and the rest of her food isn’t that sugary I don’t think.

She won’t exercise (very hard for her to move, we tried chair yoga and she was in pain through most of what she tried, walking is exhausting and she feels unsafe on her feet a lot of the time). I am at a loss over how to help here. Any suggestions on what we can do?

It’s really sad, as long as I’ve been aware, mum has been ‘on a diet’ and I hate seeing her still so caught up in this mind set. (She’s always been on the large size, I have no recollection of her being less than a UK size14, and she’s mainly been about an 18). No one else in the immediate family is overweight (oh, my female cousin is, she’s mums brothers daughter, but she is the only one).

**What this app does**

* It connects to your free account on [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and to its API
* You can search for keywords (""bullet shells"", ""lofi kick"", ""lofi snare"", ""cow moo"", ""lighter"", ""piano loop"", etc. - the default keyword if you dont put one yourself is ""foley"") and the app will connect to freesound collection, get a random sound that corresponds to your keyword, and assign it to a pad on the app.
* Additionally you can set a maximum duration for the retrieved samples (defaults to 5 seconds if you dont put anything), so you get mostly shorter sounds if you want.
* You can do this multiple times with the same or different keywords per pad, then trim the sample to your liking (since some samples are long and you may want just a bit of it), and you can preview it using the play button.
* When you are done, you can ""Save Program"" and it will create a folder in your computer including the Akai MPC program (if MPC Live series (One, Live, Key, etc || previous versions untested)), along with the individual samples, trimmed and normalized to max volume.
* You can then copy that folder to your hardware MPC or to the Akai software (i guess) and the kit will be loaded for you, with the sounds assigned to the pads. Now you can further finetune the kit, add fx, etc.
* Here are a couple of quick and dirty videos of the app: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csvy9ALG97s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQfM-oCc5vI)

**Why this is cool (imho)**

* It´s free if you want it to be.
* Most of us have our own samples, mostly drumkits and instrument samples, but getting some extra foley sounds and sound fx can really spice your creativity - it does for me.
* It is a free sound library with +600.000 sounds

**First things third**

* This is a release of the first version of the MPC Program Creator app;
* Download quotas may apply since these are dropbox links;
* The reddit community for this app is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc\_program\_creator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/)
* In case you want to test it i´d ask you to join this community so we can keep in touch regarding its future development, possible new features, release of version 2 (with waveform display, pad deletion, and other new features), and also for me to know who is interested to fuel this.

**Instructions**

* Download the appropriate app below:
* Windows: [Click here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d6fgs00f7bz2t1k2dv76x/MPC_0.9_Program_Editor_WIN_NO_KEY.zip?rlkey=my4e16d2rodomb1iwpqxizlqw&st=slpx1wmg&dl=0)

* Then go to [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and create a free account and login
* Then go [here](https://freesound.org/home/login/?next=/apiv2/apply) to get yourself an API Key (no need to fill anything else)
* Copy that API Key , you will need it in the next step.
* Open the APP, it will ask you for the API Key, put it in.
* Check the brief manual [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/comments/1frkgbk/current_manual/)

**Troubleshooting**

* Windows should work fine.
* Apple (some OS´s) will tell you ""app is broken"" or ""can't open"" etc.:
* First try Right Click + Open
* If that doesn't work, you have to unquarantine the file, follow these instructions:
* Change the app name to just ""mpc"", and place it on your Desktop
* Open ""terminal""
* Write ""cd Desktop"" (or whatever your desktop name is)
* Write ""ls"" (LS in lowercase), and check if [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/) shows on the list
* If it does, write this on your terminal: ""xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/)""
* It should just go to the next terminal line. No worries. App should open now
* If app opens and doesnt allow you to press a pad to download a sample and gives an error:
* Go to settings on your mac,
* Search for ""privacy"" and ""allow full disk access"" to the [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/),
* Since it will try to save samples to your computer, it demands you previously authorize access.

**Kudos**

* This app consumes a lot of my free time. But I don't demand anything in return, however i´d very much appreciate it if:
* You provide me with some feedback (community or PM) on your experience getting it to run, for me and others to see, and maybe with some videos with kits created with this app, it would mean a lot.
* Also, if it doesn't work, let me know via PM or community post, providing your computer OS, your MPC and it's OS, so i can check wtf is going on.
* And if it works, and you really enjoy it and are using it to make kits, I believe you'd buy me a coffee if we met in person. So do that, and buy me a coffee please :) as this will fuel my interest in further developing and supporting it. You can do that on a button inside the app, or [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/redsquares)

**Disclaimer**

* I am not a pro developer, so bugs may happen
* I will use my free time when possible, to address peoples messages and assist them
* Have patience

Ok, that's it for now!

Have fun beatmaking with alien farts!

* You can search for keywords (""bullet shells"", ""lofi kick"", ""lofi snare"", ""cow moo"", ""lighter"", ""piano loop"", etc. - the default keyword if you dont put one yourself is ""foley"") and the app will connect to freesound collection, get a random sound that corresponds to your keyword, and assign it to a pad on the app.
* Additionally you can set a maximum duration for the retrieved samples (defaults to 5 seconds if you dont put anything), so you get mostly shorter sounds if you want.
* You can do this multiple times with the same or different keywords per pad, then trim the sample to your liking (since some samples are long and you may want just a bit of it), and you can preview it using the play button.
* When you are done, you can ""Save Program"" and it will create a folder in your computer including the Akai MPC program (if MPC Live series (One, Live, Key, etc || previous versions untested)), along with the individual samples, trimmed and normalized to max volume.
* You can then copy that folder to your hardware MPC or to the Akai software (i guess) and the kit will be loaded for you, with the sounds assigned to the pads. Now you can further finetune the kit, add fx, etc.
* Here are a couple of quick and dirty videos of the app: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csvy9ALG97s) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQfM-oCc5vI)

**Why this is cool (imho)**

* It´s free if you want it to be.
* Most of us have our own samples, mostly drumkits and instrument samples, but getting some extra foley sounds and sound fx can really spice your creativity - it does for me.
* It is a free sound library with +600.000 sounds

**First things third**

* This is a release of the first version of the MPC Program Creator app;
* Download quotas may apply since these are dropbox links;
* The reddit community for this app is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc\_program\_creator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/)
* In case you want to test it i´d ask you to join this community so we can keep in touch regarding its future development, possible new features, release of version 2 (with waveform display, pad deletion, and other new features), and also for me to know who is interested to fuel this.

**Instructions**

* Then go to [freesound.org](http://freesound.org) and create a free account and login
* Then go [here](https://freesound.org/home/login/?next=/apiv2/apply) to get yourself an API Key (no need to fill anything else)
* Copy that API Key , you will need it in the next step.
* Open the APP, it will ask you for the API Key, put it in.
* Check the brief manual [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpc_program_creator/comments/1frkgbk/current_manual/)

**Troubleshooting**

* Windows should work fine.
* Apple (some OS´s) will tell you ""app is broken"" or ""can't open"" etc.:
* First try Right Click + Open
* If that doesn't work, you have to unquarantine the file, follow these instructions:
* Change the app name to just ""mpc"", and place it on your Desktop
* Open ""terminal""
* Write ""cd Desktop"" (or whatever your desktop name is)
* Write ""ls"" (LS in lowercase), and check if [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/) shows on the list
* If it does, write this on your terminal: ""xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/)""
* It should just go to the next terminal line. No worries. App should open now
* If app opens and doesnt allow you to press a pad to download a sample and gives an error:
* Go to settings on your mac,
* Search for ""privacy"" and ""allow full disk access"" to the [mpc.app](http://mpc.app/),
* Since it will try to save samples to your computer, it demands you previously authorize access.

**Kudos**

* This app consumes a lot of my free time. But I don't demand anything in return, however i´d very much appreciate it if:
* You provide me with some feedback (community or PM) on your experience getting it to run, for me and others to see, and maybe with some videos with kits created with this app, it would mean a lot.
* Also, if it doesn't work, let me know via PM or community post, providing your computer OS, your MPC and it's OS, so i can check wtf is going on.
* And if it works, and you really enjoy it and are using it to make kits, I believe you'd buy me a coffee if we met in person. So do that, and buy me a coffee please :) as this will fuel my interest in further developing and supporting it. You can do that on a button inside the app, or [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/redsquares)

**Disclaimer**

* I am not a pro developer, so bugs may happen
* I will use my free time when possible, to address peoples messages and assist them
* Have patience

Ok, that's it for now!

1fvbpt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1fvbpt1/inspiring_others_to_join_writing_for_your_rarepair/,Inspiring others to join writing for your rarepair,"Most of us know the pain of being into a rarepair or a small fandom. We often have to just suck it up and make our own works and hope others will join in. I'm currently thinking about how the ""inspire others to join"" part can work. 

I'm not in a tiny fandom, but I have a particular pairing I really like right now and there's only about 2 (amazing) long fics and 4 shorter fics which have them as a side plot.  

My best ideas for how to bring new people in are currently:
1. Be bat-fucking-wild in the fics I write for them. Insane crossovers in hopes to get people from other fandoms intrigued with this pairing, insane porn in order to get the thirsty people who don't care that much about anything besides the kinks, insane AUs which will make people go ""what the fuck"" and read out of curiosity, just picking out minor tiny details from canon and writing entire fics focused on that.
2. Creating or prompting in kinkmemes or ""insert pairing here"" weeks in fanfic communities like Tumblr, Dreamwidth. 
3. Fic exchanges. It's hard if you're a really small fandom, but some fic exchanges are fandom blind and I can hope that I get gifted something that scratches the itch. 
4. Making podfics for all works in that pairing that I get permission for. At least podfic listeners will get interested?
5. Responding to all comments on my work, letting people do translations, fan art, podfics, etc.
6. Getting a beta (or, if only, a co-author). Maybe they'll at least have ideas or talk to you about the pairing. 
7. Making sure there's at least one of all the most popular AUs for  your pairing/fandom. This could get people who just want to read that AU? Like, Omegaverse, Sentinel/Guide, Coffee shop AU, High school AU, Hanahaki, etc. 
8. Get good at tagging. Don't add 50+ tags to your work, but actually think about which ones apply and would make people looking for that happy when they read your fic. 
9. Flat out begging. Not in the comment sections of other authors, but just in the end notes of my chapters, writing out some ideas/prompts for spin-offs or AUs in hopes to inspire readers.
10. Some people like roleplaying I guess? 
11. If you make fandom friends, maybe they'll write something for you?
12. Generally promoting your work to get more eyes on it and entice other people to be interested. 
13. If you have a *great* idea for a fic, but know you're not going to write it, you can post it to Ao3 as a Not!Fic where you lay out your outline for what would happen and hope that people are interested enough to write it. NOTE: *NOT* promptfics or idea lists, which are not allowed on Ao3. You have to actually write something of ""fannish"" substance, like the actual plot of a fic. 
14. Run a promptmeme on Ao3?
15. Make and post fan art. 
16. Interact with other authors who do post your rarepair.
17. Translate works if you have the capability. 
18. Create a ""pairing"" starter explaining the character backgrounds and relationships in canon. (Basically a ""Reasons to ship X"" guide)
19. Make a music playlist for your ship? Or AMVs? Or youtube videos explaining the pairing?
20. Write fics which also include popular pairings. DON'T bait people by tagging things that don't exist, but lure them in by giving them something they know they like while introducing them to something new.

Any ither ideas? What would you say is the most effective way to get people interested in a rarepair? ",9,1727972724.0,FanFiction,11,0.84,False

Td i was running in and out of meetings, dropping smth off at my desk, picking smth up. I like having a bit of candy at my desk to snack during the day, a little sugar boost to get the work going. I got a new bag of some candy this AM. I always share a bit with my friends. 

My coworker who usually sits next to me was sick td. When I got back to my desk to pack up my stuff and go home there was a woman from another department sitting there and the bag of candy was open and nearly half was gone. I look at her desk and there's not 1, not 2, but a pile of wrappers. I also specifically picked out more red ones bc I like that flavor most and she ate all the red ones specifically. 

First of all, all my stuff (coffee cup, purse, notebook, etc.) were at my desk so it's not like I left for the day. Secondly, the bag was in the corner of my desk closed, wrapped up, so that means she went to my desk to get the bag, open it and eat half... Wth? 

Like I said, I never mind sharing so if she had simply asked I would've said ""ofc, have a few, help urself"". It's not like this candy is super expensive or hard to get, but the fact that she was comfortable enough to help herself to my things... I've never had this happen before. And no, we don't have drawers. 

When I saw all this I couldn't say anything to her because she was on a call and I was going home. But I feel like it'd be weird if I confronted her a day or two later (she doesn't come in every day). WIBTJ if I brought it up? Tx<3",2,1727972457.0,AmITheJerk,2,1.0,False

Yesterday my purse tipped over in my car, and I found a weird brand of cigarettes between the seat and center console. It’s half full. 

I’ve asked my mom, sister and friends that I’ve been with recently (like in the past year) if they were theirs and all said no. I asked my husband about it and he said they were maybe his sister’s. She was in my car once 18 months ago. Now, I don’t clean out my car that often, but it’s definitely been cleaned out since 18 months ago. Am I overreacting thinking that my husband took my car to cheat on me? 

If someone was going to snoop/steal something out of my car, there would be things missing and I’ve never noticed anything missing (like the three pairs of Ray-bans I keep in there). So that just doesn’t seem like the answer to this. 

He just doesn’t have access to my car without me around very often, but this is the most logical conclusion I can come up with. In any scenario, I’m super freaked out that someone was in my car. Overreacting or no? 

Edited to add: our relationship is rocky right now, 20mo old baby and haven’t been intimate very often since before I was pregnant.

I have been reading through this forum but have started to get overwhelmed. So, hopefully, I can get some local knowledge on the best spots to hit up this weekend. I will be staying at the Hyatt Regency downtown on Friday night. Any recommendations for the following would be helpful:

* A good casual dinner spot for Friday evening that is walkable. I will be dining alone so a place that takes walk-ins would be best.
* Any good coffee spots or breakfast/lunch spots that are also walkable for Saturday

The event I am in town for will be at the Enercare Centre on Saturday evening. Are there any really good restaurants or breweries nearby that I could grab a later dinner (9pmish)?

I am pretty wide open to all cuisines but Toronto seems to have some awesome Asian spots that we lack in my city so I am interested to check those out. Also, if there is anything else outside of food that you can't miss please let me know. ",2,1727972279.0,FoodToronto,13,0.57,False

1fvbm81,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1fvbm81/how_do_i_order_to_avoid_this/,How do I order to avoid this?!,"First of all, I want to say that I LOVE my broistas. I'm originally from Oregon and grew up with Dutch. I go probably 3-4 times a week. 

But over the last year I'm having an issue. I like my drinks sweet, so I always order them extra sweet. Never had a problem before. But now, when I order a drink extra sweet it seems like there is a 50/50 chance that it'll actually be extra sweet. The rest of the time, it's like I said half sweet. It'll taste like there's almost no flavor in there, and like there is extra creamer. It'll be visibly much lighter in color, and it just tastes like coffee and cream. My boyfriend does not like super sweet drinks, but when I've had him try it, he agrees it just tastes like coffee with a lot of half and half.

I don't understand how, so frequently, it seems like when I order EXTRA sweet I'm getting the opposite. I never correct them, just go home and add some stevia because I really don't want to be a pain in the ass. Again, I really like our broistas and I feel like if  I had complained every time this has happened, I'd have a reputation as difficult or a Karen and god, that's the last thing I want.

But at the same time, if I'm spending upwards of 8 dollars on a drink that I want sweet, I should be able to get it sweet. Am I ordering wrong? Is there an ""extra cream"" button next to the ""extra sweet""?? do I have to say ""I want extra flavor not extra cream""?? I've never had this problem before this year and I'm sort of baffled by it.
