Second, the fact that we can't even wear different color Coffee Gear shirts now, makes me so fucking glad I never bought anything from there. Tbh, I always thought it was strange, giving your hard earned money right back to the company just to be a walking billboard for them. No thanks. 

I would just buy the cheapest basic T-shirts I could find at Walmart, sometimes even getting lucky enough to find some on clearance. But now somewhere around 90% of those shirts I got are useless cause they're not black. Wtf?

Yesterday, she asked me how far the hotel is that we are staying at from her friends; then how far her friends is from the ceremony. I was really busy with work and couldn‚Äôt get back to her on the second half but sent her the address of the ceremony. I never heard from her again until today.

She had asked me if she could do my make up at her friends house, because I had asked her ahead of time to do it however, I said if it needs to be done at the ceremony that would be fine with me. I told her that that is a lot of driving on a day that I have a time crunch, she said to me that it would be a very expensive Uber. I told her she could stay with me and my family Saturday night, and come to the graduation with us, and I would drop her off at her friends house after to this she did not reply. I told her if not, it‚Äôs probably cheaper to rent a car. She said I do not have money to rent a car, but she had advised me she was Uber in from one airport to her friends house and stopping for coffee at a local coffee shop on the way and that she was Uber from her friends house to an alternate airport on Monday. I told her this alone is about $100 in Ubers, which it is. I fact checked it. Then I did research myself and saw a rental for $130 and I told her again she can either stay with us Saturday and come with us to the ceremony or she would have to find her own way there.

updated firmware of the Creative App and the BT W5 stick

1k82qy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/1k82qy4/why_are_my_experiences_so_different_from_my/,Why are my experiences so different from my friend‚Äôs?,"So my best friend and I are both on the apps, both women. I‚Äôm late 30s, she‚Äôs early 40s. 

Our experiences are profoundly different, and we‚Äôve been trying to figure out why (I have some guesses, but I don‚Äôt want to bias the responses too much), mostly because she‚Äôs been trying to help me and doesn‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt seem to have as much luck with men treating her well as she does. 

My first dates are often what you‚Äôd expect: someone suggesting coffee or a drink or a casual meal. I‚Äôm fine with this! I‚Äôm not passive and will suggest we meet up if they don‚Äôt and will be an active participant in planning. I get a reasonable number of flakes (I‚Äôd imagine about average) who end up bailing last minute. Many of them are won‚Äôt plan anything more than a couple of days out. I don‚Äôt expect to be paid for and always offer to split. I assumed this was all pretty common and just part of the slog. 

Ok, now onto her. She matches with guys who unprompted (she‚Äôs not asking for fancy dates), plan fairly elaborate (often expensive) looooong first dates that require them to drive an hour+ each way. Think dinner at a nice restaurant followed by a concert or 5th row seats to an NBA game. They also go out their way to make sure she‚Äôs comfortable and just seem to be generally thoughtful and considerate and like they are very much trying to woo her. 

She always insists on video chatting as an intro with them before committing to a first date, but other than texting, that‚Äôs all the contact they will have had. These guys are not only planning these things, they‚Äôre committing to them a week+ out and sticking to it. She rarely gets guys bailing. I know she‚Äôs not promising sex and takes things very quite slowly. 

She regularly has first dates where men are putting in more effort than I have EVER had a man do, including ones that I‚Äôve been in a relationship with. 

My friend thinks my bar is too low and that esp given my history, I should have higher expectations of men putting in some sort of work to date me because it‚Äôs a signal for how good they will be to me in a relationship. I‚Äôve read so much about how men resent being ‚Äútaken advantage of‚Äù and having to do all the work in dating that I‚Äôm hyper-aware of not being that person, but I do wonder if I‚Äôm shooting myself in the foot somehow. 

Anyone got some good insights for me? Like I said, this has been an ongoing discussion with us, so we have some hypotheses, but I‚Äôd love to get some outside perspectives. Happy to provide more details if anything else would be helpful.

I‚Äôm an international student in the US, and lately, I‚Äôve been feeling really lonely.
Most of my close friends graduated and moved on, and now I find myself spending a lot of time alone. For some reason, I haven‚Äôt been very successful in relationships here either ‚Äî no girlfriend, no real romantic connections. I think I underestimated how hard it would be to rebuild a social life once your core group leaves.

It‚Äôs hard to find new friends, especially when you‚Äôre no longer a freshman and everyone already seems to have their own circles. I try to stay busy with school and work, but honestly, it feels like something is missing. I miss having people to just hang out with, talk to, or even do simple things like grab coffee or watch a movie.

If anyone has been through something similar, how did you deal with it? How do you push through the loneliness and find new connections when it feels so overwhelming?

the problem is my HM is pretty passive aggressive and not direct at all. she never asks me to do any extra specific tasks which at first gave me the impression that they were just very easy going people, but, as time went on she started making passive aggressive comments and once gave me a whole speech about how it would be really nice of me to ‚Äúpitch in for once‚Äù and walk and feed the dog and clean their dishes because i‚Äôm ‚Äúpart of the family‚Äù and because they (sometimes) make dinner for me. when that is not what i‚Äôm here for. i‚Äôm here to take care of their kids. and i get it, i live here. cleaning up MY OWN stuff is pretty much obligatory, basic decency even, but why should i have to wash your coffee mug and tupperwares and put away the food that you use when i‚Äôm literally busy taking care of your children and cleaning after them/doing their never ending laundry? idk the guilt tripping is just so crazy to me.
i already don‚Äôt feel comfortable living here. this is not my country, this is not my house and this is not my family. i feel so out of place and they don‚Äôt even try to make me feel welcome. like the people pleaser i am, in the moment, i just said ‚Äúi appreciate you telling me this, i‚Äôll keep it in mind‚Äù but as time has gone on i just feel like i shouldn‚Äôt have stayed quiet. but then again i just don‚Äôt feel that comfortable speaking up which i know i should work on especially when i‚Äôm living with strangers who are also my bosses.
they also make me feel guilty whenever i go out. they often imply that i should spend more time with them ‚Äúas a family‚Äù (e.g. go with them to the kids‚Äô dance class at 9 am when it‚Äôs my only free day and god forbid i want to sleep in for once) like i said, it‚Äôs my only free day the whole week and respectfully, i would go crazy if i don‚Äôt get out of that house and have peace and quiet. like is it such a bad thing to not want to hear kids screaming and crying 24/7? they sure don‚Äôt like having to deal with it, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd understand why someone would need a break lol
i should also say that my relationship with the kids is pretty good. they can be really difficult and do not understand what the word ‚Äòno‚Äô means, parents don‚Äôt know how to set boundaries which is exhausting but that‚Äôs actually not even my main complaint. my point is the kids like me. even HP are pleasantly surprised by how well they adapted since it didn‚Äôt go so well with their last au pair. so idk, i think it‚Äôs fair that i get one free day without feeling guilty for not being with all of them all day",1,1745635132.0,Aupairs,1,0.99,False

1k82gb4,https://i.redd.it/d0tv7eocb3xe1.jpeg,Brief summary on a survivor concept I had based on a character of mine,"Alright so I have this rat named Nick and I was imagining him as a survivor in Forsaken (don't ask why) so I'm just gonna briefly give what his abilities are and stuff

Name: Nick Roddy

Description: 

Difficulty: 3 stars

Health: 25

Walk speed: 14

Run speed: 28

Stamina: 105

Stamina loss: 10/s

Stamina gain: 20/s

Gameplay:

Nick is solely a support mixed with a ""sentinel"" I say that very loosely because what he does is gives a small speed buff to other survivors with Starblox latte while also working as a looper, his speed makes him hard to catch but he's very fragile and easy to kill so any good killer with a ranged ability will pretty much make quick work of him. God forbid a Jason gaping wounds him.

Passives:

Rat-like: Nick being a rat has the speed and frailty of one. +2 to walk and run speed while having 25 health.

Abilities:

Whistle (Q): Let out a loud whistle revealing your aura to the killer, all survivors but Nick get resistance 3 for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 40s. (this ability essentially makes Nick a higher priority as the other survivors are harder to kill except for Nick)

Description: ""Hey come get me, you wuss!"" - Nick

Coffee time (E): Nick pulls out a Starblox latte and chugs it, being slightly slowed for the duration of the animation (1.25s), he gains speed 3 and his stamina depletion is halved for 5 seconds. Once the 5 seconds are up he gains slowness 2 and his stamina regeneration is halved for 5 seconds. Cooldown is 60 seconds and has 3 uses. (this ability works as a panic button as well as a way to get to other survivors faster)

Description: ""You drink any more of those and you'll get a heart attack."" - Ratticus

Free sample (R): Nick hands out a Starblox latte and it will be in his hand for 5 seconds, survivors that stand in the hitbox trigger will get speed 2 and have their stamina depletion reduced by 20% for 8 seconds. If no survivors take it then he'll put it back. Cooldown when someone takes the Starblox latte is 35 seconds, cooldown when nobody takes it is 15 seconds. (This ability is similar to Elliots pizza throw except you don't throw the latte, you just hand it out and instead of healing you, it makes it easier to escape the killer or get to a survivor.)

  For context, up until I got married very recently and moved out, I would help my mom and dad a lot around the house and with my younger siblings. My mom has told me multiple times since I moved out how much she misses my help. I do my best to still come around as often as possible but I am finishing my degree and also actively applying for jobs for when I graduate, as well as doing an internship and also being newly married! It‚Äôs just a lot. 

  Well at 7:15, absolutely nobody in that house was ready. Brother was throwing a tantrum as teenage boys do, dad was arguing with him, mom was trying to make coffee and the machine was broken, my littlest sisters were fighting over a hairbrush and whacking each other with it, and my little sister, 16, was sitting on the couch looking very sick. She‚Äôs usually the one who‚Äôs very put together so I asked her if she was okay. She said yes, but told me she had a stomache, and asked if she could drive her own car to church just in case she had to leave because she was sick. I said I didn‚Äôt care, especially because even though she felt sick she was the only one who was semi ready to go. 

  When we finally left my mom harped a few things about my sister just wanting to drive her new car (just recently turned 16 and started driving) but I just ignored it because honestly, she really did seem sick and her car was right behind us the whole time. 

  About 20 mins after service started, my sister got up and left. She texted me and my mom in a groupchat and told us she was having girl problems and her stomach was really upset so she had to go and didn‚Äôt want to say anything in front of everyone. Again, that was a good enough excuse for me. 

  Wellll except for the fact that her ‚Äúhack‚Äù of trying to turn off her phone at the last location (home) didn‚Äôt work. Even though her phone was off driving to church, and then to her boyfriend‚Äôs house, it tracked her both places and my mom found out quickly. 

  Needless to say my mom was livid. She cursed my little sister out, grounded her, took her phone, and told her she can‚Äôt see her boyfriend for months. Apparently my sister had been begging to go to his house for months and my mom hasn‚Äôt let her. And then I, as an adult, got scolded and reprimanded like a child for it and ‚Äúallowing‚Äù my sister to do that. My mom accused me of knowing her plans and letting her do it, which obviously isn‚Äôt true. 

  I couldn‚Äôt believe it. First of all, she‚Äôs my sister not my kid and second of all how was i supposed to know. She really did seem sick. I left my parent‚Äôs  house crying that day because of how frustrated I was. 

  My husband obviously has been saying it‚Äôs not my fault and I shouldn‚Äôt be letting it affect me this much, but it truly truly is. I honestly don‚Äôt think my mom has thought about it since Sunday but I have so many times. Why is my fault??? Is it my fault??? ",8,1745634199.0,AITAH,12,0.9,False

I love my job, but it is one of the top most stressful jobs in the country. I also run a business with my husband, which admittedly, is my passion. I also do all the household chores.
My husband (36m) works 36 hours a week at a gas station. His only passion is rock climbing, but he also helps with the business. 
He recently left to go hang out with some friends for a week and I had the business and my normal work hours. The business takes about 2 hours of work a day and there is no putting it off, especially cause we‚Äôre still small and don‚Äôt have some automatic features so it takes some juggling to make it work. 
Today, I had to go pick up a couple of items for the business so I asked him to help me load a large crate in the back of the truck so I could leave. He sat there drinking his coffee and playing on his phone. I asked again as I was putting on my shoes and he snapped back with ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt take long for me to do it and you‚Äôre not even ready so why are you rushing me?‚Äù
I told him ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre lazy and it takes you forever to get off the couch and I need to leave‚Äù 
He got even more mad and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre calling me lazy? Making someone wait isn‚Äôt going to kill you, but if you‚Äôre so worried about leaving on time maybe I should just leave the marriage‚Äù (for context I am overweight and he is very athletic so his thinking is all overweight people are too lazy to workout)
Now, I pay for everything: the house, the utilities and the business. His car, insurance, phone is all financed by me. His paycheck goes to climbing equipment and travels only. So I told him ‚Äúwell, bye‚Äù cause I know I‚Äôd be fine on my own and I literally teach manipulation tactics at work and viewed it as one.

1k829zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/smartwatch/comments/1k829zd/opinion_on_smartwatch_sought/,Opinion on smartwatch sought,"Hey all,

So I am going to be ordering the new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 to replace my current phone which is on its last legs. I am thinking of getting a smartwatch to go with it. I am only really interested in notifications and running apps/widgets for some of my installed Android apps. Any fitness stuff is a bonus, but not my main focus.

I was looking at the Motorola Moto Watch 120 as a possible choice. Partially because it got good reviews and has notification options, and partially because it would be the same brand as my new phone. And it is going for a good price for my budget (I can go higher, but this is nice). My concern is that being the same brand isn't going to gain me anything and since the Moto Watch doesn't run WearOS, the available apps/widgets are limited compared to watches that do run WearOS.

So if the brand matching isn't that crucial, should I just go with whatever watch does everything I want, at a price I can afford, and be done with it? My brain tells me having the same brand of phone and watch doesn't make that big of a deal in the Android universe, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious or important that I should be considering. Thanks in advance for any thoughts/ideas/recommendations/etc.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me they didn‚Äôt steal‚Ä¶anything? Nothing at all?‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no. I mean, I haven‚Äôt exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*‚ÄúLet me make sure I‚Äôm getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just‚Ä¶moving your furniture around? That‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what‚Ä¶open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let‚Äôs try this one more time,*¬†I thought.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to their intent, sir. And that‚Äôs not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.‚Äù*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn‚Äôt completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*‚ÄúI guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That‚Äôs when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*‚ÄúWhat do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?‚Äù*¬†I asked, impatient to learn what he‚Äôd written.

*‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶no, probably not.‚Äù*¬†He snorted.¬†*‚ÄúI have an important question, though.‚Äù*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop‚Äôs previously stoic lips couldn‚Äôt help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*‚ÄúWhat song was it?‚Äù*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*‚ÄúMy Dark Star by The London Suede,‚Äù*¬†I replied automatically.

*‚ÄúHuh, I don‚Äôt know that one,‚Äù*¬†said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn‚Äôt actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I‚Äôd never listened to that song before last night. Didn‚Äôt know any other tracks by¬†*The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I‚Äôd google the track once they left. It¬†*was*¬†what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*‚ÄúThese were my guesses.‚Äù*

In scribbled ink, it read¬†*‚ÄúBad Romance? The Macarena?‚Äù*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add¬†*assaulting a lawman*¬†to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town‚Äôs tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren‚Äôt the¬†*exact*¬†words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn‚Äôt necessarily¬†*need*¬†to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and it wasn‚Äôt like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it¬†*way*¬†below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She‚Äôd see that I could maintain our ‚Äústandard of living‚Äù, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I¬†*am*¬†a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn‚Äôt endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?*¬†I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù*¬†I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don‚Äôt know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn‚Äôt where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn‚Äôt see any of their details.

The picture wasn‚Äôt poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just‚Ä¶dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from¬†*within*¬†the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn‚Äôt believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house‚Äôs back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*‚ÄúBut she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‚ÄòOh, how my dark star will rise,‚Äô*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.‚Äù*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she‚Äôd get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*‚Äú\****Who, THE FUCK, are‚Ä¶‚Äù***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house‚Äôs perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn‚Äôt creative enough, and two, she wasn‚Äôt truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from outside the house like I‚Äôd thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room‚Ä¶*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I‚Äôm just forgetting the layout. I haven‚Äôt been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of ‚Äú*My Dark Star‚Äù*were coming from the room I couldn‚Äôt remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear¬†*My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint¬†*precisely*¬†where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the surface of the wall, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn‚Äôt real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as¬†*My Dark Star*¬†faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star*¬†began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become crowded over time, and each one was fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into two saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its torso. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

1k825n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mackinnon4congress/comments/1k825n9/a_conundrum/,A conundrum.,"I'm mostly typing this for myself, I think it's called ""rubber ducking,"" so future you, good job for staying until the end.

So I'm trying to get press attention, and I'm plainly telling my story:

I'm a regular dude who decided that the political situation in America is so dire that I actually decide that the most effective way to protect his trans child from Trump was to prod the local power structure to actually act against Trump, yet he might risk the wrath of both Trump and the local Democrats simultaneously.

Like, isn't that a compelling story? I'd read an article about that. I'd send that guy $5. And people on Reddit and local Facebook groups in particular seem to like it. I've got hundreds of people who would give me a job reference, but there can be reprisals from local politicians against schools! Which is where I've worked my whole life. And I can't get them to risk it!

So no, I'm not some bored tech bro who decided to be a politician on a lark.

I love my district and it is going to be a beautiful summer. I think I'm going to meet thousands of people. At what threshold are they going to pay attention to me? I think a part of my appeal is that I articulate one of the most forceful and urgent responses to Trump out there. It's my pinned... Blusky thing... anyways. And I'm going to be persistent with it. Everyone in the district will know that I was right. And in summer 2026 when we're dressing in the dark in the morning because we're having another brownout, and you're sad they're rationing coffee again, they'll remember I was right.

A commenter said I was being alarmist. If only.

Any advice on attention schemes? I cannot be cringe. It goes against every fiber of my Dad Soul, but I cannot be cringe. My public persona must be relatively serious. It cannot be known that I still give my tween child pony rides.

Brown sugar latte -- Brown sugar.

Vanilla latte -- A few drops of vanilla extract.

Cinnamon latte -- Cinnamon, plus more sugar.

Mocha latte -- Chocolate syrup / chocolate chips / cocoa powder / hot chocolate packet.

Caramel latte -- Ok this one's fun. If you don't have caramel syrup, you can just microwave a tablespoon each of brown sugar and butter for a minute, stir it up, drain any extra butter, now you have fresh caramel syrup.

I've been in the US for about 6 momths now(25 F). I had visited a few times before as a tourist but I came here this time for work. 

I don't really plan on settling down here permanently and honestly, I never thought I'd date American guys cause I figured the cultural and language barriers would be too much. 

But after making some friends and spending time here, I realized those differences aren't as big of an issue as I thought so I started dating.

Here's the problem. I've dated three guys so far (one Hispanic, one white, and one mixed white/black). The first guy approached me at a coffee shop, the second at a market, and the third at the gym. They all asked for my number first and I liked cause they all good-looking, tall and fit. 

The issue is that ALL of them had previously dated Asian women. I'm Korean, and these guys had dated Korean-Americans, Chinese, or Japanese women before. When I found out about this, I became suspicious that they might have an Asian fetish and ended things with all of them. 

What really triggered this was when the first Hispanic guy I dated complained that 'American white women' are ""sexually promiscuous and aggressive"" while praising Asian women, saying he liked how ""girly and peach"" I was. 
As soon as he said that, I completely lost interest and he just seemed like a loser to me, so I broke things off. 

The problem is that the other guys I dated afterward never said anything like that but just knowing their exes were Asian made me suspicious of an Asian fetish so I ended things with them too.

Is dating someone from a different race common here? Statistically it seems like dating Asians while living in America would be rare, so I‚Äôm suspicious and kind of scared of American guys who approach me.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

I knew her for a year as a friend, but ever since we got into this relationship she became so paranoid and jealous it's ridiculous.  

Whenever I don't answer her texts or calls for more then 1 hour she starts bombarding me with messages and how she knows what I'm doing etc. She told me I need to stop texting with my sister because that's weird...wtf?
One example of why she got mad at me was when my sister called me and asked me to pick her from school. First of all it's literally my sister and second of all she's 13 years old.
Idek what to say. I brushed that off when I shouldn't have but whatever.
 
The other day I met up with my mom to pick some things she brought for me from home and I didn't tell my gf about this because I don't think it's important, I don't ask her to tell me where she is every moment of the day either. We were sitting at a coffee shop and just talking for a bit before she goes back and the gf comes, out of nowhere and starts yelling at me. Mind you theres like 10 other tables around us and my mom is right there too. She was like I knew you are meeting up with someone you son of a bich, pig, manwhore etc... I yelled back at her and told her to calm tf down and she literally kneeled down and tried to like cup my face and told me I'm being groomed, I need to choose her. üíÄ 

I told her that's my mom and that she's an insecure bitch and basically she was still trying to prove a point or something, basically she's trying to say it's my fault because I didn't tell her. We all left separately and when she called me after 15 mins I told her we're done. I told her I don't care about her insecurities and that it's not giving her the right to act that way. I was so embarrassed and on top of that I wasn't doing anything wrong. 

Since then she was texting me on every possible fucking app. She sent me an email on school account...and what she's saying is how she's insecure because all men are cheters, how she's living through a really hard moment, she's stressed, how she's gonna k*ll herself etc. I know that she won't but honestly I'm not getting back with her because of that. I sent her mails and messages about taking her life to unis psychologist and she said she will share it to whoevers in charge of that. She hasn't called me since yesterday and while I don't want to be with her I don't want her any harm. Do you think this was just a clash out or she could be serious? I mean we were only dating for like 3 months, we are both 20 and we're young,  it's not like I wasted half her life then broke up with her. 

Tell me do you think I should jsut ignore any new messages if she sends them or I should try to end this on better terms?

1k81od4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k81od4,How to you all make coffee ice cream?,"Hi creamy people

At my job i took over Ice cream making about 2 years ago and have mostly been following the recipes from my predecesor, which included a coffee recipe that called for Instant Coffee and Artificial Flavoring.

After trying a vietnamese coffee ice cream that is prepared by brewing the actual ice cream base i saw how completely gamechanging this is and how the flavor was so full and rich. I experimented at my own store this week by brewing the vanilla base we get (10qts) with 1 lb of beans and tried two batches one with unground one with ground beans. Brought the base with the beans/grounds in it up to 120F in a pot on an induction stove, set the stove to 160 and had it stay on heat for 2 hours. Refigerate beans-in overnight and used next day.

I was so excited that the FLAVOR was incredible. HOWEVER i was straining the grinds batch for over an hour! I lost about 25% of the base to straining and could not seem to get the grinds out. Looking into it I need to get either a brew bag or use a cheesecloth so i come here for advice on which method to use. Should i crush the beans instead of grinding them? Would it still need brew bag/cheesecloth?

BTW the unground batch was very deep and smooth, less acidic. Needed some instant coffee for punch though it was the base for pic #3 Mocha Cookie Fudge. 

Grinds batch after straining did have the grinds affect mouthfeel so i called it ""Artisanal Coffee"" so i turned it into an upside lol. This batch had more acidity and completely powerful flavor which i loved as a coffee addict. Feels like an espresso shot to the soul. 

Pic 1: artisanal coffee, 2: strain #5, 3: mocha cookie fudge

Not sure if i should give out my location and store name but would love some input :)

1. Mesh strainer (coarse)
2. Single layer of fine cheesecloth
3. Multiple layers of fine cheesecloth
4. Coffee filter

This works well for steps 1-3 to filter out most of what I want to remove, but I want to get it as clear as possible, which is why I have the coffee filter.

My problem is that at step 4, the filter always gets clogged up really quick and stops filtering and I end up needing to switch filters many times which is slow. I assume that there's too much in terms of fine particles in there still and I'm wondering if there's some intermediate filtering I should be doing before the coffee filter, or if anyone has any advice for me.

A group of people broke into my house last night, but nothing was stolen. You can have everything. I don't think I'm coming home.","*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me they didn‚Äôt steal‚Ä¶anything? Nothing at all?‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*‚ÄúLet me make sure I‚Äôm getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just‚Ä¶moving your furniture around? That‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what‚Ä¶open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let‚Äôs try this one more time,*¬†I thought.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to their intent, sir. And that‚Äôs not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.‚Äù*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn‚Äôt completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*‚ÄúI guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That‚Äôs when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*‚ÄúWhat do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?‚Äù*¬†I asked, impatient to learn what he‚Äôd written.

*‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶no, probably not.‚Äù*¬†He snorted.¬†*‚ÄúI have an important question, though.‚Äù*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop‚Äôs previously stoic lips couldn‚Äôt help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*‚ÄúWhat song was it?‚Äù*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*‚ÄúMy Dark Star by The London Suede,‚Äù*¬†I replied automatically.

*‚ÄúHuh, I don‚Äôt know that one,‚Äù*¬†said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn‚Äôt actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I‚Äôd never listened to that song before last night. Didn‚Äôt know any other tracks by¬†*The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I‚Äôd google the track once they left. It¬†*was*¬†what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*‚ÄúThese were my guesses.‚Äù*

In scribbled ink, it read¬†*‚ÄúBad Romance? The Macarena?‚Äù*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add¬†*assaulting a lawman*¬†to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town‚Äôs tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn‚Äôt necessarily¬†*need*¬†to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and it wasn‚Äôt like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it¬†*way*¬†below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She‚Äôd see that I could maintain our ‚Äústandard of living‚Äù, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I¬†*am*¬†a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn‚Äôt endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?*¬†I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù*¬†I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don‚Äôt know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn‚Äôt where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn‚Äôt see any of their details.

The picture wasn‚Äôt poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just‚Ä¶dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from¬†*within*¬†the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn‚Äôt believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house‚Äôs back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*‚ÄúBut she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‚ÄòOh, how my dark star will rise,‚Äô*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.‚Äù*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she‚Äôd get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*‚Äú\****Who, THE FUCK, are‚Ä¶‚Äù***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house‚Äôs perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn‚Äôt creative enough, and two, she wasn‚Äôt truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from outside the house like I‚Äôd thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room‚Ä¶*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I‚Äôm just forgetting the layout. I haven‚Äôt been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of ‚Äú\*My Dark Star‚Äù\*were coming from the room I couldn‚Äôt remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear¬†*My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint¬†*precisely*¬†where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the surface of the wall, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn‚Äôt real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as¬†*My Dark Star*¬†faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star*¬†began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become crowded over time, and each one was fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into two saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its torso. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don‚Äôt need you, I don‚Äôt need him, I don‚Äôt need any of it.

I‚Äôve found an unconditional love.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù*¬†I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don‚Äôt know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn‚Äôt where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn‚Äôt see any of their details.

The picture wasn‚Äôt poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just‚Ä¶dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from¬†*within*¬†the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn‚Äôt believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house‚Äôs back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*‚ÄúBut she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‚ÄòOh, how my dark star will rise,‚Äô*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.‚Äù*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she‚Äôd get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*‚Äú\****Who, THE FUCK, are‚Ä¶‚Äù***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house‚Äôs perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn‚Äôt creative enough, and two, she wasn‚Äôt truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from outside the house like I‚Äôd thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room‚Ä¶*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I‚Äôm just forgetting the layout. I haven‚Äôt been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of ‚Äú*My Dark Star‚Äù*were coming from the room I couldn‚Äôt remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear¬†*My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint¬†*precisely*¬†where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the surface of the wall, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn‚Äôt real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as¬†*My Dark Star*¬†faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star*¬†began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become crowded over time, and each one was fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into two saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its torso. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don‚Äôt need you, I don‚Äôt need him, I don‚Äôt need any of it.

I‚Äôve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find¬†*me*, well,

You know where to go, but I‚Äôll tell you¬†*when*¬†to go.

11:58 PM, every night.

If you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.

1k81jh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k81jh2/blair_this_is_finn_a_group_of_people_broke_into/,"Blair, this is Finn. A group of people broke into my house last night, but nothing was stolen. You can have everything. I don't think I'm coming home.","*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me they didn‚Äôt steal‚Ä¶anything? Nothing at all?‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no. I mean, I haven‚Äôt exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*‚ÄúLet me make sure I‚Äôm getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just‚Ä¶moving your furniture around? That‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what‚Ä¶open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let‚Äôs try this one more time,*¬†I thought.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to their intent, sir. And that‚Äôs not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.‚Äù*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn‚Äôt completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*‚ÄúI guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That‚Äôs when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*‚ÄúWhat do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?‚Äù*¬†I asked, impatient to learn what he‚Äôd written.

*‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶no, probably not.‚Äù*¬†He snorted.¬†*‚ÄúI have an important question, though.‚Äù*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop‚Äôs previously stoic lips couldn‚Äôt help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*‚ÄúWhat song was it?‚Äù*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*‚ÄúMy Dark Star by The London Suede,‚Äù*¬†I replied automatically.

*‚ÄúHuh, I don‚Äôt know that one,‚Äù*¬†said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn‚Äôt actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I‚Äôd never listened to that song before last night. Didn‚Äôt know any other tracks by¬†*The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I‚Äôd google the track once they left. It¬†*was*¬†what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*‚ÄúThese were my guesses.‚Äù*

In scribbled ink, it read¬†*‚ÄúBad Romance? The Macarena?‚Äù*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add¬†*assaulting a lawman*¬†to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town‚Äôs tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren‚Äôt the¬†*exact*¬†words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn‚Äôt necessarily¬†*need*¬†to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and it wasn‚Äôt like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it¬†*way*¬†below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She‚Äôd see that I could maintain our ‚Äústandard of living‚Äù, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I¬†*am*¬†a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn‚Äôt endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?*¬†I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star*¬†began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become crowded over time, and each one was fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into two saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its torso. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

\- - - - -

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don‚Äôt need you, I don‚Äôt need him, I don‚Äôt need any of it.

I‚Äôve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find¬†*me*, well,

You know where to go, but I‚Äôll tell you¬†*when*¬†to go.

11:58 PM, every night.

If you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1k81h8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1k81h8c/blair_this_is_finn_a_group_of_people_broke_into/,"Blair, this is Finn. A group of people broke into my house last night, but nothing was stolen. You can have everything. I don't think I'm coming home.","*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me they didn‚Äôt steal‚Ä¶anything? Nothing at all?‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no. I mean, I haven‚Äôt exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*‚ÄúLet me make sure I‚Äôm getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just‚Ä¶moving your furniture around? That‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what‚Ä¶open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let‚Äôs try this one more time,* I thought.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to their intent, sir. And that‚Äôs not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.‚Äù*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn‚Äôt completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*‚ÄúI guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That‚Äôs when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged.  I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù* he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*‚ÄúWhat do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?‚Äù* I asked, impatient to learn what he‚Äôd written.

*‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶no, probably not.‚Äù* He snorted. *‚ÄúI have an important question, though.‚Äù*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop‚Äôs previously stoic lips couldn‚Äôt help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*‚ÄúWhat song was it?‚Äù*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*‚ÄúMy Dark Star by The London Suede,‚Äù* I replied automatically.

*‚ÄúHuh, I don‚Äôt know that one,‚Äù* said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn‚Äôt actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I‚Äôd never listened to that song before last night. Didn‚Äôt know any other tracks by *The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I‚Äôd google the track once they left. It *was* what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*‚ÄúThese were my guesses.‚Äù*

In scribbled ink, it read *‚ÄúBad Romance? The Macarena?‚Äù*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add *assaulting a lawman* to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town‚Äôs tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren‚Äôt the *exact* words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - - 

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn‚Äôt necessarily *need* to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and it wasn‚Äôt like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn‚Äôt understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She‚Äôd see that I could maintain our ‚Äústandard of living‚Äù, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn‚Äôt endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - - 

*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don‚Äôt know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn‚Äôt where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn‚Äôt see any of their details.

The picture wasn‚Äôt poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just‚Ä¶dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn‚Äôt believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house‚Äôs back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*‚ÄúBut she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‚ÄòOh, how my dark star will rise,‚Äô*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.‚Äù*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she‚Äôd get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

*‚Äú****Who, THE FUCK, are‚Ä¶‚Äù***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house‚Äôs perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house is a half-mile away. Blair wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn‚Äôt creative enough, and two, she wasn‚Äôt truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from outside the house like I‚Äôd thought.

\- - - - - 

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room‚Ä¶*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I‚Äôm just forgetting the layout. I haven‚Äôt been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of ‚Äú*My Dark Star‚Äù* were coming from the room I couldn‚Äôt remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the surface of the wall, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn‚Äôt real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - - 

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become crowded over time, and each one was fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into two saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its torso. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

Blair, I hope you see this.

The door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.

You can have everything.

The house, the money, the cars.

You can keep Thomas, too.

I don‚Äôt need you, I don‚Äôt need him, I don‚Äôt need any of it.

I‚Äôve found an unconditional love.

I hope someday you find one, too.

If you ever need to find *me*, well,

You know where to go, but I‚Äôll tell you *when* to go.

11:58 PM, every night. 

If you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.

Gregor would love to meet him.

I've been very sexually frustrated after my divorce and I frequently masturbated myself with a dildo inside my room and I knew my son could hear my moans as I masturbated. 

How it all started:
A few months ago when I went to clean his room I noticed one of my panties was under his desk and it was covered in dried cum. I picked it up and put it under my nose and smelled it. The smell was intoxicating to me. I didn't say anything to him about my discovery and let him have the freedom to continue to cum on all my panties. Sometimes I intentionally wore the panties with my son's fresh cum on them. It turned me on like crazy and I would have the most powerful orgasm later when I fucked myself, knnowing that I've been wearing cum-laden panties.

Because of my free rein on my son's behavior, he has seemingly become emboldened. He not only cummed in my panties, but also on my bras, my dress, my skirt, etc. As always, I pretended not to notice and simply wore whatever piece of clothing that had his dried cum on them and washed the cum off later.  It seriously turned me on knowing that I've been wearing clothing with my son's cum on them.

how it escalated:
One morning, my son told me he made me coffee and carried a cup to me directly. It was unusual for him to make coffee and as I drank it, he stared at me with the most strange excitement. I stared back at him cluelessly and when I tasted a trace of his cum in my coffee, I shuddered and everything was clear to me. But once again I pretended not to know what he was doing.

Later that evening he carried a cup of milk to my room and told me its good to have a cup of milk before sleep. I could see his wild excitement as I drank his milk. He asked me how does his milk taste, and, still, collecting my composure and acting like I was completely oblivious, I told him that his milk tasted very sweet and mommy loved it. 

I don't know if it's my pretending to not to know or what but he's been getting more and more flagrant. When he made coffee in the morning, he'd ask if my coffee tasted different and I said no. Then the next day he carried my coffee cup into the bathroom and came out and I could clearly see white gluey cum in my coffee and he even told me that he added his special sweetener in my coffee just for me because ""I love you, mom.""

I drank his cum laced coffee as usual and patted on his head and I said that he's a good boy. Inside though, I started to shake and wonder whether at some point he's going to want to deposit his cum inside me directly.",6,1745630493.0,incestGW,4,0.88,False

After much procrastination ü§£, I‚Äôm incredibly proud to say that I have finished developing the Dune Weaver Pro. For those of you who haven‚Äôt heard of it before, Dune Weaver is a kinetic sand table that creates mesmerizing patterns using a marble that moves on a sand bed.

I spent the last couple of months working on this and you can build one right now with me if you want to. For now, the model is available for a fee on my Patreon page (https://patreon.com/duneweaver) for early supporters, and I plan to release the model for free later this year.

The Dune Weaver Pro is a 75-cm fully functioning coffee table that will impress anyone who looks at it. The table is powered by two stepper motors and 3d printed gears that control the angular and radial movements of a magnet. This magnet will move a magnetic marble on a surface with sand, which in turn creates stunning patterns. This isn‚Äôt just a piece of furniture; it‚Äôs a conversation starter, a source of relaxation after your long day, and a fantastic project to learn new skills. We‚Äôd be working with 3D printed parts, motors, electronics, Raspberry Pi, and DLC32 and deploying code to these devices. The project costs me $250 Canadian dollars, but your mileage may vary, depending on what you have on hand.

I had a question regarding a non-dot drug test. Wednesday I had taken a pre-employment non-dot drug test but was informed by my employer friday morning that it came back as negative diluted. My employer reached out to me asking for a retake which i happily complied even taking it same day 4 hour notice to avoid any delays. He informed me to watch my water intake to avoid dilution again which i did and did not drink any water that day, however I am an avid caffeine consumer ( drinking 2-3 of caffeine a day ranging from yerba mate, vietnamese coffee, and redbull) and it was the only drinks i consumed to help me urinate before my test. After reading online, i came across that diuretic may also increases chances of providing negative dilution and now i am becoming worried. For reference i am a very active judoka therefore i drink a gallon a water a day, and very much during practice. My urine has always been light yellow/pale. My urine during the test was also light/pale yellow. What are the odds of my urine being marked as negative diluted again? Should i express this concern to my employer? The only instruction he provided was to not drink so much water ( which i did ) and nothing regarding caffeinated drinks. I dont do drugs as i regularly compete and now i am worried that it will count as negative dilution again. I couldnt find any of their policy regarding drug testing and was unsure what the usual procedure for something like this is. All insights, and personal experience will be greatly appreciated.

thanks everyone for their insight.

Edit: I would also like to inform that i drank 20oz bottle of gatorade at 11:30am, alongside a cup of orange juice, small vietnamese coffee and an 8oz of redbull around 2:20pm alongside my meal, and i had to urnite very bad which i did and drank another 8oz of redbull at 3:15pm to help me urinate before taking my test at 4:00pm.",1,1745630185.0,AskHR,2,0.6,False

I stepped off the bus into Nevada heat that punched through my uniform. The driver tossed my duffel beside me and pulled away, leaving a cloud of dust that settled on my polished boots. Behind a chain-link fence topped with razor wire stood Bravo Mike‚Äîseven squat buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a central courtyard. Nothing special. Nothing that screamed classified.



A corporal met me at the gate. ""Wilson? Follow me.""



The processing took less than an hour. I signed forms without reading them, got assigned quarters, and received my shift schedule. No welcome speech, no tour. Just paperwork and a set of keys. The corporal pointed me toward the barracks and walked away. So much for orientation.



My room was standard military‚Äîtwin bed, metal desk, small closet. The window faced west, showing nothing but desert and distant mountains. I unpacked my few personal items, made my bed to regulation corners, and sat down to write my mother. Halfway through the letter, I realized I couldn't tell her anything about where I was or what I'd be doing. I ended up with three paragraphs about the weather and a promise to call when I could.



That night, I reported for my first shift. The operations center sat in the middle of the base‚Äîa windowless concrete box with a single reinforced door. Inside, screens lined the walls showing radar sweeps, atmospheric readings, and satellite imagery. Eight workstations faced the screens, each with its own computer setup and uncomfortable chair.



""Wilson,"" a voice called from behind me. ""Station four is yours.""



I turned to see a woman about my age with auburn hair pulled tight into a regulation bun. She held a clipboard and looked me over without smiling.



""Thanks. And you are?""



""Bane. Natalie Bane. I'm on your rotation."" She handed me a thick binder. ""Standard operating procedures. Memorize it by tomorrow.""



I took the binder. ""What exactly are we monitoring?""



Her expression didn't change. ""Atmospheric disturbances.""



""What kind of‚Äî""



""Just read the manual, Wilson."" She walked away, posture straight as a ruler.



The night crawled by. I watched numbers change on screens, logged readings every thirty minutes, and fought to stay awake. Nothing in my training had prepared me for the pure tedium of Bravo Mike. By morning, I'd read the entire manual and still had no clear idea what we were looking for.



Three days later, I was eating alone in the mess when Bane sat across from me, dropping her tray with a clatter.



""Wilson,"" she said, fork already stabbing at something pretending to be meatloaf.



""Bane.""



We ate in silence for a few minutes. The mess hall hummed with low conversations, metal scraping against trays, the kitchen staff yelling orders.



""Did you figure it out yet?"" she finally asked.



""Figure what out?""



She leaned forward. ""What we're actually doing here.""



I shook my head. ""Atmospheric monitoring seems pretty straightforward.""



She snorted. ""Right. And they need a hundred personnel and triple-layer security for that.""



I glanced around, lowering my voice. ""You think there's something else?""



""I know there is."" She took a bite, chewed, swallowed. ""Whatever we're watching for, it's not just weather.""



Before I could respond, the mess hall door swung open and Sergeant Thomas Cooper walked in. The room went quiet. Cooper was tall with the kind of military bearing that made you want to stand at attention even in the shower. His eyes swept the room once, paused briefly on our table, then moved on. The conversations slowly resumed, but quieter than before.



""That's our fearless leader,"" Natalie said, not looking up from her food. ""Sergeant Cooper. Man of mystery and zero explanations.""



""You've worked with him before?""



""Six months. Never heard him say more than twenty words at a time."" She pushed her tray away. ""Just follow orders, Wilson. That's all anyone does here.""



Weeks passed. The desert winter brought cold nights and clear skies. I settled into the rhythm of Bravo Mike‚Äîeat, work, sleep, repeat. The tedium became comfortable. I got to know the others on my shift rotation. Martinez always brought homemade jerky. Chen could solve crosswords in ten minutes flat. Rogers kept a picture of his kids hidden under his keyboard.



And then there was Natalie. We got paired on night shifts often, midnight to eight, when the base slept and the screens glowed in the dark. She relaxed around three a.m., when the coffee kicked in and fatigue lowered defenses. We talked about home, about training, about the food in the mess hall. Never about what we were monitoring.



""I'm from Michigan,"" she told me one night, feet propped on her desk. ""Little town on Lake Huron you never heard of.""



""Try me.""



""Harrisville.""



I laughed. ""My grandparents had a cabin in Greenbush. We went up every summer.""



Her eyes lit up. ""No way. Small world.""



After that, night shifts felt less like duty and more like time with a friend. We developed a shorthand for the boring parts of the job. She'd catch me nodding off and flick paper clips at my head. I'd bring extra coffee when she looked tired. Small things. Normal things in an abnormal place.



Cooper rarely visited during night shifts. When he did, it was just to check logs and leave. No small talk, no interest in his personnel beyond their function. I heard stories from others‚Äîhow he'd dress down anyone who asked too many questions, how he kept his own quarters separate from everyone else's, how no one had ever seen him laugh.



""Blind obedience,"" Natalie whispered one night after he left. ""That's his motto.""



I shrugged. ""He's military.""



""There's military, and then there's whatever Cooper is.""



January slipped into February. Nothing changed in the rhythm of Bravo Mike except the temperature outside. I'd been there long enough to stop counting days. Long enough that most nights I could do my job on autopilot, logging readings without really seeing them. Long enough that Natalie started bringing extra granola bars because she noticed I always got hungry around four.



On February 18th, I showed up for midnight shift as usual. Chen was finishing his rotation, eyes bloodshot from eight hours of screen time.



""All quiet,"" he said, standing up from station four. ""Enjoy the boredom.""



I settled in, logging my start time. Natalie arrived five minutes later, coffee already in hand.



""Extra shot of espresso tonight,"" she said, taking her seat at station six. ""Had a feeling we might need it.""



I didn't ask why. Some nights she just had hunches.



The first four hours passed like any other shift. We monitored, we logged, we talked about nothing important. At 4:17 a.m., the door opened. Cooper walked in, looking exactly as he always did‚Äîpressed uniform, perfect posture, expression carved from stone. But something was different. It took me a second to realize he was carrying a sealed manila envelope.



He walked straight to my station. ""Wilson.""



I sat up straighter. ""Yes, Sergeant?""



""You have new orders."" He placed the envelope on my desk. ""Read them, memorize them, then destroy them. You have five minutes.""



He stepped back, watching me. I felt Natalie's eyes on me too, but didn't look her way. The envelope had no markings except a red stamp reading ""CLASSIFIED"" across the seal. I broke it open and pulled out a single sheet of paper.



The orders were simple but made no sense. I was to proceed to Building C, Room 217, and wait for further instruction. I was not to discuss these orders with anyone. I was not to deviate from the prescribed route. I was to bring no electronic devices.



I memorized the instructions, then handed the paper back to Cooper. He took a lighter from his pocket and burned it, letting the ashes fall into a trash can.



""Report to Building C now,"" he said. ""Bane, you're coming too.""



Natalie looked up, surprised. ""Me, Sergeant?""



""Different assignment, same destination. Move out.""



We followed Cooper out of the operations center into the cold desert night. Stars filled the sky, so many they seemed to crowd each other out. Our breath made clouds in front of us as we walked across the courtyard toward Building C‚Äîthe one structure at Bravo Mike I'd never entered.



Cooper unlocked a series of doors, each requiring different keys and codes. The deeper we went, the heavier the doors became. The final door was steel, at least six inches thick, with no handle on our side. Cooper entered a code, placed his palm on a scanner, and stepped back as the door slid open.



""Inside,"" he said.



The room beyond was small and spartanly furnished‚Äîa few chairs arranged in a line facing a reinforced window that took up most of one wall. The window looked out on nothing but darkness. Four other airmen were already seated, staring straight ahead. I recognized Martinez and Rogers from our shift rotation. The other two were from different rotations‚ÄîPeterson and Chang, I thought.



Natalie took a seat, and I sat beside her. Cooper remained by the door, checking his watch.



""You are here to observe only,"" he said, his voice flatter than usual. ""What happens outside that window is classified Level Eight. You will not discuss it with anyone, not even each other, after you leave this room. Is that clear?""



Six voices answered as one: ""Yes, Sergeant.""



Cooper nodded once. ""ETA three minutes.""



No one spoke after that. I glanced at Natalie, but her focus was on the window. Outside, I could now make out a perimeter road running along the base fence line. Floodlights activated suddenly, illuminating the area in harsh white light. In the distance, dust plumes rose from the desert floor.



A convoy of vehicles appeared, racing toward the base at high speed. Five vehicles‚Äîthree armored personnel carriers sandwiching two heavy transport trucks. They swerved occasionally, as if avoiding obstacles, but maintained their heading toward the base.



Behind them, at first just a dark mass against the horizon, something moved. Something big. As it neared the floodlights' range, I caught glimpses of shape‚Äîimpossibly tall, with multiple limbs that seemed to both walk and flow across the desert floor. It moved with fluid grace despite its size, closing the gap on the convoy with each stride.



My mouth went dry. Beside me, Natalie's breathing quickened. I felt her hand find mine in the darkness, gripping tight.



The door behind us opened. Cooper stepped back in, his face drained of color. He looked at each of us in turn, then at the window where the creature was now clearly visible‚Äîa nightmare fifty feet tall, with jointed legs like a spider's and a mockery of a human face stretched across what might have been a head.



""You are to watch only,"" he said, his voice hollow. ""Under no circumstances are you to interfere or attempt to engage the entity. This is a direct order.""



The sirens started wailing mid-sentence, cutting through Cooper's order with a sound like steel being tortured. I jolted in my chair. Everyone did. The floodlights outside flickered twice, then blazed even brighter, painting harsh shadows across the desert.



Cooper's radio crackled. He pulled it from his belt, listened for three seconds, then slammed it back into place.



""Stay here,"" he barked, and was gone through the door before anyone could respond.



I turned back to the window. The convoy had reached the outer fence, the lead vehicle smashing through the gate in a shower of chain-link and concrete. Behind them, the thing‚ÄîGoliath, I heard someone whisper‚Äîmoved with a grace that defied its bulk. Its limbs bent at impossible angles, covering ground in loping strides that ate up the distance between it and the perimeter wall.



""Jesus,"" Martinez breathed next to me. ""It has to be thirty feet tall.""



It was bigger than that. Much bigger.



Natalie's fingers dug into my sleeve, but I couldn't look away from the window to check on her. The creature moved like nothing I'd ever seen‚Äînot running exactly, but flowing, each limb finding perfect placement despite its speed. It reached the perimeter wall just as the last convoy vehicle cleared the inner gate.



Personnel scattered across the compound. Some ran for cover. Others moved with purpose toward defensive positions I hadn't known existed. Mounted guns emerged from hidden emplacements along the wall. Soldiers poured from barracks buildings in various states of dress, grabbing weapons from an armory truck that had appeared in the center of the base.



Goliath hit the wall and didn't slow. Its front limbs‚Äîtoo many, I couldn't count them‚Äîlatched onto the concrete. The thing's body twisted, and it went up and over the thirty-foot barrier like a spider scaling a bathroom tile. No hesitation. No effort.



Something caught in my throat.



""They can't stop it,"" Chang said from the end of the row. ""Nothing could stop that.""



A single shot cracked through the night. Then another. Then a barrage as panic spread through the ranks outside. The guards on the wall opened fire against orders, their discipline crumbling in the face of the impossible. Tracer rounds cut bright paths through the darkness, passing through the creature's body as if through smoke. It didn't flinch. Didn't even seem to notice.



Once inside the wall, Goliath moved with terrible purpose. It surged toward the nearest cluster of soldiers, limbs extended. I couldn't see clearly what happened next‚Äîjust bodies flying, blood spraying in patterns too perfect to be real. Screams reached us even through the reinforced glass.



""We have to help,"" I said, half-rising. No one moved with me.



""Orders,"" Rogers muttered, though he looked sick.



Outside, Cooper appeared from a side door, running toward a group of soldiers who'd formed a defensive line. He grabbed a radio from one of them, shouting orders we couldn't hear. More personnel emerged from buildings, taking up positions, creating a corridor through which the convoy could pass.



The trucks and APCs made straight for the largest structure on base‚Äîa hangar I'd only ever seen from the outside. Doors three stories high began to slide open, revealing darkness within.



Goliath paused, its head-like upper section swiveling toward the hangar. It changed direction instantly, abandoning a group of soldiers it had been cutting through. It moved toward the convoy with new urgency.



Cooper saw it coming. He directed soldiers to fall back, waving them toward secondary positions. Too slow. Far too slow. Goliath covered the distance in seconds, looming over Cooper and the men around him. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Cooper stood his ground, sidearm raised in a gesture that seemed almost comical given the scale of the threat.



The creature's limb lashed out faster than I could track. Cooper disappeared in its grip, lifted high above the ground. For a terrible moment I could see him struggling, a tiny figure against the night sky.



Then he came apart.



There's no other way to say it. His body separated into pieces, and those pieces fell like rain onto the men below. The blood looked black under the floodlights. A sound escaped Natalie beside me‚Äînot quite a scream, something smaller and more broken.



I found myself on my feet without remembering standing. My palm pressed against the glass, useless. Natalie's nails dug into my other arm, breaking skin. I barely felt it. Outside, soldiers died by the dozens. Some shot themselves rather than be taken by the creature. Others ran blindly, only to be snatched up and torn apart.



The convoy reached the hangar. The middle truck backed in first, followed by the others. Soldiers swarmed around them, unloading something long and cylindrical from the lead vehicle. It took eight men to carry it, moving with urgent care toward the depths of the hangar. Whatever it was, they treated it like it might shatter‚Äîor explode.



Once it disappeared inside, the hangar doors began to close. Goliath froze in place. Its limbs retracted slightly, drawing close to its body. The misshapen head turned, scanning the compound with a deliberate motion that somehow conveyed intelligence.



Then, with the same fluid motion it had approached with, it retreated. It scaled the wall again, dropping to the other side, and moved back into the desert darkness from which it had emerged. Within seconds, it was just a silhouette against the stars. Then nothing at all.



The silence that followed seemed heavier than the chaos before it. On base, survivors stumbled between bodies. Medics appeared with stretchers that quickly ran out. The wounded screamed for help that couldn't come fast enough. The dead stared upward, their faces masks of terror frozen in place.



No one in our viewing room spoke. What was there to say? We'd watched dozens of our fellow airmen die in ways that defied understanding. We'd seen our commanding officer torn to pieces. We'd witnessed something impossible.



We sat there until the first gray light of dawn crept over the eastern mountains. No one came to dismiss us or give new orders. The six of us stayed, shoulder to shoulder, afraid to be the first to move, afraid to break whatever fragile thing was keeping us sane.



The blood on my arm dried where Natalie's nails had dug in. I didn't wipe it away. It was the only thing that felt real.



I woke to a fist pounding on my door. Didn't remember falling asleep. My clothes felt glued to my skin, stiff with dried sweat. The clock read 09:17.



""Wilson! Open up!""



Military police. Two of them filled my doorway in combat gear with sidearms unholstered. Behind them stood a man in a dark suit who looked like he'd stepped out of a government pamphlet‚Äîcrew cut, blank expression, unremarkable in every way that screamed federal agent.



""Come with us,"" the taller MP said.



I didn't ask questions. Didn't even change clothes. The base looked wrong in daylight‚Äîbloodstains on concrete, bullet casings scattered like seeds, body bags lined up outside the infirmary. Twenty-seven of them. I counted twice.



They led me to the admin building and into a windowless room with a metal table bolted to the floor. The suit followed, closing the door with a click that echoed like a gunshot.



""James Wilson,"" he said, not a question. ""I'm Agent Reed. You're going to tell me everything you saw.""



The questions went on for hours. Each answer recorded, timestamped, filed away. I told him about the convoy, the creature, Cooper. My throat went dry. They didn't offer water.



""Did the entity communicate with anyone?"" Reed asked.



""No.""



""Did you observe any weaknesses?""



""Bullets passed through it.""



""Were there any unusual smells, sounds, or atmospheric disturbances?""



I remembered the stillness before it appeared. ""No.""



More questions. Same ones rephrased. Reed checking my face for lies I wasn't telling. Eventually he slid papers across the table‚Äîpages of legal text with red tabs marking signature lines.



""Standard non-disclosure agreement,"" he said.



Nothing standard about it. Phrases jumped out like warnings: ""lifetime obligation,"" ""matters of national security,"" ""prosecution for treason,"" ""minimum penalty.""



""What happens if I don't sign?""



Reed didn't blink. ""Prison. For a very long time.""



I signed.



They released me at sunset. I stumbled back to my quarters past clean-up crews hosing blood into drains. No sign of the bodies. No sign anything had happened except for sections of missing wall and bullet holes in concrete.



My room had been searched. Drawers left open, bed stripped, personal items moved. I collapsed anyway, too empty to care.



At 06:00 the next morning, transfer orders arrived‚ÄîOsan Air Base, South Korea. Effective immediately. A corporal I'd never seen before handed me the paperwork and said I had two hours to pack.



I tried calling Natalie's quarters. No answer. Went to her barracks. Found it empty, bed stripped, closet cleaned out. Asked around. No one had seen her.



Forty minutes before my transport left, I found Martinez loading his gear into a truck.



""You seen Bane?"" I asked.



He glanced around before answering. ""Ramstein.""



""Germany?""



""Shipped out at dawn. They're scattering everyone who was in that room."" He slammed the truck door shut. ""Don't try to contact anyone. They're watching.""



The flight to Osan lasted sixteen hours. I spent it staring at the seat back, replaying that night, seeing Cooper pulled apart, hearing the screams cut short. The airman next to me asked twice if I was okay. I lied both times.



South Korea blurred past. Days became weeks. I did my job. Filed reports. Followed orders. At night, I wrote letters to Natalie that came back stamped ""UNDELIVERABLE."" Sent emails that bounced. Called numbers that didn't connect.



After three months, a message reached my terminal: ""Stop trying. ‚ÄîN""



I stopped.



The nightmares started in month four. Always the same‚ÄîGoliath finding me, lifting me like it had Cooper, my body coming apart like cheap fabric. I'd wake twisted in sheets, throat raw from screams I hadn't heard myself make.



My roommate requested a transfer. Can't blame him.



The military doctor prescribed pills that turned the dreams to static. Better than watching myself die every night. I took them until they stopped working, then got stronger ones. Worked my way through the pharmacy until nothing helped.



Found bourbon instead.



Finished my service in 2013 and settled in Denver. Rented a one-bedroom near downtown and landed an IT security job I could do half-drunk. The HR manager who hired me had a brother in the Air Force. Military discount, she called it.



Tried therapy. VA doc with a beard and coffee breath who nodded at my vague descriptions of ""combat trauma"" and wrote prescriptions that joined the others in my medicine cabinet. Couldn't tell him the truth. Couldn't tell anyone.



Tuesday nights I'd meet other vets at a bar off Colfax. They talked about Afghanistan, Iraq, IEDs, and firefights. Real horrors, human horrors. I'd nod like I understood, drink until their faces blurred, then stumble home to my empty apartment.



Six years passed. I functioned. Held jobs. Dated women who eventually got tired of the parts of me I couldn't explain. Drank less, worked more. Started running until my lungs burned and my legs went numb. Pain helped. Made other things fade.



In 2019, I was doing contract work for a Seattle firm. Security audit, two weeks on-site. Boring work in a rainy city. One night I walked into a twenty-four-hour diner near my hotel, soaked from a sudden downpour.



And there she was. Natalie. Sitting in a corner booth with medical textbooks spread around her, red pen between her teeth, hair pulled back in the same tight bun. Six years older but unmistakable.



She looked up as the bell above the door jingled. Our eyes met. Neither of us moved.



""Wilson,"" she finally said, red pen hovering.



""Bane.""



The waitress appeared, coffee pot in hand. I ordered a cup I didn't want. Walked to Natalie's booth and sat without asking. She closed her books, one by one.



""You look..."" she started.



""Older.""



""I was going to say dry. It's pouring outside.""



""I just came in.""



Awkward silence stretched between us, years of it packed into seconds. I suddenly couldn't remember why I'd approached her. What was there to say?



She broke first. ""Do you still have the dreams?""



The question hit like cold water. No preamble, no small talk. Just straight to the wound.



""Every night,"" I admitted.



""Me too."" She pushed a textbook aside. ""Sometimes I think I see it on the street, just for a second. A shape that doesn't fit. A shadow that moves wrong.""



""I check the locks twice,"" I said. ""Always.""



""Three times,"" she countered with half a smile.



We talked until the waitress stopped refilling our cups. Traded theories about what Goliath was, why the government covered it up, where it came from. Compared transfer locations, dead ends, nightmares. Discovered we'd both tried the same medications with the same results.



I came back the next night. And the next. My two-week contract stretched to three. We moved from the diner to a bar, from the bar to walks along the waterfront. On my last night in Seattle, she invited me back to her apartment.



It wasn't romantic. We were two broken pieces that somehow fit together. Two people who didn't have to lie about the worst night of their lives. The relief of that was better than any painkiller.



I extended my stay again. Found local work. Moved into a studio twenty minutes from her place. We dated like normal people‚Äîdinner, movies, weekend trips to the coast. But underneath it ran a current of shared trauma that kept us close when any sane person would've walked away.



""Sometimes I think they put us in different countries to see if we'd break,"" she said one night, fingers tracing circles on my chest. ""Like an experiment.""



""Did you?""



""Break? No."" She shook her head against my shoulder. ""Bend, maybe. You?""



""Same.""



When she moved in with me six months later, the nightmares came less often. By the time I proposed a year after that, they'd faded to once a week. Sometimes less.



We got married in a courthouse with two strangers as witnesses. No family, no friends. Just us, the way it had been since that night in Room 217. Easier that way. Fewer questions about how we met, where we served, why we woke up screaming.



Natalie finished nursing school. I built my security consulting business. We bought a small house in the suburbs with good schools nearby. Planted a garden. Got a dog. Normal life. Suburban life. The kind of life that feels like a shield against darker things.



Robert was born on a cold January morning in 2022. Seven pounds, four ounces. Perfect in every way. The moment I held him, something shifted inside me‚Äîa wall coming down or a light coming on. I'd been broken for so long I'd forgotten what wholeness felt like.



""He has your eyes,"" Natalie said, exhausted and beautiful in her hospital bed.



""Your nose.""



""Poor kid.""



We brought him home to a nursery painted soft blue. A mobile hung above his crib‚Äîstars and moons spinning in lazy circles. At night I'd hold him while Natalie slept, watching his tiny chest rise and fall, listening to his breath.



The nightmares stopped completely. Not fewer‚Äîgone. For the first time in thirteen years, I slept through the night. Every night.



We settled into routines. Diaper changes, midnight feedings, first smiles. Natalie worked three twelve-hour shifts at the hospital while I stayed home with Robert. Then we'd switch‚Äîshe'd take over while I caught up on client work. We were tired in the good way parents are tired. Normal tired.



I built a security system for our house. Motion sensors, cameras, smart locks. Natalie pretended not to notice I checked the footage every morning. I pretended not to notice the bat she kept by the bed. Old habits, worn smooth like river stones.



Some nights we'd sit on the back porch after Robert went down, drinking beer and watching stars come out. Not talking much. Not needing to. The weight we carried had become familiar, almost comfortable in its constancy.



""Do you ever wonder if it's still out there?"" she asked once.



""No,"" I lied.



""Me neither,"" she lied back.



But we both knew better. Something that large, that impossible, doesn't just disappear. The government didn't lock us down because it was a one-time event. They did it because they knew it would happen again.



Still, we had built something good. Something real. A life filled with first steps and client meetings and Sunday pancakes. A life where Goliath was just a fading memory, a story we'd never tell our son.



I pulled the stack of mail from our box and thumbed through it on the walk back to the house. Bills. Credit card offer. Something from Natalie's sister. And beneath that, a manila envelope with no return address.



My fingers knew before my brain caught up. Same weight. Same texture. Same government issue I hadn't held in thirteen years.



I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Our neighbor's sprinklers ticked through their cycle. A kid rode past on a bike, baseball card clicking in the spokes. I turned the envelope over and checked the postmark. Rachel, Nevada.



The only thing in Rachel was dust and the road to Bravo Mike.



Inside our kitchen, I set the other mail down and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Careful cut along the top edge. Clean. Controlled. The knife shook anyway.



Inside was a note card. Three words in red ink: ""He is coming.""



The handwriting wasn't Cooper's. Cooper was dead. I'd watched him die. But someone from Bravo Mike had sent this. Someone who knew.



I fumbled for my phone and hit Natalie's contact. It rang five times before she answered.



""Hey,"" she said, sounds of the hospital bustling behind her. ""I'm between patients. Everything okay?""



""No."" My voice came out wrong‚Äîtight and small. ""You need to come home. Now.""



A pause. ""What happened?""



""Bravo Mike.""



Two words. That's all it took. I heard her breathing change.



""I'll tell them it's an emergency,"" she said. ""Twenty minutes.""



I hung up and opened the hall closet. Behind winter coats and shoe boxes were two black duffel bags we'd packed years ago. Grab-and-go bags with cash, documents, clothes, first aid kits. Things we hoped we'd never need. I pulled them out and set them by the front door.



Next was Robert's room. He was napping, one arm flung above his head, blanket kicked off. I gathered his essentials as quietly as I could‚Äîdiapers, wipes, formula, clothes, his favorite stuffed dog. Packed it all in his diaper bag and added it to the pile.



Natalie burst through the door nineteen minutes after my call. Her face was flushed, hair coming loose from her bun.



""What is it?"" she demanded.



I handed her the card. She read it three times, lips moving silently.



""Who sent this?"" she finally asked.



""Postmark says Rachel. Only thing near there is the base.""



""We destroyed all records of where we were going.""



""Someone kept track,"" I said.



She set the card down like it might bite. ""You think it's real? Not someone messing with us?""



""Who else knows about him? About what happened? The government buried it all.""



She nodded, already moving toward our bedroom. ""How much time do we have?""



""No idea.""



We'd rehearsed this scenario in our heads for years. What we'd take. Where we'd go. How fast we could disappear. Now that it was happening, the plan felt flimsy, full of holes.



""I'll get Robert,"" Natalie said, voice steady despite the fear in her eyes. ""You load the car.""



I grabbed our bags and headed outside. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across our driveway as I popped the trunk and arranged our things. Checked the gas tank‚Äîthree-quarters full. Not ideal, but enough to get distance before we needed to stop.



Something felt wrong. I paused, keys in hand, listening. No birds. No neighborhood sounds. Just the faint hiss of someone's sprinkler two houses down. It was too quiet.



Natalie appeared with Robert bundled against her chest, still sleepy from his nap.



""Car seat,"" she said.



I helped her secure him in the back, his tiny face scrunched in confusion. He sensed our panic. Kids always know.



""Where are we going?"" Natalie asked, climbing into the passenger seat.



""East. Away from the coast."" I started the engine. ""We can figure out details once we're moving.""



""Should we try to contact the others? Martinez? Chang?""



""Martinez is overseas. No idea where Chang ended up."" I backed out of the driveway. ""Try Michael. He's in Portland.""



Natalie pulled out her phone while I scanned the street. Still unnaturally quiet. No dog walkers. No kids playing. Nobody checking mail.



""Voicemail,"" she said after a moment. ""Michael, it's Natalie Bane from Bravo Mike. If you're getting this, you might be in danger. Call me immediately."" She left her number and hung up.



Robert started crying as we turned onto the main road. Not his usual fussy cry‚Äîthis was different. Frightened. Natalie twisted in her seat to comfort him.



""It's okay, baby. We're just going on a trip.""



The lie sounded hollow even to me.



I hit the gas harder than necessary, tires chirping on asphalt. The car picked up speed as we approached the intersection that would take us to the highway. Three more blocks. Two. One.



The ground trembled. So slight I might have missed it if I hadn't been waiting for something. Anything. A vibration that traveled up through the wheels and into the steering column.



I checked the rearview mirror. Four blocks back, between houses, something moved. Something large. A distortion in the air like heat waves, but sharper. More defined.



""James,"" Natalie said, voice barely audible.



""I see it.""



Robert's cries grew louder. I pressed the accelerator to the floor. The engine roared in protest as we shot through a yellow light and onto the entrance ramp.



""Call Michael again,"" I said.



Natalie tried three times. No answer.



""Where are we going?"" she asked, strain breaking through her calm facade.



The truth formed in my stomach like a stone. ""I don't know.""



Goliath was back. The creature that had torn apart Cooper and dozens of others thirteen years ago had found us. Whether it had been hunting us all this time or just now picked up our trail didn't matter. It was here.



I merged onto the highway at twenty over the speed limit, weaving between cars. In the back seat, Robert's cries had softened to whimpers. Natalie reached back to touch his leg, her hand trembling slightly.



""How did it find us?"" she asked.



""I don't know that either.""



Thirteen years of nightmares. Thirteen years of jumping at shadows and checking locks. Thirteen years of telling ourselves we were safe, that it was over. All blown away by three words on a note card.



I pushed the car faster, watching the rearview mirror more than the road ahead. Nothing followed‚Äîno massive shape flowing over asphalt, no spider-like limbs reaching between vehicles. But that didn't mean it wasn't coming.



""We need a plan,"" Natalie said. ""Somewhere it can't find us.""



But we both knew there was no such place. We'd seen what Goliath could do. How it moved. How it hunted. How it killed.



""We keep driving,"" I said, knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""We don't stop until we have to.""



The highway stretched before us, carrying us away from our home, away from the life we'd built. But not away from the nightmare. Never away from that.



It had only just begun.

1k8118f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1k8118f/could_this_be_only_fluid_dynamics_bubbles/,Could this be only fluid dynamics? Bubbles behaving oddly ordered under microscope.,"Hi everyone, I'm a Physics undergrad trying to understand what should be just fluid dynamics.

Recently, I came across a TikTok account of a doctor (apparently a physician?) who posts videos of his homemade microscope experiments. Some of them show behaviors that don‚Äôt quite match what I‚Äôd expect from gas bubbles or random liquid behavior.

Here are two examples that really confused me:

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMB7ajhS9/

Here we see under microscope bubbles from coffee with motions seemingly well organized; 

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMB75KUuD/

And here, specially the last of the three short experiments, with naked eyes it's shown the appearance of stable bubbles inside a liquid medium under a chaotic turbulence that is very hard to assume it's just random gas.

As I couldn't find anything similar anywhere, I bought a microscope to watch it closer, but I'm also questioning here and there trying to find the right answers for these intricate fluid dynamics phenomenons.

1k80yfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1k80yfy/superauto_confusion/,Superauto confusion,"So many options and have watched YT videos and started reading posts here.  Thought I would ask for help.  In US and budget is 3k USD - ideally less. 

Here is my coffee background:
- Have had Nespresso for 20 years and wife loves it 
- I had a Rocket Appartemnto for over a year and loved it.  Sold last year because it and my Ceado were taking a ton of space.  - Wife didn‚Äôt take to it because it too many steps.  She used to work in a coffee shop back in HS but she‚Äôs in her routine of push button.  
- I primarily drank double shot Americanos and occasionally a milk based drink with the Rocket 
- since the same of my beloved Rocket, I‚Äôm now a pour over guy with a Hario switch and Fellow grinder.  I like my setup overall.
- wife does use sugar and cream in her Nespresso; I drink my pour over neat
- we have frother wand thingy that the wife will use occasionally so lattes and flat whites would be welcome recipes 
- so you have a picky husband and wife that likes push button coffee with cream (yes we are still married - hahaha)
- I drink 2-3 pour overs per day and my wife drinks 1 coffee but uses 2 capsules per day because she does like it strong 

We have a lot of coffee related appliances (including scale, kettle, grinder, hario, orea dripper, Nespresso and a jar of pods) on the counter.  

I want to get a Super to dump Nespresso and replace my pour over so we have single coffee thing on the counter.  But it has to be really good coffee quality.  And it has to be easy to use (and clean).  

I‚Äôm thinking a Jura E8 because it has the single hot water spout.  Seems like it‚Äôs not fiddly.  But then I was looking at Dinamica and KF8.  Hoffman‚Äôs video says Dinamica is the value choice and I have read mixed reviews on KF8 coffee is not as hot and Jura beats out on quality.  I am not able to try these anywhere so wanted some advice.  Should I look at other options?  Are one of these 3 the one to get?  ",1,1745629599.0,superautomatic,6,1.0,False

Spending four nights in Medellin then hopefully going to Guatape for two nights. Looking for recommendations of where to stay in Guatape. We need a place with 2 beds. Hoping to spend no more than $250 USD/night. Looking at availability, there are plenty of options over many price points. I'm leaning towards something on the water - The Brown by Marriott looks nice. I'm just not sure if it's too remote. We won't be looking for a party (having just spent 4 nights in the city) but we also don't want a place that mostly caters to couples. Also, I'm not sure if it's too remote. We are likely going to hire someone to drive us out there so we won't have a vehicle while we're there. How easy is it to get around? Would it just be easier to stay right in Guatape? Things we think we want to do: Climb Penol de Guatape, check out Guatape (hopefully get some good eats), water sports (kayak, jet ski) and visit a coffee farm. Is there anything else you would recommend? Also, should we have have cash on hand? USD? Lastly, we'll need to hire a driver to get back to the airport so would prefer staying somewhere that can arrange it (thus, haven't looked at air b&bs) Thanks for any ideas.",0,1745629486.0,Colombia,0,0.5,False

1k80u0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k80u0j/aita_for_cutting_contact_with_my_bff_after_she/,AITA for cutting contact with my bff after she accused me of sleeping with her husband?,"This happened seven years ago, but unfortunately it has been causing me massive amounts of anxiety lately.  I am a 34f and this happened in the summer of 2018 so I was 27. This friendship started when I was much younger though in 2013 when I was 22. I'm going to change all of the names.
 
I was taking classes at the local community college and ran into someone who I knew back in high school, David. We weren't close but he was always around with the group of people that I used to skip school with.  David was with his friend who I had never met before, Adam (27 at the time). We all talked for awhile catching up and then Adam told me about his family, wife (33f) Emily, and his daughter (8). I find out Emily is a painter and likes the same kind of music that I do, and I'm like oh hey, would your wife wanna maybe hang?  
At some point we all get together Emily, Adam, myself and my husband Matt. 
The boys hit it off, they're both into cars and home renovation and Emily and I become fast, close friends.  We are constantly hanging out and letting the kids have play dates my daughter was a little younger than theirs, she was 4 at the time we met.  

Eventually Adam starts working on some of the renovation projects that my husband was managing in 2015.  I was also a part of this renovation team , I handled leasing and acquisitions for the parent company and took care of supply runs and such.  We all continue to be great friends and do dinner together multiple times a week. We went on camping trips every summer and road trip vacations together over the years.  

One summer day it exploded in my face.  
Adam's brother Alex was also on the renovation project and they were coming to my house to pick up tools for the job. I hear screaming out of the side door and start to leave the basement to find out what's going on.  Alex walks in and is giggling and covering his mouth and runs down the stairs into the basement towards me and says something along the lines of - Adam is in the driveway on the phone with Emily and they're screaming, she thinks ""he  fucked you"". (I only have a few direct quotes after so many years and I'll never forget that one like wtf)   My heart started pounding I'm like bro what the actual fuck, you are joking this is a prank. Alex goes -nope they've been fighting all morning. 
My husband half overhears this and comes in like hey what's up? Alex throws his hands up in the air, and as he walks away says -oh you're gonna have to ask Adam about that he's on the phone outside, and then walks back outside. My husband looked at me and I  straight up told him what Alex said to me.  Then told him it was absolutely not true and not a thing.   

Adam and I have literally never touched eachother, we never hugged or anything like that at all.  There were never any previous like doubts or accusations from anyone.  This blindsided me. 
When Adam came in he was all upset and said something like - Emily is going insane and she thinks we (talking to me) are screwing around. My husband asked him ""well are you"" and he said -no absolutely fucking not. I start like panicking and trying not to cry and freak out.  They all three pack up and leave for work like almost immediately. My husband hugged me and kissed me like normal, like strangely normal and they were gone. I have no idea what the conversation was like in the truck on the way to work I can't remember if all three rode together, but they often did.  


I'm left at home now and of course do the I'm sad, nope I'm mad, nope now I'm crying and hyperventilating thing.  I start realizing her and I had actually planned to hang out while they were working that day and she was suppose to be in the car they arrived in.  I tried to call Emily and she didn't answer, didn't text me back.  I really wanted to tell her that nothing ever happened between her husband and I ;and ask why she would think that. I was just fucking devastated and confused.  I didn't get any correspondence from her for what had to be days until I got an email from her!!! She had NEVER sent me an email before this.  We always spoke over text or calls. 
In this email Emily basically tried to rationalize her suspicions by saying because he is always ""around me"" why wouldn't she have suspicions? There wasn't  anything in that email that said I'm sorry I accused you and it did not say i believe you didn't do it.  So I tried calling and still didn't get an answer. I wrote back to her in email and text saying that I'm offended she would think I could do this to her or MY husband and I didn't think our friendship would recover from this.  If she can't trust me, we're done. 
I think it was a month or two before Adam stopped working with us. It tapered off he wanted less and less hours as time went on.    I haven't seen either of them since.  

There might be a reason why I have been thinking about it recently.  

I've been driving for Uber lately and picked up a rider near where Adam and Emily used to live.  It turned out to be Alex's ex wife Alex saw me from the curb and greeted me warmly, told me he missed me and Matt and told me to get his number from his ex wife.  Well, it was literally one of the most awkward rides I've ever taken.  At first she was very chill like how are you, blah blah then she started in on how do you know Alex? I told her I was friends with his brothers wife back in the day and her face instantly dropped.  I'm like shit she knows who I am now, but before this ride I have only seen her a handful of times at parties and such.  I'm instantly nervous and then she asks how much money I make doing uber, because her friend makes ""reeaallly gooood money"" driving uber.  I tell her like it is.  It kinda sucks most of the time but when it gets busy downtown you can make good money, sure.  We arrive at Adams parents house! I haven't been there since I was friends with them and it's the creepiest fucking feeling in the world. (Like Emily or someone is going to walk out any second) I pull up, drop her off.  No big deal right? Sure! Glad it's over! 
Nope.   Two hours later I get a call from a random number.   Uber is suppose to protect my phone number, but their toll free data-free calls never connect for me or my riders so when I'm driving, I answer random ass phone numbers because it could be the next rider.   I answer expecting a rando named Jim , but I get a woman, and it's the ex wife ! She proceeds to ask if I have cameras in my car facing the backseat.  I tell her no, my forward facing dashcam points directly at the road and does not film in cab.  She says she left her Walmart bag with her coffee, new earbuds, and a ""bunch of shit"" in it.   I tell her no I'm sorry there is nothing in my backseat. I can look over the footage to see if she got in with it; and she hangs up on me.  Wtf kind of scam is that? I'm pretty sure uber gives you nothing if you leave your stuff in a car??idk I'm just a driver.  I clean my car every day it would be super hard to lose"" a bag in my car. I reviewed the video later and she did NOT have any bag with her at all.  


I'm just missing Emily a lot lately and wonder if I wouldn't have cut off contact so abruptly if we would still be friends. Do friendships make it through shit like that? Now I feel like I was young and too hot headed maybe. 
I know I only have one side of this but I don't think Adam and I were even flirty.  Emily was correct Adam and I were around eachother a lot but like mostly in passing when I stopped in to meet inspectors and adam and Alex came almost daily to pick up tools and materials from my house. Any of our interactions outside of that were right in front of her.  I've never spent time alone with this man other than ONE car  ride when I had too much too drink at Emily's house and Adam drove me home; it was a seven minute ride or so. It was uneventful. I miss her but I was and still am kind of offended that this was a thought she had at all. If my husband wasn't so amazing about this situation her accusation, and the way Adam was screaming about it and broadcasting it in my driveway, could've damaged my marriage. 

Am I the asshole for cutting contact with my best friend after she accused me of sleeping with her husband? ",9,1745629213.0,AITAH,2,0.91,False

Nobody likes cheaters. Autoguessers will get kicked, and excessive spam guessing could also get you kicked, depending on how tolerant your lobby is. You should only ever guess words from your own memory, never directly from a wordlist like this one, but if you decide to memorise every word on this list then fair enough.


I‚Äôve played a lot of skribbl over the last 2 years and so naturally i‚Äôve come across pretty much every word at some point (in English lol, sorry to all the German, French, Italian, etc. players). I‚Äôve seen a few outdated lists out there, and I know some people have made wordlists recently but idk if they‚Äôve posted them online.

Out of curiosity I wanted to see how many I could think of. So, this is a list I‚Äôve compiled myself over the last few days, mostly from memory. I encountered a bunch more words in-game that I‚Äôd forgotten to add, so I put them in too. This list is definitely not complete, but probably covers 90% of the words out there. I‚Äôll keep adding to it when I can, and if you come across any I‚Äôve missed , please let me know!

This list only covers 11+ letter single words, plus the double words. I haven‚Äôt included guesses with 3 or more words, or any hyphenated words like x-ray, t-rex, pac-man, band-aid, kool-aid, color-blind etc. Can‚Äôt remember if yo-yo is hyphenated or not also. Anyway, I may add those words to the list in the future if I get round to it.
If there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve question marked, it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt seen it recently and am unsure of it. But if I come across them in a game I‚Äôll amend the list. Alternatively, if anyone can help me out by confirming or correcting the question marked words I‚Äôd really appreciate it!

P.S. I used chat gpt to help arrange them alphabetically within their respective groups, to make it a bit neater. Unfortunately, chat gpt is dumb sometimes and messed a lot of things up, so I had to painstakingly correct all the issues manually. I apologise if there are still some mistakes I missed.

Although all of my tests have been negative, I keep checking my hands with very cold water and ice multiple times a day to see if I have Raynaud‚Äôs.
When I expose my hands to very cold water, they turn red and I feel a sharp, burning pain. I repeat this several times a day, and now I notice that my palms sometimes become slightly swollen and red.
In the past, I didn‚Äôt have this sensitivity to cold ‚Äî touching cold surfaces like a car steering wheel or a metal pole didn‚Äôt cause any symptoms.
Now, when I touch very cold objects, the skin on my fingertips quickly becomes pruney, and when I hold a cold drink like iced coffee, my hands feel a slight burning sensation. I also feel a hot, burning sensation in my palms and fingertips afterward.
At first, I thought it might be Raynaud‚Äôs, but because my fingers don‚Äôt turn white or go numb, my doctor said it doesn't look like Raynaud‚Äôs.
Initially, I could hold cold drinks without any problems, but now these symptoms appear quickly The skin on my hands becomes slippery and feels tighter, and I have to switch the drink to my other hand. My doctor believes this pattern is more consistent with erythromelalgia rather than Raynaud‚Äôs.
Below are pictures of my hands after holding a cold drink.

I'll try to keep it short. So l'm making this espresso and for some reason the first one comes out exactly at 8 bars and runs it for 27 seconds with 36g out just how I like it.

l use the same beans and the same way to make another cup; however, this time I see my 8 bars pressure dropping to 6 and everything dispenses by 24 seconds hitting 38g.

Same exact beans, same method. I clean the puck after each use too. I press it with the same pressure, same grinded coffee.

I know I'm picking hair here, but I'm just curious why does this happen and why can't it be same exact timings.

I use 17g of beans. ",2,1745629010.0,espresso,6,1.0,False
