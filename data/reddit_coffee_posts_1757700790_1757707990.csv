I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. Most evenings are simple-coffee, a good soundtrack in the background, and something worth watching. I’m introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I’m talkative, loyal, and consistent. I actually show up.

What I’m into: anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer, and anything honest), story-driven movies, late-night playlist rabbit holes, quiet walks, stargazing, museums and cafés over parties, and a clean all-black aesthetic. I used to game a lot; now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I daydream about Japan, Norway, and Switzerland, but I’m just as happy with a calm weekend at home.

What I’m hoping for: someone kind, steady, and open to building something slowly sharing small day-to-day things, swapping songs, laughing at scenes we pause, making little plans we actually follow through on. Long distance is fine if the effort matches; if we click, I’m open to closing the gap.

You don’t need a fancy opener. If this feels like your pace, just say hi and we’ll see if it works.

Thanks for reading hope that wasn’t boring 😂 take care💫

Trying to shed a few pounds? The secret might be in your pantry! Learning [how to use ghee ](https://lazizgold.com/)for weight loss is a game-changer, as this traditional clarified butter offers a unique blend of healthy fats that can support your metabolism and keep you feeling full. Ghee has long been a staple in Ayurvedic medicine, valued not just for its rich flavor but also for its ability to aid digestion and promote overall wellness, making it a perfect addition to a weight management plan.

**Simple Ways to Add Ghee to Your Diet**

Incorporating ghee into your daily routine is easy and can have a significant impact on your weight loss journey. Here’s how to use ghee for weight loss in practical ways:

1. **Start Your Day Right:** Try a spoonful of ghee in your morning tea or coffee for a ""keto coffee."" This provides sustained energy, helps curb appetite, and gives you a feeling of fullness that can last for hours.
2. **Substitute for Cooking Oil:** Use ghee as a direct substitute for other oils when sautéing vegetables, frying eggs, or searing meat. Its high smoke point makes it a healthier choice, and its rich flavor can make simple dishes more satisfying.
3. **On an Empty Stomach:** Some traditions suggest taking a small amount of ghee on an empty stomach to improve gut health and kickstart your digestive system.

By leveraging these simple methods, you can harness the power of this golden fat to support your goals.

**Conclusion**

Ghee is a versatile and effective tool for those looking to manage their weight and improve their overall health. For the best results, it is crucial to use a high-quality, pure product. To ensure you are getting premium-grade ghee, we recommend a trusted brand like La-ziz Gold, which provides the perfect blend of tradition, purity, and convenience for your wellness journey.",1,1757707773.0,u_IndividualFormal128,0,1.0,False

Hi all, I was asked in my original post ""first cruise, solo cruise"" to do an update on my experience so here it is based on what others recommended in the initial thread. I was on Carnival Celebration from 8/31 - 9/6.

  
What others recommended:

* Hub App: 
   * As a first time cruiser, I wasn't sure what to expect with this app, but I swore by it and used it often to figure out what all was going on on the boat. If you're the social type who makes friends (and don't want to buy the WiFi package) there is a chat feature that was $5 for the whole cruise to stay connected with people you meet. I didn't buy the WiFi package because I wanted to unplug, but it was nice to have people on board who I met up with after planning through the chat feature.
* Mixers: 
   * I had mixed experiences with the mixers. I attended the Independent Travelers mixer and the LGBTQ+ mixer. The Independent Travelers mixer wasn't well attended but I was able to connect with two other solos and learned about their past travel and cruise experiences. The LGBTQ+ mixer was honestly surprising. I was the first one there, but was greeted by a member of the Fun Squad, Roro, who did an amazing job at creating a fun environment for those who showed up. Roro said usually the LGBTQ+ mixers aren't well attended and this was probably the largest she had ever seen. I feel like part of that was because she had printed out a flyer for the table and people started to ask and join in on the ice breakers and conversation. This was a cool group and I remained connected with those from that mixer throughout the trip, even if just waving in passing!
* Bars: 
   * There wasn't a bar I didn't like. I would recommend getting a Smoked Manhattan from the Golden Jubilee, and The Sakura from Latitudes. Alchemy Bar had great cocktail(s) too (can't remember what I got), but found it to be a bit packed for me. 
* Summers Landing/Pig and Anchor: 
   * Great spot and that infinity-style pool is impressive. Loved watching the Cowboys-Eagles game Thursday night at Pig and Anchor, which was delicious but slower service than I expected
* Dining time: 
   * I had late dining, which wasn't as bad as I thought. It got in the way of trying to see some of the evening shows but on those days I just subbed my dining room seat for another spot on the boat to eat. 
   * Probably the weirdest part of this whole thing was being sat at a 6 person table, by myself, in the middle of the dining room. I mean the very middle, right where they start talking and singing. I was comfortable with it, but would have preferred to not be sitting at an empty six person table. 
   * The dining staff was often shocked or confused when I shared I was a solo traveler but I was getting a lot of props, fist bumps, and cheers as a result of it from the dining crew. They looked forward to seeing me and would continue to ask about my solo trip
* Music, entertainment, and shows: 
   * I wasn't sure whether to put the Piano Bar here or under the bar section, either way, I spent a lot of time here. Hanz is funny and is very talented. The crowd here were definitely ""locals"", often the same folk each night
   * Karaoke is a must, even if you don't sing, it was such a lively atmosphere
   * Deal or no deal was fun to watch, congrats to the fella who won $1000, 
   * The circus was okay but the effort and dedication from performers is impressive!
   * I didn't realize I liked comedy that much -- I made it a point to see each comedian once
   * I spent a ton of time at the Havana Bar -- I loved the live music (although I found it hilarious that people were uncomfortable by two men dancing salsa well together)
   * DJs played a variety of music, even mixed in hiphop. There was a schedule outside Limelight Lounge that had what each night was themed as, it felt like they had a little something for everyone
* Facebook Group
   * I didn't have Facebook prior to someone suggesting joining the group. I thought it was a good idea, but not having anything on my profile definitely gave my account a ""bot"" presence. I found it cool to see who all was on there, but I didn't find it incredibly useful. I can see how it would be for some though. I would still join a FB group if I went on another cruise, just wouldn't look to it as the source of community for me.
* Excursions and Ports:
   * Celebration Key - it was cool and commercial, the drinks were strong, the beach was fine - some bigger rocks in the water so be careful if you have sensitive feet or aren't used to that, the music and the party were great though -- it felt like a spring break from undergrad but with people who could hold their liquor (for the most part)
   * Amber Cove - I had an excursion booked that was canceled due to low demand so I just explored the port, bought some cigars and got back on the boat but I heard great things about the Damajagua excursions
   * Grand Turk - An absolute must. The water was beautiful, the food was delicious, I also did a snorkeling catamaran which was a ton of fun and lively. I felt all my tension leave my mind here. I stopped by Margaritaville but left shortly after -- it was a little too crowded for my liking but seemed like a great time.
* Coffee: Get the cafe con leche from the Havana Bar and thank me later
* Spa: 
   * I had a great bamboo massage that had me working through knots and emotions I didn't know I had. I think I got off the massage table shedding a tear. A bit pricey, although they do have deals. They do try to get you to sign up for more than one, or get add-ons, or get a take-home package of things. I get it, it is a business. I didn't end up buying anything - a simple ""no thank you"" goes a long way
* Seasickness:
   * I didn't use the patches but saw tons of people with them, I did pop dramamine a day before embarkation and each morning. I felt the boat moving more when I was standing still or sitting down -- usually around my late dinner time. For the most part, it was smooth sailing and not something I worried about.
* Someone joked about bringing boxing gloves
   * I only witnessed one curfuffle and it was the absolute last night into the morning of debarkation -- some guys in the bathroom? it didn't disturb me... but security running definitely raised some eyebrows
   * Generally though, it was weird to me to experience people who were outwardly irritated or tense and impatient. I get it, traveling with family or kids or being in a foreign environment can be difficult, but I just stayed away and quickly removed myself from conversations where entitled people felt they had an ally for their disrespect towards staff. It just isn't rhetoric I tolerate anywhere, especially not on vacation

My biggest regrets:

* Not getting to Family Feud 
* Not finding more ducks (I found one, dropped it, and decapitated it on accident. Someone heard me retelling the story and gave me a squeaky one -- thank you!)
* Not trying Emeril's beignets 

Some advice for solo and first time cruisers: 

* Bring a journal (and two pens): There is something about being on the open water solo that brings great relaxation and reflection. I went through a brand new pen with my journal, which I brought almost everywhere with me (expect to party). I would journal at breakfast, and dinner, in the in-between listening to Leo do a great job on the Piano at Golden Jubilee... I'd highly recommend it if you're the writing type -- and it was also a conversation starter for many who were intrigued about a solo 20 something male sitting by himself with a Manhattan.
* Get the drink package if you're a drinker: I only maxed out one day, but that day included smoothies, alcoholic drinks, coffee, specialty teas, and so much more. I found it worth it (I got it on one of the weeks it was on sale)
* Prepay gratuities: I tipped extra on tabs where I felt like the bartender was really making an effort to get to know me and chat me up, but other than that -- sign and drive. I also made sure to tip my room attendant upon debarkation.
* Bring fiber and vitamin c packets: fiber for the gut, vitamin c because towards the end there were way more people coughing than there should have been
* Book the dang trip! I had a great time, met some really cool people, enjoyed time by myself and felt really confident and doing it. Would I do it again? Maybe.  I have to think more about if I would want to cruise again more broadly. I definitely needed a vacation, and this was that, but I find myself enjoying traveling and experiencing locations a bit more than a few hours at a time. Still -- a fabulous time and one I'll never forget.

Thank you to everyone who commented on that first thread, you all left gems. I hope this post gives the next solo and first time cruiser some tips!

1nfdbwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plane_Rub_8371/comments/1nfdbwm/el_archivo_perdido_de_goat_simulator/,El Archivo Perdido de Goat Simulator,"Siempre he sido un coleccionista de rarezas de videojuegos. No hablo de simples “ediciones limitadas”, sino de esas leyendas que solo se mencionan en foros oscuros: discos de prueba, prototipos que jamás debieron ver la luz.

En 2024, un usuario anónimo en un hilo de deep web escribió:



“¿Has probado el GS\_0.9black.iso? Es el Goat Simulator original, pero… sin censura.”



El mensaje duró solo siete minutos antes de que el hilo completo desapareciera.

Copié el enlace que alcanzó a dejar. Me condujo a un servidor de archivos antiguos, protegido por una contraseña: “CABRA”. El archivo pesaba exactamente 666 MB.

Durante la descarga, mi router comenzó a parpadear como si estuviera enviando datos hacia afuera. No había virus detectables, pero el MD5 mostraba un hash imposible: 000000… repetido.



Cuando ejecuté el instalador, no apareció el clásico logo de Coffee Stain Studios. En su lugar, una pantalla negra con un único texto:



La cabra observa desde el abismo.



No había botón para salir. Presioné Enter. La pantalla se llenó de una textura roja, como carne viva. Al iniciar la partida, no era la ciudad graciosa y caótica de siempre.

El cielo estaba cubierto por un crepúsculo permanente. No había música, solo un zumbido eléctrico. Las casas parecían quemadas y las ventanas mostraban siluetas que se movían, pero al acercarme se desvanecían.



Mi cabra no tenía la típica expresión burlona: su hocico goteaba un líquido negro que dejaba marcas en el suelo.

Cada vez que corría, el líquido formaba palabras que desaparecían rápido: VUELVE, OFRENDA, UNO DE NOSOTROS. En el menú de pausa encontré un nuevo apartado: “Confesiones”.

Dentro, una lista de usuarios, cada uno con una fecha. Eran nombres de foros que yo conocía: coleccionistas que habían desaparecido de la red. Junto a cada nombre, una grabación de voz distorsionada repetía:



“No debí mirar a los ojos de la cabra.”



Cuando intenté salir, el juego se colgó. O eso pensé: mi cámara web se encendió sola y la imagen de mi rostro apareció dentro del juego, proyectada sobre un gran mural en la plaza central. A lo lejos escuché un balido profundo, casi humano. Seguí el sonido hasta un granero.

Dentro, un círculo de cabras pixeladas se movía lentamente en espiral. En el centro había un archivo de texto flotante: ritual.txt.



Lo abrí:



“Para ascender, debes ofrecer tu reflejo.”



En ese instante mi monitor mostró una foto mía tomada segundos antes, pero con los ojos completamente negros.

El juego me obligó a arrastrar el archivo de imagen dentro de una especie de altar interactivo. No había forma de cerrar el juego: el teclado no respondía.



Cuando solté la imagen, mi PC emitió un sonido gutural. Todas las luces de mi casa parpadearon. Tras el ritual, la pantalla mostró “Actualizando contenido… 99%” durante exactamente 6 minutos y 66 segundos.

Luego apareció un nuevo nivel: El Pastizal Eterno.



No había límites visibles; solo una llanura sin fin. En el horizonte, una cabra gigantesca —con un ojo único que giraba— me observaba.

Al avanzar, la textura del suelo se deformaba y comenzaba a mostrar fragmentos de mis conversaciones de chat, correos personales y fotos de mi disco duro.

El juego sabía todo. La cabra gigante habló con una voz compuesta por miles de balidos:



“Dame tu mirada, o toma la mía.”



En ese momento aparecieron dos opciones:



Aceptar el pacto.



Rechazar y despertar.



Elegí Rechazar.

La pantalla se oscureció. Creí que el juego había terminado… hasta que escuché un golpe detrás de mí.

Mi espejo, en la habitación, estaba empañado y en él, con una huella húmeda, se leía:



“UNO DE NOSOTROS”. Intenté eliminar GS\_0.9black.iso.

El archivo reapareció en diferentes carpetas, siempre con la misma fecha de modificación: la hora exacta en la que comencé a leer este relato.



Cada vez que enciendo mi PC, escucho un balido bajo, y el ventilador se detiene un segundo.

Dicen que si juegas hasta el amanecer, la cabra dejará de buscarte. Pero nadie ha llegado tan lejos.

The pediatrician was concerned that he was not growing or putting on weight and had dropped a lot in percentile.

Before this appointment, we weren't worried at all. He's generally a happy eater, and we've been doing baby-led weaning (BLW) successfully. He'd play with his food, eat what he wanted, and we'd lift him out when he seemed done. Occasional snacking outside the high chair too.

Now we want to boost his calories, but I'm worried about messing with his natural eating cues. Will intervening make him develop negative associations with food?

Current situation:
Since turning 1, he plays with food more and eats less in the high chair. But when he's walking around and playing, he eats much better. We sometimes put snacks on the coffee table and he definitely eats more that way than strapped in the high chair.

Our questions:

1. Are we creating bad eating habits by letting him snack at the coffee table instead of always using the high chair?
2. When he's having fun eating in the high chair, should we try to sneak in extra bites? (Sometimes he'll take them, other times he clamps his mouth shut)
3. Do these interventions go against BLW principles?

We were happy and worry free before the visit but now would like some more advice on how to deal with this.

Additional info:

1. No processed sugar introduced yet
2. Loves: omelets, chicken/beef, fruits, some vegetables

1nfd2zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nfd2zh/aio_for_ending_my_friendship_with_my_friend_right/,AIO for ending my friendship with my friend right before leaving for bootcamp?,"TLDR: I ended a friendship with a close friend  who repeatedly ignored my time, feelings, and boundaries. Despite me supporting her emotionally, financially, and practically for months, she canceled plans, avoided accountability, and blamed me for “expectations of timing.” After repeated disrespect and a final straw over a missed meetup, I cut her off and asked for repayment of money owed. I’m questioning if I’m overreacting or if ending it was the right call.

I’ve been questioning whether I did the right thing, so here’s the situation.

I had this close friend. From the start, I’ve always been there for her. I gave her rides, helped her out financially, supported her emotionally and mentally she’d often call me when she was stressed, sometimes even before her own boyfriend. I’ve overextended myself for her because I cared.

But the friendship never felt equal. She often disregarded my time and feelings. For example, I once bought us tickets to a show. I told her in advance what time to be ready by, and I even kept her updated, texting her when I was on my way and exactly what time I’d be there. By the time I arrived, she still wasn’t ready. Instead of hurrying since we were already pushing it, she decided to change her outfit multiple times, which killed even more time. We ended up being so late that the show was basically over, and the tickets I paid for were wasted. What frustrated me most wasn’t just the money, but her lack of urgency it didn’t seem to matter to her that we were on a schedule. Later, she complained that I’m “always late,” but never acknowledged how often she’s the one who makes us later. Most times when I pick her up, I end up waiting for her to finish getting ready, yet she shifts the blame to me instead of owning her part. But that’s just how she is very self-centered, no real accountability.

More recently, things came to a head. I had just gotten news that my Navy ship date got pushed back and I was excited to share with her. When I told her, she completely ignored it and just started talking about if I had chairs for an event we were going to that night. That hurt, because I’ve always made her feel heard and seen, but she couldn’t even acknowledge something big for me.

Then came the movie situation. We bought tickets for a movie she wanted to go to in advance, and on the day of, she canceled last minute because I had calmly expressed my feelings about her disregarding the news earlier and it made her “uncomfortable.” Instead of talking it out like a mature friend, she cancelled on me, so I went to the movie by myself. That was a crappy feeling, especially since she was the one who planned it in the first place.

After that, I thought she’d at least check in, knowing I went alone and knowing my time before bootcamp was limited. Instead, silence. Two weeks of nothing. Normally she texts me daily or sends reels, so it was noticeable.

Then, out of nowhere, she texted saying she wanted to grab coffee and reconnect before I leave. I thought about it and decided to respond, even though I was hurt. I said thanks for reaching out, told her my time is limited (since I leave in less than a week), and that I’d be open to meeting if it worked with our schedules.

She didn’t respond. For three days. After she was the one who reached out to me first.

At that point, I snapped. I sent her a message basically saying: due to her lack of response, I was done. I told her I’d always been genuine and supportive, but when I had one small issue, this is how she treated me. I told her she’d disappointed me as a friend, that I wasn’t putting effort into something unreciprocated anymore, and that she still needed to pay me back the money she owes.

Suddenly, she replied right away. But instead of apologizing, she flipped it back on me. She said I was putting my “own expectations of timing” on her, that the “ball was in my court” during the two weeks of silence, that she didn’t respond because she was “tired and busy,” and that it wasn’t fair of me to blame her. She ended with saying she’d pay me back “hopefully next week” and wished me the best.

To me, this just felt like more avoidance and lack of accountability. I’ve bent over backwards for her for months, but when I needed basic acknowledgment, she ghosted me and then tried to make it about “imbalanced timing.”

So I cut it off. Told her to pay me back and not to reach out again.

I recently went through a breakup, and I’ve already cut off toxic family and friends in the past. In this new chapter of my life, I really just want to make space for genuine friendships. She has been there for me at times, and we’ve made a lot of fun memories together, especially this past summer. But seeing her pattern of avoiding accountability and the way she’s treated me, I’m questioning whether I’m just acting on emotion or if this friendship is truly worth trying to salvage despite everything that’s happened.

A couple months back, I randomly came across BananaGun. At first, I thought it was just another meme project (I mean, come on-a banana with a gun?), but turns out the team’s actually serious. They’ve built in auto-sniping, take-profit settings, rug protection, and even multi-wallet support. All in one clean interface, without the usual hype. Their official X account is also active, with real updates and features that actually get shipped.

Recently they launched BananaGun Pro-a more advanced version where you can set up strategies, track trades, and automate your flow without babysitting it.

Maya is reactive, anxious, and difficult to manage, and despite my best efforts with training, I often feel like I’m failing. Her struggles have taken a toll on my quality of life and straining my relationship after just moving 2,600 miles to be with my partner.
I had been saving to invest in professional behavioral training, but unexpected old taxes drained those funds, and now I feel overwhelmed. There are so many issues that I can’t seem to focus on one long enough to make progress.
Despite it all, Maya is the sweetest cuddle bug. playful, silly, and deeply attached to people. I love her so much and I can't imagine ever giving up on her. Here we go...

Basic info: 
Maya is 5 years old, ~16 lbs, mixed breed (likely mostly Chihuahua, possible Jack Russell/pit mix) Adopted in 2021. 

Separation Anxiety / Confinement Issues:
Severe destructive behaviors when left alone.
Destroys blinds and doors in every house. 
Crate: Potties immediately inside, flips water bowl, soils bedding.
Pen: Learned to climb walls, then destroyed house.
Bathroom: I tried leaving her with a bed, toys & enrichment items. She freaked, jumped onto counter, destroyed light switch, slipped a disc when falling, temporarily paralyzed hind legs.
*Right now I don't own a crate as I just moved and been trying to keep living area as pet friendly as possible. doors and blinds are already destroyed but considering crate again.

House soiling:
Potties almost every time we leave, even after being walked. When we’re home, she sometimes pees/poops immediately after we leave the room.
She will use a pee pad, but will also target clothes and rugs if a bedroom is left open. She pottied on my bed once. It feels spiteful and targeted sometimes? 
She gets 3–4 walks daily (min 15 minutes each). Taking her out before leaving reduces accidents and she seems a little more tired out. but doesn’t resolve the issues entirely. 
She eats her poo sometimes. She's had this behavior since I first got her.

Reactivity:
Severe leash reactivity. whimpers when seeing dogs at a distance, escalates to barking, lunging and snapping even when across the street. She goes full demon mode and it's super stressful and embarrassing. If I pick her up she tries to jump out of my arms to get at the other dog. In contrast, she does fine in group play and boarding settings. though she's still visibly nervous and awkward, it's not nearly as bad as when shes on the leash. She can eventually coexist calmly with other tolerant dogs. 
I've tried positive reinforcement (rewarding calmness when seeing dogs) and distance-based desensitization (treats when noticing dogs at safe range) teaching ""look at me"" and ""lets go this way"" so she has other safe & rewarding options instead of reacting.
This seems to have helped a tiny bit, but progress feels minimal and a dog coming around the corner too close can set us back in progress. She often rejects treats and ignores commands when over threshold. 

More anxiety info:
Heightened stress in stationary social situations (picnics, coffee shops, camping).
Cries and yaps when expected to sit still; hard to bring her places. 
Seems distressed both when she’s left home and when she comes along.

Medication:
A new thing we are trying with her vet. She is currently on 30 mg trazodone daily + 300 mg gabapentin daily (split AM/PM).
This combo seems less effective now, tolerance building? May need to adjust or something.

I was originally booked to stay in overnight, but the surgery went so well they said I could go home that evening. The anaesthesia took a while to wear off (this is always an issue for me), so after some waiting and a little nausea, my husband drove me home. Had a bit of a barf when lying down for the first time, but that was the most eventful thing that happened. Immediately noticed my lack of lower back pain. 

Day two I noticed how messed up my throat was from the intubation, which I always forget about being a possibility. Other than that, I felt some gas pain and discomfort but nothing major. I managed to get by with regular pain killers. I had small meals to avoid anything big and drank a lot and did my best to move around. Slept a lot as well. 

Day three was a bit better. Woke up with a bad headache for whatever reason. Throat still felt funky, but I was able to have coffee and toast. Still trying to move around a fair bit and rest how I can. Noticed a lack of leg as well as back pain, which was really cool (this type of pain usually doesn’t go away with regular painkillers). Showered and took my bandages off. I also pooped today!! This was really scary but it went off without a problem. 

Today I have more energy, still noticing my lack of back and leg pain, and started to notice that my breathing is a lot better (deeper breaths than usual). I might be starting to notice some of the internal cuff but just barely (this was a big worry of mine, but so far it’s nothing).

TL;DR I’m healing up well and starting to notice some immediate benefits to my daily pain and breathing. I don’t really notice the cuff at all. Pooping was fine thanks to laxatives and staying hydrated. Overall, lots of things I was afraid of happening or experiencing haven’t happened, it’s all been pretty straightforward, and I’m feeling hopeful for healing and finally feeling more like myself again. :)",1,1757706470.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

I've been reworking much of the electrical in the vicinity and I'm familiar with wiring to code and all that however LED under cabinet lights are typically low voltage with a little transformer. Down in the laundry room I installed some on a straight row of cabinets without any interruption for Windows. They turn on and off with just a sort of wave of the hand. Unfortunately that wouldn't work for multiple strands & broken cabinet runs for windows.

Q: what would be the best idea for under cabinet lights where there is a break for a large window and then more cabinets on the other side? I don't want a plug-in transformer sticking out in a wire running up the backsplash that looks like an afterthought. Ideas so far 

1. Put an outlet up in the attic to plug in the LED lights and then make a small hole in the drywall ceiling and then also the top back corner of the cabinet and route the low voltage wire through that and seal it up. This outlet could be controlled by adding a switch to an existing switch box on the wall. The power to the attic outlet or outlets could power another string on the other side of the window and a little coffee bar row cabinets we have adjoining the main area. This would allow us to turn them on and off all the same time with a wall switch. However I haven't read about low voltage wiring through drywall and all of that so wondering about how that would work with code. 

2. I guess another option might be some sort of wireless remote control sort of thing if they could all work off of one system and then I could have the outlet or outlets controlled by that. 

Any suggestions before I hang cabinets to prepare for under cabinet lighting? ",1,1757706332.0,HomeImprovement,0,1.0,False
1nfctlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nfctlt/does_apec_roes50_reverse_osmosis_system_truly/,Does APEC ROES-50 Reverse Osmosis System Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"**Effortlessly Clean Water with APEC Water ROES-50**  

I’ve been testing the APEC Water Systems ROES-50 Essence Series 5-Stage Reverse Osmosis System for weeks now, and as someone who’s obsessed with water quality for both health and flavor, this system has been a fascinating addition to my kitchen. Setting up this under-sink filtration marvel gave me high expectations from the start, and overall, it delivered beautifully while throwing a few curveballs my way. You’ll absolutely want to dive into both the strengths and quirks of this system before making a decision.  

**Impressive Design and Durability**  

This reverse osmosis system screams durability and quality in every component, from the housing unit to the faucet. At first glance, you can tell it's built to last. Manufactured by APEC Water Systems, it’s engineered right here in the United States, which adds an extra level of trust to its construction. I love how compact the unit is for something that packs so much filtration power – the 16 x 5.25 x 17.5-inch dimensions allow it to nestle under most sinks without eating up a significant amount of storage space.  

One feature that really stood out to me is the 100% lead-free faucet that comes with the system. It has a sleek, modern design perfect for most kitchens, and it feels sturdy in use, not flimsy like the faucets you sometimes encounter in lower-quality filtration systems.  

**[Check APEC Water ROES-50 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00i0zgozm/)**  

**The 5-Stage Filtration System in Action**  

Testing out the 5-stage filtration process was like uncovering a mini-lab hidden in my own cabinet. The ability to remove up to 99% of impurities, including arsenic, lead, chlorine, fluoride, and heavy metals, is nothing short of incredible. Living in an area with hard water concerns, the difference was noticeable when making coffee, tea, and even simple dishes like soups. It completely elevated everything.  

The taste is crisp and fresh, far better than anything bottled I’ve tried. The first week, I forced my family to do “taste tests” with bottled water versus this system. Without fail, the filtered water won hands-down for smoothness. The WQA certification adds more confidence; this isn’t just their claim—it’s a certified system delivering results.  

**Ease of Installation and Daily Use**  

The installation process isn’t entirely for the faint of heart, but it’s not the Mount Everest of setups, either. I wouldn’t call myself “handy,” but armed with the provided instructions (and one or two YouTube videos), I got it up and running in about an hour and a half. The system comes with premium-grade tubing, which felt reassuringly durable.  

However, I underestimated how snugly some fittings go together. In one instance, it felt like I needed Hulk-like strength to ensure the connections were secure and leak-free. On a side note, the noise level is virtually nil, which is a huge win for anyone who despises extra sound in their home environment.  

**Perks**  
- Removes over 99% of common contaminants (arsenic, lead, chlorine, etc.).  
- Compact, durable construction fits easily under sinks.  
- Includes a long-lasting, stylish lead-free faucet.  

**Critiques**  
- Installation might challenge those without any DIY experience.  
- Some fittings take significant effort to fully secure.  

**Usage and Maintenance Over Weeks**  

One thing I valued while using this reverse osmosis system day-to-day is the long-lasting filters. I haven’t needed to change any yet, but based on specifications and user reviews I’ve seen, the filters hold out much longer compared to some competitor systems. Occasional checks for leaks or minor adjustments became part of my routine, but this is standard practice with any under-sink system.  

Another thing to note: it has a maximum flow rate of 0.03 gallons per minute. For large families, this may feel slow when you’re filling pots or water bottles, especially if you’re coming from a faster, non-filtered tap. For single individuals or smaller households like mine, the rate was completely manageable.  

**Competing Options in the Market**  

While this filtration system shines, comparing it to competitors highlights both its prowess and areas for growth. For instance, Aquasana offers reverse osmosis systems with higher flow rates, which might better fit larger families’ needs. However, their filters are slightly pricier, and I’ve read mixed reviews about their durability over time.  

Another rival, iSpring, also gets a mention. Their reverse osmosis setups are competitively priced, but I noticed a drop in filtration effectiveness when reading other users’ reviews. APEC Water ROES-50 clearly holds the edge in lifespan and thorough filtration, even if the installation process is comparable across most brands.  

**Smart Spending**  

When evaluating the pricing, this filtration system feels like an investment in health and taste. I’ve spent far too much money on supposedly high-quality bottled water that doesn’t even compare to the drinking water produced by this unit. If you break down the cost over the years of usage you’ll get from this, it ends up being an extremely cost-effective purchase.

1nfcrtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nfcrtd/hm_ben_and_thomas/,[HM] Ben and Thomas,"Old Ben probably should’ve paid attention when he mowed his yard. It was a warm, boring Sunday. The neighbor kids were laughing two doors down, loud enough to echo in his large, empty house—a house which he bought for 4 dimes and a nickel back in high school. There were no frames on the walls. Nor a wife to warm his bed at night. Just Old Ben and his six pack. He downed another beer, grimacing as their laughter cut through him. He grabbed his Cuban cigar off the ashtray, smoked it, then grunted towards the garage. He rummaged through boxes of junk—old pictures, a purple heart, some medals. Then he found an old lawn mower straight out of a 70s catalogue. It was slow, loud, and too old to do much, other than complain. Ben exhaled bouts of smoke, pushing that loud, rumbling mower down his already trimmed lawn. He laughed to himself as the kids ran inside, dropping their squirt guns. That’ll teach those damn kids, making noise on his—

—Suddenly his mower choked. Ben yelled and kicked its side, as though it were a stubborn mule. When it finally limped forward, he saw that he accidentally ran over the property marker between him and his neighbor’s yard. His neighbor—*Old Thomas*—fellow Vietnam vet, but a different flavor of crazy. With shaking hands, he tried to set it upright, but it just leaned on its side. *Shit*.

Thomas came home from golfing later that day. When he saw the bent marker, he hobbled up the front steps of his house and slammed the door. The next day, Ben woke up to the smell of bacon. When he threw back his curtains, he was met with his yard *on fire*. His walker forgotten, Ben stumbled like a newborn colt toward the flames. He doused them with his hose, and when the flames collapsed, he cursed Thomas; the yard would be dead all summer. 

The next morning, Thomas woke up angry as he always did. He drank his morning coffee and stood at the window—then immediately dropped his mug, shattering it. All 74 of his garden gnomes were buried up to their chins, red hats pointing up like punji stakes. Thomas tossed his newspaper to the ground; It would take *hours* to dig them out.

Not even an hour later, Ben woke up with a smile on his face. He moonwalked into the kitchen wearing a robe, mug in hand. And as he lifted the mug to his lips, he suddenly spit his coffee everywhere. Those snot-nosed brats were TP-ing his yard! Ben shook his cane and yelled at them. They screamed and fled to the street on their scooters. Thomas, who was digging gnomes on his hands and knees, laughed into his elbow.

That following Sunday, both men sat in lawn chairs on opposite sides of the marker. Glaring. Their yards no longer green—but dirt-brown and full of holes. Signs stood in like rows like walls, painted with slurs and dicks. Hands shaking with Parkinson's, Ben was drawing up another sign now.

“You can’t keep this up forever,” Ben said, sipping his beer.

Thomas inhaled his cigarette, long and slow. He blew a smoke ring.

Let me get a bit more specific. There is a symptom that both Anxiety and LPR have known as ""Globus Sensation"" aka ""Cricopharyngeal Spasm"" but the problem is it feels nearly impossible to tell which one is causing it. I've had this symptom for the past 20 years and no doctor has been able to figure it out. They either brush it off as just anxiety or GERD but I have done every single test known to mankind and nothing comes back abnormal. I've done the following tests

1. Endoscopy   
2. CT Scans : with and without contrast  
3. Thyroid Ultra Sound  
4. Barium Swallow  
5. Blood Tests  
6. X-Rays

and they all come back ""nothing is wrong"" but this symptom is far from normal. I can just be sitting here and all of a sudden it comes on , when I'm not even anxious, there seems to be no definitive trigger just things that make it worse. Here are the things that make it worse and things that make it better

**Worse When:**  
1. Anxiety / Stress / Excitement / Sad or any heightened emotion really (the same feeling you get when you are holding back tears)  
2. Physical Activity : Lifting Weights / Sports / Running / Even simply walking sometimes  
3. Lack of Sleep (for me this is when its at its worst and I can't control it at all)  
4. Talking for long periods of time   
5. After eating too big of a meal or fatty foods (super full)

**Better When:**   
1. Empty Stomach   
2. Chewing on Gum / Lozenges / Food  
3. Drinking   
4. Spraying Mint in throat  
5. Xanax (or muscle relaxants)

I've read about so many people going through this but I never see any true success stories of someone figuring out what was causing it or the true root cause. Every day my mind plays tricks on me as to what is causing it and the two I keep coming back to is LPR or Anxiety because every day this globus sensation varies which is the hardest part about figuring out. If I have 2 days back to back where I eat the same things and sleep the same amount one of those days the sensation is worse then the other with no explanation its like this symptom has a mind of it's own with no true cure. For awhile I thought it was caffeine / coffee for awhile  and cut it out for entire month and it never truly did much for it and that was my biggest trigger so when cutting that out only helped a little bit I was left clueless again. 

Is there anyone out there who can tell me which is causing this or the science behind it? LPR or Anxiety? I know they can play a role in each other but I don't know which one is the root cause or how to approach fixing myself since even doctors themselves can't diagnose this. It is obvious to me that it's simply a muscle cramping up or tightening but it becomes debilitating when you can't even have a conversation with your own family or friends without shoving mints or gum in your mouth, its not normal at all. I'd love any advice or hope that there is a light to the end of the tunnel for this thing as it's destroyed my life and so many others. It puts you in a horrible mental loop.

Recently i’ve been very bothered by some immigrants, and don’t get me wrong: politically i am more left leaning and think immigration is good for this country in some ways. i am no way racist, at least i don’t think i am. none of my opinions are based on skin colour, however the immigrant status: yes, partly.

i don’t really know why this suddenly bothers me so much, maybe because i went to helsinki a few weeks back, where i encountered employees that *did not speak finnish.* My grandma cannot speak english for the life of her, and had trouble ordering a single coffee (thankfully i was there). That was a huge culture shock for me. I live in Tampere, a big student-city with also alot of immigrants, but this has never been the case here. 

This whole thing had me noticing how many people live here in Finland and don’t know any finnish. and that is especially for ex. Americans. i dont think many english-speaking people even bother to learn the language and i feel very sad about it. The language is the back bone of our culture and i fear it’s disappearing. Not many people speak it, and i’m honestly very mad at people who think they can just come here and live life speaking only english. 

and obviously i don’t mean people who are having a hard time learning this difficult language; however, i’m saying some of them need to use more effort into learning it. Not just to save our culture, but also to intergrate and survive better here. I’ve seen people who have lived here years and years without ”having” to speak finnish. I’ve also seen people who have successfully learned the language in just a few years. If you’re going to move to a country, you will have to learn the language. to me it’s kind of disrespectful to not learn it if you’re living here. And once again: i understand how difficult it can be, but just try to learn it.

am i wrong for thinking like this? kind of feels like i’m some huge dick for complaining, but i love my culture and language, and i don’t want it to disappear.",39,1757705964.0,Finland,71,0.72,False

1nfciu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1nfciu5/so_stressed/,So stressed,"So, it's a bit long. My husband is a pilot so he's gone quite a bit we just moved into a new community where a lot of people have dogs and I had been begging for almost a year for a small dog, key phrase being small like nothing over 20 lb. Finally got him to agree so I started looking. We went to a shelter specifically for a certain animal that had just recently been adopted and as we were walking by one of the enclosures this one dog kept jumping on the wall only when my husband walked by. She's huge. So it was late in the day we went home and we both partially disgusted but then the next day we ended up going back to the shelter to adopt her with my husband asking me what were my thoughts. Because I knew she liked him obviously and it was obvious he was enamored with the fact that"" she chose him"", when he asked what did I think I told him it was up to him so we adopted her.

She's a very stubborn breed and is now 83 lb. We both had different approaches to training that we are now in agreement with merging but I had originally told my husband that the one thing would not put up with was chewing.

We've now had her over 3 months and she has chewed four different household items and destroyed two things,  irreplaceable.  

She's very very active but she also is in her crate far too much. She goes into her crate at 7:30 everyday because I have to be at work at 8:15 and doesn't get out till I get home which is almost 6:00. This is five days a week And she's out on the weekends And for the 12 Days A month that my husband is home From flying. However of course because of the chewing she doesn't allow free roam and goes into her crate if we have to go anywhere but it's never been more than two or three hours. Personally I find this far too much and from my investigation it is. I've become very frustrated because of her damage But my husband has been adamant about not getting rid of her not actually saying so but making excuses To the fact that she's only one or whatever. She recently became sick because she eats everything inside which I personally believe is pika. And it was me for 2 hours that cleaned up her vomit and diarrhea from her crate and off of her body. We ended up having to take her to an emergency vet and when she jumped out of the back of my brand new car she damaged the bumper because she's that hyper. That literally broke me. Between other family stress and now all of this it is definitely causing and has been causing strife between my husband and I and he has out of anger on two occasions made the comment to get rid of her while I was gone. He is now on a trip and I have potentially found her a very good home with people that have acreage another dog and she would not be created. But the problem is is I have not told my husband this I literally started looking the moment he told me 5 days ago that he has resolved that she probably won't be there when he gets back. I am pretty sure he'll get over it matter of fact I know he will because even she gets on his nerves. He rarely picks up after her I do When he gets up in the morning he insists on having his coffee before he takes her out on the Daisy's home Which I have asked him that when he's home he is going to take care of her to give me a break But usually I end up doing it first because I don't think a dog should wait to go out after they've been in their crate for several hours. 

I guess I'm just looking for confirmation or whatever that I'm not a bad person for going ahead and getting rid of her. She is a sweet dog but we have a brand new home and she's already damaged portions of it she is damaged a couple of antiques and literally destroyed a book from the 1800s. Yes she has plenty of toys yes she has been redirected but it doesn't help which I think stems from her being cooped up all the time. I'm literally on the verge of a mental breakdown between her and the issues going on with our family.",1,1757705587.0,Pets,1,1.0,False
1nfcir8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nfcir8/can_60_pcs_rainflow_best_appliance_covers_keep/,Can 60 PCS RAINFLOW Best Appliance Covers Keep Dust Away Efficiently,"It seems like every inch of my kitchen has a purpose or an appliance, which means clutter and dusting have become unwelcome sidekicks to my culinary adventures. That’s where the RAINFLOW ZML49-DustCover-30 stepped in to shake things up. Honestly, I wasn’t sure if disposable appliance covers would truly be a game-changer, but after giving these covers a fair trial run, I can safely say they have made life easier in some unexpected ways.

**Material Design and Versatility**

The clear design of these covers is what struck me first. Made of thickened PE material, they’re strong enough to withstand tears but flexible enough to snugly fit over various appliances. I don’t have to guess what’s underneath because the transparency makes the contents visible at a glance. Even my skeptical sister—who’s notorious for hating anything 'disposable'—had to admit how practical this feature was. While labeled as disposable, I found the material durable enough to reuse a couple of times before tossing. From my air fryer in the corner to my rice cooker near the window, everything looked neat while staying dust-free.

**Ease of Use**

Using these covers is embarrassingly simple. Each one comes with an elastic band that stretches around the appliance, ensuring a snug fit. The set includes three sizes, so every device—whether it’s my medium-sized oven or tiny coffee grinder—could get its perfect match. I did have to trial and error a bit initially, guessing what size would fit, but after that, it was smooth sailing. My favorite discovery? These covers also worked wonders for bowls during meal prep and a rogue computer monitor near the kitchen. It’s a multitasker’s dream!

[Check RAINFLOW ZML49-DustCover-30 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dsprc69q/)  

**Strengths**

There are certain good aspects of these covers that quickly became apparent:
- Effortlessly keeps kitchen appliances clean from dust and grease spatters.
- The clear material eliminates the hassle of labeling stored appliances.
- Elastic bands ensure a snug fit, reducing the chances of sliding off.
- Offers versatility beyond just kitchen use, such as for protecting non-appliance items like storage containers or even small electronics.

**Pitfalls**

Even a near-perfect product like this has a few areas for improvement:
- While reusable, the PE material isn’t heavy-duty enough for long-term use; it feels wasteful for those prioritizing sustainability.
- It can be tricky determining the correct size for larger or irregularly shaped appliances.
- If stored improperly, the elastic bands could lose their elasticity over time.

**Other Options**

When browsing alternative products for appliance dust covers, it’s clear the RAINFLOW set solves many problems that competitors haven’t quite mastered yet. Some options on the market come in thicker, washable materials for long-term use, but this adds time-consuming cleaning to your chore list. On the cheaper spectrum, a few competitors offer less durable materials but sacrifice the overall consistency in elastic fitting. For those seeking convenience and variety in sizing, this product stands taller than most.

**Price Performance**

At first glance, a pack of 60 covers feels like it might be overkill. But doing the math, I realized how cost-effective this set is considering the variety of sizes included. While true that you could use cloth covers as long-term replacements, the time saved from repeated washing makes these covers stand out. Not to mention, they’re perfect for quick applications during outdoor gatherings or even while moving.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **NC Dinos vs. Doosan Bears: A Postseason Sprint with a Side of Sliding Home Runs**

**Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
The numbers say it loud and clear: the **NC Dinos** are the favorite here, with most bookmakers pricing them at **-214 (decimal: 1.74)**, implying a **57% chance to win**. The Doosan Bears, meanwhile, sit at **+191 (decimal: 2.15)**, suggesting a **47% implied probability**. The spread? NC is favored by **1.5 runs**, with odds of **-150** (implying 60% implied probability to cover), while Doosan’s +1.5 line sits at **+240** (29% implied). The total runs line is **10.5**, with even money on both sides.

So what does this mean? NC is the slight favorite, but the spread suggests the bookmakers expect a close game. With Doosan’s recent struggles and NC’s playoff positioning on the line, this is a match where every run could be a walk-off… or a walk-over.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and a Grand-Slamming Hero**  
Let’s start with the Doosan Bears. Their last game was a 5-4 loss to the KIA Tigers, where their closer, Kim Taek-yeon, threw a **154 km/h fastball**—faster than a cheetah on a treadmill, but slower than a dad in a hurry to finish his coffee. Doosan’s offense? They managed just 4 runs against KIA, and their starting pitcher, Jack Log, gave up 4 runs in 6 innings. If Log starts again, he’ll need to trade his “sloppy pizza” delivery for something more precise.

NC, on the other hand, is fighting for survival. At **8th place**, they’re just **0.5 games behind 7th-place NC** (wait, *NC is NC*—confusing, right?), but more importantly, they’re **three games above the playoff cutoff**. Their recent 5-4 comeback win over Doosan? A masterclass in drama, featuring Kim Seon-bin’s **grand-slamming home run** (yes, *slamming*—he slid into home like it was a matter of life and death). Their starting pitcher, Adam Olly, struck out 8 in 6 innings against KI

1nfcgcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WIBTA_AITA/comments/1nfcgcj/aita_for_yelling_at_my_little_brother_because_his/,AITA for yelling at my little brother because his dog keeps eating my clothes?,"SUMMARY/TLDR

My younger brother's dog has eaten hundreds of dollars worth of pants to the point where I don't even have enough clothes to leave the house. It prevented me from going to a job interview. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair/cane and I can't defend against the dog. Me and my mom have had a lot of big drama and he's mad at me. I snapped at him over the whole situation after dealing with the dog for months.

We are both young adults. 22f and 18m respectively.

This is actually becoming an active barrier to me getting a job and endangering my safety sometimes. He refuses to care for her. At the same time, I drove my mom out of the house and now our parents are separating. So I also understand why he's angry. He has every right to be upset.

AITA?

Edit: Just edited it down since it was crazy long and added the summary for clarity. You can skim the context, read the summary, and read the story if you want.

Context is basically:

1. My mom's kind of abusive. 2) Cops came for some questionable stuff she did to me so dad started protecting me from her. They got a divorce over it and my brother is understandably mad at me for it. 2) I got hit by a car while at college, so I'm in a wheelchair and desperately job searching. 3) I've been deaf since I was two. 4) My brother is given way more freedom than me because he's not deaf or disabled. 5) Sometimes I got jealous of him a lot as a kid and would try to get him in trouble, but I never got away with it since everyone else in the family always blames me for everything anyway. 6) He also can be kind of insensitive and he's recently fallen in with a bad crowd. 7) Me and my brother are both adults. 8) I am trying to give my brother space, but he keeps doing things that put me in danger or interfere with my wheelchair. He refuses to resolve these issues to the point that I once got trapped in one room for two days straight before I finally yelled at him to unfold my wheelchair.

NOTE

I'm trying to give all this context to get as fair as a judgement as possible and also to explain why I'm actually questioning if I am the A-hole. If you were just looking at what's happening right now, I don't think I would be considered the a-hole. With the context, I think it does change things. A lot. I'm genuinely looking for advice, so I am trying to be as open about the nuances here as possible.

CONTEXT:

I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user, but I've only been able to walk with the cane since early August. I fell down the stairs and then hit by a car a year while recovering from that. I then discovered I have a chronic muscular condition. That was two years ago.

I'm also partially deaf and have hearing aids, but I am fully speaking.

My mother and I have a rocky relationship. WhenI attempted suicide at 13 or 14, my mom told me to ""Just die then"". When I was in the hospital and the doctors thought I was hours from dying, I called my mother and she just cursed me out before the nurse could tell her I was sick. I have suffered from PTSD and bipolar disorder since I was r\*ped when I was five and my mom used my triggers against me. She said it was meant to ""help me get over it"", but she kept doing it even after my therapist ordered her to stop and threatened to call CPS. CPS was over at my house a lot when I was a kid.

My family regularly brings up things I did when I was in middle school and elementary school as reasons they ""cannot trust me"". I'm always guilty until proven innocent and have to justify everything I do. If I don't tell people what I'm doing as I do it, I get blamed for something stupid later.

No matter how how well I did in school or how hard I worked, they always treated me as disabled and different. My mom always talked about how glad she was to have a daughter and how hard it was for her when she found out I was disabled. She outright states that her putting up with my existence is something I should be thankful for and that she could have just given me away as a child. For a long time, I believed that.

Recently, I've kind of stopped putting up with that kind of treatment. Mainly because I made friends in HS, went to college and saw that other families aren't like that. I've been working on calling out the nonsense and setting boundaries.

My brother openly blames me for our family falling apart. He's not entirely wrong. He doesn't know most of the stuff mom actually did or just how much they restricted me. I love him, but he holds no regard for me. There have been times I've fallen out of my wheelchair and down the stairs, and he refused to help because he was watching videos on his phone. I had to injure myself further in order to get to my chair and set back my recovery by a month I was relearning to walk at the time).

I admit (for the sake of judgement) that I can be jealous of my brother, because they give him all the choices and freedom they withheld from me. Heck, I wasn't even allowed to have a door until he asked my parents to get me one when we were teenagers. I wasn't even allowed to leave the street our house was on and my parents refused to let me learn how to drive. When I was his age, I wasn't even allowed to go across the street to a coffee shop after school and hang out with friends if my parents weren't invited. He's allowed to stay out until midnight. It's not fair or right.

As an adult, I put the blame on my parents for the favouritism and I try to give my brother a lot more leeway. I let him treat me pretty badly, honestly, because he openly hates me, frequently insults me, downplays my accomplishments every chance he gets, invalidates+mocks every struggle I have, and constantly expects me to do things he knows I physically cannot do due to my disability (like carry heavy boxes or baskets). I'm trying to be patient and ignore it, because I know he has a right to be mad, but... still. It's hard.

I was at college for DC when I was injured and so I don't have a degree. I was on a full scholarship and I can't get it back at this point (my parents don't have the money to help me pay for school.) I've been desperately searching for a job, but it's the worst time for that. The rate of unemployment is really high and no one wants to hire a disabled kid without a degree. Also, some people in my area have been openly hostile and some even told me ""to let natural selection take its course"" when they realized I was disabled. I've asked around but everyone I know has either been laid off, retired, or their company has no entry level openings.

At this point I have been looking for a job since January and applied to...(checking document of places I've applied) about 6,135 jobs and done 2,564 interviews. I've frequently gotten to the last round of interviews, too. I did try to get help from two local recruiter offices, but they said it's basically hopeless for anyone with disabilities right now. I applied for social security, but my state denies all disability social security applications in order to force people to appeal them. I tried to appeal, but was told there's a huge waiting list for the local lawyers who help with it for free and that it would be a three year process... and the max amount wouldn't even cover a studio apartment. Welcome to the USA. Lol.

At first, I tried to avoid coming home at all costs, but after about six months my savings were just not enough. I couch surfed and did odd jobs for awhile, but eventually got stuck at a hotel. I called some local homeless shelters, but they were full and many of them also informed me they were not wheelchair accessible. My parents refused to let me just live on the streets, understandably. My dad said they'd gotten a ramp set up in the garage and it was winter, so they convinced me to come home on the condition that they'd done things to make the house more accessible... only to find out there was not a ramp. It took them five months to set up the ramp. In that time, they refused to let me have anyone pick me up and refused to help me get to things. They always would say they could take me to anything I needed and then say they couldn't whenever I actually asked them to take me to dr appointments or job interviews. I continued to call homeless shelters and seek help, because I quickly realized that I was trapped and reliant on these people now -- which is very much NOT what I wanted. They had promised this wouldn't happen and said that a lot of things were in place that just... were not. So yeah.

My mom and I started fighting again. At one point she wasn't letting me eat, I called my friend and vented about it. My friend -- always well meaning and brazen but never thinking things through -- decided to start texting my mom to get to her stop. My mom came up to my room and just started screaming and pounding on my door. Like, super loud and my ears rang kind of screaming. My friend was on the phone with me and she called the cops. It was bad. I begged the cops to just give me a ride to a homeless shelter. I had a bag ready to go. They said my wheelchair wouldn't fit in a cop car. I'm not sure if that's true. They also advised me to carry my wheelchair down the stairs to get out of the house? Which was... kind of wild. Honestly about what I expect. The police in my area are infamously horrible at handling abuse cases.

A few weeks after that, one of the many homeless shelters and programs I'd been calling called DHHS. DHHS called the cops. Technically what mom and dad had done was considered kidnapping/holding me hostage. Since they brought me to the house under false pretenses and then I was locked inside + unable to leave. I also asked them to drive me to shelters a few times, but was told no every time. Several shelters had informed me that was illegal and I kind of waved it off at first. It was like a game of telephone and it escalated pretty badly. Cops ended up at our door. I was annoyed, because I knew it would only escalate the situation, but I still asked to be taken to a shelter. The cops refused and then left. The situation did escalate for a bit, but dad started defending me and protecting me.

My mom and my dad's relationship has been rocky for about a decade. They had been threatening each other with divorce since I was in middle school. I guess this was the final straw. My mom moved out even though I was begging my parents to take me to a shelter or to just help me to the curb so I could be picked up by one. My brother blamed me. He's probably right. I definitely played a part in it.

My dad has admitted the only reason he didn't break up with my mom sooner was because she threatened to commit suicide if he did. He and mom kinda brought out the worst in each other.

I can't say I'm sorry that I drove her out, but I am sorry for how much it hurt my brother. He has hated me ever since. In spite of my jealousy, we'd always been closer than most siblings. He's my baby brother, you know? I would jump in front of another car for him anytime. When we fought, we'd often devolve into lightsaber duels, pillow fights, and laughter. My brother has always been the one person I would die for -- the one I loved most -- and then I came back from college. It's like he's a whole different person.

We're a very liberal family and all his new friends are MAGA according to my dad. Right off the bat -- before the drama with mom -- my brother mentioned some... unique opinions about disabled people and women. He's always been a bit quiet, but he was reserved and usually holding back a smile. Now he's just... empty. It's not just me either. Other people have commented on it as well. It's concerning.

He doesn't believe that I'm disabled (I have literally presented him doctor notes at this point and shown him the disabled placard by the state). He kept insinuating that I was lazy or just incompetent since I've been having trouble finding a job. He has worse grades than I did at his age and he's in public school. Now he hates me for what happened with my mom.

I have been trying my best to just give him space. Even though he often does things like fold my chair or block my ramp, I do try to be as patient with him as possible. Thing is, I'll repeatedly ask nicely for him or my dad to unfold my chair and get stuck in one room for two days (happened once) because he refuses to do it. I often do try to handle it myself first or have tried multiple times before, so when I ask for help I do usually need help. There's been a couple times (like with the chair) that I had to yell and I always feel bad about it... I try to give him space, but he's doing things that actually endanger me.

ONTO THE ACTUAL STORY

He has a dog that he doesn't take care of. I love her, but... I'm not physically able to care for her or keep up with her. I also have a cat to take care of. It'd be one thing if he took care of her when he was home or even just played with her sometimes, but... he doesn't. He says he does, but I know he's not telling the truth because she's always with me when he says he plays with her. Not because I want her to be with me, but because she comes and refuses to leave. This would be fine if she didn't always mess with my cat and ruin my stuff.

You see, she's not well trained. She pees on the floor to be obstinate. She steals food out of people's hands and will purposely trip people carrying food in order to steal it. When I was like 17 she bit me hard enough to bleed when I was trying to break up a fight between her and my cat because the dog was stealing my cat's food. I love her, but... She's very badly behaved. That's not her fault, though. She's a really sweet dog most of the time. She's just really badly trained. This is a longstanding issue with my family's pets. Our childhood cat peed all over the floor and never used the litterbox, for example.

I worked really hard to train my cat. She's good about using the litter box and she doesn't eat people food. She comes when her name is called and even alerts me to sounds and alarms that I can't hear. Her shots are always up to date. When she's unwell, I notice right away. She's prone to ear infections and I know exactly what the symptoms are + have some over the counter medicine to treat mild cases on hand. I'm over prepared if anything. We have a doggy door that is self-locking. However, it's run out of battery and they won't replace it. I just keep my cat in my room. She's a good kitty, so that's manageable -- even if that does mean having a litter box a yard from my bed. However, that is obviously not ideal.

So I get kind of frustrated with my brother, because I have had to make sacrifices in order to make my pet manageable for others, but he's on his phone and playing around until midnight with his friends instead of taking his dog on a walk. It's really bad. I tried to grab my cane and take her on a walk, but she pulls so hard that I kept falling over and it was so bad a nice lady actually ended up having to help me. The dog was a lot calmer and well behaved for the rest of the day after that though -- which kind of confirmed the problem. Both my mom and my dad have admitted that the dog is acting out for attention. My dad didn't want the dog from the start, but mom's apartment doesn't take pets and my brother says he wants her even if he doesn't act like it.

Then, it all got worse. The vet said the dog needed special food due to medical issues, but she refuses to eat it. She's knocking over trash cans, lunging and snatching bread, biting me in order to get me to drop food, and then she realized that the crotch of my underpants tastes like period blood. I have a blood clotting disorder so my periods are really, really severe.

She's started eating my underwear, so then I had to go without and she started eatign the crotch of my pants. She eats the crotch out of everything I own whether it's got period blood on it or not. She'll snap her teeth at me if I try to stop her. She darts into the bathroom when I'm getting out of the shower to steal my clothes. If I leave them in a basket, she will get to them. She even knocked over a hamper to steal them at one point.

I can't use the washer in my house. For one, it's down in the basement which is physically painful for me to use regularly. There are 25 - 30 steps between the shower & my room and the basement. More importantly, though, it's too deep. I can get the clothes into the washer but I can't get them out of the washer. It was hard to reach that far when I was able bodied. Now bending like that sends excruciating sparks of pain up my sides and leaves my lower back and abdomen burning for hours. I also can't carry a basket or anything. I'm not able to lift more than ten pounds without risking further damaging my muscular system and ending up with even less mobility than I have now. I was going to handwash stuff -- which is what I was doing at other places -- but my dad threw away the detergent soap bar I had. I have a lot of allergies so the detergent soap bar I can use isn't cheap. I'm working on getting a new one, but my brother also threw out my wash boards. I have one smaller one, but it's not any good for bigger things of clothes. My brother and my dad don't ever bring back half of the clothes I give them to wash. I don't know where they go. They're just gone.

Since a lot of my clothes are dirty, I thought she was only going after dirty clothes for a long time, but then I had a bunch of clothes fresh out of the washer. I was sorting them out in the living room and she went after those, too! So I had to shove all of the pants into bags so she wouldn't steal them out of the basket while fending off a dog that was jumping all over me and trying to bite the clothes I was holding. It's ridiculous. I've even gotten some vaginal infections from wearing things she chewed on that were clean prior to her chewing on them. It's so dumb, but it's genuinely a huge problem.

At this point, I'm having to constantly leave the bathroom full of clothes with the door closed, because this dog keeps eating all of my clothes.

And these aren't cheap clothes either. I'm talking like expensive slacks and stuff, because I'm going to job interviews all the time right now. It's really frustrating

I have been begging my brother to do something -- anything -- about it for a long time. Last week, I had to miss a job interview, because my dog has stolen every pair of pants I own. We're talking like 30 pairs of nice pants at least. Probably closer to twice that. Like, I have had to fill entire trash bags of my clothes with the crotch gone. Each pair ranges between $30 and $150. I haven't even saved that much since getting SNAP benefits, because all that grocery money now goes to paying for my freaking pants. It's so dumb.

I tell my brother to play with his dog so she'll stop seeking attention like this. My brother insists that he has no time and that I should tell him if I see him having time. When I see him watching youtube on his phone, I tell him and he says he's tired and that he'll do it later.

Several times, I had to cancel JOB INTERVIEWS, because my brother let his friend use the bathroom overnight, his friend left the door open, and then the dog went and destroyed the outfit that I put in there before I went to bed so it would be safe from my cat sitting on it or her eating it. Sometimes, I'm able to order amazon last minute, but I literally cannot make plans because I never know if I'll have clothes. I'm at my wit's end. I've been asking as nicely as I can and getting increasinly urgent, but it's in one ear and out the other.

Today I snapped.

I heard my brother downstairs today at 9:40 pm. He said he had just finished cooking and eating dinner and was sitting on his phone. I suggested that he play with his dog. I asked casually at first, but he didn't hear me, so I asked again. He asked me to ask louder, so I did and then he told me to stop yelling at him. So I said sorry and then repeated my request -- kind but firm. He refused, so I got a little more urgent and explained that she'd burst into my room, knocked over a bunch of my stuff, and kept eating my clothes. He then said that he'd just gotten home. To which I pointed out that it was getting late and there wasn't another time to ask. He then repeated he had just gotten home. I then pointed out that he had just told me that he'd cooked a whole meal and eaten it, so clearly he'd been home for awhile. He then started shouting that'd he'd just gotten home and he'd been at school and work all day. I then tried to explain that I really needed him to do this and that he was never home, so I needed to say this before he went off with his friends again. He just kept yelling and then my dad started yelling. He automatically sided with my brother -- as my parents have done since we were in elementary school -- and so I backed off.

(for the record, my brother chooses to cook his own meals because he doesn't like the food my dad, my mom, or me make. I tried to go vegan once and got in huge trouble for being ungrateful or not sharing my food with everyone when I tried to cook my own meals at 16 -- and unlike him I bought my own food! My parents' double standards are crazy sometimes. Not his fault. It's theirs. Just bewilders me how stark the difference is. I still get weird side eyes when I choose to eat food I bought for dinner.)

So then an hour later I saw him on his phone again and I asked him to please play with her. He first lied that he took her for a walk yesterday. He didn't. She was with me Wednesday and Tuesday afternoon. I went to an event at 5 yesterday afternoon, but she was with me until then. When I got home at 9, he and his friends had blocked the garage with a project they'd been working on. The dog was way too hyper to have been walked and was bothering nonstop until she finally settled down beside me. He came home hours later. He was asleep or not home in the mornings.

I called him out on that. He didn't even bother to give any sort of reasoning against it, so I must have been right. I tried to ask him again -- explaining that she'd gotten into my room today, chased my cat around, knocked over a trashcan, nearly knocked over a shelf, and stolen more of my underwear. He then told me that I should just pick up my clothes out of the bathroom (they're in there because she keeps eating them and attacks me when I try to move them) and that she doesn't eat clean clothes (which is false but he never believes me when I tell him that).

I snapped. He just refused to listen. I've been putting up with this for months. I started out just raising my voice and arguing. He kept just saying the same two points over and over again which haven't been working and cutting me off. He wouldn't listen to a word I said. Just sitting there on his phone. I called him lazy and he said he'd been working all day. He then brought up my lack of employment and asked who I was to call him lazy. As if I haven't been working my butt off to try and find a job. As if I hadn't always had to work ten times harder than him just to be treated like a human being. As if I didn't do way more at his age.

Prior to being disabled, I did way more work at his age and I did it for free as a volunteer , because I wasn't allowed to work. Even in college, my parents kept trying to stop me from working. But I got full ride scholarships because I had done over 700 hours of volunteer work every year, four different extracurriculars, and was a B+ student at a college prep school -- which I also got into on a scholarship. He works a minimum wage part time job, spends a couple hours every other week at his youth group (and always tries to get out of it, and only works on his car. Which is probably more than most kids, but it is nothing compared to what I did. I singlehandedly raised like $15,000 for charity through planning a color run and an ice skating festival. I performed at local mainstage productions. I was making presentations to hundreds of psychiatrists, because I'd discovered a unique method of using theater, storytelling, and montessori methods helps people with Alzheimers and dementia by constantly working with people with Alzheimers and dementia.

So I kept yelling. I told him that she is his dog and it is his responsibility. I said it was crazy that I was even having to put up with this. I pointed out that I'd lost hundreds of dollars worth of clothes and that I'd missed job interviews because of this. He said that was my problem and I just started screaming. I was crying from frustration.

My dad yelled at me. He said it was innappropriate. He said he doesn't want the dog here either, but mom doesn't want to take her. I told him that doesn't solve the problem and that she's acting out for attention. She's my brother's dog. It's his responsibility. Feed the dog, clean up after the dog, walk the dog... it's just common knowledge. My dad just repeated himself and walked away, disappointed.

I do feel bad for yelling at my brother, though. I think I might have gone overboard a little. It's just... really hard to deal with. It's expensive and I physically can't fight off a dog. I'm not sure what to do. I am calling homeless shelters again, because at this rate it is preventing me from being able to go outside in anything other than a dress -- and that's if I can find leggings or underwear. There are days I have to sit in a dress without underwear until an amazon package arrives with stuff. During those days, my brother's friends are here and it's always really uncomfortable, too. He refuses to tell me when they are here, so it's often a surprise.

AITA and does anyone have any advice how to deal with this?

My younger brother's dog has eaten hundreds of dollars worth of pants to the point where I don't even have enough clothes to leave the house. It prevented me from going to a job interview. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair/cane and I can't defend against the dog. Me and my mom have had a lot of big drama and he's mad at me. I snapped at him over the whole situation after dealing with the dog for months.

We are both young adults. 22f and 18m respectively.

This is actually becoming an active barrier to me getting a job and endangering my safety sometimes. He refuses to care for her. At the same time, I drove my mom out of the house and now our parents are separating. So I also understand why he's angry. He has every right to be upset.

AITA?

Edit: Just edited it down since it was crazy long and added the summary for clarity. You can skim the context, read the summary, and read the story if you want.

Context is basically:

1. My mom's kind of abusive. 2) Cops came for some questionable stuff she did to me so dad started protecting me from her. They got a divorce over it and my brother is understandably mad at me for it. 2) I got hit by a car while at college, so I'm in a wheelchair and desperately job searching. 3) I've been deaf since I was two. 4) My brother is given way more freedom than me because he's not deaf or disabled. 5) Sometimes I got jealous of him a lot as a kid and would try to get him in trouble, but I never got away with it since everyone else in the family always blames me for everything anyway. 6) He also can be kind of insensitive and he's recently fallen in with a bad crowd. 7) Me and my brother are both adults. 8) I am trying to give my brother space, but he keeps doing things that put me in danger or interfere with my wheelchair. He refuses to resolve these issues to the point that I once got trapped in one room for two days straight before I finally yelled at him to unfold my wheelchair.

NOTE

I'm trying to give all this context to get as fair as a judgement as possible and also to explain why I'm actually questioning if I am the A-hole. If you were just looking at what's happening right now, I don't think I would be considered the a-hole. With the context, I think it does change things. A lot. I'm genuinely looking for advice, so I am trying to be as open about the nuances here as possible.

CONTEXT:

I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user, but I've only been able to walk with the cane since early August. I fell down the stairs and then hit by a car a year while recovering from that. I then discovered I have a chronic muscular condition. That was two years ago.

I'm also partially deaf and have hearing aids, but I am fully speaking.

My mother and I have a rocky relationship. WhenI attempted suicide at 13 or 14, my mom told me to ""Just die then"". When I was in the hospital and the doctors thought I was hours from dying, I called my mother and she just cursed me out before the nurse could tell her I was sick. I have suffered from PTSD and bipolar disorder since I was r\*ped when I was five and my mom used my triggers against me. She said it was meant to ""help me get over it"", but she kept doing it even after my therapist ordered her to stop and threatened to call CPS. CPS was over at my house a lot when I was a kid.

My family regularly brings up things I did when I was in middle school and elementary school as reasons they ""cannot trust me"". I'm always guilty until proven innocent and have to justify everything I do. If I don't tell people what I'm doing as I do it, I get blamed for something stupid later.

No matter how how well I did in school or how hard I worked, they always treated me as disabled and different. My mom always talked about how glad she was to have a daughter and how hard it was for her when she found out I was disabled. She outright states that her putting up with my existence is something I should be thankful for and that she could have just given me away as a child. For a long time, I believed that.

Recently, I've kind of stopped putting up with that kind of treatment. Mainly because I made friends in HS, went to college and saw that other families aren't like that. I've been working on calling out the nonsense and setting boundaries.

My brother openly blames me for our family falling apart. He's not entirely wrong. He doesn't know most of the stuff mom actually did or just how much they restricted me. I love him, but he holds no regard for me. There have been times I've fallen out of my wheelchair and down the stairs, and he refused to help because he was watching videos on his phone. I had to injure myself further in order to get to my chair and set back my recovery by a month I was relearning to walk at the time).

I admit (for the sake of judgement) that I can be jealous of my brother, because they give him all the choices and freedom they withheld from me. Heck, I wasn't even allowed to have a door until he asked my parents to get me one when we were teenagers. I wasn't even allowed to leave the street our house was on and my parents refused to let me learn how to drive. When I was his age, I wasn't even allowed to go across the street to a coffee shop after school and hang out with friends if my parents weren't invited. He's allowed to stay out until midnight. It's not fair or right.

As an adult, I put the blame on my parents for the favouritism and I try to give my brother a lot more leeway. I let him treat me pretty badly, honestly, because he openly hates me, frequently insults me, downplays my accomplishments every chance he gets, invalidates+mocks every struggle I have, and constantly expects me to do things he knows I physically cannot do due to my disability (like carry heavy boxes or baskets). I'm trying to be patient and ignore it, because I know he has a right to be mad, but... still. It's hard.

I was at college for DC when I was injured and so I don't have a degree. I was on a full scholarship and I can't get it back at this point (my parents don't have the money to help me pay for school.) I've been desperately searching for a job, but it's the worst time for that. The rate of unemployment is really high and no one wants to hire a disabled kid without a degree. Also, some people in my area have been openly hostile and some even told me ""to let natural selection take its course"" when they realized I was disabled. I've asked around but everyone I know has either been laid off, retired, or their company has no entry level openings.

At this point I have been looking for a job since January and applied to...(checking document of places I've applied) about 6,135 jobs and done 2,564 interviews. I've frequently gotten to the last round of interviews, too. I did try to get help from two local recruiter offices, but they said it's basically hopeless for anyone with disabilities right now. I applied for social security, but my state denies all disability social security applications in order to force people to appeal them. I tried to appeal, but was told there's a huge waiting list for the local lawyers who help with it for free and that it would be a three year process... and the max amount wouldn't even cover a studio apartment. Welcome to the USA. Lol.

At first, I tried to avoid coming home at all costs, but after about six months my savings were just not enough. I couch surfed and did odd jobs for awhile, but eventually got stuck at a hotel. I called some local homeless shelters, but they were full and many of them also informed me they were not wheelchair accessible. My parents refused to let me just live on the streets, understandably. My dad said they'd gotten a ramp set up in the garage and it was winter, so they convinced me to come home on the condition that they'd done things to make the house more accessible... only to find out there was not a ramp. It took them five months to set up the ramp. In that time, they refused to let me have anyone pick me up and refused to help me get to things. They always would say they could take me to anything I needed and then say they couldn't whenever I actually asked them to take me to dr appointments or job interviews. I continued to call homeless shelters and seek help, because I quickly realized that I was trapped and reliant on these people now -- which is very much NOT what I wanted. They had promised this wouldn't happen and said that a lot of things were in place that just... were not. So yeah.

My mom and I started fighting again. At one point she wasn't letting me eat, I called my friend and vented about it. My friend -- always well meaning and brazen but never thinking things through -- decided to start texting my mom to get to her stop. My mom came up to my room and just started screaming and pounding on my door. Like, super loud and my ears rang kind of screaming. My friend was on the phone with me and she called the cops. It was bad. I begged the cops to just give me a ride to a homeless shelter. I had a bag ready to go. They said my wheelchair wouldn't fit in a cop car. I'm not sure if that's true. They also advised me to carry my wheelchair down the stairs to get out of the house? Which was... kind of wild. Honestly about what I expect. The police in my area are infamously horrible at handling abuse cases.

A few weeks after that, one of the many homeless shelters and programs I'd been calling called DHHS. DHHS called the cops. Technically what mom and dad had done was considered kidnapping/holding me hostage. Since they brought me to the house under false pretenses and then I was locked inside + unable to leave. I also asked them to drive me to shelters a few times, but was told no every time. Several shelters had informed me that was illegal and I kind of waved it off at first. It was like a game of telephone and it escalated pretty badly. Cops ended up at our door. I was annoyed, because I knew it would only escalate the situation, but I still asked to be taken to a shelter. The cops refused and then left. The situation did escalate for a bit, but dad started defending me and protecting me.

My mom and my dad's relationship has been rocky for about a decade. They had been threatening each other with divorce since I was in middle school. I guess this was the final straw. My mom moved out even though I was begging my parents to take me to a shelter or to just help me to the curb so I could be picked up by one. My brother blamed me. He's probably right. I definitely played a part in it.

My dad has admitted the only reason he didn't break up with my mom sooner was because she threatened to commit suicide if he did. He and mom kinda brought out the worst in each other.

I can't say I'm sorry that I drove her out, but I am sorry for how much it hurt my brother. He has hated me ever since. In spite of my jealousy, we'd always been closer than most siblings. He's my baby brother, you know? I would jump in front of another car for him anytime. When we fought, we'd often devolve into lightsaber duels, pillow fights, and laughter. My brother has always been the one person I would die for -- the one I loved most -- and then I came back from college. It's like he's a whole different person.

We're a very liberal family and all his new friends are MAGA according to my dad. Right off the bat -- before the drama with mom -- my brother mentioned some... unique opinions about disabled people and women. He's always been a bit quiet, but he was reserved and usually holding back a smile. Now he's just... empty. It's not just me either. Other people have commented on it as well. It's concerning.

He doesn't believe that I'm disabled (I have literally presented him doctor notes at this point and shown him the disabled placard by the state). He kept insinuating that I was lazy or just incompetent since I've been having trouble finding a job. He has worse grades than I did at his age and he's in public school. Now he hates me for what happened with my mom.

I have been trying my best to just give him space. Even though he often does things like fold my chair or block my ramp, I do try to be as patient with him as possible. Thing is, I'll repeatedly ask nicely for him or my dad to unfold my chair and get stuck in one room for two days (happened once) because he refuses to do it. I often do try to handle it myself first or have tried multiple times before, so when I ask for help I do usually need help. There's been a couple times (like with the chair) that I had to yell and I always feel bad about it... I try to give him space, but he's doing things that actually endanger me.

ONTO THE ACTUAL STORY

He has a dog that he doesn't take care of. I love her, but... I'm not physically able to care for her or keep up with her. I also have a cat to take care of. It'd be one thing if he took care of her when he was home or even just played with her sometimes, but... he doesn't. He says he does, but I know he's not telling the truth because she's always with me when he says he plays with her. Not because I want her to be with me, but because she comes and refuses to leave. This would be fine if she didn't always mess with my cat and ruin my stuff.

You see, she's not well trained. She pees on the floor to be obstinate. She steals food out of people's hands and will purposely trip people carrying food in order to steal it. When I was like 17 she bit me hard enough to bleed when I was trying to break up a fight between her and my cat because the dog was stealing my cat's food. I love her, but... She's very badly behaved. That's not her fault, though. She's a really sweet dog most of the time. She's just really badly trained. This is a longstanding issue with my family's pets. Our childhood cat peed all over the floor and never used the litterbox, for example.

I worked really hard to train my cat. She's good about using the litter box and she doesn't eat people food. She comes when her name is called and even alerts me to sounds and alarms that I can't hear. Her shots are always up to date. When she's unwell, I notice right away. She's prone to ear infections and I know exactly what the symptoms are + have some over the counter medicine to treat mild cases on hand. I'm over prepared if anything. We have a doggy door that is self-locking. However, it's run out of battery and they won't replace it. I just keep my cat in my room. She's a good kitty, so that's manageable -- even if that does mean having a litter box a yard from my bed. However, that is obviously not ideal.

So I get kind of frustrated with my brother, because I have had to make sacrifices in order to make my pet manageable for others, but he's on his phone and playing around until midnight with his friends instead of taking his dog on a walk. It's really bad. I tried to grab my cane and take her on a walk, but she pulls so hard that I kept falling over and it was so bad a nice lady actually ended up having to help me. The dog was a lot calmer and well behaved for the rest of the day after that though -- which kind of confirmed the problem. Both my mom and my dad have admitted that the dog is acting out for attention. My dad didn't want the dog from the start, but mom's apartment doesn't take pets and my brother says he wants her even if he doesn't act like it.

Then, it all got worse. The vet said the dog needed special food due to medical issues, but she refuses to eat it. She's knocking over trash cans, lunging and snatching bread, biting me in order to get me to drop food, and then she realized that the crotch of my underpants tastes like period blood. I have a blood clotting disorder so my periods are really, really severe.

She's started eating my underwear, so then I had to go without and she started eatign the crotch of my pants. She eats the crotch out of everything I own whether it's got period blood on it or not. She'll snap her teeth at me if I try to stop her. She darts into the bathroom when I'm getting out of the shower to steal my clothes. If I leave them in a basket, she will get to them. She even knocked over a hamper to steal them at one point.

I can't use the washer in my house. For one, it's down in the basement which is physically painful for me to use regularly. There are 25 - 30 steps between the shower & my room and the basement. More importantly, though, it's too deep. I can get the clothes into the washer but I can't get them out of the washer. It was hard to reach that far when I was able bodied. Now bending like that sends excruciating sparks of pain up my sides and leaves my lower back and abdomen burning for hours. I also can't carry a basket or anything. I'm not able to lift more than ten pounds without risking further damaging my muscular system and ending up with even less mobility than I have now. I was going to handwash stuff -- which is what I was doing at other places -- but my dad threw away the detergent soap bar I had. I have a lot of allergies so the detergent soap bar I can use isn't cheap. I'm working on getting a new one, but my brother also threw out my wash boards. I have one smaller one, but it's not any good for bigger things of clothes. My brother and my dad don't ever bring back half of the clothes I give them to wash. I don't know where they go. They're just gone.

Since a lot of my clothes are dirty, I thought she was only going after dirty clothes for a long time, but then I had a bunch of clothes fresh out of the washer. I was sorting them out in the living room and she went after those, too! So I had to shove all of the pants into bags so she wouldn't steal them out of the basket while fending off a dog that was jumping all over me and trying to bite the clothes I was holding. It's ridiculous. I've even gotten some vaginal infections from wearing things she chewed on that were clean prior to her chewing on them. It's so dumb, but it's genuinely a huge problem.

At this point, I'm having to constantly leave the bathroom full of clothes with the door closed, because this dog keeps eating all of my clothes.

And these aren't cheap clothes either. I'm talking like expensive slacks and stuff, because I'm going to job interviews all the time right now. It's really frustrating

I have been begging my brother to do something -- anything -- about it for a long time. Last week, I had to miss a job interview, because my dog has stolen every pair of pants I own. We're talking like 30 pairs of nice pants at least. Probably closer to twice that. Like, I have had to fill entire trash bags of my clothes with the crotch gone. Each pair ranges between $30 and $150. I haven't even saved that much since getting SNAP benefits, because all that grocery money now goes to paying for my freaking pants. It's so dumb.

I tell my brother to play with his dog so she'll stop seeking attention like this. My brother insists that he has no time and that I should tell him if I see him having time. When I see him watching youtube on his phone, I tell him and he says he's tired and that he'll do it later.

Several times, I had to cancel JOB INTERVIEWS, because my brother let his friend use the bathroom overnight, his friend left the door open, and then the dog went and destroyed the outfit that I put in there before I went to bed so it would be safe from my cat sitting on it or her eating it. Sometimes, I'm able to order amazon last minute, but I literally cannot make plans because I never know if I'll have clothes. I'm at my wit's end. I've been asking as nicely as I can and getting increasinly urgent, but it's in one ear and out the other.

Today I snapped.

I heard my brother downstairs today at 9:40 pm. He said he had just finished cooking and eating dinner and was sitting on his phone. I suggested that he play with his dog. I asked casually at first, but he didn't hear me, so I asked again. He asked me to ask louder, so I did and then he told me to stop yelling at him. So I said sorry and then repeated my request -- kind but firm. He refused, so I got a little more urgent and explained that she'd burst into my room, knocked over a bunch of my stuff, and kept eating my clothes. He then said that he'd just gotten home. To which I pointed out that it was getting late and there wasn't another time to ask. He then repeated he had just gotten home. I then pointed out that he had just told me that he'd cooked a whole meal and eaten it, so clearly he'd been home for awhile. He then started shouting that'd he'd just gotten home and he'd been at school and work all day. I then tried to explain that I really needed him to do this and that he was never home, so I needed to say this before he went off with his friends again. He just kept yelling and then my dad started yelling. He automatically sided with my brother -- as my parents have done since we were in elementary school -- and so I backed off.

(for the record, my brother chooses to cook his own meals because he doesn't like the food my dad, my mom, or me make. I tried to go vegan once and got in huge trouble for being ungrateful or not sharing my food with everyone when I tried to cook my own meals at 16 -- and unlike him I bought my own food! My parents' double standards are crazy sometimes. Not his fault. It's theirs. Just bewilders me how stark the difference is. I still get weird side eyes when I choose to eat food I bought for dinner.)

So then an hour later I saw him on his phone again and I asked him to please play with her. He first lied that he took her for a walk yesterday. He didn't. She was with me Wednesday and Tuesday afternoon. I went to an event at 5 yesterday afternoon, but she was with me until then. When I got home at 9, he and his friends had blocked the garage with a project they'd been working on. The dog was way too hyper to have been walked and was bothering nonstop until she finally settled down beside me. He came home hours later. He was asleep or not home in the mornings.

I called him out on that. He didn't even bother to give any sort of reasoning against it, so I must have been right. I tried to ask him again -- explaining that she'd gotten into my room today, chased my cat around, knocked over a trashcan, nearly knocked over a shelf, and stolen more of my underwear. He then told me that I should just pick up my clothes out of the bathroom (they're in there because she keeps eating them and attacks me when I try to move them) and that she doesn't eat clean clothes (which is false but he never believes me when I tell him that).

I snapped. He just refused to listen. I've been putting up with this for months. I started out just raising my voice and arguing. He kept just saying the same two points over and over again which haven't been working and cutting me off. He wouldn't listen to a word I said. Just sitting there on his phone. I called him lazy and he said he'd been working all day. He then brought up my lack of employment and asked who I was to call him lazy. As if I haven't been working my butt off to try and find a job. As if I hadn't always had to work ten times harder than him just to be treated like a human being. As if I didn't do way more at his age.

Prior to being disabled, I did way more work at his age and I did it for free as a volunteer , because I wasn't allowed to work. Even in college, my parents kept trying to stop me from working. But I got full ride scholarships because I had done over 700 hours of volunteer work every year, four different extracurriculars, and was a B+ student at a college prep school -- which I also got into on a scholarship. He works a minimum wage part time job, spends a couple hours every other week at his youth group (and always tries to get out of it, and only works on his car. Which is probably more than most kids, but it is nothing compared to what I did. I singlehandedly raised like $15,000 for charity through planning a color run and an ice skating festival. I performed at local mainstage productions. I was making presentations to hundreds of psychiatrists, because I'd discovered a unique method of using theater, storytelling, and montessori methods helps people with Alzheimers and dementia by constantly working with people with Alzheimers and dementia.

So I kept yelling. I told him that she is his dog and it is his responsibility. I said it was crazy that I was even having to put up with this. I pointed out that I'd lost hundreds of dollars worth of clothes and that I'd missed job interviews because of this. He said that was my problem and I just started screaming. I was crying from frustration.

My dad yelled at me. He said it was innappropriate. He said he doesn't want the dog here either, but mom doesn't want to take her. I told him that doesn't solve the problem and that she's acting out for attention. She's my brother's dog. It's his responsibility. Feed the dog, clean up after the dog, walk the dog... it's just common knowledge. My dad just repeated himself and walked away, disappointed.

I do feel bad for yelling at my brother, though. I think I might have gone overboard a little. It's just... really hard to deal with. It's expensive and I physically can't fight off a dog. I'm not sure what to do. I am calling homeless shelters again, because at this rate it is preventing me from being able to go outside in anything other than a dress -- and that's if I can find leggings or underwear. There are days I have to sit in a dress without underwear until an amazon package arrives with stuff. During those days, my brother's friends are here and it's always really uncomfortable, too. He refuses to tell me when they are here, so it's often a surprise.

1nfce61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Book_Buddies/comments/1nfce61/23m_looking_for_a_book_buddy_sci_fi_fantasy/,"23M - Looking for a book buddy (Sci Fi, Fantasy, Romance etc)","Hello to whoever is reading this,

I've currently gotten back into the high life that is full time employment (sarcasm) and due to the nature of my job, it involves a lot of travelling, time away from family and also a constant pace that requires many hours working and less for my free time. 

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

I've also been interested in exploring some romantasy which is a usual change of pace from my usual liking towards more epic fantasy tales. Also, anything with dark romance related undertones with gritty character arcs and vivid storytelling.

I'm planning on starting to read 'The Fourth Wing' pretty soon.

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

Hikes on tall peaks, vast hills and epic views are where you'll likely find me. Along with running along nature trails and trying aimlessly to beat my 5km run time. I like to travel too, whether it be exploring new cities, visiting museums and art galleries or simply just taking in the sights.

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out and I'd be more than happy to talk.

I do have discord if you'd prefer to chat there too.",1,1757705276.0,Book_Buddies,0,1.0,False

Monday 8th sept


I melted some butter, crushed a clove of garlic and some ginger and put them all on a medium heat in a pan. Cut some fresh basil leaves and put on a large slice of bread for toast. I weighed a single freshly harvested golden teacher at 22.6 grams, cut it into small peices, spread the flavoured butter on the toast and topped with the GT and the basil. Not sure this counts as lemontek but i squeezed half a fresh lemon over with a little maldron salt and black pepper. I have to say i did all of this as i wanted the experience of the consumption to be pleasant (i recall many years ago the taste and texture of a philosophers stone truffle being a lasting spoiler for my trip). This part was a win, it was delicious, i chewed quick thinking the nasty flavour would hit, it did not. If you are looking for a quick prep, I'd recommend this (fresh shroom). 
I fed the dog, washed up and took out the bins, this took me 16 minutes. Thought id make a coffee, this is a 6 minute process, mid way through this my depth perception was faltering and i could see in a familiar enhanced HD-like way. Colours became smoother and more contrasting. I finished making my coffee, the heart in the milk was not well poured but was the most interesting ive ever seen as the cup flattened. I turned to walk to the sofa and looked out at the morning sun. The trees were alive with burning orange and tropical green and blue, each cluster of leaves was litterally waving at me, back and forth, happy in its performance. The world had altered to a cartoon like wonderland in the space of a couple of minutes. This was fantastic. It had been at least 20 years since i had taken a halucinagen and this was surpassing my expectations almost immediately. My dose was chosen based on my past experience with lucy and shrooms on a fairly regular basis in my late teens and early twenties, wanting to have a reintroduction that was markable yet not to extream, given this was a fresh mushroom i had multiplied the dose by 10 to equate to 2 grams of dried. I now know this was inaccurate. As i continued to come up fast i decided it was best to head upstairs and lay down in comfort. I cannot remember going upsatairs but once there my view over the fields and trees was exhilarating, the ground undulated and the sun bled the clouds into the trees as they waved at me excitedly. The wooden floor beneath my feet began to spiral and twist, i put myself on the bed and stared out the windows with amazement. As the ceiling formed a cacoon around my body i lost my nerve, i made the mistake of thinking i had a choice in this and rolled my body off the bed in the direction of the bathroom. A nausea set in. I fell off the bed, the floor was unexpectedly hard and sent a jarring shock through what felt was my now fragile existance. I tried to put my head to the toilet and vomit but nothing came up, i felt like my skin was scaled and my body elongated, lizard-like with large slit eyed pupils as i cluthed the bowl. I was there for a good while i think, perhaps 20 minutes. I got into bed and thought i could just sleep this out, i had no control at this point and my thoughts had become panicked and dark. As i closed my eyes the word salad in my head began, 'tuesday spastic norman tong bangers. Susan squadstix vermin sqander'. This was now constant and was accompanied by a childlike feeling of being unfairly teased by something very unfriendly. I was reduced to somthing so vulnerable that this had a large impact on my mood. I felt as though i was aware of a dark empty room, i knew i was in my bed but i was also there, i couldnt see the walls but was aware of being inside, i could see a window frame but outside was a vast darkness the same as inside, no escape. This was where the words were coming from, and they continued in a taunting assault. I thought this is now how life is, now that i know this other place it will always be with me, always watching and running its words through my head, it was here that i began to consider my options very seriously. I held onto the fact that i had been in heavy trips before and had always come out the other side, if this was my first experience i doubt i would have had the strength of mind to know it would end, it felt so final and doomed. This is im sure what it would be like if I was to develop a serious mental illness, a horrendous proposal. There is a space in my mind that i cannot access without halucinagenics, and its dark beneath is indescribably lonely. Having been there twice in my life now, i feel like it is waiting for me to some extent, it exists. I worked through this and forgivingly it slowly faded away. I enjoyed looking at the 4d levels of the skin on my hand, the shifting freckles and hairs that grew out of my arm as i watched and told myself to ignore the now less intense mind shouting. I got up from my bed and went downstairs, my dogs long curls waved like fire as she greeted me as cartoon k9, the front lawn glistened and the clouds were like snowy mountain ranges. There was a calm as i began to process my exposure. I felt drained for the hours that followed. No real emotional energy left. My ears rang for a few minutes that evening noticably and i have been insatiably thirsty since. I delevoped a bruise like pain on my back at the side of each lung that hurts when i cough. Perhaps unrelated i dont know. 
Strangley i am looking forward to my next dose, i have dried my produce and will start with a low and controled measure, i do feel like i have taken something from this experience even if as yet i dont know what. It was both beautiful and pure torment, there is nothing in life like it and having gone back to it, i cannot ignore it. I tried to make this shorter apologies if it has been a waffle. Thanks for reading, it has been cathartic.

1nfc8tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nfc8tp/explore_waterdrop_wdg3cb_replacement_water_filter/,"Explore Waterdrop WD-G3-CB Replacement Water Filter Review for Pure, Clean Drinking Water!","The **Waterdrop WD-G3-CB Filter (WD-G3-N3CB)** has been my go-to filter for weeks now, and I’ve had the chance to thoroughly test its capabilities. As someone who values clean and great-tasting water for both drinking and cooking, I was curious to see if this replacement filter lived up to its enthusiastic reviews. While it impressed me on many fronts, there were some things that stood out—both for better and worse.

**Build Quality and Design**  
This replacement cartridge strikes the perfect balance between durability and practicality. Constructed with carbon block material, it feels solid right out of the box. Its compact dimensions (2.6""D x 2.6""W x 12.1""H) make it effortless to handle, and the white finish provides a clean and modern aesthetic in any under-sink water filtration setup. I also appreciated its eco-friendly materials like the natural coconut shell-activated carbon. Just keep in mind—if you’ve got coconut allergies, this might not be for you.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**  
The product delivers on its promise of improved water taste by effectively removing residual chlorine, odors, and organic impurities. I noticed a pronounced difference in flavor the first time I used water filtered by this system. It's NSF 58 & 372 certified, which added confidence that it wasn’t just a gimmick. While cooking or even brewing coffee, the water didn’t carry the chemical aftertaste you often find in untreated supplies. It's a small joy, honestly, to get crisp, clean water for an entire year without needing frequent replacements.

**Installation Ease**  
Replacing the old filter with this one couldn’t have been simpler. The quick-twist mechanism genuinely takes three seconds—it sounds like an exaggeration, but I was amazed to see it in action. You don’t need extra tools, which is a blessing, especially for someone like me who can never locate the right wrench when I need it.

[Check Waterdrop WD-G3-N3CB price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07nxq3s87/)

**Pluses**  
- Certified to effectively reduce impurities for better-tasting water.  
- Easy three-second replacement system with no tools required.  
- Provides a full year of service, making it cost-effective and low-maintenance.  
- Fits multiple Waterdrop systems: WD-G3-W, WD-G3P600, and WD-G3P800-W.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Not suitable if you’re allergic to coconut-based products.  
- Water might take a day or two to flush completely clean after the initial setup.  
- Slightly higher upfront cost compared to non-branded alternatives.  

**Real-World Usability**  
For my family, this filter was a significant upgrade. Beyond drinking water, we noticed how it enhanced the flavors of simple dishes like pasta or boiled veggies. My coworkers even brought samples of filtered water when I gushed about the taste improvement—it’s not every day water becomes a talking point at the office. That said, there’s a minor flushing process necessary when starting. I recommend running water for 10–15 minutes; the slight cloudiness clears quickly.

**Good Points Over Competing Products**  
In comparison to generic filters, I liked how this cartridge utilized high-grade carbon blocks for deeper filtration. While cheaper knockoffs might initially seem comparable, they often lack official certifications like NSF 58 or customer support options. The long lifespan (up to a year) also sets it apart from rivals needing substitution every six or nine months. However, other competitors like Brita focus more on portability and smaller sizes, which cater to a different audience.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given all its perks, this filter offers excellent value for its price point. Yes, there are more affordable alternatives in the market, but this one’s durability, compatibility with advanced Waterdrop systems, and one-year lifespan justify the investment. Would I repurchase it over a bargain-bin version? Absolutely—clean drinking water is worth the slight extra expense.

I recently shot an indoor event that had extremely challenging lighting.  It was a coffee shop / tap house.  Large windows on one side as the sun was setting and various lights on the inside.  Also part of the event included a presentation and had to shoot the presenter with a bright screen behind them.

Gear used was a canon RP as primary with a m50 as backup.

Used the RF 85mm f2 and 50mm 1.8 on the RP.
On the m50 I only used an adapted Sigma 35mm 1.4 Art.

I was able to capture some good shots with the RP setup but I was very pleased / surprised with the m50 / sigma combo.

The better aperture really helped in many shots and it did fantastic with the harsh backlighting some of the shots had without losing contrast.  The sharpness out of this lens was also fantastic.  I have used the Sigma on my RP before with great results as well.  But seeing the difference that lens made in the same environment was quite surprising.

Anyone else have similar examples where an old body + good lens combo surprised you?",1,1757704902.0,canon,2,1.0,False

Chapter 2. The Call.

The bar, ""The Tightwad’s,"" was like a lost treasure island in a sea of the city's modern, sterile architecture. It was one of the few places where they still strummed live music, and the repertoire consisted of old, lewd sea shanties. The loud, rhythmic live music overwhelmed conversation, forcing people to lean in closer and shout into each other's ears, which, of course, helped forge bonds more quickly. The band, ""The Rusted Cutlasses,"" a trio of bearded, sweaty men who looked like dockside thugs, was just bellowing about a mermaid who had ""treasures between her legs and a willingness to share them."" The crowd roared with delight, joining in on the chorus as mugs clinked together in time with the drums.

The decor, styled after an early twentieth-century port tavern, had an undeniable charm. Old fishing nets and models of frigates hung from the ceiling, and yellowed maps and brass portholes adorned the walls. The air was thick with the smell of spilled beer, cheap tobacco, and a whole spectrum of women's perfumes, from the cheap and sweet to the expensive and predatory. A long oak bar, gleaming from hundreds of thousands of wiped-down mugs, stretched the entire length of the room. Behind it, bartenders bustled about, adhering to the old principle: pour as much as you'd want to get yourself. The drinks were strong, and the beer was cold and bitter.

But it wasn't for the beer that the Guardsmen loved this place so much. It was the women. They were hot, confident, and they knew why they were there. Any single girl in the area looking for a no-strings-attached adventure with a young, fit soldier made a beeline for ""The Tightwad's."" It was an unwritten rule, a sort of marketplace of vanity and desire.

Kael, a thirty-three-year-old corporal in the body of a twenty-eight-year-old, thanks to an early nanite treatment, couldn't have cared less about this marketplace. For a year, his attention had been captured by only one woman. His companion for today, yesterday, and, if all went well, tomorrow. Blanca. Damn, wonderful Blanca. They had met right here, in this noise and the smell of beer, and ever since, they'd been having passionate, wild sex at every possible opportunity. She was older than him, in her forties, with her own company, her own life, and absolutely no need for a man. And that was precisely why he desired her so damn much. Their arrangement was simple: no commitments, just pure, uninhibited pleasure. But after a year, Kael was beginning to suspect that this simple arrangement was starting to get dangerously complicated.

Now, swaying to the rhythm of the shanty, he unceremoniously grabbed her by the ass, which was as firm as her character. It was their regular ritual, a game they both loved. Blanca didn't even flinch. Instead, with a predatory smile he knew by heart, she executed a lightning-fast counterattack. Her nimble hand slipped behind his waistband, slid down, and unerringly found its target. A gentle yet firm squeeze of his testicles made Kael hold his breath and raise his eyebrows in silent admiration, which hadn't diminished one bit after a year.

""Now that I have your full attention,"" she whispered into his ear, her lips brushing against it as her fingers tightened their grip slightly. ""We're going to my place. Now.""

A stifled laugh escaped Kael. ""Alright, woman, you win. Again. But why is it always your place?""

She let him go, her hand casually moving back to his back. ""Because, my dear Guardsman, you still earn peanuts and can afford, at best, to rent a closet with a mattress,"" she snorted, repeating a line he'd heard on their first ""date."" ""And I have a big bed and better whiskey. And don't forget, you have other assets… your stamina."" Her voice carried a note of delightful, absolute dominance that he adored.

Kael laughed out loud. Damn, he loved this woman. Though he would never tell her that.

""Fine, have it your way,"" he muttered, downing the last of his beer and standing up. He scanned the room, looking for his sister.

There she was, at the other end of the bar. Lyra. His beautiful sister, two years his junior, a senior corporal with several years of service. She was thirty-one, though thanks to nanites, her body had stopped aging at twenty-six. She was surrounded by a flock of Guard ""pups,"" first-year recruits with doe eyes and muscles pumped from their initial training. They weren't hitting on her, oh no. They were looking at her with reverent awe, as if she were a living legend. They bombarded her with questions.

""Senior Corporal Lyra, how is it possible you can hit a coin from three hundred meters in a crosswind?""

""Do you have a special breathing technique?""

""Is it true that in sniper school they made you eat your own boots?""

The questions varied, sometimes trivial, sometimes personal, but always tinged with puppy-like adoration. Lyra answered patiently, with a slight, indulgent smile. These boys were just like she had once been. They weren't born geniuses, they weren't brilliant engineers or strategists. Their only chance at a thousand-year life, at escaping mediocrity, was service in the Guard Infantry. Blood, grime, sweat, and tears in exchange for the promise of near-eternal youth. They hadn't undergone the nanite treatment yet; three long years of grueling training awaited them before they could earn it.

Kael waved to her from a distance. She noticed him, and a shadow of a smile touched her lips. She said something to her younger colleagues, and they burst out laughing. Kael didn't need to hear it to know. They were siblings; they understood each other without words. He read it from her lips.

He's been fucking her for a year and has even stopped playing the field.

He laughed himself. She had been less fortunate in her romantic conquests. She didn't want a Guardsman for a boyfriend, claiming she had enough of uniforms at work. And other candidates... well, for civilians, she was too masculine, too direct, too intimidating. Men liked to look at her ass in a tight uniform, but they were afraid of a woman who could assemble a rifle in thirty seconds with her eyes closed and snap a neck with her bare hands.

Suddenly, the drunken cacophony of shanties and chatter was sliced through by something completely alien. The shrill, ear-piercing sound of a combat alarm. The music stopped instantly. Throughout ""The Tightwad's,"" the screens of smartwatches on dozens of wrists lit up simultaneously. The red, pulsing text was unambiguous:

COMBAT ALERT. CODE: RED. REPORT TO UNIT IMMEDIATELY. MAXIMUM ETA: 4 HOURS.

The party was over in a single second. The cheerful buzz turned into the clatter of pushed-back chairs and military boots. Lyra was on her feet first, her amused expression replaced by a focused mask. She looked at her brother, and their eyes met across the heads of the crowd. A perfect understanding.

Kael immediately turned back to Blanca. The woman looked at him, then at his glowing watch, and her smile vanished. She understood. Instead of pulling away, he drew her to him and crashed his lips against hers. It wasn't a quick, farewell peck. It was a deep, passionate kiss, a desperate attempt to condense a year of desire into a few seconds. It tasted of whiskey, of promise, and of the sudden, bitter note of parting.

""Duty calls,"" he murmured, pulling away.

Lyra, pushing through the crowd, headed for the exit, where her brother was already waiting. Suddenly, her path was blocked by a powerfully built man her age, with a shaved head and a tattoo of a snake coiling around his neck. Corporal Jax, her barrack-mate, known for his foul mouth and his ability to procure any contraband on the military base, as well as for his even wider network of contacts. He was just finishing his beer in one mighty gulp.

""So much for the party,"" he tossed in her direction, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. At that same moment, his smartwatch vibrated differently from the others. A private call. A look of surprise crossed his face. ""Hang on, it's Oleg from Fleet Command.""

He answered, and the rest of the Guardsmen, sensing the gravity of the situation, paused for a moment in their frantic march to the door. Jax listened for a moment, his expression hardening with each passing second. His eyes widened in disbelief, then in grim understanding.

""Fuck me,"" he hissed, ending the call. He looked at Lyra, then at the soldiers surrounding him. He took a deep breath. ""This is not a drill. Oleg says the entire fleet is leaving the docks. We're going to Proxima.""

A moment of dead silence fell over the bar, broken only by the last dying chords of the shanty. The word ""Proxima"" hung in the air like a death sentence.

""What for?"" someone from the crowd asked.

Jax swallowed hard. Everyone already knew it was serious, but no one had expected this scale.

""The Plague Empire has set up a base and shipyards there. On Proxima b. We're supposed to fucking take it. The entire Guard Infantry from our 9th Brigade is going, and we'll be joined by Guardsmen from the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Brigades. We're shipping out on transport number 9, the vessel's name is Exodus.""

A whisper rippled through the room. Someone dropped a glass, which shattered with a crash on the floor. This wasn't a routine patrol mission or the pacification of some forgotten colony. This was open war, a full-scale invasion.

""Oleg gave me the strike group's composition,"" Jax continued, his voice, though quiet, carrying with extraordinary power in the sudden silence. ""Fourteen transport ships, two hundred thousand tons each. The escort... get this. Three Hegemon-class carriers at one hundred eighty thousand tons. Nine Thor-class battleships, forty thousand tons each. Twenty-seven Warlord-class cruisers at twenty-seven thousand tons and eighty-one Hammer-class destroyers at twelve thousand tons. The whole fucking ARROW strike group!""

Someone let out a long, low whistle. Kael, who had rejoined his sister, exchanged a heavy look with her. A force that large meant one thing: high command was expecting a hell of a fight and had no intention of losing.

""And now for the best part,"" Jax added grimly. ""Travel time, one way: eight point four years.""

The silence that followed those words was as heavy as lead. Eight years one way. Eight years back. A mission from which they would return, if at all, in nearly seventeen years. Seventeen years locked in a metal can, followed by a fight for their lives on an alien planet, light-years from home. Kael felt his heart rise into his throat. He spun around, searching for Blanca. She was standing by the bar, still as a statue, staring at him from across the room. Their eyes met, and in that instant, they understood everything, without a word.

He ignored his sister, ignored Jax and the rest of the Guardsmen. He started back toward her, pushing through the crowd that was frozen in place. He stood before her, and the noise of the bar ceased to exist for him.

""You heard,"" he stated, not a question.

She nodded, her eyes shining with a strange, unreadable light. ""Seventeen years, Kael. I'll be almost sixty.""

That word, spoken aloud, hit him with the force of a physical blow. He would come back the same. She would be a different woman. Their worlds, so perfectly aligned for the past year, would diverge irrevocably.

""I know,"" he whispered, his voice breaking. ""Blanca, I...""

""Don't,"" she interrupted him gently, placing a finger on his lips. ""Don't say anything. Don't make promises you can't keep. Not now. We both know this is the end.""

There was no regret in her voice, only a brutal, pragmatic acceptance. The very quality he had fallen in love with in her was now hurting him the most.

""When I get back... if I get back..."" he began, trying to force a hardness into his voice that he didn't feel. ""I'll call. And I'll take you for coffee. To that little place of ours by the river.""

A shadow of a smile appeared on her lips. A real, warm smile.

""I'll be waiting for that call, soldier boy.""

He leaned in and kissed her. This time gently, tenderly, with all the bitterness of a farewell that would have to last them seventeen years. She tasted of whiskey and a lost future.

""Take care, Blanca.""

""You too, Kael. And come back.""

He turned and walked away without looking back. He knew if he looked one more time, he wouldn't have the strength to leave.

Playtime was over. Service had begun.

They were ready for anything.

At the same time, in a sterile, luxurious apartment overlooking the illuminated heart of the city, the atmosphere was thick with a completely different kind of tension. Aris Thorne, his hand clamped on his communicator, felt cold sweat trickle down his back. His fingers trembled as he dialed his brother's number yet again. Each ring was like a hammer blow to his racing heart. Beside him, his wife, Elara, paced the room like a caged animal. Her face, usually an oasis of calm, was now a mask of primal fear. She walked from wall to wall, her nervous movements a silent scream of despair that echoed in the tomb-like silence of the apartment.

""Aris, keep calling..."" she rasped, her voice alien, choked with panic. ""He has to answer. He has to.""

Aris didn't reply. He focused all his willpower on the device in his hand, praying silently to all the gods he had long since stopped believing in. Finally, the connection was made. A rough, impatient voice came from the speaker, muffled by the din of orders and the metallic echo of the command pit.

""I can't talk right now, I'm overseeing battle group preparations! Arrow! Why are you calling non-stop?""

Markus's voice was like a blast of frigid air, professional and distant. Aris felt a sting—to his brother, he was just another distraction in the war machine. Elara froze in the middle of the room, staring at the communicator with maddened hope.

""My children are in the 9th Brigade!"" Aris blurted out, his voice cracking, revealing raw, paternal terror. ""I know they're going to Proxima. Markus... transfer them, please, I'm begging you, take them off the list!""

The silence on the other end lasted only a second, but to Aris, it was an eternity. He felt the fate of his children, his entire world, hanging in the balance of that short moment.

""Aris..."" Markus's reply was quieter, but harder than steel. ""I can't do that. Your children are soldiers. They've been trained, their performance is above average. They were chosen.""

Aris heard the words, but his mind refused to accept them. It was a nightmare. His son and daughter, his pride and joy, now reduced to statistics in a military report. He looked at his wife, who was silently mouthing the word ""beg.""

""Brother, please..."" his voice was now just a whisper, a drowning man's last hope. ""You have the power. Admiral of the Guard Fleet. One order from you, one signature, and they'll be safe. They'll come home.""

In that moment, Aris was no longer an influential scientist. He was just a father, begging for his children's lives. On the other side, on the bridge of the flagship, Admiral Marcus Thorne closed his eyes for a moment. Before his mind's eye were not the silhouettes of soldiers, but the faces of his nephew and niece. Kael, with that roguish grin of his. Lyra, with her calm, unshakable confidence. Family. His own blood. His brother's plea was like a knife twisted in his conscience. He could do it. One encrypted order, one stroke of a pen on a digital document. He could save them.

But then he saw other faces. Thousands of faces of the young men and women under his command. Each of them was someone's child, someone's brother, sister, love. How could he look them in the eye, knowing that he had bent the rules for his own family, rules they all had to obey? How could he demand the ultimate sacrifice from them when he was shielding his own? It would be a betrayal. A betrayal of the ideals to which he had dedicated his entire life. Morale, that delicate, invisible foundation of any army, would crumble to dust. Faith in the command, in the fairness of the system, would die in an instant, replaced by cynicism and a sense of injustice. That single decision could lose the war before it even began.

He opened his eyes. His gaze was as cold and hard as the armor of his ship.

""I will not do it,"" he said, and each word was a blow against himself. ""What would that look like to the other soldiers of the 9th Brigade? To the Seven Worlds Defense Guard? This entire unit, its morale, would go up in smoke. I will not sacrifice thousands for the sake of two. Not even if it's our family.""

There was no longer anger in his voice, only the weight of the decision he had made. A weight he would carry for the rest of his days.

""I will not do it.""

Before Aris could say anything, he heard only the click of the terminated connection. The communicator fell silent. Absolute silence descended upon the apartment. Aris stood motionless, staring at the dead device in his hand. And then a sound escaped Elara's throat—a long, terrifying wail, the cry of all parents in the universe losing their children to war.

Marcus Thorne stood in the command center, surrounded by the chaos of preparations, yet he felt more alone than ever. He had just sacrificed his family on the altar of duty. And he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to forgive himself, or if his brother ever would.

“We need to have a talk about our communication protocols” I said to my quasi-alive predecessor.

“WHAT”? Doctor Doomsday shouted back, barely audible over the constant roar of the converted V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport aircraft he was piloting. He glanced at me from the pilot’s chair, an entirely unnecessary motion due to the dozens of optical sensors hidden almost everywhere on his mechanical frame. He could still see me just fine if he was looking out of the cockpit or break dancing in the storage bay. 

“I SAID-” I tried to reply, but Doctor Doomsday shook his head while tapping the side of his helmet with his free hand. 

“I CAN’T HEAR YOU. WE’LL DISCUSS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS AFTER THE MISSION” he said, and returned his attention to the controls of the aircraft. There wasn’t much for him to do, since we were flying over a vast swath of flat farmland, but I supposed it made sense to at least look in the direction we were flying. This investigation would be over before it began if we perished in a corn field en route. 

I briefly pondered the point of a robot wearing a helmet in the first place before I dismissed it as either habit, eccentric behavior trying to get a rise out of me, or if we needed to retrofit the cockpit to be compatible with Doombot software. I watched the rows of corn speeding by for a few minutes before I cracked open the binder that Static had given us, begrudgingly admiring the detail the Hero’s Union 283 had put into their briefing. The farm consisted of two adults, one of which had a lower level superpower, and a long list of domesticated animals, both livestock and pets. Well, the dog listed on page 4 was probably a ‘working’ dog of sorts, and the cats might just be natural pest control. The whole property covered 12 acres of grazing grasslands, a few beehives, and rows upon rows of what looked to be corn. The house and the barn, where ShepHeard’s body had been found, lay in the south-west corner with woods surrounding the edges of the property. 

“PREPARE FOR LANDING!” Doctor Doomsday shouted. I glanced up just in time to see the madman push the flight stick all the way forwards and send the Osprey into a nosedive. I dropped the folder and grasped at anything I could reach as the plane fell out of the sky. Mere moments before certain death, the mechanical man pulled up and switched to the vertical takeoff and landing mode, regaining lift within a yard of smashing us against an old dirt road. The wheels had barely touched the ground before he switched the plane off and unbuckled his harness. He turned back to look at me as he ducked out of the cockpit towards the lowering cargo ramp. “No time to dilly-dally, my boy! You can rest on the flight back.”

I undid my own harness and joined Doctor Doomsday and Chairman Static as we departed the Osprey.	The farm was swarming with police and heroes alike, circling around the crime scene like ants around an unguarded picnic blanket. I recognized a few heroes I had met in passing, mingling with a cluster of our boys in blue. They were all hard at work with donuts and coffee in hand. One very familiar hero spotted me and waved, flinging powdered donut crumbs over the nearest uniformed police officer like the sandman frantically trying to put an unruly child to sleep. I returned the wave sheepishly as she made her way to embrace me in a big, motherly hug. 

“Steven! Oh it’s so good to see my baby boy!” The heroine squealed as she squeezed me with super-human strength. I struggled to fill my lungs against the crushing pressure to squeak out an embarrassed grumble in reply. 

“I’ve been meaning to come by the Doomfort to see you!” She said as she finally released me from the hug that would have killed a normal person. “How are the repairs going?” 

“The Doomfort is currently operating at 58.21% capacity, with defenses and quality of life retrofits taking priority” Doctor Doomsday announced proudly, answering for me. “We should have the ice cream parlor up and running by the end of the week.” 

Anchor Woman smiled at the mechanical maniac. “Thanks, Nigel. How’s the new body treating you?” 

Doctor Doomsday took Anchor Woman’s hand and brought it to his robotic mouth in an automated mockery of old fashion Southern hospitality. “Splendidly, thank you for asking. If I had realized just how much lower back pain I had in my original flesh and bones, I would have made the switch years ago.” 

Anchor Woman giggled, blushing ever so slightly. “Don’t tell me that, I may want one of those myself if my hip issue isn’t fixed soon.”

Doctor Doomsday raised a mechanical eyebrow. “We could arrange that, my dear.”

“Can you show us where ShepHeard’s body was found, mom?” I interrupted, leaping at the opportunity to put a stop to this waking nightmare of a conversation. 

“Hmm? Oh, yes, that. Right this way” she said, and led us through. We ducked under the standard yellow police tape, the kind that had never once actually deterred any un-authorized access, and found ourselves standing beside a corpse. It was the first dead body I had seen in person since… well, my father’s, shortly after I had shot him in the face several times. I shuddered and made another mental note in my concerningly long list for the Doomfort therapist to pick over. For now, I had to maintain my image in front of my contemporaries.   

ShepHeard was lying face down in the dirt, blocking the barn door from closing like the world’s grossest doorstop. The laser wound was right where Chairman Static said it would be, smack dab in the middle of the back of his head. The hair had been burned away in a small ring around the entry point, and the hole itself was partially cauterized, leaving a bullseye ring where that part of his skull should be. Doctor Doomsday circled the body, squatting to examine bits closer as needed. He withdrew a hand from his signature lab coat pocket, revealing three metallic orbs with glowing red spots. Each orb unfolded like an origami figure and took flight, swarming around the body to scan and photograph and probably a hundred other sciency things. He drew another handful of the devices from some other hidden pocket and tossed them into the air, where they unfolded mid-flight and spread out to scan the surrounding area. 

“Were there any witnesses?” Doctor Doomsday asked Anchor Woman as he stood, brushing dirt off his labcoat. 

“No” she said, “The only other person on the farm was his wife, Martha, who said she was asleep when it happened. Would you like to speak wi-”

Doctor Doomsday waved a dismissive hand at Anchor Woman mid sentence. “Nevermind. I need to confer with your son on the matter. Come, Steven.” 

The mechanical madman took off at a brisk pace. I gave mom an apologetic shrug and made to follow. I caught up to him with… well, with considerably more effort than I cared to admit. I really needed to start exercising more. 

“Where are we going?” I asked as I caught up to my mentor. “Did you find a clue or something?” 

“No,” he said bluntly, “I didn’t find anything at all. Nothing that wasn’t in the Hero’s Union report. It is possible that the drones might find something, but frankly, I doubt they’ll be of any use.” 

“But…” I said, trailing off as my mental gears grinded away to parse the truth from his words. “Oh. They’re just a distraction, aren’t they?.”

“Precisely! And it grants us plenty of time to interview the witnesses.” 

I furrowed my brow in confusion. “Um, Doc, mom said there weren’t any people around besides ShepHeard’s wife…” 

Doctor Doomsday scoffed in irritation. “I didn’t say people, my boy, I said witnesses.” 

“You lost me,” I admitted. 

Doctor Doomsday pulled his sleeve back, exposing his robotic forearm and the phone sized screen mounted within. With a few taps near his wrist, the small screen blinked on, showing what was likely a live feed of one of those tiny drones he had scattered. This one was hovering above the barn door, facing the exterior wall as it scanned every plank. It slowed along the top, coming to a complete stop in a dark corner. The camera adjusted its brightness until I saw it: A relatively large spider, probably the size of a gumball, walking in delicate circles as it repaired its web.

“We have a witness” Doctor Doomsday proclaimed. “What we need is a translator.” He glanced at the diver’s watch strapped on his mechanical wrist, for old habit’s sake. “Hmm. 4:00 PM exactly. We need to hurry if we want to talk to her today.”

My eyes grew so wide I was afraid they would fall right out of my face. I couldn’t have kept the fear out of my voice if my life depended on it. “Her…you can’t possibly mean…”

Doctor Doomsday’s eye twinkled with mechanical mischievous glee. “Oh yes, my boy. We’re going to visit Grandmommy Longlegs.”",1,1757704832.0,SlightlyColdStories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 2. The Call.

The bar, ""The Tightwad’s,"" was like a lost treasure island in a sea of the city's modern, sterile architecture. It was one of the few places where they still strummed live music, and the repertoire consisted of old, lewd sea shanties. The loud, rhythmic live music overwhelmed conversation, forcing people to lean in closer and shout into each other's ears, which, of course, helped forge bonds more quickly. The band, ""The Rusted Cutlasses,"" a trio of bearded, sweaty men who looked like dockside thugs, was just bellowing about a mermaid who had ""treasures between her legs and a willingness to share them."" The crowd roared with delight, joining in on the chorus as mugs clinked together in time with the drums.

The decor, styled after an early twentieth-century port tavern, had an undeniable charm. Old fishing nets and models of frigates hung from the ceiling, and yellowed maps and brass portholes adorned the walls. The air was thick with the smell of spilled beer, cheap tobacco, and a whole spectrum of women's perfumes, from the cheap and sweet to the expensive and predatory. A long oak bar, gleaming from hundreds of thousands of wiped-down mugs, stretched the entire length of the room. Behind it, bartenders bustled about, adhering to the old principle: pour as much as you'd want to get yourself. The drinks were strong, and the beer was cold and bitter.

But it wasn't for the beer that the Guardsmen loved this place so much. It was the women. They were hot, confident, and they knew why they were there. Any single girl in the area looking for a no-strings-attached adventure with a young, fit soldier made a beeline for ""The Tightwad's."" It was an unwritten rule, a sort of marketplace of vanity and desire.

Kael, a thirty-three-year-old corporal in the body of a twenty-eight-year-old, thanks to an early nanite treatment, couldn't have cared less about this marketplace. For a year, his attention had been captured by only one woman. His companion for today, yesterday, and, if all went well, tomorrow. Blanca. Damn, wonderful Blanca. They had met right here, in this noise and the smell of beer, and ever since, they'd been having passionate, wild sex at every possible opportunity. She was older than him, in her forties, with her own company, her own life, and absolutely no need for a man. And that was precisely why he desired her so damn much. Their arrangement was simple: no commitments, just pure, uninhibited pleasure. But after a year, Kael was beginning to suspect that this simple arrangement was starting to get dangerously complicated.

Now, swaying to the rhythm of the shanty, he unceremoniously grabbed her by the ass, which was as firm as her character. It was their regular ritual, a game they both loved. Blanca didn't even flinch. Instead, with a predatory smile he knew by heart, she executed a lightning-fast counterattack. Her nimble hand slipped behind his waistband, slid down, and unerringly found its target. A gentle yet firm squeeze of his testicles made Kael hold his breath and raise his eyebrows in silent admiration, which hadn't diminished one bit after a year.

""Now that I have your full attention,"" she whispered into his ear, her lips brushing against it as her fingers tightened their grip slightly. ""We're going to my place. Now.""

A stifled laugh escaped Kael. ""Alright, woman, you win. Again. But why is it always your place?""

She let him go, her hand casually moving back to his back. ""Because, my dear Guardsman, you still earn peanuts and can afford, at best, to rent a closet with a mattress,"" she snorted, repeating a line he'd heard on their first ""date."" ""And I have a big bed and better whiskey. And don't forget, you have other assets… your stamina."" Her voice carried a note of delightful, absolute dominance that he adored.

Kael laughed out loud. Damn, he loved this woman. Though he would never tell her that.

""Fine, have it your way,"" he muttered, downing the last of his beer and standing up. He scanned the room, looking for his sister.

There she was, at the other end of the bar. Lyra. His beautiful sister, two years his junior, a senior corporal with several years of service. She was thirty-one, though thanks to nanites, her body had stopped aging at twenty-six. She was surrounded by a flock of Guard ""pups,"" first-year recruits with doe eyes and muscles pumped from their initial training. They weren't hitting on her, oh no. They were looking at her with reverent awe, as if she were a living legend. They bombarded her with questions.

""Senior Corporal Lyra, how is it possible you can hit a coin from three hundred meters in a crosswind?""

""Do you have a special breathing technique?""

""Is it true that in sniper school they made you eat your own boots?""

The questions varied, sometimes trivial, sometimes personal, but always tinged with puppy-like adoration. Lyra answered patiently, with a slight, indulgent smile. These boys were just like she had once been. They weren't born geniuses, they weren't brilliant engineers or strategists. Their only chance at a thousand-year life, at escaping mediocrity, was service in the Guard Infantry. Blood, grime, sweat, and tears in exchange for the promise of near-eternal youth. They hadn't undergone the nanite treatment yet; three long years of grueling training awaited them before they could earn it.

Kael waved to her from a distance. She noticed him, and a shadow of a smile touched her lips. She said something to her younger colleagues, and they burst out laughing. Kael didn't need to hear it to know. They were siblings; they understood each other without words. He read it from her lips.

He's been fucking her for a year and has even stopped playing the field.

He laughed himself. She had been less fortunate in her romantic conquests. She didn't want a Guardsman for a boyfriend, claiming she had enough of uniforms at work. And other candidates... well, for civilians, she was too masculine, too direct, too intimidating. Men liked to look at her ass in a tight uniform, but they were afraid of a woman who could assemble a rifle in thirty seconds with her eyes closed and snap a neck with her bare hands.

Suddenly, the drunken cacophony of shanties and chatter was sliced through by something completely alien. The shrill, ear-piercing sound of a combat alarm. The music stopped instantly. Throughout ""The Tightwad's,"" the screens of smartwatches on dozens of wrists lit up simultaneously. The red, pulsing text was unambiguous:

COMBAT ALERT. CODE: RED. REPORT TO UNIT IMMEDIATELY. MAXIMUM ETA: 4 HOURS.

The party was over in a single second. The cheerful buzz turned into the clatter of pushed-back chairs and military boots. Lyra was on her feet first, her amused expression replaced by a focused mask. She looked at her brother, and their eyes met across the heads of the crowd. A perfect understanding.

Kael immediately turned back to Blanca. The woman looked at him, then at his glowing watch, and her smile vanished. She understood. Instead of pulling away, he drew her to him and crashed his lips against hers. It wasn't a quick, farewell peck. It was a deep, passionate kiss, a desperate attempt to condense a year of desire into a few seconds. It tasted of whiskey, of promise, and of the sudden, bitter note of parting.

""Duty calls,"" he murmured, pulling away.

Lyra, pushing through the crowd, headed for the exit, where her brother was already waiting. Suddenly, her path was blocked by a powerfully built man her age, with a shaved head and a tattoo of a snake coiling around his neck. Corporal Jax, her barrack-mate, known for his foul mouth and his ability to procure any contraband on the military base, as well as for his even wider network of contacts. He was just finishing his beer in one mighty gulp.

""So much for the party,"" he tossed in her direction, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. At that same moment, his smartwatch vibrated differently from the others. A private call. A look of surprise crossed his face. ""Hang on, it's Oleg from Fleet Command.""

He answered, and the rest of the Guardsmen, sensing the gravity of the situation, paused for a moment in their frantic march to the door. Jax listened for a moment, his expression hardening with each passing second. His eyes widened in disbelief, then in grim understanding.

""Fuck me,"" he hissed, ending the call. He looked at Lyra, then at the soldiers surrounding him. He took a deep breath. ""This is not a drill. Oleg says the entire fleet is leaving the docks. We're going to Proxima.""

A moment of dead silence fell over the bar, broken only by the last dying chords of the shanty. The word ""Proxima"" hung in the air like a death sentence.

""What for?"" someone from the crowd asked.

Jax swallowed hard. Everyone already knew it was serious, but no one had expected this scale.

""The Plague Empire has set up a base and shipyards there. On Proxima b. We're supposed to fucking take it. The entire Guard Infantry from our 9th Brigade is going, and we'll be joined by Guardsmen from the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Brigades. We're shipping out on transport number 9, the vessel's name is Exodus.""

A whisper rippled through the room. Someone dropped a glass, which shattered with a crash on the floor. This wasn't a routine patrol mission or the pacification of some forgotten colony. This was open war, a full-scale invasion.

""Oleg gave me the strike group's composition,"" Jax continued, his voice, though quiet, carrying with extraordinary power in the sudden silence. ""Fourteen transport ships, two hundred thousand tons each. The escort... get this. Three Hegemon-class carriers at one hundred eighty thousand tons. Nine Thor-class battleships, forty thousand tons each. Twenty-seven Warlord-class cruisers at twenty-seven thousand tons and eighty-one Hammer-class destroyers at twelve thousand tons. The whole fucking ARROW strike group!""

Someone let out a long, low whistle. Kael, who had rejoined his sister, exchanged a heavy look with her. A force that large meant one thing: high command was expecting a hell of a fight and had no intention of losing.

""And now for the best part,"" Jax added grimly. ""Travel time, one way: eight point four years.""

The silence that followed those words was as heavy as lead. Eight years one way. Eight years back. A mission from which they would return, if at all, in nearly seventeen years. Seventeen years locked in a metal can, followed by a fight for their lives on an alien planet, light-years from home. Kael felt his heart rise into his throat. He spun around, searching for Blanca. She was standing by the bar, still as a statue, staring at him from across the room. Their eyes met, and in that instant, they understood everything, without a word.

He ignored his sister, ignored Jax and the rest of the Guardsmen. He started back toward her, pushing through the crowd that was frozen in place. He stood before her, and the noise of the bar ceased to exist for him.

""You heard,"" he stated, not a question.

She nodded, her eyes shining with a strange, unreadable light. ""Seventeen years, Kael. I'll be almost sixty.""

That word, spoken aloud, hit him with the force of a physical blow. He would come back the same. She would be a different woman. Their worlds, so perfectly aligned for the past year, would diverge irrevocably.

""I know,"" he whispered, his voice breaking. ""Blanca, I...""

""Don't,"" she interrupted him gently, placing a finger on his lips. ""Don't say anything. Don't make promises you can't keep. Not now. We both know this is the end.""

There was no regret in her voice, only a brutal, pragmatic acceptance. The very quality he had fallen in love with in her was now hurting him the most.

""When I get back... if I get back..."" he began, trying to force a hardness into his voice that he didn't feel. ""I'll call. And I'll take you for coffee. To that little place of ours by the river.""

A shadow of a smile appeared on her lips. A real, warm smile.

""I'll be waiting for that call, soldier boy.""

He leaned in and kissed her. This time gently, tenderly, with all the bitterness of a farewell that would have to last them seventeen years. She tasted of whiskey and a lost future.

""Take care, Blanca.""

""You too, Kael. And come back.""

He turned and walked away without looking back. He knew if he looked one more time, he wouldn't have the strength to leave.

Playtime was over. Service had begun.

They were ready for anything.

At the same time, in a sterile, luxurious apartment overlooking the illuminated heart of the city, the atmosphere was thick with a completely different kind of tension. Aris Thorne, his hand clamped on his communicator, felt cold sweat trickle down his back. His fingers trembled as he dialed his brother's number yet again. Each ring was like a hammer blow to his racing heart. Beside him, his wife, Elara, paced the room like a caged animal. Her face, usually an oasis of calm, was now a mask of primal fear. She walked from wall to wall, her nervous movements a silent scream of despair that echoed in the tomb-like silence of the apartment.

""Aris, keep calling..."" she rasped, her voice alien, choked with panic. ""He has to answer. He has to.""

Aris didn't reply. He focused all his willpower on the device in his hand, praying silently to all the gods he had long since stopped believing in. Finally, the connection was made. A rough, impatient voice came from the speaker, muffled by the din of orders and the metallic echo of the command pit.

""I can't talk right now, I'm overseeing battle group preparations! Arrow! Why are you calling non-stop?""

Markus's voice was like a blast of frigid air, professional and distant. Aris felt a sting—to his brother, he was just another distraction in the war machine. Elara froze in the middle of the room, staring at the communicator with maddened hope.

""My children are in the 9th Brigade!"" Aris blurted out, his voice cracking, revealing raw, paternal terror. ""I know they're going to Proxima. Markus... transfer them, please, I'm begging you, take them off the list!""

The silence on the other end lasted only a second, but to Aris, it was an eternity. He felt the fate of his children, his entire world, hanging in the balance of that short moment.

""Aris..."" Markus's reply was quieter, but harder than steel. ""I can't do that. Your children are soldiers. They've been trained, their performance is above average. They were chosen.""

Aris heard the words, but his mind refused to accept them. It was a nightmare. His son and daughter, his pride and joy, now reduced to statistics in a military report. He looked at his wife, who was silently mouthing the word ""beg.""

""Brother, please..."" his voice was now just a whisper, a drowning man's last hope. ""You have the power. Admiral of the Guard Fleet. One order from you, one signature, and they'll be safe. They'll come home.""

In that moment, Aris was no longer an influential scientist. He was just a father, begging for his children's lives. On the other side, on the bridge of the flagship, Admiral Marcus Thorne closed his eyes for a moment. Before his mind's eye were not the silhouettes of soldiers, but the faces of his nephew and niece. Kael, with that roguish grin of his. Lyra, with her calm, unshakable confidence. Family. His own blood. His brother's plea was like a knife twisted in his conscience. He could do it. One encrypted order, one stroke of a pen on a digital document. He could save them.

But then he saw other faces. Thousands of faces of the young men and women under his command. Each of them was someone's child, someone's brother, sister, love. How could he look them in the eye, knowing that he had bent the rules for his own family, rules they all had to obey? How could he demand the ultimate sacrifice from them when he was shielding his own? It would be a betrayal. A betrayal of the ideals to which he had dedicated his entire life. Morale, that delicate, invisible foundation of any army, would crumble to dust. Faith in the command, in the fairness of the system, would die in an instant, replaced by cynicism and a sense of injustice. That single decision could lose the war before it even began.

He opened his eyes. His gaze was as cold and hard as the armor of his ship.

""I will not do it,"" he said, and each word was a blow against himself. ""What would that look like to the other soldiers of the 9th Brigade? To the Seven Worlds Defense Guard? This entire unit, its morale, would go up in smoke. I will not sacrifice thousands for the sake of two. Not even if it's our family.""

There was no longer anger in his voice, only the weight of the decision he had made. A weight he would carry for the rest of his days.

""I will not do it.""

Before Aris could say anything, he heard only the click of the terminated connection. The communicator fell silent. Absolute silence descended upon the apartment. Aris stood motionless, staring at the dead device in his hand. And then a sound escaped Elara's throat—a long, terrifying wail, the cry of all parents in the universe losing their children to war.

Marcus Thorne stood in the command center, surrounded by the chaos of preparations, yet he felt more alone than ever. He had just sacrificed his family on the altar of duty. And he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to forgive himself, or if his brother ever would.

I'm hoping to get her a few nice gifts that she may like that could be related to her culture.   
As far as I know she really enjoyed the baklava I've bought her, though she did inform me she's picky/has weird eating habits so that would be hard, though she very much enjoys drinking coffee, usually black.

I would love to get her more stuff, not necessarily food but maybe coffee bundles and other stuff that a Syrian woman might like? 

Note that we live in a gulf country but I can buy imported stuff or products online rather than local so I am open to any suggestions that's possible. Thank you.",1,1757704156.0,LGBTArabs,0,1.0,False

1nfbwyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/littlehouseonprairie/comments/1nfbwyh/im_rewatching_little_house_last_update/,I'm rewatching Little House last update,"I finally finished rewatching this series, here are links to my other updates.

Here is the first one - https://www.reddit.com/r/littlehouseonprairie/s/Gk4ZndBKuD


Here is the second one - https://www.reddit.com/r/littlehouseonprairie/s/ZeTmfIn7Ka

Here is the fourth one - https://www.reddit.com/r/littlehouseonprairie/s/X4qfm67sgu

So, here are my thoughts on the last of the episodes to the end of the show. I won't mention every episode, just the ones that got my attention. 

Spoilers beyond this point. 

...

The Lost Ones part 1 & 2. 

Why was this written in? The Ingalls did not need more kids, James and Cassandera just aren't necessary. 

Of course Charles goes down the hill just fine as apparently, no one can drive a wagon like he can. 

...

The Reincarnation Of Nellie Part 1 & 2. 

Nancy is right, I do hate her, I truly honestly hate the character Nancy. I have nothing against the actress, just can't stand Nancy. 

This character needed some refining, I think. No child locks up someone in an ice house, good grief. Were the writers intending to make Nancy a sociopath or something? 

I get that she is supposed to be mean and nasty, some kids are bullies, okay fine but to lock someone in an ice house, bite people, smash windows, set fires, and the other crap Nancy pulled? It just goes too far. 

At least Nellie had a bit of a heart, yeah she was mean but she had her softer moments even before Percival came. 

I just think a more troubled past should have been written for Nancy, like what they did with Albert in being abused at the orphanage. 

All we have for Nancy's background is that her mother died while giving birth to Nancy and that Nancy was raised by her grandmother, that's it. We aren't told anything about her father, unless I missed something. Where is Nancy's father though? 

I think the character of Nancy was a big missed opportunity because so much could have been written for her character that wasn't written. 

...

A Wiser Heart. 

Yay for Mort, I love Mort, I wish he had shown up again in future episodes but oh well. 

I was wearing earbuds when I watched this so the part where Mort does bird calls at the table was a bit loud in my ears, still a funny scene though. Is he really making those bird calls though? He's very talented if he is. 

Laura doesn't bring up Harv Miller, she lied and told Laura and Almanzo that she married Harv Miller, we the audience know she lied but Laura and Almanzo don't know that, and yet Laura doesn't ask Eliza Jane where Harv is and the lie Eliza Jane told isn't discussed at all. 

I love the ending where Mort and the Professor are going back and forth and the Professor asks Mort if he wants to step outside and fight and Mort replies, ""Not really, but I will."" I love that bit and I love that Mort punches that Professor. 

Am I the only one who thinks Mrs. Pierce looks like she could be Miss Peel's younger sister? Got the same bitchy attitude too. 

...

Dark Sage. 

It's so funny that Mrs. Oleson thought Dr. Ledoux was French. 

As soon as I saw Dr. Ledoux I thought that Mr. Larrabee would come back on with his same racism but I was glad to see that Mr. Larrabee didn't show up. 

It was interesting to me to see Doc Baker be the racist one here. 

I wish that Dr. Ledoux showed up in future episodes as I really liked his character but oh well, he just disappears. 

...

The Legend Of Black Jake. 

I honestly thought I dreamed this episode until it started playing, I was happily surprised to see it was an actual episode. 

The funniest and worst criminals ever. 

This episode is just plain funny, although a bit mean what Nels does to Harriet with pretending to be a ghost but still funny. 

...

Wave Of The Future. 

Another funny as hell episode. 

Mrs. Sullivan's the first chain restaurant. 

I agree with Mrs. Oleson, that green is awful looking. 

I wonder what Gordon Ramsey would say about Mrs. Sullivan's. 

It's a bit ridiculous though, as one restaurant wouldn't survive in a town as small as Walnut Grove, nevermind two when Nels and Charles  open the competing restaurant. 

Still a funny episode though and I love seeing Col. Sanders at the end, I prefer Popeyes chicken though. Now I have a craving for fried chicken. 

...

A Christmas They Never Forgot. 

This is my favorite Christmas episode out of all the other Christmas episodes. 

I enjoyed hearing everyone's stories that they shared. 

Hester Sue's story made me cry along with Caroline's story. 

...

The Legacy. 

This episode was cool with the modern opening.

I don't buy antiques (can't afford them) but I like looking at them, and wondering who owned them.

Whenever I see an antique, it always gets my imagination going wondering who owned them, who were the people that made or used it, did they think that what they made would survive for so long, and many questions like that. 

This episode was really neat to me and made me wonder what kind of legacy I will leave behind. I don't know who will remember me or know I was ever here, but I hope to leave behind something that says that I existed. I don't know what that would be but I will think of something.

...

Times Are Changing Part 1 & 2. 

Why the hell was it written that the Ingalls move out of their home? Surely the writers knew that the Ingalls moving out and having a different family live in that house would be a death sentence for the show? 

I'm against that idea, I think a lot of things including bad writing killed this show but the Ingalls moving out of their home, that I think was the number one thing that killed the show. 

That's not the Carter's home, I don't care how nice they are, not their house. 

Almanzo's brother Royal is back but this time his wife is dead and he has a little girl instead of two little boys. 

I recognized Nicholas Pryor who played Royal in this episode. 

He was Jim in the movie Airplane, he never did have a second cup of coffee at home. 

He was Major Burnham in an episode of Mash. 

He was in a ton of other things too so it was cool to see him on this show. 

Shannen Doherty plays Jenny, cool to see her too. 

The second episode got very dark very quickly with Jenny wanting to off herself, sheesh. 

...

Welcome To Olesonville. 

This episode is a bit like in the movie It's A Wonderful Life where George Bailey sees what the world would be like without him and sees that Bedford Falls has been changed to Pottersville. 

What's with rich people and having everything named after them? 

The same damn house shows up again, now it's Lars Hansen's old house. It's a beautiful house though so it's no wonder they used it so much. 

So many characters in this episode that were never seen before and never seen again, the side characters are always more interesting then the main characters. 

...

The Return Of Nellie.

What's with the wig? There have been many horrible wigs on this show but the one Alison Arngrim is wearing in this episode has to be the worst wig ever. 

It's a shame Percival wasn't in this episode too, oh well. 

I can't blame Nancy for running away and this an episode where we could have had more interesting writing for Nancy but never got. 

Nancy is a replacement for Nellie and she knows that, being constantly compared to someone else has to hurt her feelings but we only touch on that a little and that's it.

I actually feel bad for Nancy in this episode as Nellie is back and Nancy is getting neglected a lot, she isn't shown as much attention as before. 

Sadly enough this episode ends with Nancy being the same horrible person as before and with the same bland ""everyone hates me"" character. 

...

Marvin's Garden. 

The only reason this episode works is because Ralph Ballamy made it work. If it weren't for him, I don't think this episode would have worked at all. 

This episode is a bit slow and nothing special, the only good parts are the scenes with Ralph Ballamy. 

The episode really doesn't make sense though as we are to believe that this doctor has been in Walnut Grove all this time, even though we haven't seen him until now. 

...

Once Upon A Time. 

It was cool to see Matthew Perry's dad, John Bennet Perry in this episode. 

I like how it was written of how Laura got the idea of writing and publishing her stories that we all now know so well. I seriously need to read those, all I have read is Little House In The Big Woods, I need to read the other books. 

...

Hello And Goodbye. 

I love Mr. Montague, his character is awesome and so entertaining. I only wish the show had gone on for longer so we could see him more. 

I would have loved a spinoff series of Mr. Montague, but oh well that didn't happen. 

About time that Willie graduated and got married, took him long enough. 

When Nancy said she wanted to read her essay at Willie's graduation, entitled, ""why Jesus loves me more then most"" I laughed at that, thought that was funny. 

That boarding house is beautiful though. 

...

The Last Farewell. 

I had never seen this episode before now. Growing up, I wasn't allowed to see this episode. 

I knew what would happen in this episode, I had just never seen it before. 

I cried like a baby watching everything get blown up, I'm still emotional. 

They should have done everything and anything they could so Katherine McGregor could be in this episode, oh well. 

Other characters that I think should have been in this episode were Adam and Mary, Hester Sue, Joe Kagan, Nellie and Percival, and Andrew and Jonathan Garvey. 

I barely knew a lot of the townspeople as the camera panned everyone. 

...

So, that's it now, I'm done rewatching the show. Such a good show. 

There are many episodes that I will be watching all over again and again. ",2,1757704150.0,littlehouseonprairie,0,1.0,False

Not warm to me, but warm to everyone else","It a frustrating middle ground - she’s doing her job as a mentor answering legal questions and sharing legal knowledge but withholding the personal warmth and connection that would make the relationship supportive. YET, she’s warm to everybody else, even junior-mentees who are not  assigned to her.  I’m  receiving the bare minimum of what’s required of her while watching her be genuinely friendly with everyone else.

This kind of professional-but-cold dynamic is harder than outright hostility because I can’t really point to anything she’s doing “wrong.” She’s meeting her work obligations, answering my questions, giving me the information that I need - but she’s doing it without any of the personal investment or friendliness that makes mentoring relationships actually work well.  

She goes on coffee runs with juniors who are not assigned to her.  
It leaves me in this weird limbo where I can’t complain because technically she’s doing her job, but I’m also not getting the kind of mentoring experience that helps me feel welcomed and integrated into the team. The professional politeness almost feels worse because it’s so obviously deliberate - she’s capable of warmth, she just chooses not to extend it to me.

Now I’m constantly analyzing my every interaction over the past year.  It’s giving me anxiety and I dread coming into work.  

Has anyone encountered this mentorship before? How do you deal with this “professional but cold” mentorship. Btw, she volunteered to be a mentor and my resume was given to her randomly",3,1757704044.0,biglaw,5,0.64,False

As linked - my previous post mentions that I was using 18g as recommended for a double shot. It turns out there was too much of an air gap between my portafilter and shower screen. I ended up upping my dosage and now I'm able to get into espresso range and I finally can enjoy a shot of espresso!!

I also realized, through the help of comments, that the beans I have are VERY tricky to get right. Looking forward to moving back into darker roasted beans to keep it simple.

I’ve never had a Nespresso machine before. The only other coffee machine I’ve owned was a Dolce Gusto with third party pods, so this is a bit of a learning curve for me!

I’ve read the handbooks and everything the machine comes with & downloaded the app, but I’m still struggling to understand how it works (ie which coffee is what, sizes, how to make them with milk, etc). I guess I’m basically just looking for some beginner “hacks” or whatever that might make this seemingly large coffee pod world a little easier to understand. Thanks!

Ran into the person I loved so deeply in college, who I never thought I’d see again","Yesterday was one of those days that felt like the universe was nudging me. I’d been crying on and off all morning. Tears coming and going when I least expected them. Emotional for no clear reason. People I knew at work kept asking me if I was okay. I simply brushed it off, as I’ve been exhausted and busy from work as of recent. It felt easier to say. But deep down I knew it wasn’t. I kept searching for something to blame these strange feelings on. There had to be some explanation as to why I felt so raw, so cracked open. It felt like intuition, almost like I predicted the moment without knowing it.

And then I saw him in a coffee shop. The guy I dated back in college that I was deeply in love with. It wasn’t for long, but he changed me in ways I can never forget.

When we met, I was in a dark place and lost, though he never knew it. It was like he saw me, he sensed all the things I lacked and without realizing it, made them better. He pulled me out of my shell, taught me things, and made me want to be a better person.  He was a turning point in my story. He inspired me.

I never thought I’d see him again. That chapter has always felt sealed shut. It took me some time, but I was content to have finally come to terms with that. But suddenly, there he was, in front of me after all these years. Proof that he exists outside of my memories.

My heart pounded out of my chest. Not because I still love him. It wasn’t butterflies. It was the weight of everything I’d built up in my head over the years. He didn’t know it but used to speak to him all the time. All the imaginary conversations where I’d tell him what he meant to me or ask him why he didn’t love me. And yet when it happened, I said nothing. I just walked away.

And strangely, that felt okay. Maybe our paths crossed again only to pass. Maybe I didn’t need closure after all. Just seeing that he was still real, present, alive in this world, not just someone I made up.

He was the spark that changed my life’s direction. The truth is, if I’d never met him back then, I think I’d still be that scared little girl. But I’m not.

It wasn’t romantic. It wasn’t about wanting anything from him. It was surreal. It was nostalgic. And it left me with a quiet sense of peace, knowing that part of my past is still out there, even if I’ve moved on.",1,1757703904.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

My department is very small, and everyone else has been here for years. They’re all really close and hang out outside of work, so it feels like I’ve walked into a group of old friends where I don’t really belong.

I know it’s not always smart to get too close to coworkers since personal information can sometimes be used against you, but honestly, I’m feeling really lonely. I want to build relationships that feel genuine, not just for the sake of having someone to talk to, but because I care about growing in my career. Eventually, I’d like to move into another department, and I know that without building some kind of network, I might miss those opportunities entirely.

One of the hardest parts has been lunch. The team always goes out together, but they never invite me. I’ve asked a few times if I could join, and they always say yes, but when I sit with them, I feel invisible. They don’t include me in conversations or ask me any questions. I try to engage by asking them things and showing interest, but they usually give short answers that end the conversation. After a while, I stopped going because it felt worse to sit there and be ignored than it did to eat alone.

I’ve tried other ways to connect, like offering to grab coffee for people when I go on breaks or starting casual conversations during downtime, but those attempts also tend to fall flat. I know I shouldn’t care too much about what they think, but it’s hard. This is my first real job, and I want to build a strong foundation. I feel like being in an entry-level admin role makes me easy to overlook, even though I know I have a lot of potential. It’s hard watching new hires in upper management be instantly welcomed and pulled into the group while I’m barely acknowledged.

I’ve been trying to take initiative in small ways. I ask about people’s roles, express interest in learning, and have even reached out to see if anyone is open to a quick coffee chat so I can understand more about the company. Most of the time, I get told people are too busy, and then I see them socializing with each other anyway.

I know I’m still very new and that building real connections takes time. I don’t expect to be part of the inner circle right away. But I’m struggling with how to approach this in a way that feels genuine and intentional. I want to position myself with smart career moves, but I don’t know how or what small steps to take next. I feel awkward a lot of the time, and I’m scared that if I don’t figure this out soon, I’ll miss the window to grow and be seen.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you build real connections without forcing it or coming off as desperate? And how did you take early steps to grow your career when you didn’t feel supported or included?",1,1757703839.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

* **Babb's Coffee House:** Babb's always hits the spot with great coffee and delicious cake. Beyond the treats, they have a really cool, laid-back atmosphere that's perfect for settling in with a notebook or laptop.

I (25F) have always been incredibly close to my younger sister (24F) — let’s call her *Amber*. Growing up, we were practically inseparable. We weren’t twins, but we might as well have been. We shared everything — laughs, fights, secrets. She was the person who knew me best.

But over the last three years, something’s shifted. I didn’t fully realise how strained things had become until today, after a major fight. I’m still in shock. She told me she no longer wants a relationship with me — and I just can’t wrap my head around it.

Some background: We also have an older sister (29F), who we weren’t especially close to growing up. She was more independent — had boyfriends early on, moved out at 21, married at 22. Funny enough, I’m much closer to her now than I’ve ever been, probably because I’m in a similar stage of life.

Amber went off to university in September 2022, five hours away from home. Around the same time, I started a serious relationship with my partner (M24) — let’s call him *Connor*. We’ve now been together for three years and are planning to get engaged soon. Life moved forward. Naturally, the bond Amber and I had as kids began to shift. We weren’t in the same house anymore, living totally different lives. I thought this was just the natural evolution of things — from sisters to more of a friendship.

Last year, I moved out of home too. My priorities changed. Connor is my chosen family now, and that’s who I focus on. Meanwhile, Amber has moved back in with our parents. She’s currently job hunting and has more free time than I do.

# The Fight That Broke Everything

The most recent argument started over something that seemed small. Our parents were away, and I didn’t message her during that time. I thought we were fine — here’s how the conversation went:

* **Me:** ""I almost burnt my house down.""
* **Amber:** ""How?""
* **Me:** ""Put popcorn in the microwave.""
* **Amber:** ""Want to come over for tea?""
* **Me:** ""No thanks, I’m really tearful today — you don’t want to be around me.""
* **Amber:** ""No worries.""

That was it. No follow-up, no “Are you okay?” — but I’ll admit, I didn’t check in on her either. I assumed everything was okay and carried on with my day. It wasn’t until a week later, when I popped by the house, that I learned she was hurt that I hadn’t messaged her more while our parents were gone.

I was surprised — I work 12+ hour shifts in retail (I’ve recently been promoted to supervisor at a theme park — great, but exhausting). On my days off, I need time to rest and recover. I’m also undergoing medical testing for ongoing health issues, so emotionally and physically I’m already stretched thin.

When she brought it up, I said, “The phone works both ways,” which wasn’t the most empathetic thing I could have said — I know that. But I felt frustrated and misunderstood. Since then, I’ve tried to stay civil and reach out here and there, but the distance between us only grew. Then today, we had a blowout fight… and she said she no longer wants a relationship with me.

# The Bigger Issue: Grudges & “Keeping Score”

Part of the fight today included her bringing up things from the past — especially a holiday to Spain she gifted me **three years ago**.

To be clear: I never asked for that holiday. It was a gift, given when she was in a full-time job and had the money to do something big. At the time, I was incredibly grateful, and I still am. But now, every time we argue, it gets thrown back in my face — that I’ve never done anything like that for her in return.

She’s not wrong — I haven’t taken her on a holiday. But I’ve tried to show appreciation in the ways I can: I’ve paid for meals, driven her places, picked up coffees, and made small gestures when I could. I’ve also sent her ideas for trips or concerts we could do together — but my expectation was always that we’d both chip in.

To be honest, part of why I never pushed hard for us to go to concerts together is because, when we were younger, she *hated* concerts and made it clear she didn’t enjoy them. I still remember her reluctantly coming to see The Vamps with me — and even that felt like a compromise on her part. So I’ve always kept that in the back of my mind.

I’ll admit this too: I’ve spent money on holidays with my partner. We went to Disney in the US and have a second holiday coming up. That’s where my financial priorities are — Connor is the person I’ve chosen to build my life with, and I want to make memories with him. I don’t think I’m a bad sister for that, but maybe it makes me a different one than I used to be.

Also… I just don’t have the cash spare to be giving big gifts like that right now. I’ve moved out, I pay my own bills, I’m working full-time — the reality is, even if I wanted to match what she gave me, I couldn’t afford it. And honestly, I don’t believe in giving to receive. If you give a gift, it shouldn’t come with long-term strings attached.

# Am I the A**hole?

I don’t know. Maybe I’ve been selfish. Maybe I haven’t been as present as I should’ve been. But I feel like I’ve tried — in my own way, and with what I’ve had to give.

I guess I just don’t know where to go from here. Amber says she’s done with me, and I don’t know whether to fight for the relationship or respect her decision and grieve it.

Has anyone been through something like this with a sibling?  
Is it possible to rebuild, even after something like this?  
And… am I the asshole for never taking her on a holiday?

  
Thank you Charlotte, I love your videos. Congratulations on yours and Mikes wedding day!!

1nfbh1r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfbh1r,"Why We’re Selling Our Hidden Gem Oasis With Indoor/Outdoor Flow, Creative Studio and Central Access to the Best of Los Angeles","Everyone who visits us says the same thing: “This place feels bigger, calmer, and more private than I expected. How did you even find it?” That’s the magic of this house — a hidden pocket where LA feels less chaotic, yet you’re still central to everything.

Eight years ago, I was searching in Culver City, Beverlywood, and Picfair Village, but prices were sky-high and the competition was brutal. Expanding my search just a little led me to [1820 Alsace Ave, Los Angeles CA, 90019](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1820-Alsace-Ave-Los-Angeles-CA-90019/20599346_zpid/) — and the search ended here. At the time it was a nearly finished flip, and I could clearly see the potential to craft it into the oasis it’s become.

Now, my wife has been offered a great opportunity in Nashville, and since I’m fortunate to be in a work-from-anywhere role, we’ve made the bittersweet decision to pass this home on to its next chapter.

We poured ourselves into this house. As a creative director/engineer/handy person, with an eye for design, I finally brought it to “turn-key” status and a home that feels like a private boutique retreat.

* ☀️ **Mornings**: coffee or journaling under the shade sail on the backyard deck, with squirrels darting through the olive tree and birds playing in its branches.

* 🔥 **Evenings**: BBQs with friends in the backyard, or cozy gatherings flowing from kitchen to dining to living room with the ethanol fireplace.

* 🎙️ **Workdays & weekends**: the converted garage studio — insulated, with split HVAC and natural light. With the custom glass doors open, it becomes a bright, airy extension of the house. Perfect for creative projects, podcasting, or just a relaxed game night with friends.

You enter the property via a tree-lined street tucked away from the hustle and bustle of busy vehicle traffic. The home itself is surrounded by custom fencing, privacy hedges, and mature trees for security and seclusion. Inside, three bedrooms and two full baths are thoughtfully separated, giving everyone their own space.



**And the location? Central without being landlocked.**

* 🚴 9-mile bike ride to the beach via Ballona Creek path

* 🛒 Easy bike or car rides to groceries, cafes, and endless restaurants

* 🎬 Minutes to Culver City, West Adams, Picfair Village, WeHo, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and Baldwin Hills hiking

* ✈️ 20 minutes to LAX when traffic is flowing

* 🚉 Just over a mile to two Metro stations, giving you stress-free access across LA. Whether it’s DTLA, USC, Santa Monica Pier — or major events like the World Cup, Super Bowl, and 2028 Olympics ceremonies — you’re connected without the parking headaches.



**Nearby employers are a bike ride away** if that’s how you roll, including Amazon MGM Studios, Apple, Warner Bros Discovery/HBO Max, FX Networks, TikTok, Netflix, Cedars-Sinai, and Kaiser. Local favorites like Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Erewhon, and The Platform are all close by.

This has been our oasis, and now we’re ready to pass it on to someone who will value both the care we’ve put in and the lifestyle it offers — while adding their own vision for its next chapter.

**The only “problem” you might have here? Friends and family lining up to stay over.**

* **“The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.”** – a Japanese proverb, meaning those who stand out or take risks are often criticized or punished.

When times get tough, or patience gets worn down; frustration begins to take over. That can lead to division, separation and unwarranted criticism. If anyone wants to target their frustrations out on anyone that posts on this Livimmune subreddit; go ahead and make yourself known here on this post and take it out on me. 

u/MGK_2 is not the person to take your frustrations out on. I am so grateful for reading MGK's posts. I can actually tell others who have a sick (cancer) family member who has not gotten any help from the current treatment therapies. Because of MGK's posts I can communicate to a non-LL-savvy people about the molecular process.   

In fact, I have learned a ton of information from this message boards as well as others. All kinds of information from these message boards has allowed me to broaden my understanding: Legal, Financial, Trading technicals, SEC, other peoples experiences. Some posts move me to tears and some have been entertaining, if I don't like a post, I generally just move on. 

Do I wake up everyday and read everything, no! I try to have a balanced life but I do not judge those that are obsessed with CYDY. It is my choice to get frustrated, it is my choice to feel elated, it is ALWAYS my choice on how I feel about what somebody says or does. 

All I have ever done here is try to share my past experiences with the FAMILY of LONGS that are on this board and other boards. And YES, sometimes that involves speculating on the when something might happen. I read the SEC filings and report my interpretation, plus share my experiences with what my past companies would have or would not have done. 

In the simplest of terms: my predictions of timing have ALWAYS been wrong but the directionality seems to be intact. Meaning the next most logical move CYDY could make is a Partnership. The when has been the challenge. 

I feel fortunate to be a shareholder; full transparency: I have spent $581,643.63 of my money on 668,106 shares for a rough average of .87

I am not going anywhere and I will from time to time share my opinion. Feel free to disagree or agree with it. 

**Final thoughts for today on the current state of affairs that is CYDY:**

About 1.5 years ago I was calling on CYDY to present at one of these Healthcare Investor conferences. JP Morgan being one of them. Even though these are invite only conferences, there are ways to get invited....

CYDY made the right conventional move to attend this HCW conference and begin to help expand the exposure of CYDY to a broader audience of investors. Leadership might be tight lipped, but this is a Great first step in exposing LL and the work the CytoDyn team is focused on. Plus, they have to balance what they say without making claims, and breaking NDAs, and violating SEC rules. Claims is the FDA jurisdiction: Hoffman can't claim we CURE cancer. 

The HCW conference was the correct step forward, IMO. It could be the beginning of a more sustained effort to get information out to more investors. We will see.

I am more of the ""show me the money"" person as it relates to this investment. I don't really care how or who but CYDY has been talking about future trials not covered by a ""High Net Worth Investor"" and those activities cost money. The S3 is active for 3 years and the only thing we really know is what is written in the SEC filings. As I have pointed out before, the spend is $1.5M per month and that means to me according to my math that Q1 2026 is when we run out of cash. Dr. JL did not show any signs of urgency or concern regarding this, Hoffman showed no signs of urgency or concerns at HCW (replay). CYDY has not ask shareholders to authorize more shares (which would take a minimum of 90 days before the vote would occur). 

Based on the above your DAMN RIGHT I AM GOING TO SPECULATE THAT SOME TYPE OF MATERIAL EVENT IS AROUND THE CORNER. I don't care if it's a HIGH NET WORTH individual or a BP partner, or CYDY played the Lotto and won. I don't care: just ""Show me the money""

If you do not like my prediction, just walk away or Call me out! NO biggie to me. I am out here sharing a point of view. I am not sitting on my couch and playing it safe, and when some person makes an informative post...then BAM I criticize it. What I have done when I think someone has made a mistake or I just disagree with their opinion is professional acknowledge their efforts, and politely share another point of view. 

I have been a shareholder for almost 5 years and I respect people's opinions if they have been here for 10 minutes or 10 + years. 

After the HCW conference and there was no announcement I was disappointed because I am expecting a significant Material announcement any day now. Maybe it will happen Q1 2026, maybe sooner, but I am on the any day now path of expectations. Yes, I am setting myself up for disappointment, but I know how to handle disappointment. So I had some fellow CYDY investors text me after the HCW ""no"" announcement conference and my reply was this:

***I was disappointed that the big pharma partnership news I was expecting didn't happen. My fault for raising my expectations. But, as usual the Sun came up and I am enjoying another great morning with my wife and a cup of coffee! I remain confident that a material event will happen before the end of 2025: because it has to!***

Have a GREAT weekend LONGS and **“The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.”** – a Japanese proverb, meaning those who stand out or take risks are often criticized or punished.

I'll continue to take risks!! and I hope and pray tha u/MGK_2 continues as well. There are too many great a posters to mention but lets all keep up the posts. ",17,1757702975.0,Livimmune,8,1.0,False

I'm a 30F, and finally now starting to really see my childhood for what it was, and not see people through the rose colored glasses my parents made me wear. Many of our relatives were toxic people, or used us and made my and my brother's life bad. For example

\-An aunt and uncle constantly took money from our parents, used it to travel the world, live a fine life while not working hard. Meanwhile my brother and I had to beg and plead for anything in childhood. I would be fine with a frugal childhood if indeed, my parents couldn't afford better-but to think we had to live that way while someone else took money is wrong. Now the aunt and uncle expect me to give them and their grown kids money because I'm a doctor, and I'm refusing, instead I prefer to cut them off

\-My mother's aunt and uncle, quite literally, took up all my parents' energy. They had their own adult kids, who (naturally) got tired of them. All this aunt and uncle could do was complain and demand. They'd forever come stay at our house, and demand ""we want XYZ for breakfast, this for lunch, that for dinner, and then to be taken out to this and that place in the evening"". Any vacation they'd tag along, and make huge demands. My parents made it their life mission to cater to these people like servants. But in the meantime, they didn't have time for their own kids (us). They'd be impatient with us and yell and scream at us. I remember on one vacation when I was 13, I got my period and whispered to my mom ""Do you have pain meds...if not that's fine I'm just asking"". She BLEW UP at me for daring to ask her anything ""Can't you see I'm busy googling where to take your aunt and uncle?!"" In my 20s, I had a horrible breakup, and my parents were exhausted from just getting off the phone with aunt after 3 hours. They saw me crying, and proceeded to scream and yell at me for needing their attention. I also remember aunt came stayed w/ us during my exams-she got mad I was in my room studying, complained to my mom, who proceeded to come in and scream at me. ...This same aunt came to my own wedding and proceeded to order me around like a maid on my own wedding day, to get her tea, coffee, bread , etc

So after all this, I'm cutting off that aunt and uncle. Countless such examples permeated my childhood. I feel these people robbed me and my brother of a proper childhood. Is it bad to be cutting them off? I get it, not sanskaari but how long can generational abuse go on?",6,1757702955.0,AskIndianWomen,6,1.0,False

If it helps, a friend is selling a lelit mara x and accessories for 800 all in which seems like a good deal for a starter.

However, I can change the outcomes. I talked to many men way past our “expiration” date.

Hey everyone!

I’m Ivan, originally from Bilbao (northern Spain), and I’ve been living in Hamburg for about two years now. I’m based in Ottensen (Altona) and usually pretty active with sports and calisthenics — but right now I’m dealing with a small ankle injury, so I need to take it a bit slower.

Since running, climbing, or long walks are off the table for now, I thought it might be the perfect moment to lean into a quieter hobby: board games or chess. I’ve always enjoyed the idea of sitting down, having a good conversation, and playing something strategic or fun. Ideally in English (my German is still in progress), but I’m happy with international vibes too.

Also a coffe would be nice to meet new people :) 

A bit about me:
	•	☕ Love coffee and slow mornings
	•	📚 Into philosophy, psychology, and deep conversations
	•	🎬 Appreciate cinema and art
	•	🍳 Like cooking when it’s not rushed
	•	🌿 Normally I’d be outside a lot, but now I’m more into chill hangouts

So if you’re into chess, board games, or just want to try something different than the usual bar/party scene, feel free to reach out. Would be cool to build a small group or just have one-on-one games.

Cheers, and hopefully see you across the board!

I'm sure somewhere on Reddit someone posted a similar story but a part of me just wants to vent; thank you for taking the time to read this and responding. I apologize if this turns out to be a long post. 

I'm in a relationship with a wonderful man, seven years strong. We are long distance, so dates are fluctuate from once a month, to once every couple of months. Our relationship is amazing: he's the man of my dreams and when the time feels right, we plan to get married. I feel bad that I'm even posting this/feeling a certain type of way, but sometimes these moments sting harder than others.

For some context, I'm a music teacher and assistant principal at my school. My boyfriend is a remote IT guy. His day starts at 9am and his company pays employees from 8:45am-9am to get coffee and wake up (yeah I know, he really lucked out and he absolutely earned/deserves this position). Aside from my duties at school, I work full time overnight to financially support my disabled brother and mom. At times, I get no sleep. If I'm lucky, I get four hours. This arrangement has been taxing on me as of late, and I will admit my communication has been venting/reminding my boyfriend of how exhausted I am. I realize this could contribute to my grievances regarding his communication.

When we first started dating, he would send me a cute good morning text right when he woke up and would follow-up with the most adorable brushing his teeth selfies. My love language is the little things like that, I still get butterflies when he sends a smirk and a goofy caption on Snapchat. I really, truly miss that. The past year-ish, he stopped doing that altogether. What prompted me to post this at all, was that he texted me close to 11am today, rather than his usual time (within the 9 o clock hour).

Before you jump to the keyboard, I left something out: 99.9% of his shift, he is either playing video games or on social media. His boss handles the one issue a day that happens at work (trust me, he brags about this every Monday to Friday). I had texted him ""what do you want?"" in response to his usual ""baby :)."" I have yet to check my texts. 

I'm already feeling regret about giving him an attitude for texting me ""late."" I plan to apologize after posting this. We have had this discussion before and he brushes it off by saying ""you also don't text me at work for a bit."" I would definitely be more attentive if I wasn't constantly with kids, supervising staff, and tending to situations throughout the day. And operating on little to no sleep.

1nfb68l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1nfb68l/evaluate_the_best_countertop_microwave_panasonic/,Evaluate the Best Countertop Microwave Panasonic NN-CD87KS Worth It,"Testing the Panasonic NN-CD87KS was an exciting venture into modern kitchen technology. This 4-in-1 marvel boasts a combination microwave, air fryer, convection oven, and broiler, promising to be the powerhouse your kitchen never knew it needed. Hearing about its versatility and capabilities, I couldn't wait to see how it stacked up in daily use. As someone who likes to juggle weekly meal prep, indulgent weekend desserts, and the occasional midnight snack, this compact appliance seemed like it could simplify my life.

**Design That Fits and Impresses**

This compact appliance carries a sleek stainless steel finish that looks right at home in any modern kitchen. Despite its relatively small footprint, the Panasonic NN-CD87KS makes efficient use of its dimensions. The 1.2 cubic foot capacity easily accommodated everything from a whole chicken to baking trays for cookies, while the 14.2-inch turntable ensured even heating and complete coverage. With its multifunctional build, it saved me counter space by eliminating the need for separate appliances. I particularly liked that it could be installed as a built-in unit with an optional trim kit—finally, something that melds function with style.

**Ease of Use and Features**

Testing the various modes, I found this product to be as user-friendly as it is multifunctional. The Genius Sensor was a game-changer for someone who habitually guesses microwave times. Whether defrosting chicken or reheating my coffee (again), the smart adjustments ensured perfect temperature control every time. Its 20 automatic cook menu presets ranged from quick popcorn to more elaborate items, which my partner loved experimenting with. The FlashXpress Broiler reinvigorated my love for toasty snacks, producing golden sandwiches in no time.

**Check [Panasonic NN-CD87KS price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b085sv35mt/)**

**Merits**

- Exceptional versatility with 4-in-1 functionality
- Smart microwave technology ensures even results
- Compact yet spacious with a thoughtfully designed turntable
- Air fryer mode delivers crispy results without excess oil
- Can serve as a main or secondary oven

**Healthy Cooking at Its Best**

What really surprised me was the air fryer mode. I've tried standalone air fryers before, but this built-in functionality matched their performance, circulating hot air to crisp fries and chicken wings while using less oil. Results tasted indulgent but felt guilt-free. Meals like breaded fish fillets emerged with golden, crunchy exteriors and juicy insides, making weekday dinners smoother and healthier for the family.

**Handling Cooking Tasks with Precision**

Cooking is rarely perfect on the first try, yet the Panasonic NN-CD87KS came remarkably close. The convection bake mode even replaced my trusty traditional oven on multiple occasions. From moist banana bread to flawlessly roasted vegetables, I trusted this oven for recipes that required precision. I especially appreciated that preheating wasn’t always necessary for convection baking—less waiting meant quicker meals, which everyone appreciates on busy evenings.

**Drawbacks**

- Some settings, like convection baking, required extended trial and error
- Slightly noisier than expected while in operation
- Stainless steel exterior gets smudged easily
- Lacks a touchpad backlight for easier nighttime use

**Rival Brands**

Given its features, I compared this to options from Breville and Cuisinart—the popular heavyweights in multifunctional ovens. Breville’s Smart Oven offers similar functions, but its air fryer mode didn't seem as effective in achieving consistent crispiness. Meanwhile, Cuisinart’s TOA models are strong competitors but come with more limited microwave capabilities. Neither rival felt as cohesive for combining all features into one compact design, making the Panasonic NN-CD87KS unique in versatility and performance.

**Financial Value**

While this oven offers much more than traditional options, its price could initially feel steep for budget-conscious buyers. However, breaking it down by functionality—replacing a microwave, air fryer, and even an oven—it justified itself as a worthwhile investment.

Next week, im going to a startup convention week that will host a variety of different speakers from different startups, a lot of which are around tech and computer science. After all I've read on this sub and other subs related to CS, I've seen that the best way to break into this market is by networking and making meaningful connections with those already in industry.

This is my first time going out of my comfort zone and seeking out connections by networking. I wanted to know some tips that helped you make good connections with industry members.

Specifically, i want advice for the following:

1. What are some of your favorite conversation openers? Do you open with compliments or do you approach them with ""Hi, my name is blank, what's yours?""

2. Once in conversation, what point do you achieve to get to with the speaker? Do you invite them to coffee next week or do you ask for their linkedin/email and go from there?

3. How do you like to dress for these events? Have you found a difference in different types of outfits (more personable business casual or more serious business professional)?

All and any advices are very welcome. I look forward to hearing from all of you!",2,1757702408.0,cscareers,0,1.0,False

1nfb3ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1nfb3ot/roommates_are_leaving_trash_attracting_bugs_and/,"roommates are leaving trash, attracting bugs, and making messes (advice needed!!)","I have lived with my roommates for about two weeks now, but I've known them for much longer. I (20F) am in college and share a dorm with three other girls. I share a room with one of them (We'll call her Nicole 21F), and a kitchen and a living room with the other two suitemates (Amelia 21F and Taylor 22F). I don't share the bedroom with Taylor and Amelia. My roommate Nicole and I lived together last year in our own space, so we decided to do it again this year with two of our good friends as suitemates.

The four of us are good friends. and Taylor is my best friend. So, there's a lot to lose if things go wrong.

The problem is... things are going wrong.

Taylor has a habit of making a mess and leaving it everywhere. Crafts, food, trash, etc. I wouldn't mind if she kept it to her and Amelia's bedroom... but she doesn't. The living room is becoming consumed in messes. But she gets upset if someone calls her ""messy"".

She started a craft to occupy the entirety of one of the smaller side tables (that she hasn't touched in a while and has left there to take up space), left empty soda cans and dirty dishes on that table, and hasn't picked up anything. Then the coffee table. It's covered in her old plates (paper and plastic), more old soda cans, and wrappers of food trash that will be left untouched for a few days until it's finally tossed.

\- empty trash (wrappers, soda cans, etc)

\- dirty dishes that don't make it to the sink (and when they do eventually, they are never washed)

\- untouched crafts occupying space that could be used by others

\- sticky and crumb residue of food on surfaces

\- general messes

Amelia is better, but not by much.

Nicole and I have been struggling with this. We don't even go into the common space anymore since it feels so gross and messy. None of the stuff in their is ours. Not by choice.

Less than a week ago, Nicole and I brought the worsening situation to Taylor and Amelia. We found bugs thanks to the trash. It's genuinely disgusting. We handled it but we told Taylor and Amelia to ""be considerate of not leaving out food trash because it attracts bugs"".

But two days later? A bag from Chick-Fil-A full of only empty trash was left on the coffee table. Surprise, surprise, it's Taylor's.

Other trash started to join it. Amelia told Nicole and I that ""the trash doesn't bother her"". (Amelia is also a hoarder)

Three days passed and the Chick-Fil-A bag remained. And when Taylor's bf came over? She just moved it... to the floor.

I finally outright told her to throw it away yesterday. And then found it untouched after she'd said she would toss it.

A little bit about me is that I genuinely can't handle messes and trash in the shared space. I start to lose it. It makes me feel dirty. Crowded.

Last night, seeing that the bag still hadn't been touched, I gathered all of the trash she'd left and set it on the coffee table instead of scattered--hoping she'd see it. Maybe this was a tad passive aggressive of me. I was trying not to be, I'm trying not to lose my cool, but it's getting hard.

This morning, she set the bag on top of the trash can. Not in, but on.

When I'd left for class, and she and Amelia had thought Nicole wasn't still i n the dorm, Nicole heard them talking about me. She hadn't been trying to, but they were loudly complaining in the living room while she was in our room.

Taylor is apparently mad at me for telling her to throw away her trash because she's ""actively working on it"". Because ""we are college students and need to behave like it"". (like hello? says the one leaving trash out and being on her phone all the time?)

Amelia said she ""doesn't know what \[my\] problem is.""

I'm not mad they were talking about me. That's whatever. I get it. I'm mad they're being childish.

You may ask ""why don't you just throw it away for her?"". My fear is that then that will be the norm. The first time I cave will never be undone. And then i will always be the ""maid"".

I don't know what to do. I need advice. I need them to pick up their messes because it's bothering Nicole and I. I have been nice. I have respectfully asked them both to toss their trash. It's not working.

And worst of all? I've stopped seeing Taylor as my best friend. This isn't how friends treat each other.

But i also don't want a fight. I want to handle this like adults and still maintain the friendships. I care about these girls.

I really need desperate help.

  
tldr: My roommate and I are tired of my suitemates leaving trash in the shared common space. It's attracting bugs and pests. They have refused to accept any responsibility and have left messes of trash out for several days. They see no issue with it. I have been nice already. Now they're mad at me for speaking up. What do I do to keep a peace for me and for them? How do I maintain our friendships?

I’m a local musician and visual artist in my town and there’s a guy who’s been exhibiting behavior that is concerning me.

He first messaged me asking if he could come to one of my band’s shows and asked where it was, which I told him.

He’s significantly older than me or anyone else there and was pretty off putting but I’m autistic so I can be off putting too and I wanted to give him a chance.

Later he messaged my friend, who’s also an artist, to commission some art from them and asked them some questions abt me. I sell my wares in a local coffee shop and apparently he discovered my work that way. He told my friend my art had made him realize he’s autistic.

He told me later that my work had also made him realize he’s queer and that he was divorcing his wife, and complained abt his wife a little bit to me over Instagram messages. I did not respond. I don’t know how my lighthearted stickers, silly prints, and custom mirrors could make someone have intense realizations about their identity, honestly. Like I’m glad it’s having an impact, I guess, but I’m confused. 

So since he’s divorcing his wife he got a new apartment- he bought a painting from me and I offered to drop it off at his place…. His new apartment is three blocks from my home and less than a block from my work. 

He’s been to basically every show my bands have played this summer, and also showed up at a rave I attended. I don’t know how he would’ve known I’d be there, but he was easily the oldest person there and it is not the type of thing he would typically go to based on his personality.

I’ve been trying to be chill about it, especially bc he buys my art and I rly need money for medical expenses rn. I realize that’s probably foolish of me.

Last night a band dropped from a local show and one of my bands filled in last minute- this was not something well advertised. I only posted abt it on my personal account. But he showed up to it and stood around me all night.

Fwiw, he knows I’m engaged to my partner. He’s said stuff to me like “I hope I’m not making you and your friends uncomfortable by coming to events”. I didn’t respond to that either. I have people pleasing tendencies that I’m working on. 

I just don’t know if I’m overreacting, or if he’s showing early signs of stalking. And if so, what should I do about it?

I've been obsessing over making my outdoor space perfect for the fall season, and I wanted to share my experience with finding the best fall scented candles for patios. Trust me, I've gone through countless options, and I've finally figured out what works best.

First off, let's talk about why outdoor candles are different from your regular indoor ones. When you're burning candles outside, you need something with a stronger throw - otherwise, the scent just gets lost in the open air. I learned this the hard way after wasting money on regular candles that couldn't handle the outdoors.

I recently discovered some amazing fall scented candles that are perfect for outdoor use (you can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles). They're specifically designed with stronger fragrances and better wind resistance.

Here are the scents that work incredibly well outdoors:

1. Pumpkin Spice (obviously!) - But look for ones with cinnamon and nutmeg notes
2. Apple Cider - These give off an amazing autumn vibe
3. Woodsmoke - Perfect for that cozy campfire feeling
4. Autumn Leaves - More subtle but creates a beautiful atmosphere
5. Maple - Sweet but not overwhelming

Pro tip: Look for candles in thick glass containers - they're more wind-resistant and last longer outdoors. Also, three-wick candles tend to perform better outside because they create a stronger scent throw.

I've found that citronella-infused fall scented candles are amazing for outdoor spaces - they keep the bugs away while maintaining that cozy autumn atmosphere. If you're interested in seeing some great options, I found an awesome selection here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles

Some practical advice: Place your candles strategically. I usually put them on side tables or create small clusters on my patio coffee table. Also, consider using hurricane glasses or lanterns to protect the flames from wind.

For the best results, light your candles about 30 minutes before you plan to use your patio. This gives the scent time to develop and spread. And always remember to keep them away from anything flammable - falling leaves can be a hazard!

Storage is important too - keep your outdoor candles in a cool, dry place when not in use. The temperature changes can affect their performance, so don't leave them outside permanently.

I'd love to hear about your favorite fall scented candles for outdoor spaces! Share your experiences in the comments below.",1,1757701399.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

also my other struggle is that i take it pretty early i would say at 6:30am in the morning because i work full time and work starts at 7am until like 5pm, in the beginning i noticed the effect heavily until late in the evening but now that i assume my body is used to vyvanse it works barely until 5pm, as soon as im home after work i get tired and like my old unmedicated self. no real crash tho but i just notice that im not be able to productive anymore AT ALL. i cant find the motivation to cook anymore and nothing. i find it kind of sad because i obv dont only have adhd at work but also at home and now it seems like i only take vyvanse to be good at work and not for myself.

i dont have any other side effects at all, i have normal hunger, i sleep well, my emotions are regulated, ...

does anyone else has/had this? if yes did u get an extra dose prescribed from your doctor? does it then really work longer? i also have evening schools on monday nights so id definitely need longevity☹️

i live in europe (austria) and the only amphetamine available is vyvanse. so dex would be no option here. either maybe splitting doses throughout the day or another extra 10-20mg elvanse is possible. also important to mention, the lowest vyvanse mg here in austria is 30mg so i would have really open another capsule every day and dissolve some of it in water if i get an extra small dose which sounds annoying and expensive lol

An hour after sipping on the coffee creamer and eating the strawberry and peanut butter toast. I had the worst stomach ache of my life.

I kept belching for an hour in a half and was bent over on the floor with pain. It would come and go….

My mother came over to get me crackers and ginger ale. Hours later my stomach settled a little BUT it was never the same.

Went to my doctor in early August and he put me on ppis up until the end of September.

During that time I ate bland and was getting into the routine of eating the same stuff everyday.

By October I was off ppis and I was feeling better.

Up until April of this year when I got brave and drank iced coffee. That gave me a flare for two weeks….

Went to a happy hours and had a few drink with plenty of water and food.

Didn’t feel bad after that but a few weeks ago I had another flare afte",2,1757701093.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I thought the route was excellent, the STF huts system is outstanding, and the staff at them were so helpful. I was a bit faster than I thought, but I did stop to smell the Alpine Gentian!

All in \~425 km hiking with a few other summits and side quests off the trail itself. 11 days total, with 10 days hiking with one zero day at Kvikkjokk.

I absolutely fell in love with Sweden and the north and am thinking about doing the route again in winter with a pulk. Also seriously want to go back to Sarek.

It felt great to complete the trail, it's a truly beautiful route. The STF huts and staff were amazing. Now planning the Nordkalottleden / Arctic Trai!

Dates - 25/8/2025 to 5/9/2025

\--

**Day 1 - Abisko to Tjäktja - 37km.**

​I left Abisko at about 5:30 am to begin the trail. The route immediately led me through beautiful woodland as I departed Abisko, a serene, quiet, start before the landscape began to open up.

Following the trail south, the path gradually climbed towards Gárddenvárri, which I took a quick detour to summit - it offered expansive views of the denser trees behind and the open plateau and lakes ahead. I also stopped here to gather some of the biggest sweetest bilberries I've ever seen. They call them Blueberries here - but they are the same Vaccinium myrtillus I know and love. Really delicious!

Around here I had my first truly magical moment on the trail - a magnificent herd of reindeer, grazing peacefully by the lake. They broke and ran when they saw me but it was truly incredible to witness these iconic creatures in their natural habitat

The next section was stunning walk through the valley towards Alesjaure, with the trail hugging the lake for a long stretch. ​I stopped for lunch at the STF Alesjaure Mountain Cabin, a welcome break and a chance to rest my legs amidst the vast, open fells. Refreshed, fed and watered, I continued southwest trekking towards Miesákjávri.

From there, I pushed on towards the STF Tjäktja Mountain Cabin. I decided to camp about 1 km south of here just before the elevation started to gain again. I could see quite a bit of snow higher up and figured staying a bit lower was probably prudent.

\--

**Day 2 - Tjäktja to top of Durlings Led (with an attempted summit of Kebnekaise) - 39km.**

Day two got off to a frosty start. I was packed up and set off by 5:30 am and quickly made my way up and over the Tjäktja pass, the highest point on the official Kungsleden route. The views from the top were absolutely breathtaking, with a wild, rugged expanse of snow and jagged peaks stretching out in every direction.

After a long descent through the valley, I followed the trail towards Sálka, a scenic stretch of trekking through a dramatic, glacially-carved landscape. I stopped for a quick break and some lunch at the STF Sálka Mountain Cabin, a peaceful spot before the long afternoon push.

After leaving Sálka, I trekked south towards Singi, taking in the views of the massive glaciers and surrounding peaks, including the formidable Kebnekaise. I turned east onto Durlings Led, beginning the approach to what I hoped would be a summit of Sweden's highest peak. I made it to the top of Durlings Led before deciding to set up camp for the night.

Here I made a push to summit but unfortunately the weather was starting to turn, rain and flurries of snow. With steep elevation ahead up ice and snow, and a couple of hours of daylight left I decided to head back to camp and go again first thing in the morning.

\--

**Day 3 - Durlings Led to Kaitumjaure (via Kebnekaise) - 38km.**

Day 3 began with a frosty start from my camp on Durlings Led. The tent was iced over on the inside with the condensation frozen solid! The main goal for the day was to summit Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain, and then get back to the Kungsleden.

The climb was a moderately challenging scramble over large boulders and scree, especially with the fresh snow. My microspikes and poles were a lifesaver. I stopped for a coffee at the old emergency hut, soaking in the views before pushing on to the glacier section and eventually the summit.

The views from the top were simply breathtaking. I lingered for about 45 minutes, taking photos and even getting some drone footage before the cold set in.

The descent itself was fairly tough. I retraced my steps back to the saddle, but then followed an unmarked route down the waterfall to Šiellajohka and back to the main Kungsleden trail. It was a challenging, sketchy route, but the sense of accomplishment made it worthwhile.

Rejoining the main trail, I pushed south to Singi for a quick refuel, then on to Kaitumjaure. I set up camp near the beautiful lake and mountain hut. Truly an unforgettable day.

\--

**Day 4 - Kaitumjaure to Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin - 65km (32 km hiking / 2.5 km rowing / 29 km bus / 2km boat).**

​The day began with a beautiful hike from Kaitumjaure, leading to the rowing boats at Teusajaure. The rowing was a workout - I had to row across, bring a second boat back, and then row across again to complete the crossing and ensure a boat was left on each side. A true Kungsleden rite of passage!

​Once across, the hike to the STF Vakkotavare cabin was a pleasant one, it was great to watch the stoats snuffling around for their breakfast amongst the rocks along the way. Once at the road I was grateful to hop on the bus - almost everyone does this as it is 29 km with no siding. It was also a nice break for the legs, and great to chat with a few other hikers and locals. We even stopped at a little cafe for refreshments, which was a lovely surprise.

​A short boat ride took me to STF Saltoluokta, where I was incredibly lucky to bump into someone I knew who I'd met on Te Araroa in New Zealand and it was so lovely to catch up and swap information about the trail ahead. I also took the opportunity to recharge my phone and battery, which was super useful.

​Fully recharged with fresh legs, I took on the final 10 km of the day, with the evening light setting over the stunning landscape as I made my way to the Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin.

A really varied day on the trail - waiting for busses and boats slowed me down, but the beautiful scenery and the chance encounter with a friendly face made it all worth it.

\--

**Day 5 - Autsutjvagge to Aktse (via Skierffe) - 36 km (4 km by boat).**

​The day began with an early morning hike from the Autsutjvagge Rest Cabin to Sitojaure. Here, I took a beautiful 4 km boat trip across Gasskajávrre and Gåbddåjávrre, with a lovely Sami woman named Anna. Her and her family were just unbelievably kind, honest, and wholesome folk. It was such a pleasure to chat with her about nature and the landscape of Lapland.

​After crossing, the main event was the detour to summit Skierffe. The climb was actually fairly steep, but the panoramic view from the top was absolutely worth it. The famous view of the Rapaälven delta winding its way through the valley of Rapadalen was simply unforgettable - a majestic sight of a wild and untouched landscape. I lingered for perhaps too long, just soaking it all in, truth be told it was quite hard to leave - but the weather was rolling in and some bruising storm clouds threatened rain.

​From the summit I made my descent and continued the trek toward Aktse. As the day drew to a close, a beautiful red leaf along the path was a small reminder that autumn was beginning to paint the landscape. The tips of the birch trees have begun to turn a golden yellow, and there is a definite chill in the air.

I camped at the STF site at Aktse, ready to take the boat in the morning. I got my tent up just in time as the heavens opened. It rained really hard all night!

\--

**Day 6 - Aktse to Kvikkjokk - 40 km (3 km by boat).**

The morning started slowly from Aktse as I had to wait for the boat at 9 am. It had rained all night and started raining hard again as we waited. I met a couple of really nice guys (who both also had Atom Packs!) and it was great to chat with them; it really helped to take our minds off the weather.

The boat ride across the lake was short, but by the end I was shivering with the cold. I also felt rather queasy and desperately needed the toilet. I was so thankful when we finally docked and I could get off. I quickly made my way to the Mallenjarka emergency shelter for a break to make a hot drink and eat something.

After the rain had calmed down and I was feeling a bit better, I pushed on. The trail from here was long but relatively flat, a welcome change after the last few days. Lots of board walks through lush birch forest.

I ended up hiking with the two guys I'd met on the boat, Chris and Christian. The miles flew by as we yapped away, so much so that we went a little off-track towards the end and came down just east of the trail on the outskirts of Kvikkjokk!

When we finally made it, I decided to stay at the STF station. I had a shared room with a group of three really nice French guys going north and another really nice French guy going south - it was lovely to chat with them all about life, hiking, watches, AI, and everything in-between.

The station also had a cancellation, so I booked a private room to take a zero the next day. The offer of laundry, hot showers, and proper food was too much to pass up! It was a long day, especially with the tough start, but reaching Kvikkjokk was a great milestone to reach.

\--

**Day 7 - STF Kvikkjokk - 0 km**

​What a perfect zero day! The STF Kvikkjokk Mountain Station was an amazing place to rest and recharge. I was lucky to get a private room with a lovely view out over the river. The facilities are superb, and the opportunity to do laundry, take a long hot shower, and recharge my phone and battery was too good to pass up.

​I spent quite some time exploring the common areas. The library was particularly interesting, with a selection of old maps, books, and fascinating traditional gear on display. I also loved the beautiful posters showing all the different wildflowers you might see on the trail.

​The restaurant was also a major highlight. I had a delicious breakfast buffet; porridge, fresh fruit, homemade bread, and copious amounts of coffee. The real treat though was dinner. I had an incredible locally sourced reindeer thigh with lingonberry, followed by vanilla ice cream with warm cloudberries. It was a perfect change from dehydrated meals and energy bars. The views over the Kamajokk rapids and the mountains in Tarradalen were a fantastic backdrop to it all.

The staff too couldn't be more helpful, really genuinely lovely people who were so knowledgeable about the local geography, flora and fauna. The stay here really left me ​feeling fully rested and recharged.

\--

**Day 8 - Kvikkjokk to Tjäurakåtan hut - 51 km (3 km by boat).**

The day began with a stroll around the village of Kvikkjokk, admiring the traditional buildings and the beautiful wooden church before my 9 am boat ride.

My ride across the lake was with a lovely Sami woman named Helena. The other Sami woman I'd met earlier on the trail, Anna, had asked me to pass on her regards. When I said to Helena, ""Anna says hello"" her face lit up with a beautiful smile. She told me how Anna is such a lovely woman and never fails to ask travellers to pass on her regards. It was such a simple, beautiful thing.

Once on the other side of the lake, the trail felt very cruisey and the kilometers ticked off as I passed through the ever-changing landscape now painted in vibrant autumn colors. The wildlife changed too, with frogs, toads, and lizards joining the trailside foliage.

I hiked for some time with a lovely German guy who was also going SOBO, it was great to chat with him about computer science and AI as we stopped for lunch at the emergency shelter by the Tsielekjahka river.

After lunch I pushed on up and over the range and down towards the Piteälven lake and up the other side of the valley. As the sun began to set, the sky turned to a magnificent array of pink and purple as I reached the tiny, traditional Goahti/kåta Tjäurakåtan hut high on the plateau. Unfortunately, I found a fair bit of litter inside - dehydrated meal packets, wrappers, and other waste. I decided to pack it all into my bag to take to the next proper bin.

The fact that hikers would leave litter all the way up here in a traditional building really saddened me. It was such a contrast to the joy I'd felt in the morning relaying Anna's regards to Helena. People can be amazing...but it's rare and should be cherished when it is found. With the light failing and the Goahti all clean, I decided to stay in it for the night.

\--

**Day 9 - Tjäurakåtan hut (Pieljekaise summit) to Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin - 64km (7km by boat).**

I was up early from the goahti as I had 21 km to do to make the boat at Vuonatjviken for 9 am. There is only one crossing per day across lake Riebnes. Suffice to say I made it in time but only just, and I was the last one on board!

Once across I stopped to make breakfast and hot coffee on the Southern shore. The hike from here was through birch forest passing various lakes, it was really easy going and a nice change to some of the earlier forest sections that were a bit more technical. I took another break by the shore of lake Hávggajávrre and found an amazing Reindeer antler. I'd already picked one up a few days ago - but this one was perfect, so I left the one I'd been carrying and packed the new one out.

There was another short rowing section at lake Harrselet - again with only one boat - here I met a lovely French couple who were about to cross so I jumped in the boat with them. Very kindly they offered to row, and the guy even collected a second boat and rowed it back - such a good man!

Saying goodbye to them I headed down towards the mountain hamlet of Jäckvik, most people I'd talked to planned to take a zero here as the weather was meant to be awful the next day. There is a large ICA supermarket here so I took the opportunity to resupply a few bits and to recharge my phone.

Leaving Jäckvik the route climbed steadily to the Allmän Rest Cabin, it was raining quite hard by this point so I popped inside to take a break. It was beautiful inside and immaculately clean. As the rain eased I pushed on taking a detour to summit Pieljekaise. This was a bit foolish as it was a mud bath, and by the time I reached the top the rain really began to hammer down again.

Quickly descending I followed the trail down to the Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin. By the time I reached it I was drenched. I decided to stay here and bedded down with a nice German guy from Berlin heading north.

\--

**Day 10 - Pieljekaisestugan Rest Cabin to Juovatvaretje Rest cabin - 101km.**

I was up super early from Pieljekaisestugan setting out a little before 4 am. I had a plan to finish the trail today as it was almost exactly 100 mi to the end. Obviously completing 100 mi in 24h is a huge test both physically and mentally - but it's something I've done before - and I knew if I felt good at this point it was something I wanted to go for.

The first section was super easy going down into Adolfsström with a large section of it on a dirt road. Here there was a tiny cafe - which was closed - but the owner's mother was about and offered me some fresh from the oven croissants, which I wolfed down. The shop/cafe was awesome and I would have loved to stay longer but had to push on.

The next section was to Ammarnäs about 59 km. The route up the mountain was very gradual, I didn't really feel the incline but on the tops the weather turned again, raining quite hard with a fair headwind and a thick mist. With very low visibility I dropped down early at Gieråjvvie into Norra Ammarnäs.

At Ammarnäs I grabbed some snacks from the shop and then headed out across the river and up the valley side. There was a huge white reindeer on the path here that ran with me for about a km, best pacer in the world!

At the top I took a break at the STF cabin at Ruovdatjjávrátje for some hot tea and a change of socks. Leaving the cabin the weather really doubled down - high wind and rain, strong enough to buffet me about. As I reached Lill-Aigert the fog was so thick I couldn't see the markers, and I realised that going much further in these conditions was a bit silly.

A little disheartened I made a final push for the rest cabin on the Southern flank of Stuor-Ájgart and called it a day. In the end I did a smidge over 101 km in 17.5 hours averaging \~5.8 kmph - so not too shabby at all.

There was a lovely Sami woman at the hut as well as a nice Aussie bloke. They were settled in when I arrived so I just got my head down on the cabin floor ready to finish tomorrow. Gutted I didn't make the 100 miles but hey ho.

\--

**Day 11 - Juovatvaretje Rest cabin to Hemavan - 39km.**

The final day started with a glorious sunrise as I left the hut at about 5:30 am. Thankfully, the wind, rain, and fog from the previous evening had fully cleared. I made my way steadily down towards lake Servvejávrrie to a huge cloud inversion, with the distant mountains painted pink with the morning light.

The route from the lake was really easy-going, and before long, I reached STF Tärnasjö where I stopped for an early lunch and to soak my feet. From here, the trail followed the eastern shore of Lake Tärnasjön, and it was beautiful to watch the dragonflies darting about the shoreline. I had to be quite careful as they liked to sun themselves on the boardwalks, and I really didn't want to step on them.

Towards the southern end of the lake, I took the 5 bridges across to the western side and carried on down between Sjul-Olsaxeln and Vuekienaesie into the steep-sided valley. I stopped to take a break and make a hot drink at the Syterskal Rastskydd before carrying on down the valley.

As I reached the STF Viterskalet Mountain Lodge I popped in to grab some chocolate and use the long drop. The couple staffing it were absolutely lovely giving me homemade lemonade and even filling my softflask with it before I headed off! This is the last, or first for NOBOs, STF hut on the trail.

The final 10km was also a steady downhill stretch past the ski lifts down to Hemavan. By this stage my legs were tired but the thought of finishing put a spring in my step. In the end I finished a little before 8pm, but decided to head back up the hill to camp in the woods that evening as I figured it was a bit late to head to the STF Hemavan Mountain station itself.

\--

**Gear Notes**

In general my gear is pretty ""dialed in"" so I was happy with it all. The two pieces I was less sure about were the tent - first trail for it - but it performed superbly (I usually use the Duplex 2 person version if hiking with my partner - and a tarp/bivy bag if going solo). I took the Solo plex as I wanted a space I could eat in and do admin without worrying about insects. In this regards it was excellent - as there were quite a few mosquitoes on the southern sections in the woods beyond Kvikkjokk.

The only ""gear failure"" was the Katadyn BeFree water filter - again first time use (I usually use a Sawyer squeeze with a Cnoc bag). The Katadyn has a ""sports cap"" that broke on day 4 - meaning I couldn't actually carry water in it. I have stretchy side pockets on my pack - and the flask part is soft - so when I tried to push it into my bag the water would squirt out. I managed to resolve this in Kvikkjokk buy buying a drink with the same sized cap and using that - it was annoying but not terrible. I just had to ""camel up"" for a couple of days.",12,1757700933.0,Ultralight,8,0.88,False

1nfajnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Background-Raise6389/comments/1nfajnz/the_best_coffee_makers/,The Best Coffee Makers,"Making coffee at home can feel like a never-ending rabbit hole. I’ve messed around with everything from moka pots to pour-overs to cold brew jars in the fridge, and while they all have their charm, some mornings I just don’t want to measure or babysit a kettle. That’s where drip coffee makers shine. They give you that balance of solid flavor and no-nonsense convenience, which is huge if you’re like me and need coffee before your brain really turns on.

I think of drip brewers as the reliable middle ground. You don’t need the technique of a pour-over or the commitment of an espresso machine, but you still get coffee that tastes way better than cheap single-serve stuff. Depending on what you’re after, whether that’s programmability, speed, or just something sturdy you don’t have to think about, there are some great options out there. Here are a few I’ve tried or had in my rotation.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [OXO Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#oxo-brew-9-cup)

This one was my “set it and forget it” machine for a while. I loved being able to set the timer so I’d walk into the kitchen and smell coffee already brewing. The thermal carafe really does keep it hot for hours, which is perfect on days when I was working from home and sipping all morning. It’s a tall unit, so I had to shuffle it around to fit under cabinets, but that’s more of a space issue than a design flaw.

The coffee it makes is consistently solid. Not as nuanced as a high-end Moccamaster, but plenty flavorful, especially if you don’t want to mess with manual methods. The interface took me a few tries to figure out, and cleaning the lid requires more attention than I’d like, but overall I found it reliable and practical. It’s basically the coffee maker I’d recommend to anyone who wants good coffee without fussing around too much.

## 💎 Best Upgrade Option: [Technivorm Moccamaster KB](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#technivorm-moccamaster-kb)

When I finally tried a Moccamaster, I got why people rave about it. The design feels timeless, and it looks great on the counter. Brewing is quick, about seven minutes for a full pot, and the flavor was definitely a step up compared to more affordable drip machines. It’s also nice that the hot plate keeps coffee warm for hours without that burnt taste I’ve gotten from cheaper machines.

The trade-off is that it doesn’t have a timer or alerts, which I kind of missed after using programmable brewers. Also, the price is definitely higher than what I’d normally want to spend on a drip machine. Still, the consistency was unbeatable, and the five-year warranty gave me peace of mind. If you want to splurge on a coffee maker you’ll probably use for a decade, this one makes sense.

## 💸 Best Budget Coffee Maker: [Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker CE251](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#ninja-ce251)

This one was my go-to when I didn’t want to spend much but still wanted something dependable. It makes a big pot, which was great for when I had roommates or family visiting, and it brews hotter coffee than a lot of other budget options I’ve tried. I liked being able to pick between a classic brew or a stronger setting depending on the beans.

It’s not the fastest, about 13 minutes for a full pot, but it’s steady. The water reservoir being removable made life easier since I didn’t have to awkwardly pour from the carafe to refill it. The only thing I didn’t love was the screw-on lid for the carafe, which felt clunky when I was half asleep in the morning. But for under \$100, it’s tough to beat if you just want straightforward drip coffee without investing in something fancy.

## ☕ Best French Press: [Espro P3 French Press](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#espro-p3)

I’ve always liked French press coffee, but I hated the grit that usually comes with it. The Espro P3 solved that for me. The double filter system really does make the coffee smoother and less muddy, almost like a pour-over but with the speed and simplicity of a press. I used it a lot on weekends when I wanted something stronger without babysitting a brewer.

The downside is the glass carafe, it feels fragile compared to stainless steel presses, and I was always nervous about knocking it in the sink. On the plus side, Espro sells replacement parts, which saved me after I chipped the beaker once. Cleaning the filter takes a little extra time, but honestly the taste was worth it. If you want a French press that doesn’t give you sludge at the bottom of your cup, this is the one I’d recommend.

## ❄️ Best Cold Brew Option: [OXO Good Grips Cold Brew](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#oxo-good-grips-cold-brew)

Cold brew was my summer obsession, and the OXO made it easy to prep a batch for the week. I liked that the rainmaker lid evenly spread water over the grounds, so the coffee didn’t end up too weak in spots. The glass carafe fits right in the fridge, and I’d usually get enough concentrate for several mornings, which was perfect on hot days when I didn’t want to deal with a hot pot of coffee.

It does make a stronger, bolder concentrate than some other brewers I’ve tried. Personally, I liked that, it held up well when I added milk or ice. The cleanup wasn’t bad, especially since the filter is reusable. If you’ve been buying cold brew at coffee shops, this pays for itself pretty quickly and gives you way more control over how strong you want it.

## 🍵 Best Pod Espresso Option: [Nespresso Essenza Mini](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#nespresso-essenza-mini)

The Essenza Mini was my “I need caffeine now” machine. It’s so small that I kept it on a corner of the counter, and it never got in the way. Pop in a capsule, hit the button, and in less than a minute I’d have an espresso shot. It made mornings way less stressful when I was rushing out the door.

It does mean dealing with pods, which are pricier than ground coffee, but the convenience was worth it. The water tank is small, so I’d refill it often, but that wasn’t a big deal. If you want bigger mugs of coffee you’ll probably want something like the Vertuo line, but for straight-up espresso without fuss, this little machine is hard to beat.",1,1757700917.0,u_Background-Raise6389,0,1.0,False
1nfailz,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1nfailz/how_to_build_relationships_at_work/,How to build relationships at work,"I’ve been at my job for about two months now. My department is very small, and everyone else has been here for years. They’re all really close and hang out outside of work, so it feels like I’ve walked into a group of old friends where I don’t really belong.

I know it’s not always smart to get too close to coworkers since personal information can sometimes be used against you, but honestly, I’m feeling really lonely. I want to build relationships that feel genuine, not just for the sake of having someone to talk to (not be bestfriends per-say), but because I care about growing in my career. Eventually, I’d like to move into another department, and I know that without building some kind of network, I might miss those opportunities entirely.

One of the hardest parts has been lunch. The team always goes out together, but they never invite me. I’ve asked a few times if I could join, and they always say yes, but when I sit with them, I feel invisible. They don’t include me in conversations or ask me any questions. I try to engage by asking them things and showing interest, but they usually give short answers that end the conversation. After a while, I stopped going because it felt worse to sit there and be ignored than it did to eat alone.

I’ve tried other ways to connect, like offering to grab coffee for people when I go on breaks or starting casual conversations during downtime, but those attempts also tend to fall flat. I know I shouldn’t care too much about what they think, but it’s hard. This is my first real job, and I want to build a strong foundation. I feel like being in an entry-level admin role makes me easy to overlook, even though I know I have a lot of potential. It’s hard watching new hires in upper management be instantly welcomed and pulled into the group while I’m barely acknowledged.

I’ve been trying to take initiative in small ways. I ask about people’s roles, express interest in learning, and have even reached out to see if anyone is open to a quick coffee chat so I can understand more about the company. Most of the time, I get told people are too busy, and then I see them socializing with each other anyway.

I know I’m still very new and that building real connections takes time. I don’t expect to be part of the inner circle right away. But I’m struggling with how to approach this in a way that feels genuine and intentional. I want to position myself with smart career moves, but I don’t know how or what small steps to take next. I feel awkward a lot of the time, and I’m scared that if I don’t figure this out soon, I’ll miss the window to grow and be seen.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you build real connections without forcing it or coming off as desperate? And how did you take early steps to grow your career when you didn’t feel supported or included? Please give me brutally honest advice, maybe I am missing something.",1,1757700847.0,careeradvice,1,1.0,False

1nfahte,https://www.reddit.com/r/productbible/comments/1nfahte/the_best_coffee_makers/,The Best Coffee Makers,"Making coffee at home has never been more exciting or more overwhelming. Over the years, we’ve experimented with nearly every method out there, from cold-brew makers and Chemex pour-overs to moka pots and high-end Moccamasters. Each has its own charm, but not everyone wants to fuss with timers, scales, and technique before their first cup of the day. For those who crave café-quality coffee paired with the convenience of automation, a well-made drip coffee maker remains one of the smartest choices.

What sets a drip brewer apart is its balance of flavor and ease. It delivers consistently excellent coffee without demanding the precision of manual methods, making it ideal for busy mornings or households with multiple coffee drinkers. That said, coffee is deeply personal, and depending on what you’re after, whether it’s the bold intensity of espresso, the clarity of pour-over, or the versatility of a great grinder, there are plenty of other worthwhile options to explore.

This guide highlights the best coffee makers across categories so you can find the right fit for your taste, budget, and routine. From simple machines that brew a solid pot to advanced models with precise temperature control and smart features, we’ve narrowed down the choices to make your daily ritual easier and more enjoyable.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [OXO Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#oxo-brew-9-cup)

The OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker is designed for those who value both convenience and consistency. With a 40-ounce capacity, it can brew enough coffee to keep you fueled throughout the morning, while the thermal carafe ensures the pot stays hot for hours without the need for a warming plate. Its auto-brew timer function allows you to wake up to a freshly brewed pot, making it a strong choice for anyone who wants coffee ready the moment they step into the kitchen.

One of the standout features is its automatic pre-infusion cycle, which wets the grounds before brewing to improve extraction and flavor. Combined with a brew time of under 7 minutes, this model balances speed and taste effectively. The stainless steel thermal carafe is well-made and pours smoothly, adding to the overall practicality of the design. The clean, modern look also helps it fit nicely into most kitchens without feeling bulky or outdated.

Despite its strengths, the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker does come with a few drawbacks. The control interface is not especially intuitive, and programming the timer may take some practice. Its tall build at 17.2 inches can also be a limitation for kitchens with low-hanging cabinets, as the water tank and basket lids require extra clearance when open. Additionally, the carafe lid tends to trap traces of old coffee, requiring more thorough cleaning than a quick rinse provides.

When it comes to flavor, the OXO brewer produces a satisfying cup, but more specialized models like the Technivorm Moccamaster deliver greater nuance. That said, the OXO offers features the Moccamaster does not, such as programmability and a built-in timer, making it a more user-friendly option for those who prioritize convenience. Overall, this coffee maker is a well-rounded choice for anyone who wants reliable performance, quick brewing, and the flexibility of advanced features in one machine.

## 💎 Best Upgrade Option: [Technivorm Moccamaster KB](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#technivorm-moccamaster-kb)

The Technivorm Moccamaster KB is a simple yet stylish coffee maker designed for those who want ease of use paired with exceptional results. Its tall, streamlined design is complemented by a straightforward interface, making it one of the most approachable brewers in its class. Capable of brewing up to 40 ounces in about 7 minutes, the Moccamaster consistently produces nuanced, well-balanced cups of coffee.

A key advantage of the KB model is its glass carafe paired with a hot plate that maintains a stable temperature for hours without scorching the brew. The hot plate automatically shuts off after four hours, which helps conserve energy while still offering plenty of time to enjoy a pot throughout the morning. For those who prefer longer heat retention, the thermal carafe KBT version provides even greater insulation, though it lacks the hot plate convenience of the KB.

Both the KB and KBT models allow for manual control over the brewing process by giving you the option to open or close the filter basket mid-brew. This feature lets you fine-tune extraction, offering flexibility without complicating the process. Both versions also come with a generous five-year warranty, reflecting the brand’s reputation for durability and thoughtful craftsmanship.

The Moccamaster does come with some limitations. It lacks features such as a built-in clock, a descaling reminder, or any alert to signal when brewing is complete. It also carries a higher price than many competitors, including other well-regarded drip machines. Cleaning is easier with the KB, as its glass carafe has a wide mouth and is dishwasher-safe, while the KBT requires a bottle brush due to its narrow thermal carafe opening.

At the end of the day, the Technivorm Moccamaster KB is an excellent choice for those who want a straightforward machine that emphasizes quality over bells and whistles. Its consistent brewing performance, beautiful design, and long warranty make it a standout option for coffee lovers who value flavor and durability.

## 💸 Best Budget Coffee Maker: [Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker CE251](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#ninja-ce251)

The Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker CE251 is a reliable, budget-friendly option designed for anyone who wants a straightforward machine that brews consistently good coffee. Priced under $100, it is especially appealing to those who often use pre-ground beans, though it performs just as well with freshly ground coffee. With a generous 60-ounce capacity, it can brew up to 12 cups, making it a practical choice for households or shared spaces.

This model stands out among budget drip machines for producing a hot, well-balanced cup. It offers convenient brewing options with settings for both a classic taste and a stronger, richer flavor. The removable water reservoir is easy to read and fill, reducing spills and simplifying preparation. Its intuitive programming functions also make it easy to schedule brew times in advance, so coffee is ready when you need it without unnecessary effort.

While the machine delivers solid performance overall, its carafe design has some drawbacks. The lid screws on and off, which is less convenient than the flip-top designs found on some competitors. Although this is a minor inconvenience, it does make pouring and cleaning slightly less seamless than it could be.

With a brew time of about 13 minutes, the Ninja CE251 is not the fastest model available, but it compensates with dependability and simplicity. It is well-suited for anyone who values affordability and ease of use in a coffee maker that can handle daily brewing demands. Overall, this machine provides excellent value, making it one of the strongest choices in the budget category.

## ☕ Best French Press: [Espro P3 French Press](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#espro-p3)

The Espro P3 French Press is a solid choice for coffee drinkers who value a straightforward, fast brewing method that doesn’t sacrifice flavor. It is designed for those who want something simple to master while still delivering a consistently excellent cup. With a 32-ounce capacity, it’s large enough to brew multiple servings, making it practical for both solo use and sharing.

One of the standout qualities of the Espro P3 is the way it balances ease of use with a cleaner taste than most traditional French presses. Thanks to its bucket-shaped double filter, which uses a finer mesh than competitors, it produces coffee that is remarkably grit-free, much closer to what you might expect from a pour-over. The filter also ensures that once the plunger is pressed, grounds are kept separate from the liquid, preventing bitterness from oversteeping. This design means your coffee stays bright and flavorful even if you pour a second or third cup later.

Durability is the main drawback compared to stainless steel models. The glass beaker, while functional, is fragile and can break if dropped or knocked against a hard surface. However, Espro sells replacement parts, including beakers and filters, so a mishap doesn’t require replacing the entire brewer. This availability of parts makes the P3 more sustainable and cost-effective over time.

Visually, the Espro P3 is not as stylish as classic options like the Bodum Chambord, and its dual filter can be slightly more difficult to clean. Even so, most users will find that the minor extra effort is well worth it for the improved taste and texture of the brew. The emphasis here is on performance over aesthetics, and the P3 delivers consistently excellent results in a relatively affordable package.

At the end of the day, the Espro P3 French Press combines the simplicity of French press brewing with a unique design that elevates the clarity and flavor of the final cup. It’s not the most elegant option on the counter, but its thoughtful engineering makes it one of the most practical choices for everyday coffee lovers who prioritize quality in each pour.

## ❄️ Best Cold Brew Option: [OXO Good Grips Cold Brew](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#oxo-good-grips-cold-brew)

The OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker is designed for people who want to make better iced coffee at home. Unlike hot coffee that’s refrigerated after brewing, cold brew uses a slow extraction process that results in fewer bitter flavors. The result is a sweeter, smoother cup of coffee that highlights the natural sweetness of the beans. This makes it a great option for anyone who wants a milder-tasting brew that can be enjoyed over ice or mixed with milk.

What sets this brewer apart is its thoughtful design and ease of use. The OXO Good Grips consistently produces cold coffee with balanced acidity, a stronger aroma, and a cleaner finish compared with other models. Its rainmaker lid evenly distributes water over the grounds, which ensures proper extraction. The stainless steel mesh filter is reusable, eliminating the need for paper filters, and the glass carafe makes it easy to store concentrate in the fridge without transferring to another container.

This coffee maker yields about 24 to 28 ounces of concentrate, which is enough for 12 to 14 servings once diluted. That makes it well-suited for those who want to prepare a week’s worth of cold brew in advance. For people with smaller kitchens or those who prefer to make smaller batches, OXO also offers a compact version that works the same way but takes up less counter and refrigerator space.

There are a few drawbacks, though none are significant enough to detract from its overall value. Some brewers, such as the Filtron Cold Water Coffee Concentrate Brewer, produce a smoother and mellower flavor. However, many prefer the OXO’s stronger, bolder taste, and the design is more straightforward to use and clean. While other systems can feel cumbersome, the OXO strikes a better balance between usability and flavor.

In all, the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker delivers a combination of performance, consistency, and convenience. Its reliable results, generous capacity, and intuitive design make it one of the best choices for anyone looking to enjoy cold brew at home without the fuss.

## 🍵 Best Pod Espresso Option: [Nespresso Essenza Mini](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coffee-makers#nespresso-essenza-mini)

The Nespresso Essenza Mini is designed for people who value speed and convenience in their daily coffee routine. It is one of the quickest and simplest ways to prepare an espresso-style drink at home. With just the push of a button and the insertion of a capsule, the machine delivers a consistent shot of espresso in under a minute, making it ideal for those with busy mornings or anyone who wants a no-fuss option for quality coffee.

What makes the Essenza Mini stand out is its combination of compact size and reliable performance. Despite its small footprint, it produces smooth, balanced espresso that captures the flavor and aroma Nespresso machines are known for. The machine heats quickly and operates with minimal effort, offering the core benefits of the Nespresso system, efficiency, ease, and consistent results. Although pods are pricier than ground coffee, they remain widely available and deliver dependable quality with little cleanup required.

The machine’s compactness does come with some trade-offs. Its 20.3-ounce water tank holds enough for about 10 espressos before needing a refill, and the used-capsule tray accommodates only six pods. Both are easy to manage but require more frequent attention compared with larger models. The drip tray must also be removed to fit bigger mugs, which can cause a few drops to spill onto the counter, though this is a minor inconvenience easily resolved with a quick wipe.

Another limitation is that the Essenza Mini is designed exclusively for espresso. Those who want the flexibility to make larger coffee servings, closer to drip-style brews, may prefer a model like the Nespresso VertuoPlus. Still, if your focus is on straightforward espresso drinks, the Essenza Mini does the job exceptionally well without taking up much counter space.

With its compact design, user-friendly operation, and reliable results, the Nespresso Essenza Mini offers an excellent balance of convenience and performance. It’s a strong option for anyone who wants fast, flavorful espresso without the complexity of a traditional machine.

When it comes to brewing at home, the most important factor is finding a method that matches your preferences and lifestyle. Coffee is more than just a drink, it’s a ritual that can shape the rhythm of your day. Whether that means the precision of pour-over, the strength of espresso, or the convenience of a programmable machine, the right setup can make your mornings smoother and more enjoyable.

The landscape of coffee makers today is broad, offering everything from compact pod systems to advanced brewers with precise temperature control. This variety makes it easier than ever to find a machine that balances taste, convenience, and design. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by options, consider what matters most: how much effort you want to put into each brew, how much coffee you typically drink, and the flavors you enjoy most.

Ultimately, the best coffee maker is the one that encourages you to enjoy the process as much as the result. By choosing a machine that aligns with your habits, you’ll not only get better coffee but also a more enjoyable daily routine.",1,1757700792.0,productbible,0,1.0,False
