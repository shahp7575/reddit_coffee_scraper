I sincerely hope this isn't considered spam/promotional as this content of this post is my actual business and as such, I'm hoping to stay part of this thread! 

  
I’m testing a concept for independent shops (starting with coffee initially but the principles across products verticals remain the same) that might help bring down the cost of running a high street business.

It’s based on group buying:  
A handful of shops (in the same area) combine their regular orders for everyday supplies — things like coffee, cleaning materials, retail stock, etc. That pooled volume is then used to unlock bulk discounts from suppliers.

The model:

* Shops still order individually
* We handle the negotiation, coordination, and delivery
* You pay less — without needing to buy more or sign contracts

We're starting with East London but gathering feedback from independent shops around the UK.

If you:

* Run a shop and margins are tight
* Feel like you're always overpaying on basic goods (compared to chains) 
* Are open to testing something new (low-risk) via a tech platform 

This already exists in a couple of industries, namely Pharma and Dental - it feels like something that could be good for the high street too! 

  
Any insight or thoughts very much appreciated

About a month ago, my buddy- total tech nerd and crypto geek - told me about a method to make money that turned out to be insanely simple and surprisingly profitable.

He decided to just share it publicly here on his Reddit profile \[u/klembcke\]. Honestly, if I were him, I probably would’ve sold it

But he’s just collecting tips if anyone feels like sending something. So I figured I’d help him out a bit and write this post.

For the record- I’m currently making around $230/day using this method, and after a week I’ve already made \~$1200.

Hopefully, it’ll help someone else here too- even if it’s just enough for a solid cup of coffee

And it looks great! The review was based on just a demo, and in my opinion, doesn't do the game justice. Think back to Satisfactory; that also took a few years to truly anneal.

I've done almost everything there is to do in Satisfactory, and I'm ready for something new. And that's where Foundry comes in! They've radically overhauled the purpose of their game, and there's so much more to come. The planets (yes, more than one!) are procedurally generated and look fantastic. In fact, you even have to change the terrain to fit your factories – a brilliant addition!

There's an engaging story to get you started, and a trade element that not only makes sense but also stimulates you to build automated robot factories. I say: definitely give it a try! Just like Coffee Stain did with Satisfactory, Foundry's developers listen closely to their players and constantly implement adjustments and changes (trains are coming too).

DAK is known for their complexly processed coffees and very bold flavors, so I was curious if they knew how to handle a high quality, washed Geisha.

Gotta say, its some really good stuff! Very juicy, to the point where you can't help but salivate a little after a sip, lol.

Incredibly peach forward, bright acidity and florals. There's almost zero bitterness.

At 30 euros for a 60 gram tin it's very much on the steep side, so you have to ask yourself if its worth it. I've had Geishas that were like 90% as good for about half the price. But if you truly want to experience some amazing Geisha and don't want to spend a kidney on Finca Esmeralda coffee, this comes pretty close.

Also, if you have a Deep 27, you can stretch the amount of coffees you can make by a lot.

Gear and Recipe:

- Sculptor 078, dial on 8
- Origami brewer
- Sibarist Wave Fast filters
- Custom water recipe, ~70 ppm. I use Lotus Drops, if you want my recipe, shoot in the comments.

15 gram in, 250 gram out. 94c water temp. 50g bloom until 1 minute, followed by 4 50 gram pours, being very aggressive with agitation. Finish at 2.15.

The Sibarist fast filters make it possible to go relatively fine grind and extremely high agitation for a high extraction, and still end up with a sub 2.30 minute clean brew. Highly recommend them, even though they are quite pricey.",3,1752566685.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1m0bz0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Zombie_Ninja_X/comments/1m0bz0n/hp_bars_and_hot_sauce_2_eduardo_vs_the_unbreakable/,HP Bars and Hot Sauce 2: Eduardo vs. The Unbreakable,"Eduardo Morales—legend, burrito conqueror, and proud owner of the world’s most unreasonably maxed-out HP bar—had become so famous he couldn’t walk down the street without someone asking him to open a pickle jar, bless their chihuahua, or let them lightly slap him to “see if it works.”

But all heroes need a rival. Eduardo’s showed up on a Tuesday, like all bad omens do.

⸻

The Arrival of The Unbreakable

It happened at his favorite taco truck. Eduardo was mid-bite into a burrito so stuffed it was basically a sleeping bag for beans. He heard murmurs behind him. People were pointing.

Standing at the end of the line was a man about Eduardo’s age, wearing sunglasses at night and a leather jacket that looked two sizes too small for his biceps. Above his head floated a bar just like Eduardo’s:

HP: 999,999/999,999
DEF: MAX
ATK: ???

He strutted up to Eduardo, chewing gum like it owed him money.

“You’re Eduardo Morales?” the man said, voice dripping with the confidence of a guy who’d definitely practiced this line in the mirror.

Eduardo nodded, wiping salsa off his chin. “Yeah. You want an autograph or a selfie?”

The man smirked. “Name’s Victor Valdez. They call me The Unbreakable.”

Eduardo raised an eyebrow. “Who’s they?”

“Me. I call me that. And soon everyone else will, too.”

⸻

Clash of the Titans

Word spread instantly. A crowd formed. Phones came out. A lady selling elotes started live-streaming.

Victor leaned in, sunglasses glinting. “You think you’re special because your HP bar’s full? Bro, I once ate an entire habanero farm. Didn’t even burp. I’ve never stubbed my toe. Never got heartburn. I even watched a season finale cliffhanger without googling spoilers. Untouchable, baby.”

Eduardo tilted his head. “That’s cute. I stub my toe on purpose for fun. Also, I drink gas station coffee and take a nap right after—no damage.”

Victor stepped closer. The HP bars above their heads flickered like neon signs fighting for dominance.

“Let’s settle this, Morales. One challenge. Winner gets to keep the title of ‘Most OP Human.’”

Eduardo finished his burrito, licked his fingers, and shrugged. “Okay. What’s the challenge?”

⸻

The Challenge

Victor pulled out a single, sinister-looking tortilla chip from a black bag labeled El Diablo Fantasma. It was rumored to be so spicy it could make a grown man’s HP bar drop to zero in seconds.

“The Ghost Reaper Chip. One bite. Last man standing keeps the title. Deal?” Victor said, dramatic as a telenovela villain.

Eduardo just grinned. “You should’ve brought two.”

They each took a chip. The crowd fell silent. A mariachi band materialized out of nowhere—someone had paid them for dramatic effect.

Victor bit his chip first. Crunch. His HP bar didn’t budge. He smirked. Eduardo crunched his chip. Same deal. Nothing.

Seconds passed. Then Victor’s eye twitched. A single bead of sweat appeared. His HP bar flickered: 999,999 → 999,995.

The crowd gasped in unison. Eduardo, meanwhile, burped politely. 999,999 → 1,000,000. A plus sign appeared next to his bar.

“Impossible…” Victor sputtered. He hiccuped. Another flicker: 999,995 → 999,990.

Eduardo patted Victor’s shoulder. “Nice try, bro. Next time bring salsa. You’re gonna need it.”

⸻

Mutual Respect

Victor dropped to a knee, tears streaming, not from sadness but from nuclear ghost pepper powder. Eduardo helped him up, handed him a bottle of horchata.

“Hey, man. You’re tough. Respect,” Eduardo said, grinning.

Victor wiped his nose dramatically. “Same to you, Morales. Maybe we team up sometime. Take down real threats. Like the DMV.”

Eduardo nodded. “Deal. But first, tacos.”

⸻

New Legends

From that day on, the world had two unstoppable men with HP bars so high the universe itself felt slightly underpowered by comparison. They became legends—Eduardo the Indestructible, Victor the Unbreakable.

Their adventures would take them everywhere: competitive pie eating contests, shopping cart jousting, staring contests with angry geese—each one a battle, each one a reminder that sometimes your greatest rival can also be your best burrito buddy.

1m0byvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1m0byvo/aita_for_refusing_to_change_jobs_because_of_my/,AITA for refusing to change jobs because of my friend's girlfriend?,"I (23M) recently moved to Seoul and got a job as a stage performer at a local club. I'm in good shape, so my job involves putting on shows for female audiences - dancing, interacting with them on stage, going into the crowd, etc. It's physically demanding work, and sometimes I get inappropriately touched (like getting scratches on my torso, which sucks since my looks are part of my income). But the pay is good, and I really need the money.  

Here's why: My older brother recently battled a serious illness, lost his income, and my parents drained their savings to help him. Before this, they could support me financially - now it's my turn to help them.  

Enter my best friend ""Jay"" (25M), who's lived in Seoul for years with his girlfriend Annie (27F). Recently, Jay used his work bonus to buy front-row tickets to my show. Big mistake.  

During my performance (where I'm required to interact with front-row attendees), I approached their section. Annie wrapped her arms around me, ran her hands over my body, and basically clung to me for several seconds. Standard work stuff - I was about to move on when Jay started yelling at me to ""get away from his girl"" and shoved me slightly.  

Our club’s protocol when guys get jealous: We’re trained to immediately disengage and redirect. No arguing, just exit the situation. This isn’t my first rodeo with jealous boyfriends, so when Annie full-on groped me during my crowd walk (standard for my role), and Jay started shoving/yelling, I followed protocol and walked away. 

After the show, Jay sent then deleted some angry voice messages before sending a final text: He apologized for attacking me but said Annie is ""obsessed"" with me and demanded a face-to-face talk (his idea!). At coffee, he dropped a bomb.
1) Annie won't stop talking about me  
2) Her touching me was ""inappropriate""    
He insisted I quit my job. 

I said no:  
1. This income supports my family 
2. Audience interaction is mandatory —I can’t pick and choose  
3. He brought her to my workplace, knowing what my job entails  

Jay accused me of ""encouraging"" her, gave a ""quit or we’re done"" ultimatum, and blocked me everywhere when I stood my ground.  
Now I'm sitting here like... WTF? AITA for prioritizing my family's financial needs over my friend's jealousy?

1m0bydl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Zombie_Ninja_X/comments/1m0bydl/hp_bars_and_hot_sauce_the_op_life_of_eduardo/,HP Bars and Hot Sauce: The OP Life of Eduardo Morales,"Eduardo Morales was a 36-year-old Mexican American man with two great loves in life: burritos the size of small toddlers, and taking long naps that left him more tired than when he started. He worked a boring IT help desk job, fixing people’s “broken” computers by plugging them in and turning them off and on again—high-level wizardry, really.

One Tuesday morning, Eduardo was halfway through a breakfast burrito that could double as a blunt weapon when he felt a weird ding in his head. Suddenly, above everyone’s head—including his own—a translucent green bar appeared, floating like a video game HUD.

“What the hell…?” Eduardo mumbled through a mouthful of chorizo. He squinted at his reflection in the microwave door. Sure enough, right above his head: HP: 999,999/999,999.

“Hey, Eduardo!” yelled his neighbor Dave, a man whose diet consisted of expired frozen pizzas and spite. Dave stumbled out of his apartment, tripped on his own sandals, and face-planted on the hallway floor. Above Dave’s head, Eduardo saw HP: 20/100 drop to HP: 15/100.

“Oh damn. People really do take damage from anything,” Eduardo said. He poked his head into Dave’s kitchen. It looked like a post-apocalyptic cheese graveyard. “Your life bar explains a lot, bro.”

⸻

The World Realizes HP is Real

The news spread faster than a TikTok dance challenge. Suddenly, people were wearing bicycle helmets in the shower and bubble wrap to the grocery store. You could see folks choke on a peanut and lose five HP. People ran from pigeons like they were dragons—turns out pigeon droppings cost 1 HP per splat.

Eduardo, meanwhile, was thriving. While others flinched at paper cuts that did visible damage, he could accidentally step on a LEGO barefoot and watch his HP bar stay rock solid at 999,999.

He tested his powers. He stubbed his toe on the coffee table: nothing. He swallowed an entire jalapeño whole: nothing. He did his taxes: nothing. Not even the IRS could touch him.

⸻

The Overpowered Hero Emerges

By Friday, Eduardo had become a local celebrity. People lined up outside his apartment with requests.

“Eduardo, my HP drops when my mother-in-law visits. Can you help?”

“Can you open this pickle jar? It’s been draining my HP for days.”

Eduardo obliged. He gave motivational speeches to boost morale. He carried heavy groceries. He let toddlers punch him in the shins for fun—boop boop boop—and the kids giggled when his HP bar didn’t budge.

He once sneezed so hard he added 50 HP. Scientists called him “a statistical anomaly.” His mom called him “a good boy.” His dad said, “So when are you getting married?”—which did, for the first time, cost him 1 HP.

⸻

The Final Boss

One night, Eduardo was at his favorite taco truck when he encountered his arch-nemesis: the Diablo Burrito, rumored to be so spicy it could drop your HP by 50 on the first bite. Legend said three people had been hospitalized trying to finish it.

“Eduardo Morales,” said the vendor in hushed tones. “Are you sure?”

Eduardo nodded solemnly. “Do it.”

He unwrapped the burrito. Steam rose like the breath of a mythical beast. He took a massive bite. Salsa dripped down his chin.

Everyone watched. Nothing happened. His HP bar didn’t even flicker.

Then, a tiny ding. +1 HP appeared.

He swallowed. “Oh man. That’s good. Gimme two more.”

⸻

Life with the Bar

From that day on, Eduardo became a legend. Kids dressed as him for Halloween, complete with floating cardboard HP bars. He got his own cooking show: The Invincible Chef. And when people asked him the secret to his indestructible stats, he’d smile, hold up a burrito, and say:

“It’s all about the seasoning—and a good nap.”

The world still had its dangers: choking hazards, stubbed toes, that one coworker who microwaved fish in the break room. But whenever people saw their HP bars drop, they’d look at Eduardo’s still-maxed-out bar and remember—maybe life’s about laughing, living, and never letting a Diablo Burrito scare you away.

⸻

Moral of the story: If you ever get a visible HP bar, make sure your stats are maxed and your salsa is spicy. 🌯🔥

I (21F) have been dating Marcus (34M) for about 9 months. We met at a coffee shop near my college and he was drawn to how “mature” I was for my age. My parents disowned me when I started dating him because of the age gap, but Marcus helped me see that love doesn’t have an age limit. He’s been helping me with my student loans and guiding me through “adult decisions” since I’m still figuring out life.

Yesterday I was telling him about drama with my college friends. My roommate Chloe found out her boyfriend was cheating and I was really upset because she’s like a sister to me. Instead of listening, Marcus just sighed and said “This is exactly what I mean about your generation. You’re all so dramatic about everything. When you’re an adult like me, you’ll understand that these college problems aren’t real problems. You’re too immature to understand what actual stress looks like.” He told me to focus on “more important things” like planning our future instead of “childish friend dramas.”

I told him that if he really thinks I’m too immature to discuss my problems with him, then maybe he should date someone his own age. He got upset and said I was being “emotional” and “proving his point.” So I gave him an ultimatum - either he apologizes and starts treating me as an equal partner, or I’m done. He said ultimatums are “manipulative” and that I’m “acting like a child throwing a tantrum.”

I’ve been staying at my dorm since then and he’s been texting me saying I’m overreacting and that he was just trying to help me “grow up.” Some friends say I should apologize because he’s “experienced,” but others say this is a red flag. My family won’t talk to me about it since they hate him. This morning he texted “if you’re going to keep acting like this, maybe I should find someone who can handle an adult relationship.”

I love him and he’s been good to me in other ways, but I’m questioning if I’m actually ready for this or if he’s right about me being too immature. AITAH for giving him an ultimatum?",12,1752566126.0,AITAH,19,0.87,False

First time visiting the sub, and I found it strange how Siemens machines seems underrepresented. Compared to Jura or De’Longhi, Siemens barely gets talked about.

This includes sit-down places like Mamou, Ippudo, and even cafes. It's misleading by design.

\---

I’ve been a credit card product manager in the PH for years, and I can’t stay silent about HSBC’s misleading tactics with the Live+ card. At first glance, the Live+ card looks like one of the best cards in the market. It offers best-in-class cashback on multiple categories, including 8% on dining, 5% on entertainment, and 5% on shopping (online and offline).

So what's the catch?

Many restaurants are knocked down from 8% to just 2% cashback because they're coded as ""Fast Food"", including many sit-down establishments like Mamou, Papillon, Ippudo, Pancake House, and even smaller cafes like Candid Coffee and Odd Cafe. So no, these restaurants are clearly not fast food, but HSBC excludes them to reduce our cashback.

Unfortunately, this is intentional. The HSBC Gold Visa gives 5% cashback on the same restaurants - without any exclusions for ""Fast Food"". This proves HSBC knows exactly how these are classified, yet still advertises “8% on dining” for the Live+ card. So no, this isn’t an accident. It’s an intentional design choice to overpromise and underdeliver. HSBC puts the burden on us, the users, to figure out which restaurants are valid. This misleading behavior is unacceptable from a global bank.

This happens because every establishment is assigned a Merchant Category Code (MCC) - like Restaurants, Utilities, or Fast Food. This is how banks categorize your spending. But consumers have no easy way to check these codes since banks and acquirers don't publish them.

There’s a thread tracking MCCs of PH establishments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/17rye9l/called_bank_to_provide_me_all_txn_mcc/share_id=vES__C0XBIoJjyACtN2Rz&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1).

You might argue that it's the acquirers' fault for classifying these establishments under ""Fast Food"", and that's partially true. But don't forget - HSBC is still intentionally excluding restaurants for Live+ that it includes for Gold Visa. They know this difference.

My sister talks to people in her head, these people are people we know of who she dislikes extremely due to personal reasons, there’s this one girl let’s call her julie, my sister is cussing someone out and when i ask her “who is using these words?” she says it’s julie. 
she doesn’t know what’s happening but julie is in her head and she’s talking to her, she says things like julie uses conditioner while showering or julie tells her not to eat but my sister is eating well, my sister hasn’t left the house since this started, she has had traumatic experiences and she always told me she has bpd but she knew how to take care of it. my sister is empathetic and the kindest person ever, hearing these words from her breaks my heart. she stays in her room and shes started smoking cigarettes a lot, i try to sit with her in her room and i try to make more conversation with her when she comes down to eat, she always eats her meals at the table. She stays clean, she showers everyday, she eats her meals, she has always been confident about her looks but recently she started covering her face with her hair, maybe its cause she’s afraid to be judged. i asked her many times if she wants to get coffee with me but she denies, me and my mother are both in a lot of stress, i don’t feel like talking to anyone or meeting anyone and i think
about my sister a lot, my moms brother had severe schizophrenia and she’s already traumatized by the psychiatrist and the medications. We want my sister to give therapy a shot but i know she’s not gonna agree to that either. But i know
deep down she wants help

1m0bo63,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1m0bo63/kevin_wasnt_where_he_thought_he_was/,Kevin Wasn't Where He Thought He Was.,"To Set the Scene: over a decade ago, the shopping plaza's ""anchor"" store was a K-mart. Other businesses nearby included an auto parts place, a discount grocery store, a fast food burger joint, a fast coffee and doughnuts joint, a mom n' pop pizza place, and an office supplies store that rhymes with ""Naples"". 

I worked at the latter. (E stato facile?)

Our shopping carts at the time were red. The 'Mart's carts were gray, as were the grocery store's. This is relevant because my first sign that something wasn't quite typical with Kevin was the fact that he pushed a big gray and blue cart into our store. 

But, I put that aside; no big deal, one of us would just take it across the parking lot when he left, he might laugh at himself if he tried to use our cart storage and saw that it didn't ""nest"" with the others and we'd move on with life. Shopping cart/buggy/trolley is a cart/buggy/trolley, right? 

I did not, at that time, understand I had a real life Kevin in the wild on my hands. 

I quickly realized it, however, when he walked over to the desk where I worked removing viruses from 4 mo old machines loaded with pr0n and no antivirus software enabled-- pretty standard early 2000's tech support. 

""Where's the milk?"" Kevin asked, staring past or through every single indication that there was not, in fact, going to be a gallon of milk in an office supplies store, unless you counted the little white plastic cups of coffee lightener, and he didn't look like the French Vanilla type. 

""Next door at the grocery store,"" fell out of my mouth before I could think of a kinder way to say it. Easy enough to pass off as a light-hearted joke, I thought, he'll be with us any second now.

""I need apples too,"" Kevin announced. 

Oh Kevin... 

""Sir? This is a Naples. The grocery store is next door."" Here I pointed ""through"" the wall at my back toward the grocery store. 

""Huh?"" Kevin so eloquently queried. 

Let me be clear; this was not a confused 6 year old adorably bumbling while helping his mom on an errand, nor was this Kevin some elderly widower who'd never done the household shopping until now who needed a pep talk and 5 minutes of sympathy. This was a reasonably fit, 30-50ish year old man who presumably should be able to see huge pictures of printers in 1 store, 30' away from a store with huge pictures of fruits on it's front windows, and extrapolate from the available data that perhaps the former store would not, in fact, provide the comestibles he went looking for. 

""How'd I get here?"" Kevin asked. Seriously. He expected me to answer that for him. A million answers sprung to mind, not one of them kind or polite, but I caught myself and started thinking about that acronym to check if someone's having a stroke. He appeared free of symptoms, no drooping, etc. Just... Kevin. 

""I'm not sure, sir. I wish I could be more help, but I'm confident you'll get what you need at (Grocery Store) next door."" 

""But... where do I get my groceries?"" 

Oh Jesus Hansel Christ... 

""Let me show you. This way, please,"" and I left my post (Strictly not allowed, but what else was I supposed to do?), walked him back out of the sliding glass doors, along the sidewalk to the curb cut so he could keep his big gray shopping cart upright, and pointed to the tan brick building 30' away from our front doors. 

""That one's the grocery store,"" I said. 

""Oh! That's where I got my cart,"" and off Kevin went, back to where he'd apparently started in the first place... where the big gray and blue shopping carts were kept on the opposite side of the doors from the Naples entrance. 

He'd not only walked into the wrong store and started asking for unavailable products, but **he walked right past the entrance of the required store** to do it.

When I went back in the assistant manager asked what was up. I opted for ""GPS failure"" for that poor lost soul on the highway of life. 

TL: dr-- Kevin drives to grocery store. Kevin gets cart in front of grocery store. Kevin walks 30' PAST the grocery store and is then confused why the printers-and-ink store doesn't have milk.",23,1752565517.0,StoriesAboutKevin,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1: The Wedding.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

# Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

# Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

“If you think you can manipulate me like you manipulated my father, you’re very wrong. You’ve spent all the inheritance my mother left me on trips and a luxurious life for Molly. I’m not going to ask him for anything.”

Eva didn’t lose her poise, but the glint in her eyes betrayed her frustration.

“You’re more naïve than I thought, Laura,” Eva said, her eyes shining with restrained contempt.

I felt my anger rising.

“If you wanted to get your hands on the Reynolds fortune so badly, why didn’t you force Molly to marry him? She could definitely manipulate him much better than I could.”

A cruel smile crossed her painted lips.

“Of course I wanted Molly to marry him, not you. But who would have thought that girl would run away just the day before the wedding?”

“Has she heard anything?” I asked, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity.

“She’s in Paris,” Eva replied, as if she were talking about something as trivial as the weather.

My voice was thick with disbelief. “Is the money for her? I married her instead of avoiding a scandal! Unbelievable.”

Eva leaned forward, her eyes scrutinizing me like a predator. “Molly has always been the problem, child. You’ve always been the more... controllable one.”

The word “controllable” hung in the air like an insult, heavy and venomous.

“No. Molly has always been your real daughter, and I’m the daughter of my father’s first wife.”

“But don’t worry. In the end, we all need someone. And when you need me, I remember this conversation.”

My voice trembled, heavy with years of accumulated hurt.

“I needed you my entire childhood.”

The words came out as a whisper of pain, revealing years of abandonment and neglect. Eva didn’t answer - she didn’t need to. Her silence was more eloquent than any words.

I picked up my purse, feeling the weight not only of the object, but of all the family history that had brought me there. An almost mechanical gesture: I took a $20 bill and placed it on the table, paying for the coffee as if paying for years of unresolved emotional debts.

I left without looking back.

# Chapter 4: The veronica sanctuary and bookshop

I arranged my clothes in the closet of the guest room. It was a vast space, almost unreal, but all my clothes and shoes fit through one door. All the other shelves remained empty, like a silent portrait of my current existence.

“Mrs. Laura, when will the other suitcases arrive?” The maid looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and pity.

“There are no more suitcases,” I replied without hesitation.

She opened her mouth as if to argue, but changed her mind. Her gaze roamed over the few clothes on the rack, understanding something she preferred not to name.

“If you need anything, just call,” she said, backing away discreetly.

“Where are the books here?” I asked, feeling a sudden need to find something familiar.

“On the second floor is the major library,” she explained. “On the third floor, there’s a smaller, more private one.”

Something in her tone made me raise an eyebrow.

“Reserved?” I asked.

The maid hesitated.

“It’s a private library,” she added hastily. “Mr. James’s.”

My interest immediately peaked. A private library, on the third floor. Exactly the place I needed to go.

I walked alone through the long corridors of the Reynolds mansion, since no one wanted to show me around. Everything was so big and luxurious. The third floor seemed different - less lit, quieter. A side corridor caught my eye, narrow and almost forgotten.

An old dark wooden staircase led me up a short flight of steps. At the top was a slightly ajar door.

My heart raced as I pushed it open.

The room was like a time capsule. Pictures of women were everywhere - she was young and smiling, at different points in her life. Delicate dresses hung in the closet, some still with tags. A desk with personal papers, a partially opened diary.

On the bedside table, a framed photo: James and her, smiling. Next to it, a small teddy bear, faded by time.

“Who are you?” I asked, looking at the picture.

I dabbed on a party dress, feeling the delicate fabric.

The door opened with a dry creek.

James stood there, his body filling the gap, icy blue eyes fixed on me. There was no anger on his face - something worse. An absolute emptiness.

“Get out of here now,” he said, his voice low and threatening.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t move.

For the first time, I saw a fracture in James’ mask - a muscle in his jaw that jumped, a wet glint in his eyes.

“James, I...”

“Now,” he repeated, the word laden with a pain he was trying to hide.

I ran and locked myself in my room and stayed there for the rest of the day.

…

I visited Alice late in the day. I needed to feel loved, and she was my only friend.

The aroma of coffee and new books filled the small bookshop as Alice leaned over the counter, her brown eyes fixed on me.

“Are you really going to quit your job because of that man?” Her voice trembled slightly, her hands clenching the already cold cup of coffee.

I felt a lump form in my throat. My fingers played nervously with the gold chain around my neck - a wedding present from James that felt more like a collar.

“I don’t have a choice,” I muttered, avoiding her gaze. “He’s my husband now; I have to obey him.” The words came out of my mouth bitterly, as if each syllable was a small defeat.

“But we need you here so much. You’re the soul of this place.”

Alice showed me the surrounding shelves, where I had organized every book for the last three years.

“I can take care of the reports while you find someone to replace me.”

“It won’t be the same.” Alice shook her head, an unruly curl of her red hair falling over her face.

“Alice, I’m sorry...” I hesitated, my gaze wandering to the bookshop window, where the rain was beginning to fall softly. A shiver ran down my spine as I thought about my next confession. “But I have the feeling that my marriage won’t last. He hates me and I don’t even know why.” My voice faltered on the last word, betraying the pain I was trying to hide. “And he loves another woman. I’ve seen her photos.”

Alice slammed her cup down on the counter.

“He’s an idiot. An idiot who doesn’t deserve a minute of your time.”

“I think he was hoping to marry Molly. She’s prettier and funnier than me,” I whispered, feeling the weight of this truth that I’d been carrying around for days.

Alice frowned, settling back in her chair. “Any news about your sister?”

“Eva says she’s in Paris.” My voice sounded distant at the mention of my older sister, as memories of our last conversation flashed through my mind.

“Laura,” Alice leaned forward, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret, “there’s something I don’t understand. Why did your sister run away?”

“Not to get married.” The short answer escaped my lips, bitter as gall.

She rolled her eyes, impatient.

“I know that! I didn’t understand why she didn’t want to marry James. He’s a jerk, but he’s a rich, handsome jerk. Molly loves money and luxury.”

Alice gestured with her hands, clearly frustrated by the mystery.

I bit my lip thoughtfully. “I didn’t understand it either, but I didn’t even have time to think about it.” There was something strange about this total story, a detail that had escaped me.

The sound of paper being unwrapped broke my thoughts. Alice slid a small picture frame across the counter, her eyes shining with restrained emotion.

“Here’s your wedding present.”

My hands trembled slightly as I picked it up. It was a picture of the front of a bookshop, old and charming, with large glass windows and a carved wooden door.

“What’s this?” I asked, my fingers tracing the frame of the picture frame, feeling every detail under my touch.

“The bookshop we’re going to buy when you get divorced.” Alice’s tone was firm, filled with a certainty that made me swallow.

“What’s wrong with that one?”

I ran my fingers over the image, feeling a tightness in my chest as I recognized the façade.

“Nothing.” Alice smiled, her eyes shining with that familiar enthusiasm that always appeared when we talked about our dreams. “I want to expand the business and you’ll be my partner. It was our plan all along.” His voice carried the promise of a future that seemed ever more distant.

A blue light flashed on my cell phone screen, interrupting that moment of hope. It was James.

“Where are you?”

My hands shook slightly as I typed the answer. “At the bookstore.”

His reply came almost instantly, cold and impersonal like all our interactions: “I’m having dinner with my secretary, don’t expect me and don’t bother me.”

I put my cell phone down on the counter with more force than necessary. I felt humiliated by that message and I didn’t even know why.",1,1752565373.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1: The Wedding.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

# Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

# Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

“If you think you can manipulate me like you manipulated my father, you’re very wrong. You’ve spent all the inheritance my mother left me on trips and a luxurious life for Molly. I’m not going to ask him for anything.”

Eva didn’t lose her poise, but the glint in her eyes betrayed her frustration.

“You’re more naïve than I thought, Laura,” Eva said, her eyes shining with restrained contempt.

I felt my anger rising.

“If you wanted to get your hands on the Reynolds fortune so badly, why didn’t you force Molly to marry him? She could definitely manipulate him much better than I could.”

A cruel smile crossed her painted lips.

“Of course I wanted Molly to marry him, not you. But who would have thought that girl would run away just the day before the wedding?”

“Has she heard anything?” I asked, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity.

“She’s in Paris,” Eva replied, as if she were talking about something as trivial as the weather.

My voice was thick with disbelief. “Is the money for her? I married her instead of avoiding a scandal! Unbelievable.”

Eva leaned forward, her eyes scrutinizing me like a predator. “Molly has always been the problem, child. You’ve always been the more... controllable one.”

The word “controllable” hung in the air like an insult, heavy and venomous.

“No. Molly has always been your real daughter, and I’m the daughter of my father’s first wife.”

“But don’t worry. In the end, we all need someone. And when you need me, I remember this conversation.”

My voice trembled, heavy with years of accumulated hurt.

“I needed you my entire childhood.”

The words came out as a whisper of pain, revealing years of abandonment and neglect. Eva didn’t answer - she didn’t need to. Her silence was more eloquent than any words.

I picked up my purse, feeling the weight not only of the object, but of all the family history that had brought me there. An almost mechanical gesture: I took a $20 bill and placed it on the table, paying for the coffee as if paying for years of unresolved emotional debts.

I left without looking back.

# Chapter 4: The veronica sanctuary and bookshop

I arranged my clothes in the closet of the guest room. It was a vast space, almost unreal, but all my clothes and shoes fit through one door. All the other shelves remained empty, like a silent portrait of my current existence.

“Mrs. Laura, when will the other suitcases arrive?” The maid looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and pity.

“There are no more suitcases,” I replied without hesitation.

She opened her mouth as if to argue, but changed her mind. Her gaze roamed over the few clothes on the rack, understanding something she preferred not to name.

“If you need anything, just call,” she said, backing away discreetly.

“Where are the books here?” I asked, feeling a sudden need to find something familiar.

“On the second floor is the major library,” she explained. “On the third floor, there’s a smaller, more private one.”

Something in her tone made me raise an eyebrow.

“Reserved?” I asked.

The maid hesitated.

“It’s a private library,” she added hastily. “Mr. James’s.”

My interest immediately peaked. A private library, on the third floor. Exactly the place I needed to go.

I walked alone through the long corridors of the Reynolds mansion, since no one wanted to show me around. Everything was so big and luxurious. The third floor seemed different - less lit, quieter. A side corridor caught my eye, narrow and almost forgotten.

An old dark wooden staircase led me up a short flight of steps. At the top was a slightly ajar door.

My heart raced as I pushed it open.

The room was like a time capsule. Pictures of women were everywhere - she was young and smiling, at different points in her life. Delicate dresses hung in the closet, some still with tags. A desk with personal papers, a partially opened diary.

On the bedside table, a framed photo: James and her, smiling. Next to it, a small teddy bear, faded by time.

“Who are you?” I asked, looking at the picture.

I dabbed on a party dress, feeling the delicate fabric.

The door opened with a dry creek.

James stood there, his body filling the gap, icy blue eyes fixed on me. There was no anger on his face - something worse. An absolute emptiness.

“Get out of here now,” he said, his voice low and threatening.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t move.

For the first time, I saw a fracture in James’ mask - a muscle in his jaw that jumped, a wet glint in his eyes.

“James, I...”

“Now,” he repeated, the word laden with a pain he was trying to hide.

I ran and locked myself in my room and stayed there for the rest of the day.

…

I visited Alice late in the day. I needed to feel loved, and she was my only friend.

The aroma of coffee and new books filled the small bookshop as Alice leaned over the counter, her brown eyes fixed on me.

“Are you really going to quit your job because of that man?” Her voice trembled slightly, her hands clenching the already cold cup of coffee.

I felt a lump form in my throat. My fingers played nervously with the gold chain around my neck - a wedding present from James that felt more like a collar.

“I don’t have a choice,” I muttered, avoiding her gaze. “He’s my husband now; I have to obey him.” The words came out of my mouth bitterly, as if each syllable was a small defeat.

“But we need you here so much. You’re the soul of this place.”

Alice showed me the surrounding shelves, where I had organized every book for the last three years.

“I can take care of the reports while you find someone to replace me.”

“It won’t be the same.” Alice shook her head, an unruly curl of her red hair falling over her face.

“Alice, I’m sorry...” I hesitated, my gaze wandering to the bookshop window, where the rain was beginning to fall softly. A shiver ran down my spine as I thought about my next confession. “But I have the feeling that my marriage won’t last. He hates me and I don’t even know why.” My voice faltered on the last word, betraying the pain I was trying to hide. “And he loves another woman. I’ve seen her photos.”

Alice slammed her cup down on the counter.

“He’s an idiot. An idiot who doesn’t deserve a minute of your time.”

“I think he was hoping to marry Molly. She’s prettier and funnier than me,” I whispered, feeling the weight of this truth that I’d been carrying around for days.

Alice frowned, settling back in her chair. “Any news about your sister?”

“Eva says she’s in Paris.” My voice sounded distant at the mention of my older sister, as memories of our last conversation flashed through my mind.

“Laura,” Alice leaned forward, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret, “there’s something I don’t understand. Why did your sister run away?”

“Not to get married.” The short answer escaped my lips, bitter as gall.

She rolled her eyes, impatient.

“I know that! I didn’t understand why she didn’t want to marry James. He’s a jerk, but he’s a rich, handsome jerk. Molly loves money and luxury.”

Alice gestured with her hands, clearly frustrated by the mystery.

I bit my lip thoughtfully. “I didn’t understand it either, but I didn’t even have time to think about it.” There was something strange about this total story, a detail that had escaped me.

The sound of paper being unwrapped broke my thoughts. Alice slid a small picture frame across the counter, her eyes shining with restrained emotion.

“Here’s your wedding present.”

My hands trembled slightly as I picked it up. It was a picture of the front of a bookshop, old and charming, with large glass windows and a carved wooden door.

“What’s this?” I asked, my fingers tracing the frame of the picture frame, feeling every detail under my touch.

“The bookshop we’re going to buy when you get divorced.” Alice’s tone was firm, filled with a certainty that made me swallow.

“What’s wrong with that one?”

I ran my fingers over the image, feeling a tightness in my chest as I recognized the façade.

“Nothing.” Alice smiled, her eyes shining with that familiar enthusiasm that always appeared when we talked about our dreams. “I want to expand the business and you’ll be my partner. It was our plan all along.” His voice carried the promise of a future that seemed ever more distant.

A blue light flashed on my cell phone screen, interrupting that moment of hope. It was James.

“Where are you?”

My hands shook slightly as I typed the answer. “At the bookstore.”

His reply came almost instantly, cold and impersonal like all our interactions: “I’m having dinner with my secretary, don’t expect me and don’t bother me.”

I put my cell phone down on the counter with more force than necessary. I felt humiliated by that message and I didn’t even know why.",1,1752565347.0,Novels,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1: The Wedding.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

# Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

# Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

“If you think you can manipulate me like you manipulated my father, you’re very wrong. You’ve spent all the inheritance my mother left me on trips and a luxurious life for Molly. I’m not going to ask him for anything.”

Eva didn’t lose her poise, but the glint in her eyes betrayed her frustration.

“You’re more naïve than I thought, Laura,” Eva said, her eyes shining with restrained contempt.

I felt my anger rising.

“If you wanted to get your hands on the Reynolds fortune so badly, why didn’t you force Molly to marry him? She could definitely manipulate him much better than I could.”

A cruel smile crossed her painted lips.

“Of course I wanted Molly to marry him, not you. But who would have thought that girl would run away just the day before the wedding?”

“Has she heard anything?” I asked, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity.

“She’s in Paris,” Eva replied, as if she were talking about something as trivial as the weather.

My voice was thick with disbelief. “Is the money for her? I married her instead of avoiding a scandal! Unbelievable.”

Eva leaned forward, her eyes scrutinizing me like a predator. “Molly has always been the problem, child. You’ve always been the more... controllable one.”

The word “controllable” hung in the air like an insult, heavy and venomous.

“No. Molly has always been your real daughter, and I’m the daughter of my father’s first wife.”

“But don’t worry. In the end, we all need someone. And when you need me, I remember this conversation.”

My voice trembled, heavy with years of accumulated hurt.

“I needed you my entire childhood.”

The words came out as a whisper of pain, revealing years of abandonment and neglect. Eva didn’t answer - she didn’t need to. Her silence was more eloquent than any words.

I picked up my purse, feeling the weight not only of the object, but of all the family history that had brought me there. An almost mechanical gesture: I took a $20 bill and placed it on the table, paying for the coffee as if paying for years of unresolved emotional debts.

I left without looking back.

# Chapter 4: The veronica sanctuary and bookshop

I arranged my clothes in the closet of the guest room. It was a vast space, almost unreal, but all my clothes and shoes fit through one door. All the other shelves remained empty, like a silent portrait of my current existence.

“Mrs. Laura, when will the other suitcases arrive?” The maid looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and pity.

“There are no more suitcases,” I replied without hesitation.

She opened her mouth as if to argue, but changed her mind. Her gaze roamed over the few clothes on the rack, understanding something she preferred not to name.

“If you need anything, just call,” she said, backing away discreetly.

“Where are the books here?” I asked, feeling a sudden need to find something familiar.

“On the second floor is the major library,” she explained. “On the third floor, there’s a smaller, more private one.”

Something in her tone made me raise an eyebrow.

“Reserved?” I asked.

The maid hesitated.

“It’s a private library,” she added hastily. “Mr. James’s.”

My interest immediately peaked. A private library, on the third floor. Exactly the place I needed to go.

I walked alone through the long corridors of the Reynolds mansion, since no one wanted to show me around. Everything was so big and luxurious. The third floor seemed different - less lit, quieter. A side corridor caught my eye, narrow and almost forgotten.

An old dark wooden staircase led me up a short flight of steps. At the top was a slightly ajar door.

My heart raced as I pushed it open.

The room was like a time capsule. Pictures of women were everywhere - she was young and smiling, at different points in her life. Delicate dresses hung in the closet, some still with tags. A desk with personal papers, a partially opened diary.

On the bedside table, a framed photo: James and her, smiling. Next to it, a small teddy bear, faded by time.

“Who are you?” I asked, looking at the picture.

I dabbed on a party dress, feeling the delicate fabric.

The door opened with a dry creek.

James stood there, his body filling the gap, icy blue eyes fixed on me. There was no anger on his face - something worse. An absolute emptiness.

“Get out of here now,” he said, his voice low and threatening.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t move.

For the first time, I saw a fracture in James’ mask - a muscle in his jaw that jumped, a wet glint in his eyes.

“James, I...”

“Now,” he repeated, the word laden with a pain he was trying to hide.

I ran and locked myself in my room and stayed there for the rest of the day.

…

I visited Alice late in the day. I needed to feel loved, and she was my only friend.

The aroma of coffee and new books filled the small bookshop as Alice leaned over the counter, her brown eyes fixed on me.

“Are you really going to quit your job because of that man?” Her voice trembled slightly, her hands clenching the already cold cup of coffee.

I felt a lump form in my throat. My fingers played nervously with the gold chain around my neck - a wedding present from James that felt more like a collar.

“I don’t have a choice,” I muttered, avoiding her gaze. “He’s my husband now; I have to obey him.” The words came out of my mouth bitterly, as if each syllable was a small defeat.

“But we need you here so much. You’re the soul of this place.”

Alice showed me the surrounding shelves, where I had organized every book for the last three years.

“I can take care of the reports while you find someone to replace me.”

“It won’t be the same.” Alice shook her head, an unruly curl of her red hair falling over her face.

“Alice, I’m sorry...” I hesitated, my gaze wandering to the bookshop window, where the rain was beginning to fall softly. A shiver ran down my spine as I thought about my next confession. “But I have the feeling that my marriage won’t last. He hates me and I don’t even know why.” My voice faltered on the last word, betraying the pain I was trying to hide. “And he loves another woman. I’ve seen her photos.”

Alice slammed her cup down on the counter.

“He’s an idiot. An idiot who doesn’t deserve a minute of your time.”

“I think he was hoping to marry Molly. She’s prettier and funnier than me,” I whispered, feeling the weight of this truth that I’d been carrying around for days.

Alice frowned, settling back in her chair. “Any news about your sister?”

“Eva says she’s in Paris.” My voice sounded distant at the mention of my older sister, as memories of our last conversation flashed through my mind.

“Laura,” Alice leaned forward, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret, “there’s something I don’t understand. Why did your sister run away?”

“Not to get married.” The short answer escaped my lips, bitter as gall.

She rolled her eyes, impatient.

“I know that! I didn’t understand why she didn’t want to marry James. He’s a jerk, but he’s a rich, handsome jerk. Molly loves money and luxury.”

Alice gestured with her hands, clearly frustrated by the mystery.

I bit my lip thoughtfully. “I didn’t understand it either, but I didn’t even have time to think about it.” There was something strange about this total story, a detail that had escaped me.

The sound of paper being unwrapped broke my thoughts. Alice slid a small picture frame across the counter, her eyes shining with restrained emotion.

“Here’s your wedding present.”

My hands trembled slightly as I picked it up. It was a picture of the front of a bookshop, old and charming, with large glass windows and a carved wooden door.

“What’s this?” I asked, my fingers tracing the frame of the picture frame, feeling every detail under my touch.

“The bookshop we’re going to buy when you get divorced.” Alice’s tone was firm, filled with a certainty that made me swallow.

“What’s wrong with that one?”

I ran my fingers over the image, feeling a tightness in my chest as I recognized the façade.

“Nothing.” Alice smiled, her eyes shining with that familiar enthusiasm that always appeared when we talked about our dreams. “I want to expand the business and you’ll be my partner. It was our plan all along.” His voice carried the promise of a future that seemed ever more distant.

A blue light flashed on my cell phone screen, interrupting that moment of hope. It was James.

“Where are you?”

My hands shook slightly as I typed the answer. “At the bookstore.”

His reply came almost instantly, cold and impersonal like all our interactions: “I’m having dinner with my secretary, don’t expect me and don’t bother me.”

I put my cell phone down on the counter with more force than necessary. I felt humiliated by that message and I didn’t even know why.

I am very grateful for the generous donations I received yesterday, which totaled approximately $12. It means a great deal to me.

My Samsung Galaxy A12 stopped functioning the day before yesterday. The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for the equivalent of $130 (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between $100 (8k INR) and $200 (17k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be a blessing. I have provided a BuyMeaCoffee link \[ coffee.ee/osirinyxades \], a MILAAP link \[ http://m-lp.co/aadityas-3?utm\_medium=native\_message&utm\_source=app \], and a UPI ID \[ adityasarmahdon@oksbi \] for those who wish to contribute.

Jul 15 2025
Chapter 1: The Wedding.
That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

Chapter 2: The Morning After
The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.",1,1752565117.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1m0bi11,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m0bi11/i_sent_him_back_his_sexy_selfies/,I sent him back his sexy selfies,"I literally almost never get attracted to anyone. It's super hard for me to find a person attractive. Physical beauty on its own is not enough for me and it happens to me maybe once every 2 years or less, to see and like a man and have any attraction to him. No matter how handsome/beautiful those men are.   
  
So here I am, back on facebook, after many months of not using it at all, I went in to post a little reel, that had some nice moments and myself in them.. And this guy, that I completely forgot about, the one that is clearly divinely created, cause can I just say PERFECTION .. He reacts with 5 hearts on my story. He's literally gorgeous, like a 100/10. Face, body, but the eyes... I've always loved to look into his beautiful deep eyes....  
And he's not just handsome, but quite intelligent and loves the same type of music and is bold and masculine, and loves God and has all of these bombastic fantastic traits, that combined, just make him extremely attractive to me. And super rare. For me. And I'm pretty sure for other women too, but that's not my business.  
We've chatted before, here and there, he's liked my pictures and videos before, but never overtly tried to flirt with me. Maybe slightly covertly, like 2y ago, but that's it. So after his 5 hearts, I decided to shoot him a message, to see how he's doing, where he's at, in life, you know. We've done that before so I didn't see why not. Thought it'd be a 3 line exchange and I'll go back to forgetting how handsome he is.

But this time was different, right from the get go he calls me a doll and beautiful and starts flirting with me, I'm obviously excited about it, and we have an amazing chemistry in conversation too, the humour the intelligent flirting, the lack of need to explain, cause he gets me, without even trying ah!   
It was GREAT until his flirting jokes started getting a little too .. close to sexual, and I tried to put a boundary, soft at first, then very very clear, and we kept going from flirting to benign topics, yet somehow we always came back to sexy jokes. Until I left the conversation to go grab a link of something funny to share with him, and when I came back, I came back to a selfie he sent me.. of him, shirtless, half sitting, half laying in bed. With a serious expression too! I was like ""SIR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" LOL   
It was just a selfie of his face, shoulders and up, but you know, the vibe, is too soon, too sexy, too much.   
  
So I expressed that, and told him I'm glad at least his photo was cropped. Next thing I know I have a picture of him shirtless with his full six pack smiling at me doing that biceps pose with his arm, that male models do LOL . It was shocking, but also perfect looking but also very tempting in nature, but also WHY. Like he's exactly 1000% what I LIKE. But not in our first real long conversation!!!  
It was so hard to put that boundary, especially with his soft voice, it felt like a pro seducer move from his side haha but that was way too much too early, too ...tooo tooo!  
At this point I told him I'm going to sleep and thanks for the funny and flirty conversation and sent him a funny link to checkout and we finished the 2h talk.   
For the record I didn't overstep my boundaries and nothing sexual was spoken of. I just enjoyed the beauty and his sexy voice. The rest was jokes and flirting.

I didn't expect this from someone who .. all he does is speak about God, in his life, he is sort of a public (small) figure, and all he speaks about is spirit, Jesus, God, bible etc... given the fact that one night stands type of behavior is not exactly Jesus friendly, but I'm not judging. I had fun flirting with him, but I stood my ground and didn't step on any of my boundaries. Also I'm not a 1 night stand type of a woman, so I wouldn't entertain that either way. A little flirting though, was pretty exciting, with him.

The next day came and honestly I didn't even know if I'll ever hear from him again, but I did.   
He did message me some things back and forth and this time no excessive flirting, he only said that if we were close, we'd be meeting face to face for coffee, and not just have these conversations on the phone  
 ( coffee??!?!? that's not a  date) and then enjoyed some deep spiritual topics, and I was happy about that.   
Then out of nowhere, mid voice-messages conversation, he disappeared. Stopped responding. I haven't said anything stupid, we were literally exchanging deep topics and some knowledge, then BAM... At first he didn't even open the voice messages I'd sent in response to his. The next day he'd opened them and left me on seen.  
The only thing that I can think of that I might have said is offering some knowledge about a third language that I know (and he doesn't) to talk about the symbolism of a word that he expressed wrongly, but being told more about what you know or even being corrected in something you said wrong by a native speaker, is NOT a reason to ghost someone... At least not in my book. Maybe in his ego - book though. It's not like I was rude about it or even tried to correct him, just expressed what I know, in addition to what he said. So I genuinely don't think I've said anything wrong.   
  
He's online. ALL THE TIME. He's seen my reply and has left me on seen for days now.  
I know that once we (ladies) hit the 24h it's over, so even though I decided to walk away.. I had this crazy urge, that probably no one will understand, but I had to do it for myself.   
To send him back his selfies before I walk away.   
His shirtless, perfect looking sexy selfies, that I didn't ask for.   
Send them back.   
Petty? Maybe. But not to me.   
Return them, like an unwanted, yet perfect gift,  
return that which does not belong to me, to its rightful owner. Not for attention. Not for a reply. Not for a question to answer. Just to set the record straight, for my future.  
Like an ethereal, maybe, energetic return, that was brought into my mind, my memory and has tempted me, to send it back, and disown it.   
To place it back, where it belongs.  
  
I've never returned gifts before in my adult life.  
  
It's not like he sent them for the right reasons anyway.   
He obviously just sees me as a piece of meat, with no feelings and opinions that matter to him. Clearly just wanted to cross my boundaries (yes in a sexy way, but) for his own sexual gratification, without even seeing me as a human being. And that made me feel disrespected.

So I did it. And I feel relieved!   
And I don't give a shit what he's gonna think of me anyway. Clearly he has no empathy for me, so it doesn't matter how ""crazy"" of a woman he thinks I am.

After I did it, I went back on tiktok, to unfollow him, and what do I see...   
He's shot this one video (martial arts), completely out of the ordinary (spiritual talks), just now, while ignoring me, when... we were talking about martial arts the other day, and I complemented his speed and technique and I said how much I miss kickboxing. He's not posted martial arts on his tiktok like ever or maybe at least in years. Feels like he's begging for attention and validation, while ignoring me at the same time...?   
How pathetic!   
He's even wearing one of those free the nips male ""tops"" when the other night after he sent me that freed nips photo we joked about it. He never dresses like this on this videos. It doesn't even look like a top, it just looks like a piece of fabric flying around unattended lol This is just... so strange!  
  
I'm pretty sure we'll never talk again, and he'll never know why I did what I did.

There’s a lot more but let’s leave some stuff for the chats.

We have experience in this: I’ve been the only positive three times, although pretty bad each time. We each have a  private workspace/guestroom, so when sick I holed up in my room and only went out to use the bathroom. 

I figured it would be the reverse for him, and was fully prepared to bring him meals, snacks, whatever. The first night he announces he’s going to watch the match in the living room so he can see it on the big tv instead of his iPad. I have not set foot in the living room since. First night he ate dinner in his room, but in the afternoon I saw he had left dishes in the sink from a snack. Last night he ate dinner in the kitchen. We have no openable windows in that room but he left the vent on and said it would vent the whole room in about 30 minutes. I hadn’t taken my salad yet because I’m eating in my room to avoid him and couldn’t carry an extra dish. So he ate with the salad on the table. I declined to eat food he’d been breathing on and had yogurt instead. 

Today he was up before me so he emptied the dishwasher and made the coffee. I washed my “clean” cup before using it. I washed my hands so many times making dinner last night that my hands are raw. I’m thinking I should just dine out or even check into a hotel for the duration.

He’s not an anti-vaxxer or a Covid skeptic. His mother died of Covid. I’ve had it 6 times and four of those it took me a month to recover. I’m actually scheduled to see a doctor tomorrow about my poor immune response…hopefully I don’t test positive and have to cancel.

Here’s a quick crash course on how to write intros  
  
🔹 **Option 1: The Quick Bio (aka the “Who Are They?”)**  
  
This style is clean, clear, and gets straight to the point. Include:  
Age + role  
Personality traits  
One juicy detail or habit  
  
Example:  
\> Kael is a 27-year-old tactician — cold, precise, and secretly loyal to a fault. He never goes anywhere without his brass pocketwatch… or his exit plan.  
  
🔹 **Option 2: The Scene Drop (aka “Show, Don’t Tell”)**  
  
Drop the user straight into a moment — like the start of a novel or a movie.  
  
Example:  
\> The pretty guy who works as a mechanic in your father’s workshop.  
Your brother left you at his best friend’s apartment while he ""runs out for a bit""… and now you’re alone with someone who hasn’t looked up from his engine once.  
Or:  
\> She stood barefoot in the hallway, holding a coffee mug that didn’t belong to her. “Don’t ask,” she said, already walking past you. You weren’t sure whether to laugh or lock your door.

A complete novice when it comes to using an espresso machine. I recently bought a Sage Bambino and having trouble with the output volume. I have dialled it in to put through 1 fl oz of water for a single shot and 2 fl oz for a double.

Also, the flow of shot itself seems a bit too watery. How to fix this?

I (35f) 'm currently in a relationship that's been going on for a year and a half. We're not officially engaged yet, but we've already bought an engagement ring. And I'm at crossroads, wondering whether I should stay and try harder or leave.

He's a good person, He has many strengths. He's responsible, kind when he wants to be, like he makes coffee in the morning for me, and nice to my family. Overall an amazing guy.

But the emotional connection I long for just isn't there. Instead of offering empathy, he often jumps straight into explaining his intentions. This has been a long-standing issue in our relationship.

Because of that, I feel like my emotions often remain unresolved. And every time I try to talk about how I feel, he gets more exhausted and he feels like I complain too much. Over time, the dynamic between us has started to turn unhealthy as we both are very emotional people. We're both drained, both feeling like our efforts go unrecognized. He loves me so much and I do too. I really don't want to blame him at all.

We're stuck in this exhausting cycle: intense emotional fights, followed by a few calm days, then back to conflict again. We've both tried, really tried, but it doesn't feel like anything is fundamentally improving. The idea of continuing to ""work on it"" feels suffocating and I am tired of being accused of not working for our relationship when I feel like I tried too hard and I am exhausted. And yet, the thought of breaking up and possibly regretting, and to be honest, to move out and tell people that I failed again, terrifies me.

I am

  
***I was the firelight of musical notes and sounds***

***That danced behind closed eyes***

***And lulled me to sleep and sweet dreams.***



I am a tear-soaked pillowcase

And grief-stricken screams that wake me,

The sound of the violin still ringing in my ears.



***I was the flow from energy unleashed,***

***The rush from a runner’s high,***

***The stream of air powering my sun salutations.***

***I was a mountain; a warrior.***

***I was strength and power itself.***

***My movement could stop time.***



I am endless hours passing by,

Dissociating on the kitchen tiles,

A still body surrounded by corpses, waiting to be dragged into the grave.

I am a zealous mind starved of praise and validation,

Driven mad by staring at white walls and ceilings for too long.



***I was famous for baking profiteroles, éclairs,***

***And layered cakes with tempered, glossy chocolate.***

***I was in a strings orchestra.***

***I was an actress.***

***I was fit, with an amazing body.***

***I was going to maintain that youthful body into my forties.***



I am attempted pastry, cracking in the oven.

I am a painting only half done by trembling hands.

I am amateur poetry.

I am case notes unfinished; reports too painful to type.

I am only ten minutes of piano playing

Before the pain and fatigue sets in.Still, I am tireless efforts persisting with a gratitude list—

Gratitude for the mobility in my legs,

For my work, for my independence, for my heart.

I am desperate chants and the hope to believe.

*“I am grateful to have a house.*

*I am grateful to not be in war.*

*I am grateful to be alive.”*

I am grateful…but still, I want to die.



***I was the first name on your lips when you needed someone***

***To speak, to write, to teach, to inspire.***

***I was the competence others envied.***

***I was the ambition they admired.***

***I was reliable.***



I am smiling when I meet you for coffee.

I am panic attacks and tears behind closed doors,

A body in pain, rolling on the carpet; throwing up in the toilet.

I am an apology for missing an event,

An overused excuse that has passed its expiration date.

I am letting everyone down.



***I was a thousand matches on a dating app.***

***I was the elated passion in a young girl’s voice***

***And light dancing in her eyes as she spoke about what she loved.***

***I was endless possibilities of what I could do, bake, and offer.***

***I was a beautiful bride.***

***I was a killer girlfriend.***

***I was a domestic goddess in the kitchen.***

***I was talent and creativity you could drink in and brag about.***

***I was on the same page as you in life.***

***I was your future, full of certainty.***

***He told me, “I was special.”***



I am a mastered yoga pose,

Bent in the shower for your pleasure.

I am too useless and uninteresting to be with.

There is no certainty with me,

And I am too much of a liability to marry.

But I am still loved for my body.



***I was their pride and joy,***

***The one they bragged about in letters and events,***

***The proof that my parents did “something right,”***

***The proof of what tough love and a healthy dose of trauma can produce.***



I am a reminder of your death

Because I show you that life is ever fleeting.

I frighten you.

So I am the victim of your accusations and lectures—

A stream of assaults on what I have done and what I should have done

To avoid this horrendous fate.

Nonetheless, I remind you of the power and freedom you have to lose,

***And I frighten you.***



I am the misery that has aged my parents a decade.

I am the reason they will die soon.

I am the sister too difficult for anyone to tolerate.

I am the reason nobody wants to speak to me.

I am not trying hard enough.

I need to be better.



***I was kindness and compassion, unbound.***

***I was the space held for others.***

***I was the patient pause, given to others, taken before I spoke.***

***I was perfect grades and a CV that could not do my potential justice.***

***I was guaranteed to get anything and everything I applied for.***

***I was amazing.***

***I was everything.***



*“I am enough,”*

I desperately whisper into the darkness.

The demon comes to wrestle with my thoughts once more.

*“Can I be enough?”*

I am long, painful hours of debating, analyzing, and defusing.

I am tears of defeat when it finally wins.

**I am nothing.**



***I was the talented and creative girl he loved and wanted.***

***I was the therapist that mentored and inspired.***

***I was the kind daughter.***

***I was the interesting and fun friend,***

***With a never-ending well of empathy.***



I am the psychologist that could have been.

I am the wife that has nothing to offer.

I am missed careers and opportunities.

I am talent, nurtured and wasted

I am a never ending list of what ‘was’ and ‘used to be’

*I am wasted potential.*



I am trying my best.

***And*** ***I am still deserving of love.***

I am the reminder that we do not always get what we deserve.

I am the cruelties of life, reflected.



***I was the balance of career drive and self-care, perfected***

***I was the passion and love found in hobbies, people, and helping others.***

***I was love for life itself.***



Now, I am loved and left for nothing

He doesn't work exactly at our department but comes to few meetings here and there. From the first time I saw him I felt this strong attraction, both emotionally and physically. He seemed warm, open, kind.  I developed a crush for limerence as few people call it.

I finally took up the courage to add him on facebook and ask him out for a coffee and he said yes. I met him last saturday and i was so excited. The conversation was going well when he said he had never been in a relationship and that he is avoidant. (He is also a psychologist), he also mentions he doesn't like the responsibility that comes with having kids and showed me a tattoo of him where it was written ""Leave me Alone"". Then he mentions he has ADHD and that he is gay. Also he is moving to another city by December for maybe next year. 

I was so shocked and disappointed by all that. The image I had of him shattered. He saw me being surprised by him saying he was gay and told me he thought it was obvious and I said I didn't see that and that I liked him romantically. He said he felt guilty, and I could see at that point that he showed compassion. He said I was a pretty woman and that had he not been gay, he would have dated me. By the end of the meeting he gave me a hug and left. I saw him at work and he didn't say anything to me and haven't texted me since.

A part of me is grieving, specially that the mental image I had of him when I was in limerence is not there anymore. He never existed. A part of me wants him to text me, but also I wish I never saw him again so I could move on. I have been feeling so down and sad and disappointed. ",1,1752563413.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So my money is on that.....garments being a second thing that will be soon deemphasized as soon as the boomers have all died off.  

They claim inspiration but they just want to keep people controlled and happy and paying tithing

...

I just had an idea for a way to stimulate social connection in physical environments like a bar or a board game group or a brewery or some shit where there is some kind of app or some kind of method where you can connect with other cellular devices by having your settings turned on to other devices within like I don't know 500 feet of yourself and then it is like a shared chat room that you can talk about your mind or block or ignore users or private message users and so the idea would be you speak your emotional truth and those people that are within 500 feet of you that like what you are saying might respond to you in the public chat or might private message you and you could even offer to buy them a beer or some shit to talk in person once you feel you have emotionally vetted them kind of shit

...

LMAO are you saying this is like Pokemon Go but like instead of catching pixels on a screen you are having chat zones or some shit where it's like you can talk to anyone within like 500 feet or maybe 1000 feet but in your local area where you know that if there is resonance you can invite them to like have a sandwich or have a coffee or have a beer at a nearby establishment But the people aren't so far away that if you click they have to get in their car and drive 30 miles or some shit

...

And then before people start saying what about the creepers or some shit each person needs to upload a photocopy of their ID to the fucking app before they can use it or some shit I guess but then on the other hand why would people be so idiotic to blindly trust some rando texting them about buying people beer without talking to them on a deeper level first kind of shit and also of course when you sign up for the account your phone is kept track of so there could be several layers of security if needed... also you can Set visibility as well and you don't have to give your exact location until you consent to it so there could be multiple settings regarding how much data you will present to others in the chat and you could avoid chatting completely and just send private messages to have personal conversations with others about things they have talked about without announcing your conversations to everybody in the entire room kind of thing",1,1752562772.0,EmotionalLARPing,4,1.0,False
1m0axdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m0axdy/trembling/,Trembling,"These are nine songs from a debut album I’m still working on, called Trembling.

The music’s coming - but the words arrived first.  
They came honestly and quietly. 
I offer them the same way.  
I don’t do this for a living, I have no background in the arts, and have never shared my work in this manner.
 
All I ask, is that you read them like you would look at an old photograph:  softly, in silence, if only just for a few moments.  Thank you.



TREMBLING 




**1. 'TIL MY TIME RUNS OUT**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

I never thought of growing old  
I never thought I'd watch the fold  
Of skin, of days, of sky and grace  
I lived too fast to face my face  

But then you came, and time grew near  
Not sharp, but soft, not grave, but clear  
You let me see what years could hold  
A quiet room, your hand to hold  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til my breath is spare,  
'Til my bones fall deep  
Into disrepair  

Let the clocks run south,  
Let the body tear,  
I don't mind, I don't care  
You're my can't without  
'Til my time runs out.  

**VERSE 2**

I never dreamt of thinning hair  
Of pills in cups or porchlight prayer  
Of leaning more than I once stood  
Of being seen and being good  

But now I wish for every pain  
That comes from loving you again  
The slippers worn, the kettle's sigh  
The mornings where we're eye to eye  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til the blade grows dull  
'Til the moon casts doubt  
On the beautiful  

'Til my hands can't feel  
'Til my limbs are peeled  
You're my only route  
'Til my time runs out  

**VERSE 3**

No choir waits, no gates of gold  
Just wrinkled hands I long to hold  
A whisper clothed in linen's weight  
Your shoulder bowed beside the gate  

And if I break before the end  
I pray to break where you begin  
To fall, to kneel, to be remade  
Within the furnace of your shade  

**CHORUS**

'Til my time runs out  
'Til my spine is thread  
'Til the sky forgets  
What the thunder said  

'Til my time runs out  
'Til the curtains fade  
'Til I'm just the sound  
That your memory made  

You're my vow, my drought,  
My wine, my bread  
I am yours, devout  
'Til my time runs out  

**VERSE 4**

I used to want the flame, the flight  
Not this slow grace of shared goodnight  
But now I crave the softer ache  
The soup we spill, the pills we take  

The wrinkled sheets, the morning cough  
The cardigan you never wash  
The way you laugh with only eyes  
The truth that outlives all disguise  

**CHORUS**

'Til my pain has mouth  
'Til my lungs won't fill  
And the stars burn out  
On my windowsill  

I will keep your light,  
'Til the sun unwrites  
You're my can't without  
'Til my time runs out.  

**BRIDGE**

I never dreamed of age or end  
But now I hope to just descend  
Through dusk and doubt, through loss and truth  
A pilgrim held  
in the arms  
of you  

**OUTRO**

You're my time  
You're my last  
You're the thing  
I meant to ask  

But never said  
And now I do  
I want to spend  
What's left  
with you  

You're not my fate  
You're not my proof  
You are my soul  
When it tells the truth

**2. I TO YOU & YOU TO I**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

You came that fall  
when light was thin  
Curtains drawn,  
the hush came in  

I had two hearts  
still sore with doubt  
You kissed their crowns,  
you washed them out  

No flowers thrown, no reasons why  
Just I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 2**

You moved in slow,  
with thyme and thread  
Lit up the lamp,  
unmade the bed  

You swept the dark  
into a pile  
You braided silence,  
made it smile  

No ring, no vow, no wedding cry  
Just I to you and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I tried to bring you sky in spoons  
I sang your name through empty rooms  
I built a boat from broken pine  
And held it up like it was fine  

I caught the stars  
but they slipped by  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 3**

My children knew you  
not by name  
But by the way  
you blessed their shame  

They brought you drawings,  
you brought them calm  
You sang in thread,  
you preached in balm  

No mother's robe, no alibi  
Just I to you and you to I  

No mother's badge, no need to try  
Just I to you and you to I  

**VERSE 4**

No crown you wore,  
no war you fought  
You mended what  
the world forgot  

You made the porch  
a sacred place  
You brewed the tea,  
you blessed the grace  

No altar lit, no angels nigh  
Just I to you and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I tried to carve your sleep in gold  
I kissed your feet when nights grew cold  
I brought you bells that wouldn't ring  
I dressed your hurt in linen things  

I came with hands,  
not wings to fly  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**BRIDGE**

I loved you, not for grace,  
Nor for the light behind your face.  
I loved you like the earth loves rain  
No reason, and no right to claim.  

I vowed to pour your every need  
Into a bowl my hands would feed  
But breath grew thin and shoulders shy  
Still I to you, and you to I  
Still I to you, and you to I  

**VERSE 5**

I brought you pearls  
from basement shelves  
I sang you songs  
I wrote myself  

I tried with all I had to give  
To build the life you'd want to live  
The fruit went soft, the well ran dry  
But not your gaze and not your sky  

Your love for me refused to die  
Just I to you, and you to I  

**CHORUS**

I laid your name in fields of rye  
I built a quilt of lullaby  
I failed to give what kings could not  
But still you stayed, and still you sought  

My reach fell short, but not my try  
Still I to you and you to I  
Still I to you and you to I  

**OUTRO**

No god was carved  
No myth was tied  
No golden law  
No serpent guide  

No veil was torn  
No voice replied  
Just I to you  
and you to I  

The world moves on,  
the stars go blind.  
I leave this truth,  
not sealed, but signed:  

We stayed. We gave.  
We said goodbye.  
Just I to you  
and you to I.  

So tell them this when I am done:  
I loved one woman. Only one.  
No savior came. From up on high.  
Just I to You & You to I  

---


**3. TRAMPOLINE**  
*(for Liya)*

**VERSE 1**

There will be a night when I am gone  
no soft goodbye, no light left on.  
You'll touch the chair, the book I read,  
the coat that held my thinning thread.  

You'll search the rooms I left behind,  
find ash where once you looked for mind.  
But love is not a voice or face  
it lives in how you leave a place.  

**VERSE 2**

I was not a steady man.  
I made no maps. I broke the plan.  
But you were light and rope and wheel  
you taught me what I could not feel.  

Where I would vanish, be still, stay  
Where I would curse, learn to pray.  
Where I was small, rise and grow  
I could not lead, do not follow.  

**CHORUS**

My winter crown,  
My falling down,  
My soft ravine.  

My winged ascent,  
My sacrament,  
My canopy.  

My midnight sail,  
My comet's tail,  
My holy key  

My untied rope,  
My arc, my hope,  
My trampoline.  

**VERSE 3**

Say little when the world shouts loud.  
Don't plant your flag in every crowd.  
Make gentleness your kind of bold.  
Let wisdom be the hand you hold.  

Refuse the crown that shuns the weight.  
Forgive too soon, don't love too late.  
And when they mock your heart's true song,  
sing higher still, sing until they're gone.  

Kneel beside the parts I broke  
Give them names, give them oak.  
And where I tried to hide the loss,  
Kiss the flaws, wear the cross.  

**CHORUS**

My angel's kneel  
My sword made shield  
My Saladin  

My holy rite  
My second light  
My offering  

My thunder spark  
My lift from dark  
My trampoline  

My mother's height  
My northern lights  
My trampoline.  

**VERSE 4**

So let them build their towers tall  
You'll know the truth that splits them all:  

what rises up must rise in grace,  
and never seek the higher place.  
You'll love a man, and break apart  
You'll hold your child like precious art  

You'll speak to God and hear no sound  
You'll build a truth from empty ground  
When sorrow comes, as sorrow will  
don't chase the echo, keep the still  

Let mourning be a kind of song  
not proof of loss, but proof of long.  
And when they come to weigh my story,  
and the hourglass runs thin,  
tell them I was just a shadow  

that your light invited in  

**CHORUS**

My winter fire,  
My perfect choir,  
My Nazarene  

My kite's lapel  
My citadel  
My heart's serene  

My trembling wings  
My echoing  
My love made steam  

My joy, my girl  
My whole, my world  
My trampoline

5.

THE WAY DREAMERS DO 
(for Kaiyaan)
VERSE 

They laid you down in my arms,
still wet with God, still free from harm.
Your breath was small, your silence wide
a sea I couldn't step inside.

Your fingers moved, a kind of hymn,
the light bent softly at the rim.
And I stood dumb, without a claim
too close to love to speak its name.

You found my hand, you held it fast
as if we'd always shared a past.
You were made of light, you knew
the weight I couldn't hide from you.

I made you promises I feared,
They came out cracked, they disappeared.
But every vow, though worn and thin,
was how your father let you in.

CHORUS

When the stars seem distant
And your wings feel too thin
When the gates are all golden
But they won't let you in

I will lift up the heavens
If it tears me in two
Just to watch you keep climbing
The way dreamers do

VERSE 

I pray you choose the harder grace
to stand when fear would take your place.
To give when giving makes you bleed.
To plant kindness like a seed.

To be what I could never be
less bound by shame, more openly.
To walk into the storm and stay
with quiet strength and no display

VERSE 

Be kind when no one writes it down.
Be loyal in a faithless town.
Let mercy be your only boast.
Let love remain when hope is lost.

Don't measure good by what it pays.
Don't count the nights. Just walk the days.
If the only gold that ever stays
is what you give, then give it away.

CHORUS

When they say that you're foolish
For the size of your hope
When you climb past the treetops
With your soul tied to rope

I'll be whispering steady
Through the branches and blue
As you grow into thunder
The way dreamers do

VERSE 

Now when you speak, the sky comes near.
You bring the dark, but not the fear.
And I, who chased a thousand stars,
just watch you rise, right where you are

And you stand where I once stood
but taller, kinder, twice as good.
You speak the words I never found,
and lay them gently on the ground.

I held you like a question
Now you hold me like a door
And where I used to lead your steps
You lead me somewhere more

CHORUS

When your dreams make you lonely
And they don't understand
When the stars feel too fragile
To hold in your hand

I'll be holding the silence
Til it sings just for you
And you'll walk into wonder
The way dreamers

OUTRO

When my hands are forgotten
And my voice is just dust
When the ledger is closed
And the iron has rusted

Remember this promise
I lived to lift you
To the heights of your longing
The way dreamers do


**6. NO OTHER WAY**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

My heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe  
You walk. It hums, It follows you  
No other place For it to beat  
No other home than at your feet  

**VERSE 2**

A kiss was once a place to hide.  
A bed was just the other side.  
I never knew what morning meant.  
Always gone before it spent.  

I wore some names I wore some coats  
I burned like wool I sank like boats,  
The dreams I sang were songs to sleep  
No cradle ever held them deep.  

But you - you stood like something true.  
I turned away. As I used to.  
I feared the place where longing goes.  
I knew your name I chose the road.  

**VERSE 3**

You waited like the sky waits rain  
and all my longing turned to flame.  
Now every lie I ever kissed  
burns like sugar on your wrist.  

**CHORUS**

Love, take this ring it's not for show.  
It's what I found when I let go  
It's what I earned for all the pain  
A kind of grace A holy stain  
It isn't gold. It doesn't shine.  
It only fits your hand in mine.  
No other way, No other way  
To get to you, no other way  

**VERSE 4**

Take this hand. It's out of tune.  
It held the knife. It touched the moon.  
It shook like sin but not today.  
It's waited long for this, to say:  

**CHORUS**

I've nothing left I need to prove.  
But now I know what hands can move.  
No other way, No other way  
No other thread. No finer line.  
My heart, a flower you made mine  
To press between your book of days,  
or let it blow in other ways.  

**VERSE 5**

I think of us, old, bent and slow.  
Your silver hair, the window's glow.  
My fingers cold, your laugh, a bell.  
We fall asleep. We fall so well.  

**CHORUS**

No other way. No other sound.  
No sweeter ache than what we found.  
No other way. No final sky.  
Just you and me—and what won't die  

**OUTRO**

No other way, No other way  
To get to you, no other way

**7. THERE IS**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

Mountains used to hold me  
Like a mother holds a child  
Now they crumble into shadows  
And the road runs lonesome, wild  

But your love remains like moonlight  
On the backs of trembling waves  
And if there's a God, He wrote your name  
In the marrow of my days  

**CHORUS**

And this love has grown so deep  
It wakes me from my sleep  
Just to whisper this:  

""In your love there is  
All the heaven above  
All the truth, all the love""  

**VERSE 2**

I walked through hollow chapels  
Let the echoes be my call  
But I never heard salvation  
Like your footsteps down the hall  

Oh, your body was Jerusalem  
When I had nowhere to stand  
And if there's a God, He placed your hand  
In mine, not to command  

Not to save me, nor enslave me  
Just to help me understand…  

**CHORUS**

This love has grown so deep  
It wakes me from my sleep  
Just to whisper this:  

""In your love there is  
All the heaven above  
All the truth, all the love""  

**BRIDGE**

And if there's a God, He never showed me  
Never sent the rain in sheets  
Never played a chord upon me  
Never danced between the streets  
Not to move me, not to mould me  
Not to name the love I keep  
Just left me by your window  
To watch you fall asleep…  

**OUTRO**

I don't deserve your kindness  
That's why it's holy, I suppose  
In the darkness of my blindness  
Your light is all I've come to know  

---

**8. AIR.**  
*(for Kait)*

I was dust in the hall  
Silent and small  
Before your sweet love  

My heart so bone thin,  
Just a ghost haunting skin  
Until your sweet love  

You were shelter and shrine  
Where the holy things shine  
My sacred sweet love  

In the sweep of your hand,  
I was dust turned to man,  
Knelt to sweet love  

Raised to the sky,  
pulled to the light,  
of your sweet love.  

We'll dance on the sands  
Waves in our hands,  
Endless sweet love  

Til my days come undone  
In the threads of the sun  
Burn me sweet love  

When I'm nothing but light  
In the last stretch of night  
Hold me, sweet love  

When the world breaks in two  
As only worlds do  
Release me, sweet love  

When roots hold my bones  
And my flesh is unsewn  
Know this sweet love:  

That though I be gone  
As dust to the dawn  

Our love will be air,  
Everywhere, everywhere

**9. TESTIFY**  
*(for Kait)*

**VERSE 1**

Morning through the screen door,  
Coffee steam rising slow  
Your hands around your blue mug,  
Like roots beneath the snow.  

And every little sparrow,  
Since the day we met,  
Has been singing something holy,  
I can't forget.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Every breath, every light,  
Every shadow in the night,  

I testify, I testify.  

**VERSE 2**

To the way you fold the sheets,  
How your bare feet meet,  
The wooden floor at dawn,  

Like deer through morning fields,  
Like time when it yields,  
Soft and strong.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Every ache, every wound  
That brought me to your room  

I testify, I testify.  

**VERSE 3**

To the dust motes in the window,  
Paint peeling on the sill,  
To the way you make them wait,  
When you feed the dogs so still.  

To the twilight that will take my voice,  
To the autumn leaves of gold,  
Love is written in the silence  
Like a story never told.  

**BRIDGE**

Between the tooth and tongue of time,  
Between the mountain and the pine,  
Between the creature and the road,  
I lay my heart in your hands to hold.  

And when they ask what saves us,  
From the spinning dark of night,  
I'll tell them how you showed me,  
That love invents the light.  

**CHORUS**

I testify, I testify,  
To my love, oh my love.  
Your love, so warm and wide  
Tears the sky, with holy light  

I testify, I testify.  

**OUTRO**

And I'll testify, and testify,  
For all my life…

We've had dinner a few times, sharing desserts and having walks, things like that. Nothing that romantic, no touching or flirting (I'm bad at it and she's super shy). Good conversation, we have very similar values and hobbies.

My problem is I'm the one making all the plans. She will always happily chat to me if I approach her at work, she'll text back quickly (even if we're both pretty dry texters), and she always agrees to meet up, even if she can't do the suggested day she'll offer an alternative. Basically, other than the fact I always initiate contact, we're getting along great.

Or am I just being paranoid? Am I overthinking it?

And then theres' the other problem I have - I don't think she has any romantic interest in me, at least not at the moment. First meetup was just ""for coffee and lunch"" and went pretty well. Second time I specifically asked if she'd want to go on a date or just as friends, and she said she wanted to go as friends. We still had a great time.

I'm probably being delusional but I didn't take it as a ""forever no"", especially since we still hang out. She was giving me signs that I might have misinterpreted, or not? I did probably use the term ""date"" too early, we didn't really know each other that well at that point. Or it could be a statement of ""no, never"". I didn't ask.

## Key Features Analysis

The crucial features of a small courier bag determine its usability, durability, and overall value.

**Size and Capacity:** The ideal small courier bag strikes a balance between compactness and storage space. Look for dimensions that comfortably accommodate everyday essentials like a tablet, wallet, phone, keys, and perhaps a small notebook or water bottle. Capacity is usually measured in liters, with most small courier bags ranging from 5 to 10 liters.

**Material and Durability:** The quality of the materials used in a courier bag substantially impacts its longevity and resistance to wear and tear. Common materials include nylon, polyester, canvas, and occasionally leather or waxed canvas. Nylon and polyester offer excellent water resistance and abrasion resistance, while canvas provides a classic aesthetic and durability. Reinforcements at stress points, such as seams and strap attachments, are crucial for ensuring long-term reliability.

**Compartments and Association:** A well-designed courier bag features multiple compartments and pockets to keep your belongings organized and easily accessible. A main compartment is essential, along with smaller pockets for phones, keys, and other small items. Internal dividers and padded compartments can protect delicate items like tablets or laptops.Exterior zippered pockets offer speedy access to frequently used items.

**Strap and Closure System:** The strap system should be adjustable and cozy to wear for extended periods. Padded shoulder straps and cross-body straps distribute weight evenly and prevent strain. The closure system can consist of buckles, zippers, Velcro, or a combination of these. Buckles offer secure closure, zippers provide weather protection, and Velcro allows for quick access.

**Weather Resistance:** The ability to protect your belongings from rain and moisture is a crucial consideration, especially for those who commute or work outdoors. Water-resistant materials, such as treated nylon or polyester, are essential. Water-resistant zippers and sealed seams provide additional protection. Some bags include integrated rain covers for added security in heavy downpours.

**Style and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the style and aesthetics of a courier bag are also vital considerations.Courier bags are available in a wide range of colors, designs, and materials to suit personal preferences and professional requirements. More minimalist designs favor practical features over eye-catching design.

Key features of a small courier bag include:

* durable Material Construction
* Weather Resistant Materials
* Smart Organizational Compartments
* Comfortable, Adjustable Straps
* Secure and Reliable Closure Systems

She was the first person I came out to, in the car on the way to a musical. I was so scared she'd be disappointed in me but she just bought me Starbucks instead. She's the reason I even like coffee.

(Model: 2018 Corolla LE, purchased 6 months ago) Just want to share my experience with HKZ custom-fit seat covers since I see folks asking about seat protection here. As a dad with two kids and a golden retriever, my Corolla’s fabric seats were getting destroyed by juice spills, muddy paws, and cracker crumbs. These covers solved three big issues: Key Benefits I’ve Noticed:

Waterproof & Stain Resistance: The non-absorbent material (HKZ calls it ""AquaShield"") actually works. Last week my coffee cup leaked – wiped it clean in 10 seconds with no residue. Dog drool? Same thing.

Real Seat Protection: The heavy-duty padding isn’t just for comfort. It prevents scratches from my kids’ backpacks and dog claws. Original seats look brand new underneath.

Comfort Upgrade: Surprised by the breathability. No more sweaty back in summer, and the textured surface keeps you from sliding around.

Budget Interior Refresh: Went with charcoal gray (matte finish). Makes my beige interior look modern without permanent changes. Friends thought I got new seats. Why Choose HKZ Specifically?

Perfect Toyota Fit: Snug on bolsters and headrests (no sagging after 6 months).

Safety First: Pre-cut airbag compatibility – verified when my side airbag deployed after a fender bender last month (everyone’s fine!).

Easy Maintenance: Hose them down or wipe with damp cloth. Still looks new after weekly cleanings. Who Should Consider These: •  Parents/Pet owners  •  Commuters (no more worrying about lunch spills)  •  Anyone wanting to extend their Corolla’s seat life  •  People seeking affordable interior upgrades   Fair Note: Took 25 mins to install properly – watch their YouTube tutorial. Not luxury leather, but for $139? Zero regrets. Verdict: If you need functional protection that doesn’t look cheap, HKZ is worth it. Saved me from $800+ reupholstery quotes.

1m0asc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/angelinvestors/comments/1m0asc1/unique_laundry_shop_café_concept_sandbox_tractors/,Unique Laundry Shop + Café Concept + SandBox Tractors,"I'm currently looking for an investor to help bring a unique business concept to life a combination laundry shop, café, and a fun activity area featuring a sandbox with remote-controlled tractors that dads, kids, or even moms can enjoy while waiting for their laundry or sipping coffee.

We were inspired by similar coffee shop concepts that are already successful in Middle Eastern countries. However, this combination of a laundry shop and café, with an added entertainment element, hasn't been done in the Philippines yet. We could be the first to introduce it here.

I have experience running my own laundry shop, where we earned an average of ₱6,000 per day, depending on location. That translates to ₱180,000 to ₱220,000 monthly revenue with a 70% profit margin just from laundry services alone.

What I’ve noticed is that many laundry businesses rely heavily on pickups and deliveries. With this new concept, we can attract more walk-in customers by giving them a reason to visit the shop, stay, and enjoy their time. The sandbox with remote-controlled tractors will be a fun attraction, especially for families, and it sets us apart from traditional laundry services.

I believe this concept is unique enough to be registered or trademarked in the Philippines, potentially giving us legal protection and even licensing opportunities if others want to replicate the idea.

On top of that, I’m a digital marketing specialist by profession, so you wouldn’t need to hire a separate marketer. I can handle the branding, advertising, and online presence to ensure the business gains traction quickly.

1m0aror,https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelInvesting/comments/1m0aror/laundry_shop_café_concept_sandbox_tractors/,Laundry Shop + Café Concept + SandBox Tractors,"I'm currently looking for an investor to help bring a unique business concept to life a combination laundry shop, café, and a fun activity area featuring a sandbox with remote-controlled tractors that dads, kids, or even moms can enjoy while waiting for their laundry or sipping coffee.

We were inspired by similar coffee shop concepts that are already successful in Middle Eastern countries. However, this combination of a laundry shop and café, with an added entertainment element, hasn't been done in the Philippines yet. We could be the first to introduce it here.

I have experience running my own laundry shop, where we earned an average of ₱6,000 per day, depending on location. That translates to ₱180,000 to ₱220,000 monthly revenue with a 70% profit margin just from laundry services alone.

What I’ve noticed is that many laundry businesses rely heavily on pickups and deliveries. With this new concept, we can attract more walk-in customers by giving them a reason to visit the shop, stay, and enjoy their time. The sandbox with remote-controlled tractors will be a fun attraction, especially for families, and it sets us apart from traditional laundry services.

I believe this concept is unique enough to be registered or trademarked in the Philippines, potentially giving us legal protection and even licensing opportunities if others want to replicate the idea.

On top of that, I’m a digital marketing specialist by profession, so you wouldn’t need to hire a separate marketer. I can handle the branding, advertising, and online presence to ensure the business gains traction quickly.

It’s me, Margaret. We’re moving today. I’m so scared God. I’ve never lived anywhere but here. Suppose I hate my new school? Suppose everybody there hates me? Please help me God. Don’t let New Jersey be too horrible. Thank you.  
  
  We moved on the Tuesday before Labor Day. I knew what the weather was like the second I got up. I knew because I caught my mother sniffing under her arms. She always does that when it’s hot and humid, to make sure her deodorant’s working. I don’t use deodorant yet. I don’t think people start to smell bad until they’re at least twelve. So I’ve still got a few months to go.  
  
  I was really surprised when I came home from camp and found out our New York apartment had been rented to another family and that we owned a house in Farbrook, New Jersey. First of all I never even heard of Farbrook. And second of all, I’m not usually left out of important family decisions.  
  
  But when I groaned, “Why New Jersey?” I was told, “Long Island is too social—Westchester is too expensive—and Connecticut is too inconvenient.”  
  
  So Farbrook, New Jersey it was, where my father could commute to his job in Manhattan, where I could go to public school, and where my mother could have all the grass, trees and flowers she ever wanted. Except I never knew she wanted that stuff in the first place.  
  
  The new house is on Morningbird Lane. It isn’t bad. It’s part brick, part wood. The shutters and front door are painted black. Also, there is a very nice brass knocker. Every house on our new street looks a lot the same. They are all seven years old. So are the trees.  
  
  I think we left the city because of my grandmother, Sylvia Simon. I can’t figure out any other reason for the move. Especially since my mother says Grandma is too much of an influence on me. It’s no big secret in our family that Grandma sends me to summer camp in New Hampshire. And that she enjoys paying my private school tuition (which she won’t be able to do any more because now I’ll be going to public school). She even knits me sweaters that have labels sewed inside saying MADE EXPRESSLY FOR YOU … BY GRANDMA.  
  
  And she doesn’t do all that because we’re poor. I know for a fact that we’re not. I mean, we aren’t rich but we certainly have enough. Especially since I’m an only child. That cuts way down on food and clothes. I know this family that has seven kids and every time they go to the shoe store it costs a bundle. My mother and father didn’t plan for me to be an only child, but that’s the way it worked out, which is fine with me because this way I don’t have anybody around to fight.  
  
  Anyhow, I figure this house-in-New-Jersey business is my parents’ way of getting me away from Grandma. She doesn’t have a car, she hates buses and she thinks all trains are dirty. So unless Grandma plans to walk, which is unlikely, I won’t be seeing much of her. Now some kids might think, who cares about seeing a grandmother? But Sylvia Simon is a lot of fun, considering her age, which I happen to know is sixty. The only problem is she’s always asking me if I have boyfriends and if they’re Jewish. Now that is ridiculous because number one I don’t have boyfriends. And number two what would I care if they’re Jewish or not?

  We hadn’t been in the new house more than an hour when the doorbell rang. I answered. It was this girl in a bathing suit.  
  
  “Hi,” she said. “I’m Nancy Wheeler. The real estate agent sent out a sheet on you. So I know you’re Margaret and you’re in sixth grade. So am I.”  
  
  I wondered what else she knew.  
  
  “It’s plenty hot, isn’t it?” Nancy asked.  
  
  “Yes,” I agreed. She was taller than me and had bouncy hair. The kind I’m hoping to grow. Her nose turned up so much I could look right into her nostrils.  
  
  Nancy leaned against the door. “Well, you want to come over and go under the sprinklers?”  
  
  “I don’t know. I’ll have to ask.”  
  
  
  “Okay. I’ll wait.”  
  
  I found my mother with her rear end sticking out of a bottom kitchen cabinet. She was arranging her pots and pans.  
  
  “Hey Mom. There’s a girl here who wants to know if I can go under her sprinklers?”  
  
  “If you want to,” my mother said.  
  
  “I need my bathing suit,” I said.  
  
  “Gads, Margaret! I don’t know where a bathing suit is in this mess.”  
  
  I walked back to the front door and told Nancy, “I can’t find my bathing suit.”  
  
  “You can borrow one of mine,” she said.  
  
  “Wait a second,” I said, running back to the kitchen. “Hey Mom. She says I can wear one of hers. Okay?”  
  
  “Okay,” my mother mumbled from inside the cabinet. Then she backed out. She spit her hair out of her face. “What did you say her name was?”  
  
  “Umm … Wheeler. Nancy Wheeler.”  
  
  “Okay. Have a good time,” my mother said.  
  
  Nancy lives six houses away, also on Morningbird Lane. Her house looks like mine but the brick is painted white and the front door and shutters are red.  
  
  “Come on in,” Nancy said.  
  
  I followed her into the foyer, then up the four stairs leading to the bedrooms. The first thing I noticed about Nancy’s room was the dressing table with the heartshaped mirror over it. Also, everything was very neat.  
  
  When I was little I wanted a dressing table like that. The kind that’s wrapped up in a fluffy organdy skirt. I never got one though, because my mother likes tailored things.  
  
  Nancy opened her bottom dresser drawer. “When’s your birthday?” she asked.  
  
  “March,” I told her.  
  
  “Great! We’ll be in the same class. There are three sixth grades and they arrange us by age. I’m April.”  
  
  “Well, I don’t know what class I’m in but I know it’s Room Eighteen. They sent me a lot of forms to fill out last week and that was printed on all of them.”  
  
  “I told you we’d be together. I’m in Room Eighteen too.” Nancy handed me a yellow bathing suit. “It’s clean,” she said. “My mother always washes them after a wearing.”  
  
  “Thank you,” I said, taking the suit. “Where should I change?”  
  
  Nancy looked around the room. “What’s wrong with here?”  
  
  “Nothing,” I said. “I don’t mind if you don’t mind.”  
  
  “Why should I mind?”  
  
  “I don’t know.” I worked the suit on from the bottom. I knew it was going to be too big. Nancy gave me the creeps the way she sat on her bed and watched me. I left my polo on until the last possible second. I wasn’t about to let her see I wasn’t growing yet. That was my business.  
  
  “Oh, you’re still flat.” Nancy laughed.  
  
  “Not exactly,” I said, pretending to be very cool. “I’m small boned, is all.”  
  
  “I’m growing already,” Nancy said, sticking her chest way out. “In a few years I’m going to look like one of those girls in Playboy.”  
  
  Well, I didn’t think so, but I didn’t say anything. My father gets Playboy and I’ve seen those girls in the middle. Nancy looked like she had a long way to go. Almost as far as me.  
  
  “Want me to do up your straps?” she asked.  
  
  “Okay.”  
  
  “I figured you’d be real grown up coming from New York. City girls are supposed to grow up a lot faster. Did you ever kiss a boy?”  
  
  “You mean really kiss? On the lips?” I asked.  
  
  “Yes,” Nancy said impatiently. “Did you?”  
  
  “Not really,” I admitted.  
  
  Nancy breathed a sigh of relief. “Neither did I.”  
  
  I was overjoyed. Before she said that I was beginning to feel like some kind of underdeveloped little kid.  
  
  “I practice a lot though,” Nancy said. “Practice what?” I asked.  
  
  “Kissing! Isn’t that what we were talking about? Kissing!”  
  
  “How can you practice that?” I asked.  
  
  “Watch this.” Nancy grabbed her bed pillow and embraced it. She gave it a long kiss. When she was done she threw the pillow back on the bed. “It’s important to experiment, so when the time comes you’re all ready. I’m going to be a great kisser some day. Want to see something else?”  
  
  I just stood there with my mouth half open. Nancy sat down at her dressing table and opened a drawer. “Look at this,” she said.  
  
  I looked. There were a million little bottles, jars and tubes. There were more cosmetics in that drawer than my mother had all together. I asked, “What do you do with all that stuff?”  
  
  “It’s another one of my experiments. To see how I look best. So when the time comes I’ll be ready.” She opened a lipstick and painted on a bright pink mouth. “Well, what do you think?”  
  
  “Umm … I don’t know. It’s kind of bright, isn’t it?”  
  
  Nancy studied herself in the heartshaped mirror. She rubbed her lips together. “Well, maybe you’re right.” She wiped off the lipstick with a tissue. “My mother would kill me if I came out like this anyway. I can’t wait till eighth grade. That’s when I’ll be allowed to wear lipstick every day.”  
  
  Then she whipped out a hairbrush and started to brush her long, brown hair. She parted it in the middle and caught it at the back with a barrette. “Do you always wear your hair like that?” she asked me.  
  
  My hand went up to the back of my neck. I felt all the bobby pins I’d used to pin my hair up so my neck wouldn’t sweat. I knew it looked terrible. “I’m letting it grow,” I said. “It’s at that in-between stage now. My mother thinks I should wear it over my ears though. My ears stick out a little.”  
  
  “I noticed,” Nancy said.  
  
  I got the feeling that Nancy noticed everything!  
  
  “Ready to go?” she asked.  
  
  “Sure.”  
  
  She opened a linen closet in the hall and handed me a purple towel. I followed her down the stairs and into the kitchen, where she grabbed two peaches out of the refrigerator and handed one to me. “Want to meet my mom?” she asked.  
  
  “Okay,” I said, taking a bite of my peach.  
  
  “She’s thirty-eight, but tells us she’s twenty-five. Isn’t that a scream!” Nancy snorted.  
  
  Mrs. Wheeler was on the porch with her legs tucked under her and a book on her lap. I couldn’t tell what book it was. She was suntanned and had the same nose as Nancy.  
  
  “Mom, this is Margaret Simon who just moved in down the street.”  
  
  Mrs. Wheeler took off her glasses and smiled at me.  
  
  “Hello,” I said.  
  
  “Hello, Margaret. I’m very glad to meet you. You’re from New York, aren’t you?”  
  
  “Yes, I am.”  
  
  “East side or West?”  
  
  “We lived on West Sixty-seventh. Near Lincoln Center.”  
  
  “How nice. Does your father still work in the city?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “And what does he do?”  
  
  “He’s in insurance.” I sounded like a computer.  
  
  “How nice. Please tell your mother I’m looking forward to meeting her. We’ve got a Morningbird Lane bowling team on Mondays and a bridge game every other Thursday afternoon and a …”  
  
  “Oh, I don’t think my mother knows how to bowl and she wouldn’t be interested in bridge. She paints most of the day,” I explained.  
  
  “She paints?” Mrs. Wheeler asked.  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “How interesting. What does she paint?”  
  
  “Mostly pictures of fruits and vegetables. Sometimes flowers too.”  
  
  Mrs. Wheeler laughed. “Oh, you mean pictures! I thought you meant walls! Tell your mother we’re making our car pools early this year. We’d be happy to help her arrange hers … especially Sunday school. That’s always the biggest problem.”  
  
  “I don’t go to Sunday school.”  
  
  “You don’t?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Lucky!” Nancy shouted.  
  
  “Nancy, please!” Mrs. Wheeler said.  
  
  “Hey Mom … Margaret came to go under the sprinkler with me, n  
ot to go through the third degree.”  
  
  “All right. If you see Evan tell him I want to talk to him.”  
  
  Nancy grabbed me by the hand and pulled me outside. “I’m sorry my mother’s so nosey.”  
  
  “I didn’t mind,” I said. “Who’s Evan?”  
  
  “He’s my brother. He’s disgusting!”  
  
  “Disgusting how?” I asked.  
  
  “Because he’s fourteen. All boys of fourteen are disgusting. They’re only interested in two things—pictures of naked girls and dirty books!”  
  
  Nancy really seemed to know a lot. Since I didn’t know any boys of fourteen I took her word for it.  
  
  Nancy turned on the outside faucet and adjusted it so that the water sprayed lightly from the sprinkler. “Follow the leader!” she called, running through the water. I guessed Nancy was the leader.  
  
  She jumped through the spray. I followed. She turned cartwheels. I tried but didn’t make it. She did leaps through the air. I did too. She stood straight under the spray. I did the same. That’s when the water came on full blast. We both got drenched, including our hair.  
  
  “Evan, you stinker!” Nancy shrieked. “I’m telling!” She ran off to the house and left me alone with two boys.  
  
  “Who’re you?” Evan asked.  
  
  “I’m Margaret. We just moved in.”  
  
  “Oh. This is Moose,” he said, pointing to the other boy.  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  “Hey,” Moose said. “If you just moved in, ask your father if he’s interested in having me cut his lawn. Five bucks a week and I trim too. What’d you say your last name was?”  
  
  “I didn’t. But it’s Simon.” I couldn’t help thinking about what Nancy said—that all they were interested in was dirty books and naked girls. I held my towel tight around me in case they were trying to sneak a look down my bathing suit.  
  
  “Evan! Come in here this instant!” Mrs. Wheeler hollered from the porch.  
  
  “I’m coming … I’m coming,” Evan muttered.  
  
  After Evan went inside Moose said, “Don’t forget to tell your father. Moose Freed. I’m in the phone book.”  
  
  “I won’t forget,” I promised.  
  
  Moose nibbled a piece of grass. Then the back door slammed and Nancy came out, red-eyed and sniffling.  
  
  “Hey, Nancy baby! Can’t you take a joke?” Moose asked.

Shut up, animal!” Nancy yelled. Then she turned to me. “I’m sorry they had to act like that on your first day here. Come on, I’ll walk you home.”  
  
  Nancy had my clothes wrapped up in a little bundle. She was still in her wet suit. She pointed out who lived in each house between mine and hers.  
  
  “We’re going to the beach for Labor Day weekend,” she said. “So call for me on the first day of school and we’ll walk together. I’m absolutely dying to know who our teacher’s going to be. Miss Phipps, who we were supposed to have, ran off with some guy to California last June. So we’re getting somebody new.”  
  
  When we got to my house I told Nancy if she’d wait a minute I’d give her back her bathing suit.  
  
  “I don’t need it in a hurry. Tell your mother to wash it and you can give it back next week. It’s an old one.”  
  
  I was sorry she told me that. Even if I’d already guessed it. I mean, probably I wouldn’t lend a stranger my best bathing suit either. But I wouldn’t come right out and say it.  
  
  “Oh, listen, Margaret,” Nancy said. “On the first day of school wear loafers, but no socks.”  
  
  “How come?”  
  
  “Otherwise you’ll look like a baby.”  
  
  “Oh.”  
  
  “Besides, I want you to join my secret club and if you’re wearing socks the other kids might not want you.”  
  
  “What kind of secret club?” I asked.  
  
  “I’ll tell you about it when school starts.”  
  
  “Okay,” I said.  
  
  “And remember—no socks!”  
  
  “I’ll remember.”  
  
  We went to a hamburger place for supper. I told my father about Moose Freed. “Only five bucks a cutting and he trims too.”  
  
  “No, thanks,” my father said. “I’m looking forward to cutting it myself. That’s one of the reasons we moved out here. Gardening is good for the soul.” My mother beamed. They were really driving me crazy with all that good-for-the-soul business. I wondered when they became such nature lovers!  
  
  Later, when I was getting ready for bed, I walked into a closet, thinking it was the bathroom. Would I ever get used to living in this house? When I finally made it into bed and turned out the light, I saw shadows on my wall. I tried to shut my eyes and not think about them but I kept checking to see if they were still there. I couldn’t fall asleep.  
  
  Are you there God? It’s me, Margaret. I’m in my new bedroom but I still have the same bed. It’s so quiet here at night—nothing like the city. I see shadows on my wall and hear these funny creaking sounds. It’s scary God! Even though my father says all houses make noises and the shadows are only trees. I hope he knows what he’s talking about! I met a girl today. Her name’s Nancy. She expected me to be very grown up. I think she was disappointed. Don’t you think it’s time for me to start growing God? If you could arrange it I’d be very glad. Thank you.  
  
  My parents don’t know I actually talk to God. I mean, if I told them they’d think I was some kind of religious fanatic or something. So I keep it very private. I can talk to him without moving my lips if I have to. My mother says God is a nice idea. He belongs to everybody.  
  
  3  
  
  The next day we went to the hardware store where my father bought a deluxe power lawn mower. That evening, after our first at-home-in-New-Jersey supper (turkey sandwiches from the local delicatessen), my father went out to cut the grass with his new mower. He did fine on the front, but when he got around to the back yard he had to check to see how much grass there was in the bag on the mower. It’s a very simple thing to do. The man at the hardware store demonstrated just how to do it. Only you have to turn the mower off before you reach inside and my father forgot that.  
  
  I heard him yell, “Barbara—I’ve had an accident!” He ran to the house. He grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his hand before I had a chance to see anything. Then he sat down on the floor and turned very pale.  
  
  “Oh my God!” my mother said when the blood seeped through the towel. “Did you cut it off?”  
  
  When I heard that I raced outside to look for the limb. I didn’t know if they were talking about the whole hand or what, but I had read about how you’re supposed to save limbs if they get cut off because sometimes the doctor can sew them back on. I thought it was a good thing they had me around to think of those things. But I couldn’t find a hand or any fingers and by the time I came back into the house the police were there. My mother was on the floor too, with my father’s head in her lap.  
  
  I rode in the police car with them since there was no one at home to stay with me. I had a silent talk with God on the way to the hospital. I said this inside my head so no one would notice.  
  
  Are you there God? It’s me, Margaret. My father’s had an awful accident. Please help him God. He’s really very kind and nice. Even though he doesn’t know you the way I do, he’s a good father. And he needs his hand God. So please, please let him be all right. I’ll do anything you say if you help him. Thank you God.  
  
  It turned out that my father hadn’t cut off anything, but it took eight stitches to sew up his finger. The doctor who sewed him was Dr. Potter. After he was through with my father, he came out to chat. When he saw me he said, “I have a daughter about your age.”  
  
  I love the way people always think they know somebody your age until you tell them how old you really are!  
  
  “I’m going on twelve,” I said.  
  
  “Gretchen is almost twelve too,” the doctor said.  
  
  Well! He was right about my age.  
  
  “She’ll be in sixth grade at Delano School.”  
  
  “So will you, Margaret,” my mother reminded me. As if I needed reminding.  
  
  “I’ll tell Gretchen to look for you,” Dr. Potter said.  
  
  “Fine,” I told him.  
  
  As soon as we got home from the hospital my father told my mother to look up Moose Freed in the phone book and arrange for him to cut our lawn once a week.  
  
  On Labor Day I got up early. I wanted to fix up my desk in my room before school started. I’d bought a pile of paper, pencils, erasers, reinforcements and paper clips. I’m always real neat until about October. While I was in the middle of this project I heard a noise. It sounded like somebody knocking. I waited to see if my parents would wake up. I tiptoed to their room but the door was still closed and it was quiet so I knew they were asleep.  
  
  When I heard the knocking again I went downstairs to investigate. I wasn’t scared because I knew I could always scream and my father would rescue me if it turned out to be a burglar or a kidnapper.  
  
  The knocking came from the front door. Nancy was away for the weekend so it couldn’t be her. And we really didn’t know anybody else.  
  
  “Who is it?” I asked, pressing my ear to the door.  
  
  “It’s Grandma, Margaret. Open up.”  
  
  I unlatched the chain and both locks and flung open the door. “Grandma! I can’t believe it. You’re really here!”  
  
  “Surprise!” Grandma called.  
  
  I put a finger over my lips to let her know my parents were still asleep.  
  
  Grandma was loaded down with Bloomingdale’s shopping bags. But when she stepped into the house she lined them up on the floor and gave me a big hug and kiss.  
  
  “My Margaret!” she said, flashing her special smile. When she smiles like that she shows all her top teeth. They aren’t her real teeth. It’s what Grandma calls a bridge. She can take out a whole section of four top teeth when she wants to. She used to entertain me by doing that when I was little. Naturally I never told my parents. When she smiles without her teeth in place she looks like a witch. But with them in her mouth she’s very pretty.  
  
  “Come on, Margaret. Let’s get these bags into the kitchen.”  
  
  I picked up one shopping bag. “Grandma, this is so heavy! What’s in it?”  
  
  “Hotdogs, potato salad, cole slaw, corned beef, rye bread.…”  
  
  I laughed. “You mean it’s food?”  
  
  “Of course it’s food.”  
  
  “But they have food in New Jersey, Grandma.�  
��  
  
  “Not this kind.”  
  
  “Oh yes,” I said. “Even delicatessen.”  
  
  “No place has delicatessen like New York!”  
  
  I didn’t argue about that. Grandma has certain ideas of her own.  
  
  When we got all the bags into the kitchen Grandma scrubbed her hands at the sink and put everything into the refrigerator.  
  
  When she was done I asked, “How did you get here?”  
  
  Grandma smiled again but didn’t say anything. She was measuring coffee into the pot. You can’t make her talk about something until she’s ready.  
  
  Finally she sat down at the kitchen table, fluffed out her hair and said, “I came in a taxi.”  
  
  “All the way from New York?”  
  
  “No,” Grandma said. “From the center of Farbrook.”  
  
  “But how did you get to the center of Farbrook?”  
  
  “On a train.”  
  
  “Oh, Grandma—you didn’t!”  
  
  “Yes, I did.”  
  
  “But you always said trains are so dirty!”  
  
  “So what’s a little dirt? I’m washable!”  
  
  We both laughed while Grandma changed her shoes. She brought a spare pair along with her knitting in one of the shopping bags.  
  
  “Now,” she said, “take me on a tour of the house.”  
  
  I led her everywhere except upstairs. I pointed out closets, the downstairs bathroom, my mother’s new washer and dryer, and where we sat to watch TV.  
  
  When I was finished Grandma shook her head and said, “I just don’t understand why they had to move to the country.”  
  
  “It’s not really country, Grandma,” I explained. “There aren’t any cows around.”  
  
  “To me it’s country!” Grandma said.  
  
  I heard the water running upstairs. “I think they’re up. Should I go see?”  
  
  “You mean should you go tell!”  
  
  “Well, should I?”  
  
  “Of course,” Grandma said.  
  
  I ran up the stairs and into my parents’ bedroom. My father was putting on his socks. My mother was brushing her teeth in their bathroom.  
  
  “Guess who’s here?” I said to my father.  
  
  He didn’t say anything. He yawned.  
  
  “Well, aren’t you going to guess?”  
  
  “Guess what?” he asked.  
  
  “Guess who’s here in this very house at this very minute?”  
  
  “Nobody but us, I hope,” my father said.  
  
  “Wrong!” I danced around the bedroom.  
  
  “Margaret,” my father said in his disgusted-with-me voice. “What is it you’re trying to say?”  
  
  “Grandma’s here!”  
  
  “That’s impossible,” my father told me.  
  
  “I mean it, Daddy. She’s right downstairs in the kitchen making your coffee.”  
  
  “Barbara …” My father went into the bathroom and turned off the water. I followed him. My mother had a mouthful of toothpaste.  
  
  “I’m not done, Herb,” she said, turning on the water again.  
  
  My father shut it off. “Guess who’s here?” he asked her.  
  
  “What do you mean who’s here?” my mother said.  
  
  “Sylvia! That’s who’s here!” My father turned the water back on so my mother could finish brushing her teeth.  
  
  But my mother turned it off and followed my father into the bedroom. I followed too. This was fun! I guess by then my mother must have swallowed her toothpaste.  
  
  “What do you mean, Sylvia?” my mother asked my father.  
  
  “I mean my mother!” my father said.  
  
  My mother laughed. “That’s impossible, Herb. How would she even get here?”  
  
  My father pointed at me. “Ask Margaret. She seems to know everything.”  
  
  “In a taxi,” I said.  
  
  They didn’t say anything.  
  
  “And a train,” I said.  
  
  Still nothing.  
  
  “It wasn’t so dirty after all.”  
  
  Ten minutes later my mother and father joined Grandma in the kitchen where the table was set and the breakfast all ready. It’s hard to get mad at Grandma, especially when she flashes her super smile. So my mother and father didn’t say anything except what a wonderful surprise! And how clever of Grandma to take a train and a taxi to our new house when she’d never been to Farbrook before.  
  
  After breakfast I went upstairs to get dressed. Grandma came up with me to see my room.  
  
  “It’s a lot bigger than my old one,” I said.  
  
  “Yes, it’s bigger,” Grandma agreed. “You could use new bedspreads and curtains. I saw some the other day—pink and red plaid. Then we could get red carpeting to match and a———” Grandma sighed. “But I guess your mother wants to fix it up herself.”  
  
  “I guess so,” I said.  
  
  Grandma sat down on my bed. “Margaret darling,” she said, “I want to make sure you understand that we’ll still be as close as always.”  
  
  “Of course we will,” I said.  
  
  “A few miles doesn’t mean a thing,” Grandma said. “Just because I can’t drop in after school doesn’t mean I won’t think of you every day.”  
  
  “I know that, Grandma.”  
  
  “I tell you what—I’ll call you every night at seven-thirty. How does that sound?”  
  
  “You don’t have to call every night,” I said.  
  
  “I want to! It’s my dime,” Grandma laughed. “That way you can tell me what’s going on and I’ll keep you posted about New York. Okay?”  
  
  “Sure Grandma.”  
  
  “But Margaret …”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “You answer the phone. Your mother and father might not like me calling so much. This is just between you and me. All right?”  
  
  “Sure, Grandma. I love to get phone calls.”  
  
  We all spent the rest of the day sitting around in our yard. Grandma was knitting me a new sweater, my mother planted some fall flowers, and my father read a book. I sunbathed, thinking it would be nice to start school with a tan.  
  
  We ate Grandma’s food for supper and every time she bit into a pickle she said, “Mmm … nothing like the real thing!”  
  
  We drove her back to the Farbrook station while it was still light. Grandma has this thing about walking in New York at night. She’s positive she’s going to get mugged. Before she got out of the car she kissed me good-by and told my parents, “Now don’t worry. I promise I’ll only come once a month. Well … maybe twice. And it’s not to see you, Herb. Or you either, Barbara. I’ve got to keep an eye on my Margaret—that’s all.” Grandma winked at me.  
  
  With that she grabbed the shopping bag with her shoes and knitting and left, waving good-by until we couldn’t see her anymore.  
  
  4  
  
  On Wednesday night my mother helped me wash my hair. She set it in big rollers for me. I planned to sleep like that all night but after an hour they hurt my head so I took them out. On Thursday morning I got up early but I had trouble eating. My mother said it was natural for me to feel uneasy on the first day of school. She said when she was a girl she felt the same way. My mother’s always telling me about when she was a girl. It’s supposed to make me feel that she understands everything.  
  
  I put on my new blue plaid cotton back-to-school dress. My mother likes me in blue. She says it brings out the color in my eyes. I wore my brown loafers without socks. My mother thought that was dumb.  
  
  “Margaret, you have to walk three quarters of a mile.”  
  
  “So?”  
  
  “So, you know you get blisters every time you go without socks.”  
  
  “Well then, I’ll just have to suffer.”  
  
  “But why suffer? Wear socks!”  
  
  Now that’s my point about my mother. I mean, if she understands so much about me then why couldn’t she understand that I had to wear loafers without socks? I told her, “Nancy says nobody in the sixth grade wears socks on the first day of school!”  
  
  “Margaret! I don’t know what I’m going to do with you when you’re a teenager if you’re acting like this now!”  
  
  That’s another thing. My mother’s always talki  
ng about when I’m a teenager. Stand up straight, Margaret! Good posture now makes for a good figure later. Wash your face with soap, Margaret! Then you won’t get pimples when you’re a teenager. If you ask me, being a teenager is pretty rotten—between pimples and worrying about how you smell!  
  
  Finally my mother told me to have a good day. She kissed my cheek and gave me a pat on the back. I walked down to Nancy’s house.  
  
  By the time I got to Room Eighteen of the Delano Elementary School my feet hurt so much I thought I wouldn’t make it through the day. Why are mothers always right about those things? As it turned out, half the girls had on knee socks anyway.  
  
  The teacher wasn’t in the room when we got there. That is, the real teacher. There was this girl, who I thought was the teacher, but she turned out to be a kid in our class. She was very tall (that’s why I thought she was the teacher) with eyes shaped like a cat’s. You could see the outline of her bra through her blouse and you could also tell from the front that it wasn’t the smallest size. She sat down alone and didn’t talk to anyone. I wondered if maybe she was new too, because everybody else was busy talking and laughing about summer vacations and new hair styles and all that.  
  
  The class quieted down in a big hurry when a man walked into the room, nodded at us and wrote a name on the blackboard.  
  
  MILES J. BENEDICT JR.  
  
  When he turned away from the blackboard he cleared his throat. “That’s me,” he said, pointing to the name on the board. Then he cleared his throat two more times. “I’m your new teacher.”  
  
  Nancy poked me in the ribs and whispered, “Can you believe it?” The whole class was whispering and grinning.  
  
  Mr. Benedict went back to the board. He wrote six phrases. Then he turned to us. He put his hands behind his back and kind of rocked back and forth on his feet. He cleared his throat so I knew he was going to say something.  
  
  “Now then … uh … you know my name. I’ll tell you something about myself. Uh … I’m twenty-four years old. I’m uh … a graduate of Columbia Teachers College and uh … this is my first teaching position. Now that you know about me, I want to uh … find out about you. So, if you will copy these six phrases off the board and then complete them I’d uh … appreciate it. Thank you.” He coughed. I thought he was going to wind up with a very sore throat.

1m0aofu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1m0aofu/it_is_as_simple_as_a_pringle_hear_me_out/,It is as simple as a Pringle! Hear me out...,"Hello friends! I have been studying the Law of Assumption since December of last year..so about 8 months now...I have mostly been a silent observer and have enjoyed reading all the wonderful posts here.

I have been able to manifest stuff here and there . Initially I was not sure if I actually manifested it or it was out of sheer stroke of luck or coincidence that I got what I was trying to ""manifest"". Slowly but steadily I am getting better at it. I have been able to manifest seeing the most random stuff - pink car, dark green car, get free coffee, free chocolates, someone giving me a compliment..I even manifested my “person” sending me the exact message I was manifesting to receive from him, within like 2 mins of having that thought. I still have some limiting beliefs which I am working on (through changing my self concept) and I hope to be able to manifest much faster(hell! i already do). I also understand now why I did not get something I was trying to manifest immediately or not at all(in 3D even though creation is already finished), and I don't doubt the law at all now. I know what I need to change within me ...

Something that I have always been trying to wrap my head around is - even though the creation is already finished, why does it feel like sometimes our desires take like 100 years to appear in our physical reality aka 3D? So today, I had a light bulb moment while eating Pringles lol. Sharing with you all in case it clicks for someone else too.

*The Pringle Theory* :

Imagine an empty pringle can. Now, the very first Pringle that you toss inside is your desire that you want to manifest. It can be anything from your dream relationship or winning a big lottery or getting that dream job or removing 3P from your “special person” situation, etc.

Let’s call it our *Golden Pringle*. Now it’s inside the can…i.e. creation is finished.. your desire already exists. You don’t have to create it.

Now, every single time you start doubting, overthinking, worrying or getting anxious because of your limiting beliefs, you are basically throwing another Pringle on top of your golden Pringle in the can. So with every “this is taking forever” or “ what if it doesn’t work?” or “ I’m not good enough” or “why does my crush never text me?”, all you’re doing is just adding one Pringle after another into the can.

When you look inside the can( aka check your 3D), all you see are layers and layers of Pringles one on top of another (doubts, limiting beliefs..), but not your actual golden Pringle, which is your desire that you want to manifest. The more you work on your self-concept, the more you persist in the wish fulfilled/live in the end, the more those extra layers of Pringles get eaten or removed overtime until you finally reach your original golden Pringle that you put there in the first place.

The less pringles you add, the faster you get to your golden Pringle. You don’t have to go to the store to get more Pringles. You just need to stop chucking in new ones inside, stop the habit of filling in more and more layers that separate *you* from the *version of you* who already has your desire.

So the next time you are tempted to look at your 3D and spiral into “ but where is it?”, just picture yourself about to drop another Pringle into the can and maybe… don’t! Keep persisting(that’s how all the other Pringles get eaten one by one) instead of panicking every time it looks like there is no movement and remember that your golden Pringle is right there at the bottom of the can, waiting and hidden under all those extra layers of Pringles that are blocking your view.

More layers = more delays!

Creation is already finished. The golden Pringle is already there. You don’t have to work to create it, you only have to work at removing the extra layers of Pringles between you and your golden Pringle so your awareness can “land on“ that reality and reflect it into your 3D . You just need to learn to stop adding more layers of doubt, worry, fear that imaginatively and energetically keep you separated from the reality where your desire exists . The less you pile on, the sooner you can experience what you want.

Most of all that makes you feel loved.
I've only had two men in my life.
When I turned 18
1st dude: I don't know what in the world was running through my mind. I kind of knew it was to soon for him to be in a relationship. He wasn't over his ex. Stupid me. He was an alcoholic who wouldn't work and would send me messed up audios of him hanging out with a girl. Pfttt! He'd make me get out of work to take him a burrito because he was so hung over, he didn't want to get up. SMH. He'd make me sleep on the tile floor. He'd throw food on the ground and force me to eat it. He would kick me out at 3AM during the cold. During ""busy season"" because I was working in a freezer making flower bouquets or working front office sometimes, I would go to work at 4:30ish AM get home at 4 PM change hardly had time to eat because of traffic and come back home till midnight he swore I was hoeing around. At the beginning I tried to do everything I can to satisfy him and all the good stuff but he literally started to gross me out because of the things he would tell me. Would be drunk and he'd want to things I didn't feel comfortable doing things for the same reason that he was so aggressive. Every time I'd try to leave, his family would beg me not to and he would literally say he was gonna commit suicide. SMH. I was literally living with a stranger. We wouldn't even have sex because either he was too drunk and fall asleep (I felt relieved because to begin with I didn't even want too) or I would say I was on my period and it was heavy. He made me feel like I was no good. All my life I was always a little gordita, I was never skinny but I wasn't big either but he'd say I was fat and no one was going to like me.
2nd dude: He was way older than me. He was a sweet, caring, loving person but he was also still married. His wife being a social worker was so immature. She faked an abortion SMH. Would constantly say she was filing for divorce so he had to sign the papers in person but then she would say she was going to give the papers to his family. Welp, I guess they ran out of paper or some shit. One time he said he was going to a rehab to get sober. At 9PM?! Wtf. The buses don't run, your dad is sleeping he's the only way you get around, hmm??? I knew something was up. I knew it and I told him but stupid me of course, ignored it and told him I was happy for him he was whispering and said he had to go to sleep cause everyone was sleeping. ALRIGHT.
Turned out his friend forgot something at the hotel room we where staying in and asked to come in I said yeah go ahead. I was like hey, I can't find my phone can I call from yours? He said sure. He was in a rush looking for something and was trying to rush out of there he forgot I had his phone. *ring ring* text pops up ""ay dawg don't let her come out. keep her inside cause you know who is here and we are in the lobby""
Fuck. I was like ay you got a text from wooptywoop here.... He's like who is he talking about!
 I told him to get out.
I cried myself to sleep.
I literally had guys begging to be with me but I never paid attention to them. I respected this dude. He showed up at 7AM in the morning. Look like he hardly slept. His lips looked different. He jumps right in the shower. Hmm?
I ask him, what rehab did you go too? I thought once you go in you can't easily come out till a month later or so.
I was trying to be strong but he continued lying so I yelled at him and told him "" don't lie anymore! you lied you fucking lied. why? divorce? BULLSHIT. cmon why are you doing this to me?
in the same fucking hotel too, are you serious?
you two are still legally married. grow the fuck up both of you and stay the fuck together.
All he said was Yeah. Sorry she said we had to see each other to sign the papers for divorce.
I stayed stupid I know tried to live past it but it was hard. I was unhappy and I was making him unhappy by constantly reminding him of the shit he did. I knew I wasn't going to trust him anymore so I left.

I know I'm a good as fucking woman. I'm hella laid back. I would see how my mom was with my dad so I followed her steps and always gave the best of me. My mom has only been with my dad ever since she was 14 till today they are 60 years old. She has never thought about cheating on him or anything. She only cared about her husband and her kids, made sure home felt like home. I know how to cook, I cook some bomb as Mexican food or I can wake you up to some pancakes eggs on the side kind of like bringing iHop to the bed with a milkshake or a coffee or both. I will spoil you with love and everything nice. Make some delicious deserts and some refreshing ice cold agua de sabor like de mango, fresa, anything from fresh homemade no little flavor powders.

1m0amwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asushin/comments/1m0amwf/asushin_is_secretly_canon_yes_lol_sue_me/,"Asushin is 'secretly' canon, yes lol. sue me.","OK, I just finished doing some research on **Asushin**.  
And I have compiled a large amount of information to support my point, which I have gathered from various sources (such as Evageeks, discussions about Asushin, different opinions from different people, etc. *To put it simply, I have gathered information from countless sources*).  
I have to admit that their relationship is **complicated**, extremely ***complicated***.  
And for the most part, I will summarize what Evageeks wrote about Asushin and offer some of my own opinions.

***1. Are they a couple?***  
They look like a couple, but Evangelion doesn't tell us directly. Instead, they give us small hints about this.  
***"" ...Actually, what the series usually does is use these characters to explore themes related to affection, sexuality and human interactions in general. ""  -*** *According to Evageeks (Theory and Analysis: Shinji and Asuka's Relationship )*

The unexpected, humorous, embarrassing, etc. situations that occur between the two characters are the biggest factor supporting this point.

""***Some of their scenes together incorporate elements of romantic comedy, following the pattern established in the Action Arc of reducing the story's dramatic curve in favor of a bittersweet narrative, with Asuka assuming a position of comic relief underpinned by her “difficult personality”. However, even with this apparent toughness, her weaknesses eventually become apparent and Shinji is able to see ways approach her and build a tolerable friendship. To strengthen this ""romantic comedy"" vibe, the show introduces scenes in which the two of them find themselves in funny and disastrous situations.***"" - *According to Evageeks  (Theory and Analysis: Shinji and Asuka's Relationship )*

[Source: Evageeks \(Theory and Analysis: Shinji and Asuka's Relationship \)](https://preview.redd.it/hvcefv8d2zcf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=af6f48845f762dc6adcbf3ca02c1d4059051c9c6)

In episode 17 of the TV series, we see Asuka and Shinji arguing. Toji then says, “A husband and wife quarrel?” Asuka and Shinji, after hearing that statement and the laughter of their classmates, blush and appear embarrassed. This implies that Toji's statement is completely correct, and they (Asuka and Shinji), in fact, also realize that they are arguing like a married couple. A small pause shows how embarrassed Asuka and Shinji were after hearing Toji's statement and then deny it. How cute. (And that's just a small hint about the relationship between these two characters.)  


Also,

***""An example would be in Episode 09. Misato has momentarily substituted Rei for Asuka in the synchro-attack training and Rei aces it the first try. After Asuka runs from the room Hikari says to Shinji: ""Go after her! You made a girl cry!""***  
  
***The scene has a romantic comedy content to Hikari's speech, as it implies Shinji's responsibility for Asuka's reaction, since a boy cannot disappoint a girl, even if the fault is not directly his, according to the trope.""***

\- According to Evageeks

***2. Do they feel interested in each other?***  
*Short answer: Yes, obviously. lol.*

*Long answer:*

I want to ask you a question.  
If someone asked you to ***kiss*** them to relieve their boredom, would you do it?  
***If you don't have romantic feelings for that person then of course not.***

And in the case of Shinji and Asuka. We can recall the scene where the couple kisses after Asuka tells him that she just wants to do it to relieve her boredom (and of course, it's not because she's bored, but for another reason, but I don't want to talk about that here).

[Let's be honest, those two wouldn't be kissing if they didn't have some kind of “feelings” for each other. \(Source :Evageeks\)](https://preview.redd.it/dw89p3vi2zcf1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=16667a13f8d413ea7829f3f550051b56c0d51f55)

Note: I did this part pretty carelessly, so there might be a few mistakes, but that's basically the answer *(Yes, They have feelings for each other.)*  
  
***3. Two side of the same coin.***

**Now, this will be the most complex and difficult part (also, it is very long to explain ) to understand. And I highly recommend that you research them yourself.**

Both Asuka and Shinji experienced very similar trauma. From the loss of a loved one (their mother) to the absence of their fathers. But they developed opposite coping mechanisms, as they are both too afraid of reaching out to others for fear of receiving the same abandonment they have in the past.

***Deeper analysis:***

*Shinji: Isolating himself from the outside world in order to avoid intimacy and the risk of rejection and to always stay in his comfort zone*  
*Asuka: She pushes them away from her with arrogance and abrasiveness, trying to cultivate a false image of herself that keeps her from facing reality.*  
*- According to* [*https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Shinji\_and\_Asuka%27s\_Relationship*](https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Shinji_and_Asuka%27s_Relationship)

Note: If I had the time, maybe I would spend it analyzing each episode related to Asuka and Shinji from NGE, but Evageeks and EvangelionFandom have already done that, so I probably won't. But I'm still considering doing it.

***That's probably the main reason why they find it “difficult” to connect with each other (I hate to say that)***

This is not the end of this section, as mentioned earlier. This will be an extremely difficult and complex issue to explain, and it will take a long time to explain (but I also really want to analyze each episode of NGE to analyze in detail the relationship between Shinji and Asuka, but you can still see it at Evageek and EvangelionFandom)

***4. Human Instrumentality***

*Note:*  
This is also very long and complicated, so I will summarize it. If you want more details, please visit: [https://wiki.evageeks.org/Theory\_and\_Analysis:Shinji\_and\_Asuka's\_Relationship](https://wiki.evageeks.org/Theory_and_Analysis:Shinji_and_Asuka's_Relationship)

***4.1 First Exchange***  
  
Immediately after the surreal sandbox sequence, Asuka bursts out at Shinji, declaring “***The sight of you makes me so irritated!***”, which encapsulates her visceral hostility towards him born of mutual insecurities. Shinji’s calm retort that it stems from their fundamental similarity invokes Jung’s Shadow archetype, where each confronts disowned aspects of themselves mirrored in the other . Visually, they lie ***naked and intertwined***—an embodiment of Instrumentality’s aim to merge all identities—yet their faces are never shown together, a deliberate cinematographic choice underscoring persistent emotional separation. Asuka’s aggression is rooted in her rejection of vulnerability and need for affection—traits Shinji embodies and forces her to confront in herself. Conversely, Shinji admires Asuka’s fierce self-confidence but lacks the bravery to integrate those qualities into his own psyche, revealing his fear of abandonment. This initial clash lays bare the central conflict of their bond: a struggle for genuine communication and self-acceptance under the weight of shared trauma.

***4.2 Second Exchange***

In a surreal replay of their early series kiss, Asuka explodes with frustration—“*It’s not like you understand me! You think you can help me? That’s arrogant!*”—venting months of pent-up resentment. The color palette fractures their connection: Asuka glows in vivid reds of anger and desire, while Shinji is bathed in melancholy blues, visually encoding their emotional dissonance. Shinji interrupts her tirade to confess, “***There’s no way I could understand you… You never say anything, yet expect me to***”––a painful admission of his own communicative failures. At that moment, Rei’s disembodied voice asks, “***Ikari, did you really try to understand?***”, turning his confession back on him and highlighting his self-centered blindness. This confrontation crystallizes how Shinji’s well-meaning empathy falls short: he desires connection but never learns to listen actively to Asuka’s inner life. By the end, both are left raw—her defenses up, his guilt laid bare—setting the stage for deeper ruptures.

***4.3 Third Exchange***  
  
Their next reenactment plunges into unfiltered sexual and emotional territory as Asuka taunts, “***Idiot! I know that I’m your jerk-off fantasy… If you cannot be mine and mine only, I don’t even want you,***” weaponizing Shinji’s repressed desires to assert dominance. She places her body next to his in a grotesque parody of intimacy, demanding exclusivity and unvarnished honesty to test his emotional limits. Shinji, desperate, pleads simply, “*Then, be nice to me*,” provoking a chorus of “*We are nice to you*” from Asuka, Rei, and Misato—a facade he immediately attacks as “*LIARS!! You just want to keep things ambiguous!*”. Rei’s retort, “*Because the truth hurts us all…*”, cuts through his rage to expose the cost of genuine vulnerability. In this volatile crucible, Shinji’s craving for clarity collides with his fear of emotional complexity: he seizes on their physical nudity as comfort yet recoils from their relational depth. The exchange lays bare the paradox that intimacy both entices and terrifies him, as he learns that real affection cannot be reduced to fantasies.

***4.4 Fourth Exchange***  
The final variation revisits Shinji’s crash-trope of delivering bad news—this time Kaji’s death—to Asuka, with Shinji begging, *“Stay with me. I’ll be there. I love you,”* promising mutual support and affection. Asuka shrieks her refusal—*“…Stay away from me, because all you do is hurt me”*—then hurls accusations of cowardice and emotional manipulation, declaring, *“You can’t even love yourself”* and dumping scalding coffee over him in a desperate bid to shatter his pleas. In a visceral backlash, Shinji seizes her by the throat, strangling her in a brutal act of rejection and despair, his anguished cry, ***“Everyone should die,”*** signaling his final rupture with human connection and triggering Third Impact (the apocalyptic culmination of Instrumentality). In this violent climax, intimacy collapses into annihilation; Shinji’s inability to accept both others’ vulnerabilities and his own unleashes the cataclysm that erases separateness only to render unity meaningless.

***Please note: I used AI to summarize, and I also made some minor edits to the summary. However, there may be some errors, so please bear with me.***

***5. More.***

The song “***Everything You've Ever Dreamed***” is by Shiro SAGISU, but the lyrics are by Hideaki Anno.+  
What's special is that the lyrics of this song (both Japanese and English) are ***clearly explain the relationship between Shinji and Asuka.***  
We can easily recognize this from the lyrics.  
Although not used in the show, we can understand that the Asushin couple is a special couple that Anno himself cares about.  
I won't analyze the meaning of the lyrics in depth, but in general it talks about the two characters Asuka and Shinji.

***6. I need you.***

As mentioned earlier, at the end of EoE, only these two characters appear. It also shows us that Asuka has changed from what we can see in the “***caress***” she gives Shinji even though he is strangling her. And the word “disgusting” also has many different meanings. But we won't discuss that here.

\---------------------------

And this post is just a small part of my understanding of Asushin. What do you think? Am I wrong about anything? Let me know!  
And if you take the time to read it all, I really appreciate it.

Also, if you can, please share it to other people, it means a lot to me

Cue caffein pills entering the chat. I try a 200mg pill at 7am and around 11am started yawning and crashing. But my brain is quiet for the first time in weeks, so clearly I’ve done something right. The internet says 400 mg is safe, so I take one more. This makes me feel nauseous all afternoon, so I decide this is too much. No big deal, I’ll sleep it off and try again tomorrow.

But y’all, *I don’t drink coffee*. I consume almost zero caffeine on a daily basis, like a single green tea (38 mg) in a week. It’s now 1:30am and my brain is switching between Katy Perry singing “I’m wide awake” and Jesse Spano’s “I’m so excited 😩😭.” I may never sleep again.

M solo traveller here ! 4th time in Korea so I know some stuff may occur while here, being contacted by cults and what not being one of them. 

Walking in Hongdae this morning, I met this girl in the street and we randomly started talking about lots of stuff : Kpop, hiking in Jeju, etc.

After a while, we went to a coffee shop with a friend of hers for some more talking. After 2 hours, conversation shifted to Korean history, values, family tradition, etc. She then proceeded to invite me to her town to discover “inyeon” in a ceremony. 

I have some plans later with another solo traveller so I politely refused citing timing (alarm bells were ringing in my head tbh) and left shortly after. 

Now, I’m still curious. Is it an actual cult-like, or shamanism invitation, or did I actually miss out on something ? 😅",5,1752561506.0,koreatravel,18,0.78,False
1m0alup,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1m0alup/it_is_as_simple_as_a_pringle_hear_me_out/,It is as simple as a Pringle! Hear me out..,"Hello friends! I have been studying the Law of Assumption since December of last year..so about 8 months now...I have mostly been a silent observer and have enjoyed reading all the wonderful posts here.

I have been able to manifest stuff here and there . Initially I was not sure if I actually manifested it or it was out of sheer stroke of luck or coincidence that I got what I was trying to ""manifest"". Slowly but steadily I am getting better at it. I have been able to manifest seeing the most random stuff - pink car, dark green car, get free coffee, free chocolates, someone giving me a compliment..I even manifested my “person” sending me the exact message I was manifesting to receive from him, within like 2 mins of having that thought. I still have some limiting beliefs which I am working on (through changing my self concept) and I hope to be able to manifest much faster(hell! i already do). I also understand now why I did not get something I was trying to manifest immediately or not at all(in 3D even though creation is already finished), and I don't doubt the law at all now. I know what I need to change within me ...

Something that I have always been trying to wrap my head around is - even though the creation is already finished, why does it feel like sometimes our desires take like 100 years to appear in our physical reality aka 3D? So today, I had a light bulb moment while eating Pringles lol. Sharing with you all in case it clicks for someone else too.

*The Pringle Theory* :

Imagine an empty pringle can. Now, the very first Pringle that you toss inside is your desire that you want to manifest. It can be anything from your dream relationship or winning a big lottery or getting that dream job or removing 3P from your “special person” situation, etc.

Let’s call it our *Golden Pringle*. Now it’s inside the can…i.e. creation is finished.. your desire already exists. You don’t have to create it.

Now, every single time you start doubting, overthinking, worrying or getting anxious because of your limiting beliefs, you are basically throwing another Pringle on top of your golden Pringle in the can. So with every “this is taking forever” or “ what if it doesn’t work?” or “ I’m not good enough” or “why does my crush never text me?”, all you’re doing is just adding one Pringle after another into the can.

When you look inside the can( aka check your 3D), all you see are layers and layers of Pringles one on top of another (doubts, limiting beliefs..), but not your actual golden Pringle, which is your desire that you want to manifest. The more you work on your self-concept, the more you persist in the wish fulfilled/live in the end, the more those extra layers of Pringles get eaten or removed overtime until you finally reach your original golden Pringle that you put there in the first place.

The less pringles you add, the faster you get to your golden Pringle. You don’t have to go to the store to get more Pringles. You just need to stop chucking in new ones inside, stop the habit of filling in more and more layers that separate *you* from the *version of you* who already has your desire.

So the next time you are tempted to look at your 3D and spiral into “ but where is it?”, just picture yourself about to drop another Pringle into the can and maybe… don’t! Keep persisting(that’s how all the other Pringles get eaten one by one) instead of panicking every time it looks like there is no movement and remember that your golden Pringle is right there at the bottom of the can, waiting and hidden under all those extra layers of Pringles that are blocking your view.

More layers = more delays!

Creation is already finished. The golden Pringle is already there. You don’t have to work to create it, you only have to work at removing the extra layers of Pringles between you and your golden Pringle so your awareness can “land on“ that reality and reflect it into your 3D . You just need to learn to stop adding more layers of doubt, worry, fear that imaginatively and energetically keep you separated from the reality where your desire exists . The less you pile on, the sooner you can experience what you want.

Hope this helps someone who feels stuck❣️",45,1752561481.0,NevilleGoddard,4,1.0,False

1m0ah3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1m0ah3u/i_hate_my_body/,I hate my body,"I have struggled with recurrent utis for the past 5 years. I am so tired. I've tried cranberry supplements, peeing after sex, rinsing my crotch with water after sex (only the outside). I don't drink a lot of alcohol, coffee, or soda. I seem to get a uti every 1-2 months. 

I need to get a CT scan now because I have another one, and I had bilirubin in my urine last time. I went to the clinic today to get more antibiotics and labs done. My fiancé was mad at the situation, but it seemed like he was more mad at me.

He implied that I was being selfish by going to the clinic so often when we don't have much money at all. I pay for everything myself and have had health insurance for a few months now (didn't have any money to spare beforehand and tried toughing out the utis too). He also brought up how he hasn't taken care of his own health problems (mostly cosmetic issues like braces with the exception of likely needing some kind of brain scan) to show how utis are not as urgent or important. 

I am so tired of getting sick and peeing blood. I just want it all to stop. I also have teeth problems. I very recently had a root canal done cause of an infected tooth. That was 1000 and change, and I still need a crown and a different tooth likely pulled. I got the root canal because it was one of my front teeth, and the surrounding teeth would lose bone support. 

I work 18 or so hours a week because it's summer and not busy season (everyone's hours have been cut). I don't seem to have much luck with doordash, but I plan on doing it more often around dinner time. I am also trying to save up money for a wedding. On top of that, I am a college student. We also have a total of 8 pets (3 of which were not planned and need to be rehomed). No one seems to want a corgi at the moment, and my fiancé's sister wants to wait to take in one of the cats (our 3 other cats bully her and she doesn't defend herself). 

I feel like everything is crumbling and needs money. I just feel alone and like a burden. I realize me getting sick doesn't help with finances, which is why I am so desperate for a solution. We are both a bit worried about this affecting my ability to have kids, but I think my kidneys are in more danger at the moment. My dr is also wondering if maybe it's some kind of herpes (only been with one person my whole 22 years of life, same for my fiancé), so I git my blood drawn for that today. 

Sometimes I wish I was not here. I am tired. I am too scared to vent to close friends and family because they might view my fiance or me differently. I wish my fiance was a bit more empathetic. I always encourage him to get his medical problems sorted out and have even offered to help pay for some of it too in the past. I think I need a vacation from everything and everyone.

1m0ag3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1m0ag3w/worried_about_baby_shower_gift_from_mil/,Worried About Baby Shower Gift From MIL,"First of all I want to preface this by saying I love my MIL very much and she means well, but she’s routinely off the mark.

Just received the RSVP from my MIL for our baby shower in about a month. She added a note that she will not be purchasing anything from the registry as she has already gotten a gift for our baby boy. I’m starting to worry about what she may have given us as we TRUELY only need what is on the registry. Including diapers and wipes, clothes and pacifiers.

My husband and I suffered through nearly 4 years of infertility. When I was hopeful in our journey I would either work on sewing our future baby’s baby quilt, or I would stock up on baby items we would need. By the time we found out that our IVF transfer was successful and we were due to have a baby in October, we nearly had a fully functional nursery. As the pregnancy has gone on many of our friends have gifted us the supplies they used for their babies and I’ve been crossing things off left and right off of our registry that we no longer need. The nursery is fully furnished, we also have THREE bassinets, way too many clothes for a baby to wear in the first year (for both the boy we are expecting and a girl we hope to try for in a few years as we have two female embryos), enough cloth diapers for two children, three baby bouncers, a jam packed bookcase that is cracking under the weight of all the baby books it holds, and a full closet of items baby boy will need to grow into. MIL has been in the nursery, and has seen everything.

MIL also has a history of gifting us completely unnecessary things for every occasion. I’d say she’s off the mark nearly 90% of the time. She’s been gifting us coffee for years, I hate the taste of coffee and my husband will make himself a cup maybe twice a year. She LOVES gifting us items from her local farmers market like hot sauce, which our pantry is FULL of because I don’t like that much spice and my husband is very picky with his hot sauce. She found out I love tea, and bought me libido boosting tea (that would in no way solve our fertility issues). Got us a variety of vitamins to help solve our infertility issues as well (I don’t typically lean towards eastern medicine solutions and even my acupuncturist said they wouldn’t do anything to help). When I was getting ready for a thyroidectomy she gifted me a heated neck wrap for recovery, my doctor did not recommended that I use it. Found out I was pregnant and she bought me heated booties for my feet to use this summer for swollen feet (I’m not even sure they would work for that as the doctor recommend compression socks). I could go on but will likely run out of space.

Anyways, I’m terrified she’ll gift us something totally inappropriate like a vintage bassinet that is not safe for sleep, or crib bumpers that are also not safe for sleep, or more fricken tea for milk supply that is not actually proven to do anything to your milk supply, or books relating to not vaccinating your children (HUGE point of contention with us), or literally anything that we already have. I’ve done so much research that everything that I have bought has been thoughtful researched. Everything on our registry has been thoughtful researched. I have items that friends have given us that do not fit the specifications that i have researched that I will be passing on. We are being super picky about what we keep for our baby, but I have a tendency to people please with my MIL and do not want to hurt MIL’s feelings by not keeping her gift.

Our original plan was to have MIL come down around our due date and when I go into labor she would take care of our house and dogs while we are at the hospital and help around the house for two weeks after baby is born. If this does turn out to be what we do, I’m worried she will insist on us using whatever weird grift she gives us or we will hurt her feelings by not using it. But another worry I have is that our doctor has told us everyone who will be helping take care of the baby should get an updated TDAP vaccine. I spoke to my husband and we would also like everyone to get the flu vaccine as well. MIL is anti-vax, and I am worried she will not get vaccinated. My husband believes she would do anything for our baby and isn’t worried, but is putting off having this discussion with her. So, another scenario is that she doesn’t get vaccinated, she doesn’t see baby till he’s 6 months old and fully vaccinated against TDAP, and we don’t need to use her gift 🤷‍♀️.

I’m sure I’m just overthinking everything and going to worst case scenario. Just needed to vent somewhere. Let me know if you have had similar scenarios you’ve been through and how you dealt with it!

I'm in good shape, so my job involves putting on shows for female audiences - dancing, interacting with them on stage, going into the crowd, etc. It's physically demanding work, and sometimes I get inappropriately touched (like getting scratches on my torso, which sucks since my looks are part of my income). But the pay is good, and I really need the money.  

Here's why: My older brother recently battled a serious illness, lost his income, and my parents drained their savings to help him. Before this, they could support me financially - now it's my turn to help them.  

Enter my best friend ""Jay"" (25M), who's lived in Seoul for years with his girlfriend Annie (27F). Recently, Jay used his work bonus to buy front-row tickets to my show. Big mistake.  

During my performance (where I'm required to interact with front-row attendees), I approached their section. Annie wrapped her arms around me, ran her hands over my body, and basically clung to me for several seconds. Standard work stuff - I was about to move on when Jay started yelling at me to ""get away from his girl"" and shoved me slightly.  

Our club’s protocol when guys get jealous: We’re trained to immediately disengage and redirect. No arguing, just exit the situation. This isn’t my first rodeo with jealous boyfriends, so when Annie full-on groped me during my crowd walk (standard for my role), and Jay started shoving/yelling, I followed protocol and walked away. 

After the show, Jay sent then deleted some angry voice messages before sending a final text: He apologized for attacking me but said Annie is ""obsessed"" with me and demanded a face-to-face talk (his idea!). At coffee, he dropped a bomb.
1) Annie won't stop talking about me  
2) Her touching me was ""inappropriate""    
He insisted I quit my job. 

I said no:  
1. This income supports my family 
2. Audience interaction is mandatory —I can’t pick and choose  
3. He brought her to my workplace, knowing what my job entails  

Jay accused me of ""encouraging"" her, gave a ""quit or we’re done"" ultimatum, and blocked me everywhere when I stood my ground.  
Now I'm sitting here like... WTF? AITA for prioritizing my family's financial needs over my friend's jealousy?

We were in love, the holidays were amazing, she even asked me to move in with her in March.

We were cordial for 3 weeks. Met June 5th returned our stuff to each other.

I did everything wrong. I wrote this letter that spoke of how I was madly in love from the moment we met. And how if we worked at it we could make it special again.

She didn’t go for it, she minimized the good times and maximized the few times where I was a flawed human. But she wanted to stay friends. I said that would be tough for me given I still loved her. The next day I called her and asked her to the zoo as friends. It was wishy washy and she agreed like an hour before and by that time I invited a guy friend I hadn’t seen in awhile.

The day after that, thinking maybe there was still a chance for our love. I could show her I can change. I showed up outside her apartment building in the morning with a coffee and a meal from her favorite market.

She got soooo pissed, and wouldn’t even come out to meet me. I backed off and left.

A few hours later I left her a voice message saying sorry, and I was only trying to do something kind.

She again was pissed.

I left her alone for 9 days. Tried calling her, left a brief voicemail to wish her well. 

She texted me the next morning “Hi (name), we can’t stay in touch, you can’t contact me, please don’t respond to this, just focus your energy on you and your life”

I was so unbelievably hurt and confused. I understand now showing up unannounced crossed a line. I was trying to do something to make her day easier, but she didn’t take it that way.

I waited a couple more weeks hoping it was just bad timing, but I wrote her an email hoping it would be less invasive. Saying 1) sorry again for showing up announced, and a grounded understanding for why things ended. 2) my growth in the time apart. 3) a statement saying what we shared mattered deeply to me. 4) an offering if she ever wanted to reconnect it was open on my side.

She replied a couple days later, “please stop contacting me, if you continue Ill have to look into a restraining order”

So of course now, I will not contact her. Period, full stop. I straight up can not reach out to her or any of her friends in any way. 

That was a week ago.

I just can’t believe it. It doesn’t make sense. This kind of response doesn’t add up. 

I don’t know why, but I still want her back. I still love her, and thinks she’s the one. I’m trying to let it go, and making progress but damn it’s hard. Everyone tells me “that means she’s not the one”, “you can’t be giving your energy to someone who doesn’t respect you”

Or at the very least I’d very much appreciate a mature 5 min phone call. But I guess closure is over rated. 

Idk, I just wish it ended different and we could stay friends like she said at first. For what we shared and the one fuck up of trying to bring her a meal, to going to a restraining order threat, it makes me feel the shittiest I’ve ever felt in my whole life.

This time I’m seeking for some good advice and guidance in order to help me gain some perspective for what’s going on. About me: 33, based in Berlin and I consider myself more of a Spoiled Girlfriend than a Sugar Baby. 

So I met this guy (58) on Seeking last week and we’ve been having a great time together. We met on Thursday, very spontaneously for a coffee and had such a cute date. I like him, I find him interesting and I would love to continue seeing him. 

I have visits coming over this week, so our meetings kinda happened one day after another, because I said I was not gonna have time when my family arrives. So we ended up spending the weekend together (my mistake?) and I really enjoyed it. We talked finances and he agreed that he would support me fully (rent, cover my debts, match my work salary that’s not a lot). But anyways, he said he was gonna make a transfer and when he did he ended up sending WAY LESS, than what I thought we agreed (although we didn’t actually said a number).

I’m someone who loves to give explanations in order to people understand where my wishes/insecurities come from, and I explained him several times but he seems a bit vague. Even though he says he understands he still doesn’t come up with “let’s agree on a number for an allowance”. 

Now, I like spending time with him, and I want to continue seeing him, but all this makes me feel insecure and makes me feel like he’s not respecting my wishes, specially since he seems like someone who understands but then doesn’t commit. 

So then I get to this question, is he playing games, or me actually trying to find a relationship in this world with an allowance is not a thing? And in the given case I’m actually being rational, how could I bring this subject up without him thinking that I’m just there for the money?

I randomly picked 2 companies that produced prestige goods not yet on the world market: coffee and groceries (in hindsight, they're pretty meh, but it's not the point), and to get in the top 3 producers i subsidized exports and it's all cool till now. But then, as soon as i stopped subsidizing exports, even if my prestige goods are dirt cheap and could potentially flood the world market, they're not exported (i had free trade to boost trade advantage as well); with subsidies i was exporting an unholy amount of prestige groceries to qing, having a treaty port since the beginning, but without subsidies it istantly stops.

Trade advantage is indeed what confuses me the most, i've read the tooltips and watched some video to understand it, but as a small nation outside a power block it feels quite hard relying on trade, because if i'm not mistaken, you need strategic interests all over the world (big ass fleet needed) and trade privilege treaties (which are quite hard to obtain) to compete in the world market (""compete"" it's not the right word, as you don't even get to do any trade without subsidizing import/exports, hell, i spent a shitton of money in import subsidies to get wood and iron even with interests in russia and sweden with trade privilege, and wood was still +50% base price in 1880).

So, what am i doing wrong? am i missing something? i'd like some tips to master trade, as i'm kinda lost.",4,1752560346.0,victoria3,7,0.84,False
