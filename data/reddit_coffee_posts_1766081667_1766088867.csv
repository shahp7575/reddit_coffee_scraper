1pq0vfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1pq0vfh/missed_calls_eating_your_time_i_built_an_app_for/,Missed calls eating your time? I built an app for that. Here’s how I survived nights of coding as a dad,"Hey Reddit!

I’m a solo founder and dad, building Voice Mate, an AI voicemail tool that handles inbound calls for you, summarizes calls instantly.

This app is a labour of love.  Most nights, I’m coding after the kids go to sleep — sometimes grinding through, sometimes giving myself a break because, well, if you’re tired, nothing sticks.

I started with a small waiting list, grown through SEO and chatting with folks here. Now we have 100+ users and $1000+ revenue, and today we’re expanding to the US with a .us domain. As it’s where we see 40% of users come from!

Some lessons I picked up along the way:
	•	Consistency > all-nighters: Even small progress counts. But don’t burn out, it’s not worth it. 

	•	User feedback is everything: I offer coffee to churned users to hear what really works. Anything as long as a churned user results in a lesson learned. 

	•	Small wins feel huge: Our first 2 sign-ups on launch day happened 5 minutes after going live. It helped so much having a waitinglist ready to go. 

	•	Unexpected communities benefit: I realized the deaf and hard-of-hearing community can get a lot  from Voice Mate, which was a beautiful surprise. Thankful I could do something back for the world there. 

We just launched on Product Hunt, and as a thank-you to the Reddit community, I’m offering a free month coupon, if you want to give it a try

Advice Needed","What do people usually get their partner when they first start dating for Christmas? We have known each other for 3 months because we worked together, but we have been officially dating for 3 weeks. We used to see each other a lot when we worked together.

I really care about him and want to give him a gift he will actually like. He likes anime, history, reading, football, coffee and cooking. We have nicknames for each other, I'm fox and he's goose. He has written 3 poems about me and they were all sweet. And he makes most if not all of the effort in our relationship so far so I feel even more that this has to be good enough. I haven't been to his place yet, so I don't know what he needs or wants at his place.

The problem is, I don’t know any good books, I don’t know how much of history he doesn't know, I just know he is very knowledgeable and passionate about it and he speaks to me for hours on it. I am not a fan of the ""experience"" gifts because we are already going to do experiences together so to me it would seem low effort. I don't watch anime or football, and I don't want to get him something cringe or too loud or something like that so I don't know what to do. Also, he is 27, so what am i supposed to get that isn't too childish?

My creative outlet is drawing, so I am thinking of drawing a simple fox and goose and a little note as an extra thing, but I have never written before and I would be bad at it. Another idea is when we went to the mall together, he picked up a vinyl he wanted so that is an option maybe. And when we went to the asian market together, he pointed out some of the snacks there.

1pq0ou7,https://www.reddit.com/r/toycameras/comments/1pq0ou7/a_diy_retro_digital_camera_project_blog_13_set_up/,A DIY retro digital camera project - Blog #13 Set up a safe low light shutter speed,"Low-light photography is challenging for all cameras. There’s no real distinction between cheap or expensive, analog or digital. This challenge becomes even more pronounced for the **screen-free digital camera** family.

With an affordable price point, compact lens modules, small sensors, and basic metering capabilities, screen-free digital cameras often struggle in low-light environments, sometimes even during conditions that aren’t particularly dark, such as blue hour or indoor. 

Across nearly all the screen-free digital cameras I’ve tested, the behavior is consistent: in low-light scenes, shutter speeds are commonly reduced to **1/15s–1/30s or even lower.** This demands either an iron-steady hand or perfectly still subjects, both of which significantly reduce the chances of capturing a clean, usable image.

Based on study, most of these cameras appear to rely on **full-frame average metering**, where exposure is calculated by averaging brightness across the entire frame. Given the limited hardware and narrow dynamic range, this is likely the most practical and affordable solution for screen-free digital cameras, at least for now.

With this method, users often times experience the scenario like below example:

[Shutter speed = 1\/30s, ISO = 174](https://preview.redd.it/84z8xv4mq08g1.png?width=2672&format=png&auto=webp&s=f05f5e0ef8eb6e696d6df70c6b3d3eb4ab2335d3)



This example photo was taken around Halloween at roughly 5:00 PM, with plenty of remaining daylight. However, because there was no direct sunlight in the background and darker objects dominated the frame, the average metering struggled. The camera prioritized keeping ISO low but failed to raise the shutter speed, resulting in motion blur in daylight. 

At that point, the question becomes:

Do you want a very clean blurry photo or a blur-free one with acceptable high ISO noise? 

I guess it is a dilemma for high-end camera users but not for screen free camera users, which embrace grain and noise, as long as it's controlled and intentional. 

While Rewindpix also uses **average metering**, we adopted a simple but effective solution to improve low-light performance: **boost the ISO higher!**

In low-light or dark indoor environments, Rewindpix is designed to increase ISO proactively to maintain a **safe minimum shutter speed of 1/60s**, as long as the scene isn’t pitch black. We believe 1/60s is a reliable threshold for a 35mm-equivalent lens, striking the right balance between stillness and acceptable noise.

Thanks to a more powerful processor and extensive ISP tuning (powered by countless late-night coffees), Rewindpix may be the **first screen-free digital camera that can be comfortably and reliably used for nighttime street shooting**.

\- its a mix of a ferry and a cruise ship, more like a ferry. Vital info to have 

\- Cruises have lots of stop off points! More valuable knowledge. She doesn't know the agenda but she tells us she's very chill and goes with the flow.  Takes each day as it comes, never know what's gonna come. Lidl or Aldi? The possibilities are endless. 

\- we get a brief glimpse of Tim in poor lighting, looking quite menacing. 

\- they're visiting a Christmas market! I thought she said she didn't know the agenda. 

\- She didn't do geography at school, only history. So she's got so much to discover about the world. She hadn't been north before except Scotland. And the most southern place she'd been to is Florida. 

\- She made sure to tell us several times she brought her snow boots, cos thats Norway! 

\- Her and Tim never have good weather when they travel! Could there be a harder trial for any couple to endure? All this proves 'the world's weather is messed up!' You just gotta roll with the weather. 

\- She's in pret! Fancy for them. Another hardship, you can't take milk through security! Fortunately they got priority boarding, so no panicking! Tim sullenly offers her a taste of a popcorn bar he bought. They got free oat milk! 

\- Videoing on her phone on the plane! Tim looks thoroughly pissed off. Gaby is riding some sort of coffee buzz. 

\- Tim is complaining about some sort of smell. No idea what he's saying, since she doesn't know still about background noise on planes. Probably got his nose too close to his arse.

\- They're flying over Great Yarmouth! One of the cultural capitals of the world

\- Her airplane coffee tastes like car boot sale coffee. They both want to sleep, but there's turbulence. The guy sitting behind can clearly see she's videoing on her phone and is eyeballing it, which is pretty funny. 

\- More complaining about the turbulence.   
  
\- More complaining when they got off the flight   
  
\- 'Go in there and get your picture taken Tim, just for the bants'

\- I have ever never had a coffee coming out of an airport, never ever, so this is a first for me'

The memories washed over me like a tide, dragging me back to the night my uncle had been unknowingly poisoned with a potent aphrodisiac. This time, however, I was determined not to become the misguided remedy he had once sought. Instead, I reached for my phone, my heart pounding with urgency, and dialed the number of the woman who held his heart—Chloe.

In my previous life, I had foolishly fallen for the man who had taken me in as a child—my Uncle Ethan, who, despite not sharing my blood, had become my world. The moment I discovered he had been drugged, I had ignored his desperate plea to contact Chloe, convincing myself that I could be the antidote to his turmoil.

But that choice had led to my undoing. A month later, I found myself grappling with the reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Uncle Ethan, trapped by societal expectations and his own sense of responsibility, was forced to marry me. Yet, the day that was supposed to signify our union was marred by tragedy—Chloe, having traveled overseas to find clarity, was taken from us, her life extinguished far too soon.

In her final moments, she had reached out to him, her cries for help ringing out in a haunting chorus of one hundred ninety-nine missed calls. But Ethan, consumed by the chaos of our wedding ceremony, had failed to answer even one. The weight of that silence hung heavy in the air, a palpable reminder of his choices.

As the day of my labor approached, the unthinkable happened—he locked me away in the basement. My pleas for help echoed off the cold, hard walls, but he merely offered me a twisted smile, a cruel spectator to my suffering. I writhed in pain, desperate to bring our child into the world, while he stood by, unmoved. In my final moments, his words pierced through the fog of agony: “If you hadn’t gotten pregnant, I never would’ve been forced to marry you, and I never would’ve missed Chloe’s calls for help. You deserve to die…”

When I opened my eyes again, I was thrust back into the very night that had set everything in motion—the night my uncle was drugged.

“Mia, call Chloe. Now!”

The urgency in his voice jolted me awake, the familiar plea sending a shiver down my spine. I had indeed returned to that fateful moment. Without a moment’s hesitation, I snatched my phone and punched in Chloe Summers’s number.

Ethan’s face was flushed with confusion and desire, his gaze unfocused and intense. In my previous life, that very look had sent me spiraling into a decision that would seal my fate—leading me straight to a tragic end.

This time, however, I steeled myself against his gaze and hurried out of his bedroom.

“Uncle Ethan, just hold on. The love of your life will be here in ten minutes,” I called over my shoulder, my heart racing.

As I closed the door behind me, I caught a glimpse of him struggling to form my name, hoarse syllables escaping his lips like a desperate plea. But I chose to ignore him, slamming the door shut, resolute in my decision to stay outside.

Ten minutes later, Chloe burst through the door, her expression a mix of concern and relief. She took in my composed appearance and visibly relaxed, her tension easing as she recognized that I was still intact.

Before she could step inside, she shot me a sideways glance, her voice laced with authority. “You can go. You’re not needed here.”

I turned on my heel, retreating to my own room, the weight of her dismissal settling over me like a heavy cloak. It wasn’t until the night had deepened and silence enveloped the house that I finally exhaled, a long, shaky breath escaping my lips. In my previous life, I had loved Ethan so deeply that I had willingly become his so-called cure, only to find myself pregnant and trapped in a cycle of despair.

In the end, he had succumbed to pressure and married me, but on our wedding day, tragedy struck, and Chloe was lost to us forever. After her death, he had retreated into silence, burying his grief until my due date, when he had locked me away, abandoning me in my time of need.

I had begged him to save me, to save our child, but he had turned a blind eye, watching as both our lives slipped away in agony, all in the name of vengeance for the love he had lost.

But this time, I had done what he asked—I had brought Chloe back to him, and soon, I would be free from the chains of this life, leaving him behind for good.

The following morning, as the sun streamed through the windows, I found Chloe already seated at the Reeds’ breakfast table.

Ethan, with a casual air, forked up a bite of scrambled eggs and washed it down with a sip of coffee before announcing to everyone, “From now on, Chloe’s my girlfriend. I’m going to marry her. All of you, treat her well.”

His gaze shifted to me, and he pointed his fork in my direction, a commanding gesture. “Especially you. Be nice to your future aunt, and don’t cause me trouble.”

I nodded, my expression blank, while Chloe’s lips curled into a triumphant smile, a look of victory radiating from her. I chose to ignore it, pushing my half-eaten breakfast away, the taste of bitterness lingering in my mouth.

But as I stood to leave, I heard her voice break, low and wounded.

“Ethan, does Mia not want me in this family? I know she means a lot to you. If she doesn’t like me, maybe I shouldn’t stay here.”

Tears cascaded down her cheeks, her performance as pitiful as it was calculated.

Ethan’s brows furrowed, his annoyance palpable as he called out to me, “Mia, sit down and finish your breakfast.”

I remained standing, my voice calm and steady. “I’m full.”

His expression darkened, impatience creeping into his tone. “Mia, I told you to sit down. Do you not understand plain English?”

“Have you forgotten the most basic manners? You grew up in my house. Is this what I taught you?”

In this life, I had no intention of becoming entangled with either of them, yet they refused to let me go. I turned back to them, offering a polite smile.

“Uncle Ethan, Aunt Chloe, I really am full. You two enjoy your breakfast—I’ll excuse myself.”

The memories washed over me like a tide, dragging me back to the night my uncle had been unknowingly poisoned with a potent aphrodisiac. This time, however, I was determined not to become the misguided remedy he had once sought. Instead, I reached for my phone, my heart pounding with urgency, and dialed the number of the woman who held his heart—Chloe.

In my previous life, I had foolishly fallen for the man who had taken me in as a child—my Uncle Ethan, who, despite not sharing my blood, had become my world. The moment I discovered he had been drugged, I had ignored his desperate plea to contact Chloe, convincing myself that I could be the antidote to his turmoil.

But that choice had led to my undoing. A month later, I found myself grappling with the reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Uncle Ethan, trapped by societal expectations and his own sense of responsibility, was forced to marry me. Yet, the day that was supposed to signify our union was marred by tragedy—Chloe, having traveled overseas to find clarity, was taken from us, her life extinguished far too soon.

In her final moments, she had reached out to him, her cries for help ringing out in a haunting chorus of one hundred ninety-nine missed calls. But Ethan, consumed by the chaos of our wedding ceremony, had failed to answer even one. The weight of that silence hung heavy in the air, a palpable reminder of his choices.

As the day of my labor approached, the unthinkable happened—he locked me away in the basement. My pleas for help echoed off the cold, hard walls, but he merely offered me a twisted smile, a cruel spectator to my suffering. I writhed in pain, desperate to bring our child into the world, while he stood by, unmoved. In my final moments, his words pierced through the fog of agony: “If you hadn’t gotten pregnant, I never would’ve been forced to marry you, and I never would’ve missed Chloe’s calls for help. You deserve to die…”

When I opened my eyes again, I was thrust back into the very night that had set everything in motion—the night my uncle was drugged.

“Mia, call Chloe. Now!”

The urgency in his voice jolted me awake, the familiar plea sending a shiver down my spine. I had indeed returned to that fateful moment. Without a moment’s hesitation, I snatched my phone and punched in Chloe Summers’s number.

Ethan’s face was flushed with confusion and desire, his gaze unfocused and intense. In my previous life, that very look had sent me spiraling into a decision that would seal my fate—leading me straight to a tragic end.

This time, however, I steeled myself against his gaze and hurried out of his bedroom.

“Uncle Ethan, just hold on. The love of your life will be here in ten minutes,” I called over my shoulder, my heart racing.

As I closed the door behind me, I caught a glimpse of him struggling to form my name, hoarse syllables escaping his lips like a desperate plea. But I chose to ignore him, slamming the door shut, resolute in my decision to stay outside.

Ten minutes later, Chloe burst through the door, her expression a mix of concern and relief. She took in my composed appearance and visibly relaxed, her tension easing as she recognized that I was still intact.

Before she could step inside, she shot me a sideways glance, her voice laced with authority. “You can go. You’re not needed here.”

I turned on my heel, retreating to my own room, the weight of her dismissal settling over me like a heavy cloak. It wasn’t until the night had deepened and silence enveloped the house that I finally exhaled, a long, shaky breath escaping my lips. In my previous life, I had loved Ethan so deeply that I had willingly become his so-called cure, only to find myself pregnant and trapped in a cycle of despair.

In the end, he had succumbed to pressure and married me, but on our wedding day, tragedy struck, and Chloe was lost to us forever. After her death, he had retreated into silence, burying his grief until my due date, when he had locked me away, abandoning me in my time of need.

I had begged him to save me, to save our child, but he had turned a blind eye, watching as both our lives slipped away in agony, all in the name of vengeance for the love he had lost.

But this time, I had done what he asked—I had brought Chloe back to him, and soon, I would be free from the chains of this life, leaving him behind for good.

The following morning, as the sun streamed through the windows, I found Chloe already seated at the Reeds’ breakfast table.

Ethan, with a casual air, forked up a bite of scrambled eggs and washed it down with a sip of coffee before announcing to everyone, “From now on, Chloe’s my girlfriend. I’m going to marry her. All of you, treat her well.”

His gaze shifted to me, and he pointed his fork in my direction, a commanding gesture. “Especially you. Be nice to your future aunt, and don’t cause me trouble.”

I nodded, my expression blank, while Chloe’s lips curled into a triumphant smile, a look of victory radiating from her. I chose to ignore it, pushing my half-eaten breakfast away, the taste of bitterness lingering in my mouth.

But as I stood to leave, I heard her voice break, low and wounded.

“Ethan, does Mia not want me in this family? I know she means a lot to you. If she doesn’t like me, maybe I shouldn’t stay here.”

Tears cascaded down her cheeks, her performance as pitiful as it was calculated.

Ethan’s brows furrowed, his annoyance palpable as he called out to me, “Mia, sit down and finish your breakfast.”

I remained standing, my voice calm and steady. “I’m full.”

His expression darkened, impatience creeping into his tone. “Mia, I told you to sit down. Do you not understand plain English?”

“Have you forgotten the most basic manners? You grew up in my house. Is this what I taught you?”

In this life, I had no intention of becoming entangled with either of them, yet they refused to let me go. I turned back to them, offering a polite smile.

First week after finally going off completely I felt fine. On the second week, I started having really intense dreams, waking up with really bad anxiety and nausea and brain zaps making the mornings hard for me. 
For the first time in my entire adult life I've been unable to drink coffee because my heart is already racing so fast when I wake up. 

Since i've had a cold lately and also started a new adhd med, I have no idea if these symptoms could be attributed to pristiq withdrawal or are another factor

This has affected my life in many ways, especially my social life. On normal days, I sleep 12 hours, and in winter it can go up to 14 hours. Texts and calls don’t wake me, only someone knocking on my door or gently touching me. I’ve been telling my family this for years.

Recently, it’s finals week, and with the stress of nursing school and winter fatigue, my sleep debt has gotten worse. On exam mornings, I often go without sleep, which makes my sleep longer and heavier on break days. During this stressful time, I try to make plans on my free days to go out because the weather has been nice , I even send suggestions of places to go with my mom or siblings.

A few days ago, I planned to take a short nap around 6 a.m. so I could get up later and enjoy a break. I texted my mom “Please wake me up at 12 p.m.” I ended up waking at 6 p.m. When I went downstairs, I saw leftover coffee from my favorite place and shopping bags. I asked my mom if they went out, and she said yes. I asked why no one woke me up. She said: “I texted you, that’s enough.”

I was really mad because I’ve been telling her for years that texts don’t work. I said “Why can’t anyone knock on my door? It’s not that hard.” She replied “It’s not my business that you’re lazy.” Then she added: “I’m anemic too and I’m more functional than you.” This just hurt me because it not about the hang out it self but the fact they didn’t put effort to bring me around them or understand and this applies to my siblings as well.

So now it been weeks and i have been going alone or my friends who understand me and don’t blame for my fatigue but i get blamed by my mom that i don’t appreciate family time like my siblings and that i been isolating my self .

I’m hurt, invalidated, and exhausted, and I feel trapped in a no-win situation. I’m trying to manage my health, finals stress, and my social life as best I can, but my family refuses to understand or accommodate my condition.",4,1766087967.0,AITAH,11,0.83,False

1pq0fzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MailOrderBrideFacts/comments/1pq0fzs/some_info_on_the_new_mexico_city_office/,Some info on the new Mexico City Office!,"This is an overview of our goals in Mexico City and the advantages we offer. Come see us on our [first tour - it will be on the schedule soon!](https://afamatchmaker.com/tour/order/latin-tour-order.shtml)   

***“What is it like to visit the AFA Mexico office? What is the surrounding neighborhood like, and what activities, restaurants, or date spots are available nearby if I decide to start my date in that area?”***



Our office is located in **one of the trendiest—if not** ***the*** **trendiest—neighborhoods in all of Mexico City: La Condesa.**

**(Short story:)**

This area is famous for its lifestyle, safety, and vibrant energy. You’ll find:

* Over **400 restaurants, cafés, and bars** within walking distance  
* A **very safe, clean, and walkable environment**  
* A European-style atmosphere with tree-lined streets  
* **Pet-friendly parks**, boutique hotels, and stylish architecture  
* One of the **largest expat communities** in the entire country  

It’s the kind of place where everything happens outdoors—people walking, jogging, having coffee, dating, and socializing. It’s lively yet relaxed, modern yet full of character. Many visitors say it feels like a mix between **Barcelona, Paris, and New York**, all in one.

2. Mexico's proximity to the USA. ***“How is Mexico a better option in terms of distance compared to Colombia, Peru or other countries in Eastern Europe or Asia? Are there many direct flights from major cities in the US to Mexico City?”***

One of Mexico’s biggest advantages is **how close it is to the United States**, especially when compared to countries like Colombia, Ukraine, or other parts of Eastern Europe.

Mexico City has **direct flights from nearly all major U.S. cities**, including:

* Los Angeles  
* Dallas  
* Houston  
* Miami  
* New York  
* Chicago  
* Atlanta  

In most cases, flights are **between 2.5 and 5 hours**, often non-stop and very affordable. This makes traveling easy, flexible, and practical—not just for a first visit, but for ongoing trips throughout a relationship.

Unlike long-distance relationships that require 12–15 hour flights and expensive international travel, **Mexico allows couples to see each other more frequently and with far less stress.**

**Do you want to end up having to pay 200- 300 USD for your wife’s ticket when she wants to visit your in-laws or over a thousand?** 

Distance matters in real life—and Mexico simply makes everything easier.



3**. Catholic country.** ***“What can a Christian or Catholic man expect when seeking a woman who shares his faith and values?’***



Mexico is a deeply **Catholic and Christian-rooted country**, and this strongly influences family values, dating culture, and relationships.

Most Mexican women are raised in **traditional, family-oriented, and faith-based households**, where values such as loyalty, respect, commitment, and marriage still play a central role.

For a **Christian or Catholic man**, this creates a very natural alignment.  
 You can expect:

* A strong appreciation for **marriage and family**  
* A more **conservative approach to relationships**  
* Clear traditional values around commitment and children  

There is also a significant **Christian evangelical community** in Mexico. Even when one partner is Catholic and the other is Christian, there is usually **no conflict**—the values tend to blend seamlessly.

For men seeking a woman who truly shares traditional moral and family values, **Mexico is one of the best cultural matches available.**



# 4. “Are Most Mexican Women Willing to Move to the U.S.?”

In general, **Mexican women are very open to the idea of moving to the United States—especially when their quality of life, career opportunities, and future improve as a result.**

Most have a **positive view of Americans**, and American men are generally **highly respected and well regarded**.

For many women:

* Moving to the U.S. represents a **step forward in lifestyle, career, and long-term security**  
* It opens doors to **global opportunities**  
* It offers **better financial stability for building a family**  

At the same time, Mexico’s proximity means that **traveling back to visit family is fast, easy, and affordable**, which removes one of the biggest emotional barriers to relocation.

This is a major advantage compared to long-distance relationships in Eastern Europe or Asia. Even though beautiful and wonderful women exist in those regions, **the long-term effort, cost, and distance can put serious strain on a marriage**.

With Mexican women, you benefit from:

* Strong **loyalty and family values**  
* A genuine **desire to build a home and have children**  
* A **realistic, close-distance international relationship**  

**The takeaway:**  
 When choosing a wife, it’s wise to think long-term. Marrying someone who lives **closer to your home country** makes love, family life, and logistics far simpler and more sustainable.

•	A small but engaged waiting list is gold. Out of 600 people, the first 2 signed up 5 minutes after launch. Thats the validation one needs after building for months

•	Consistency beats “big burst” work every time. Nightly progress adds up. But also: do take that break, or nap or call it a night if you are tired.

We just launched on Product Hunt today, and reached the top 10! Would love your feedback, ideas, or just to hear what resonates:

Had a great time. It was simple but basically we got a coffee and then walked around the town and a park for a couple hours. We talked all the way. Laughed. Hugged when we met and to say goodbye. I think we’re both a little socially anxious and I know I was really nervous. 

We said goodbye and an hour later I sent her a message saying “Hey, hope you made it home safe. Had a really nice time and was lovely to meet you, I’d like to see you again soon 😁” 

And a few hours later she said “You too! Yea had such a good time let’s deffo do something again! :)”

And then I replied “Perfect, I was thinking something maybe between Christmas and New Years if you’re free then?”

And that was 2 days ago. And since then nothing. Not read it, not a reply not an acknowledgement. What I want is for someone to be really keen on me. If I like a girl I won’t be clingy but I’ll reply within an hour if I see the message. I’ll engage in conversation and I’ll want to see them. I don’t buy “sorry I’ve been busy” if she says that because firstly if you had “such a good time” with someone you’d make time to reply to them or talk to them. And everyone no a days are on there phones at least a few times a day.

I’ve been struggling with feeling that my to-do list is infinite, even though my energy isn't.

I learned about the **Plimsoll Line**—that marking on a ship’s hull that indicates the maximum depth to which the vessel may be safely immersed. If you load past that line, the ship is in danger.

I realized I needed a Plimsoll Line for my own life and have a measure of control over my life. I also wanted to focus on the good things in life that tend to forget about.

I built **Plimsoll Line** as a side project to help manage that ""overloaded"" feeling. It’s a way to understand your own emotional state that focuses on your capacity, not just your tasks. It also encourages you to think about the good things in your daily life and take actions to address negative thought when certain Reminders items grow bigger.

**The Concept:**

Most apps want you to do more and focus on raw productivity. This app helps you identify when you need to do something to reduce your anxiety. It’s designed to be calming, using haptics and visuals to gently show you when you’re crossing your emotional safety limit.

The Business Model (The Experiment):

I’m a solo dev, and I’m weary of so many apps requiring a subscription. It just adds to the anxiety rather than reducing it, lol

* **No Subscriptions.**
* **No Ads.**
* **No Personal Data Tracking.**

Instead, I’m trying a **Tip Jar** approach. The app is free (Consumable IAP). If it helps you find some calm, you can buy me a coffee. If not, use it for free with my blessing. Please do leave a review if it helps you in any way, and please do contact me from within the app if you run into an issue or have suggestions (or say hi!)

I’d love to hear your feedback on the concept and specifically on the Tip Jar model—do you prefer this over subscriptions for an app like this? And what do you think of the approach of letting users have a sense of control in their lives?

I’m a 30 years old performance artist and writer. I like to build worlds in which many of my characters and imagination come to life. Whether it be in the form of an installation piece or a play, I love creating stories and telling them. Besides that, my other passions include travelling, walking everywhere (when weather permits, Canada is cold af), and of course telling men and women what to do, when to do it and how to do it.



I’ve been into femdom for the past year and it’s been a very hot way to make my life go round.

I’m usually in a coffee shop, working on grants, writing, editing or online shopping my next domme outfit. 

I’m a pretty sensual but demanding domme. You shall call me Princess, Goddess or Mistress. If you want to talk to me, you can refer to my throne for tribute or use etransfer if in Canada ([herkalypso@gmail.com](mailto:herkalypso@gmail.com)). I won’t acknowledge unless you do what is required, which is tribute.



My fav kinks involve findom, degradation, foot worship, praise, cucking, spitting, human ashtray.

I don’t do scat or ageplay.

He cuts me off and asks, ""Well, isn't there a premium processing fee we can pay to skip the line? Like TSA PreCheck?""

He wasn't joking. He legitimately thought the justice system had a Fast Pass option if he threw enough money at it.

I honestly didn't know how to respond professionally to that. The disconnect between client expectations and the glacial pace of the actual court system feels wider than ever lately. It feels like 50% of the job is just managing the shock when they realize lawsuits take months, not minutes.

Is anyone else seeing a spike in this kind of instant gratification demands, or did we just attract a special batch of clients this month?

Would appreciate the experts here to give my situation a look and make some recommendations on anything that can be better.

* Income: $180,000 combined
* Average monthly spend and categories:
   * takeout/restaurants: $600
   * coffee shops: $100
   * groceries: $1000 (Costco is about half of this, the other half is at traditional grocery stores)
   * gas: $75 (at Costco)
   * travel: $300/mo average (we typically spend big amounts in 1-2 months and nothing for the rest of the year)
   * Other entertainment: $200 (netflix, movies, PS+, etc, video games)
   * Gym: $250 (for two)
* Open to Business Cards: Not sure what the downside would be, so yes.
* What's the purpose of your next card? I think Travel would be great. We have the Southwest card since we fly mostly Southwest because of where we live. I've looked into some other options, but the travel portal points/redemptions game seems very complicated and I haven't dug deep into what options are worth it yet.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Central Connecticut State vs. Fairfield: A Parlor Trick of Points and Parlays**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a same-game parlay that’s smoother than a Darin Smith Jr. crossover and more predictable than a Netflix algorithm. Central Connecticut State (6-4) hosts Fairfield (6-5) in a MAAC clash where the Blue Devils are favored by 6-6.5 points, with the total set at 142-143.5. Let’s break this down with the precision of a point guard reading a zone defense and the humor of a comedian roasting a bad pun.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Central Connecticut’s home dominance is as reliable as a coffee addict needing their morning brew: 3-0 at home this season. Their offense averages **80.1 points per game**, a number that makes Fairfield’s defense look like a sieve at a black Friday sale. Fairfield, meanwhile, allows **75.5 points per game**, which is 4.6 more than Central’s average. If you’re keeping track at home, that means Central’s offense could outscore Fairfield’s defense by **4.6 points per game**—a stat that sounds like a recipe for a lopsided score.

The three-point battle? It’s a mismatch straight out of a rom-com. Fairfield makes **7.6 threes per game**, while Central allows **8.6**. It’s like watching a toddler try to beat a pro at darts—adorable, but not exactly a threat. Meanwhile, Central’s Darin Smith Jr. is a scoring machine at **23 points in his last game**, shooting 50% from the field. If he’s anything like a popcorn kernel, he’ll just keep popping (points) in this matchup.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Circuses, and Other Distractions

No major injuries reported for either team, which is surprising given Fairfield’s Brandon Benjamin averages **12.3 points and 9.7 rebounds**. If he’s healthy, he’ll be the Stags’ best shot at keeping this game close—assuming he doesn’t spend the game juggling rebounds like a circus act. Central’s Smith Jr., on the other hand, is as reliable as a microwave timer: If it s

It's there, we feel its presence, we know how it impacts us, but we can't physically show it to people or point it out. Hard as we try to articulate what's going on in our minds, it often feels like talking to a brick wall. 

Just this past week, I attempted to explain my anxiety to a friend. We were having coffee, sunlight streaming through the café window, steaming mugs between us. I was trying, as best as I could, to paint a picture of what it truly feels like to be in the midst of an anxiety episode. The tightening chest, the overwhelming waves of dread, the irrational panic over everyday things. I felt like a muted television, full of noiseless chaos while the world just went on around me. 

All this boils down to one pressing query. I wonder, what are some ways you've found to effectively communicate what mental illness feels like, so that others can understand and empathize?",2,1766087096.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

Listening to him referring to the L.A. fire rebuilding efforts and his personal campaign against safety has shown me that he will repeatedly speak on construction-related topics that are outside of his understanding. I'm a contruction inspector with fifteen years of deep foundations experience in civil and industrial sector projects, and some of the things I've heard him bring up would get him laughed off of most job sites. 

For example, he constantly refers to houses getting rebuilt in his area having caissons installed. They're actually installing piles. It sounds like he's referring to Auger Cast-In-Place piles or possibly drilled shafts, due to his referencing reinforcing steel cages. Caissons are a completely different thing that would be for specific industrial applications. The buildings that require these piles have a minimum bearing capacity that needs to be achieved. It has nothing to do with safety. No piles, no building. The new buildings that are replacing what was at that location previously is a different structure with a different bearing capacity. Also, the ground conditions and environment of these sites have likely changed, so the project requirements are different. Someone who knows construction would know this. Also on the topic of piles, I've heard him call them ""pylons"" before. That's those orange construction cones.

Adam claimed awhile back on an episode of Adam and Drew that he could've been a structural engineer. I almost spit out my coffee when I heard that! I reference plans drawn up by structural engineers all the time that would give most people a headache if they saw the pages and pages of physics and math that goes into basic structural engineering. I was thinking, ""Wow, does Adam really think he could've been a structural engineer when he's made a career boasting about his inability to read?""

I could cite more examples of ignorant claims, but this post has gone on long enough. I'm curious if anyone else who follows this sub has been bothered by his lack of knowledge on display?

1ppzzys,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1ppzzys/how_to_choose_the_right_coffee_beans_for_your/,How to Choose the Right Coffee Beans for Your Taste,"Choosing the right coffee beans is one of the most important decisions you can make as a coffee drinker. The beans you choose shape the aroma, flavor, strength, and even how your coffee makes you feel throughout the day. While brewing methods and equipment matter, great coffee always starts with the right beans. Understanding how to select beans that match your personal taste can transform your daily cup from ordinary to exceptional.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from bean varieties and roast levels to freshness, grind size, and ethical sourcing. Along the way, you will also discover important facts that help you make confident, informed choices every time you buy coffee.

# Understanding Coffee Bean Varieties

Before diving into flavor profiles, it is essential to understand the two main types of coffee beans available worldwide. Although many varieties exist, most coffee comes from just two species.

Arabica coffee beans account for about 60 to 70 percent of the world’s coffee production. They are known for their smooth, complex flavors and pleasant acidity. Arabica beans often carry tasting notes such as fruit, floral, chocolate, or caramel. Because they grow at higher altitudes and require specific climate conditions, they are generally more expensive.

Robusta [coffee beans](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden), on the other hand, contain almost twice as much caffeine as Arabica. As a result, they taste stronger, more bitter, and earthier. Robusta is often described as having woody, nutty, or rubbery notes. These beans are commonly used in espresso blends to add strength and crema.

If you prefer mild, aromatic coffee with layered flavors, Arabica is usually the better choice. However, if you enjoy bold, intense coffee or want a stronger caffeine kick, Robusta may suit your taste better. Many blends combine both to balance smoothness and strength.

# Knowing Your Flavor Preferences

Once you understand the bean types, the next step is identifying your flavor preferences. Coffee flavors vary widely, and knowing what you enjoy makes choosing beans much easier.

If you enjoy sweet and smooth flavors, look for beans with notes of chocolate, caramel, honey, or nuts. These are commonly found in beans from Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Central America.

If you prefer fruity and bright coffee, beans with citrus, berry, or apple notes may appeal to you. African coffees, especially those from Ethiopia and Kenya, are famous for their vibrant acidity and fruity profiles.

If you enjoy deep and bold flavors, look for smoky, spicy, or cocoa-heavy beans. These are often found in darker roasts or beans from regions like Sumatra.

Paying attention to tasting notes on coffee packaging can help guide your selection. Although tasting notes are not added flavors, they describe natural characteristics that develop during roasting.

# Choosing the Right Roast Level

Roast level has a major impact on how coffee tastes, sometimes even more than the bean’s origin. Coffee beans are typically categorized into light, medium, and dark roasts.

Light roast coffee retains most of the bean’s original characteristics. It has higher acidity and brighter flavors, making it ideal for people who enjoy complex, fruity, or floral notes. An important fact to note is that light roast beans actually contain slightly more caffeine by weight than darker roasts.

Medium roast coffee offers a balanced flavor profile. It combines acidity, sweetness, and body in a way that appeals to many drinkers. This roast level often highlights chocolatey or nutty flavors without overpowering bitterness.

Dark roast coffee has bold, smoky, and sometimes bitter flavors. The roasting process reduces acidity and brings out deep, roasted notes. While many believe dark roast has more caffeine, it actually contains slightly less due to longer roasting times.

If you are new to specialty coffee, medium roast is often a safe starting point. From there, you can experiment with lighter or darker roasts depending on your taste preferences.

# Single-Origin vs Blended Coffee

Another key decision is choosing between single-origin coffee and blends. Each option offers a unique experience.

Single-origin coffee comes from one specific region, farm, or country. Because of this, it reflects the unique growing conditions of that area, including soil, altitude, and climate. Single-origin beans are ideal for coffee drinkers who enjoy exploring distinct and consistent flavor profiles.

Blended coffee combines beans from multiple origins. Roasters create blends to achieve balance, consistency, and complexity. Blends are often designed to taste the same year-round, making them a reliable choice for everyday drinking.

If you enjoy discovering new flavors and tasting the character of different regions, single-origin coffee is a great option. However, if you value consistency and balance, blends may be a better fit.

# Considering Freshness and Roast Date

Freshness is one of the most overlooked aspects of buying coffee beans. Coffee begins to lose flavor soon after roasting, even if the beans look perfectly fine.

Always check the roast date on the packaging rather than the expiration date. Ideally, coffee should be consumed within two to four weeks of roasting for the best flavor. After this period, aroma and taste gradually fade.

It is also important to allow freshly roasted beans to rest for a few days before brewing. This process, known as degassing, allows excess carbon dioxide to escape and improves extraction during brewing.

Buying from local roasters or specialty coffee shops often ensures fresher beans compared to mass-produced options.

# Matching Beans to Your Brewing Method

Different brewing methods highlight different aspects of coffee, so choosing beans that match your brewing style is essential.

For drip coffee makers, medium roast beans with balanced flavors work well. They produce a smooth, consistent cup that appeals to a wide range of tastes.

For pour-over methods, light to medium roasts are often preferred. These brewing styles emphasize clarity and subtle flavor notes, making them ideal for single-origin coffees.

For espresso machines, medium to dark roast beans are commonly used. They provide rich body, lower acidity, and a more intense flavor that stands up well to pressure brewing.

For French press brewing, medium to dark roasts are popular because they produce a full-bodied, robust cup.

Understanding how your brewing method interacts with the beans helps you get the best possible results.

# Grind Size and Its Impact on Taste

Although grind size comes after choosing beans, it plays a crucial role in flavor extraction. Using the wrong grind size can ruin even the best coffee beans.

Coarse grinds are best for French press and cold brew. Fine grinds are ideal for espresso, while medium grinds suit drip and pour-over methods.

An important fact to remember is that uneven grind size leads to inconsistent extraction. Investing in a quality burr grinder can significantly improve flavor consistency and overall taste.

# Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability

Today, many coffee drinkers care not only about taste but also about where their coffee comes from. Ethical sourcing ensures fair wages for farmers and promotes environmentally responsible practices.

Look for certifications such as Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, or organic labels. These certifications indicate that the coffee meets certain social and environmental standards.

Supporting ethically sourced coffee not only helps farming communities but often results in better-quality beans. Farmers who are paid fairly can invest more in quality control and sustainable farming methods.

# Understanding Caffeine Content and Sensitivity

Caffeine levels vary depending on bean type, roast level, and brewing method. Robusta beans contain significantly more caffeine than Arabica, making them more stimulating but also more bitter.

Light roasts retain slightly more caffeine than dark roasts, while brewing methods like espresso deliver more caffeine per ounce but less per serving.

If you are sensitive to caffeine, choosing Arabica beans and darker roasts may help reduce its impact. Additionally, brewing methods like cold brew tend to be smoother and easier on the stomach.

# Reading Labels and Coffee Descriptions

Coffee packaging often includes useful information, but it can also be confusing. Learning how to read labels helps you make better choices.

Look for details such as origin, roast level, tasting notes, and processing method. Washed coffees tend to be cleaner and brighter, while natural or dry-processed coffees often taste fruitier and sweeter.

Avoid vague descriptions like “premium” without supporting details. Transparency is usually a sign of quality and care in production.

# Experimenting to Find Your Perfect Match

Ultimately, choosing the right coffee beans is a personal journey. Taste is subjective, and what works for one person may not work for another.

Try small batches of different beans and keep notes on what you like and dislike. Over time, patterns will emerge that make future selections easier.

Consider subscribing to a coffee sampler or visiting local roasters to explore new options. Experimentation is the best way to refine your palate and discover new favorites.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing the right coffee beans for your taste is about understanding yourself as much as understanding coffee. You can also find some of the best coffee from TrueGether, also considered the best [eBay alternative](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html). By learning about bean varieties, roast levels, freshness, brewing methods, and ethical sourcing, you empower yourself to make better decisions with every purchase.

With time and curiosity, your appreciation for coffee will deepen, and each cup will become more enjoyable. Whether you prefer bright and fruity or rich and bold, the right beans are out there waiting for you to discover them.

The last 5 years of my life have not been good.

I had a rough start to adulthood. The last 2 years I had to re-start my life moving back to my hometown after getting a divorce (got married at 20 and divorced at 23)

I work at a comfortable enough job and live paycheck to paycheck paying for my one bedroom apartment.

However, I am not happy. I have never lived my life just for me. I was raised to follow gender roles and my ambitions were constantly squashed. It’s led me to be working a job I dislike in banking and live in my hometown. I don’t want to spend all my 20s here!

I am a skilled artist with my associates of arts. I looked into pursuing a higher education but decided it may not be the best choice considering my circumstances and the current economy.

I live in the south and I want to move to a place that has a thriving art scene, public transportation/walkability, and affordable living. I’d like to rent an apartment in a smaller city. Not NY sized but maybe more Nashville, or at least close to one.

I’m flexible on weather, but I would prefer 4 seasons. Preferably somewhere that isn’t rainy every day, but normal amounts of rain is great.

I have a dog, also.

I like the mountains, I like the beach.

I definitely don’t want to live in the south or anywhere in California. No Cincinnati, no Chicago, no Nashville.

I also already looked into Canada and Europe and those are not options for me.

My work experience is retail, a bespoke coffee shop, corporate and local banking, and art in various forms.

I’m pretty particular about my food. I follow a diet and plan my snacks carefully because it helps me stay consistent and reduces stress for me. I usually buy protein-added snacks, dark chocolate, tofu, ground coffee instead of instant, green tea, etc. I plan and ration these for the whole month (which isn't a lot in quantity but is it what I want) so I don’t have to think about it later. 

The issue is that my brother regularly eats my snacks without telling me. He also goes through my things in general. This stresses me out a lot because I barely get any allowance, and I had to drop my internship due to college pressure, so I don’t really have extra funds to keep replacing things unexpectedly.

What bothers me isn’t even just the food it’s that he doesn’t tell me or replace it. If I knew something was used up, I could plan and replace it. When I go to have something I specifically saved for a day and it’s gone, it throws me off and makes me anxious.

I recently asked him to at least tell me if he eats something from my stock so I can replace it or adjust. My parents got involved and called me an asshole for being mad about it. They said food in the house shouldn’t be “mine,” that I’m overreacting, and that I’m a bad sister for getting irritated over my brother eating snacks.

For context, my family isn’t particular about food at all  they eat whatever’s available. But I am, and that’s why I plan ahead and buy specific things for myself. Also something about people going through my personal items doesn't sit right with me. I keep my journals and souvenir around the same place.

I went on a date with him after speaking for 5 days, he doesn’t drive (I do drive) and he met me where I work so that was fine. He made a comment about me paying for coffee when we meet up but I said ‘yeah I can pay for coffee’ but didn’t think he meant it so we got coffee and he didn’t even offer at all just let me pay and stood awkwardly (it didn’t bother me too much at the time), the date was okay he’s nice very chatty so maybe he was nervous but he smokes weed on a daily. He has a full time job in an office and says he spends his pay each month paying for his parents mortgage and bills ( I respect this as I do something similar). He is good looking and seems kind hearted and thinks I’m really nice already. 

My question is, when discussing if we should meet again he said yeah sure a walk and a coffee and i suggested dinner but he told me he’s short this month and next month he’s got to pay for a boiler so doesn’t have any money and so he said we can just go for a walk and get a coffee - my first reaction was sympathetic to this because he seems like a nice guy but I’m concerned if we meet up again I’ll be paying and paying a good few times after this. 

He made a ‘joke’ of I should drop him all the way home which made me feel like his mum but he seems interested in his office job and says he’s working hard to move up or find a better one so I appreciate that.

i'm also hyper-verbal and can easily understand complex or ""unusual"" language, though i don't really tend to use it in casual conversation unless it veers into a topic that calls for it. i'm normally horrible at articulating my thoughts when speaking vocally, however, but when i type it's a lot easier because i can think about it and revise/edit how i've phrased things. 

regarding socialization (because that's relevant), i would say i'm quite open and personable, bubbly even, but i can be super awkward at first. i either prefer 1 on 1 interaction OR a massive group, most of the in between just feels strange to me. the best i can do there is a group of 4 including myself because then people could kinda pair off.

oh i'm also a subjectivist and a philosophical absurdist. not the ""haha i'm so quirky and random"" type, but the ""even if there isn't any inherent and probable meaning to the universe, there are things that i find important, so i will apply personal meaning to them, regardless of if it actually means anything on the cosmic scale"" type, to dumb it down to its core principle lol. anyways i think a LOT. 

I like to believe i'm fairly nonjudgmental and open about things, i can often separate a topic from the real life application of it. First example off the top of my head would be trauma or emotional issues, i can speak about them and listen to them quite freely without having many issues, if any at all. I do struggle to offer comfort though if it's not actually going to help anything/if it's enabling. I'm usually a lot better at offering potential solutions and helping via analyzing their situation from an outsider perspective. the most common way for me to empathize is by relating what's happening to them with what's happened to me to try and clear up why i see their situation the way i do. 

speaking of, i've spent a ridiculous amount of time working on myself and figuring out what's wrong/what lead to these issues/why they manifest the way they do/what i can do to change for the better/what i'm already doing right. most of this is due to early social isolation but it has helped a lot i think. though, i do feel wayyyy ahead internally while still being quite behind in the real world. it's a bit unfortunate but i'll make it work lol.

Started heavily using coffee two years ago when classes got harder, 7am lectures, late night study sessions, the usual, and it became a habit pretty quickly. Spending way more at the campus cafeteria than I thought, needing more and more just to function.   
  
I actually tried quitting about a year ago over the holidays, but every time I went back to classes I felt like I had to drink coffee just to keep up. Last holidays I kept drinking because I had a summer job and felt like I needed it. Now it's not just affecting my wallet (student budget, you know), but it's also making me super anxious and I even get heart palpitations sometimes. That actually started to scare me, and it's one of the reasons I decided to quit for real this time.   
  
Now I'm taking advantage of being on holidays again and I'm actually on my longest streak of this year, about 10 days without coffee! I’ve been tracking my days and journaling, mostly using sunflower sober to stay accountable. I've had some headaches and felt really tired and sleepy, but since I don't have too many responsibilities right now I can handle it. The thing is, next time I go back to college I'm worried about how I'll manage. I've always had a hard time trying to stay awake in the morning and coffee genuinely helps me wake up. It's frustrating.

The Minnesota-founded brand is staking its future on the cozier, “sit down and stay a while” cafes rather than the drive-thru “cabin” model Caribou bet on in 2019.

The feel is strikingly similar to the original 1992 storefront, also in Edina, that launched the chain.

1ppzovv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lonely_Vehicle6433/comments/1ppzovv/advice_for_biologicalbiomedical_science_phd/,Advice for Biological/Biomedical Science Ph.D. Interviews,"Hi everyone! Back in August, I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1m97m6h/advice_for_biologicalbiomedical_sciences_phd/) with advice for applying for Ph.D. programs in the biological science. As promised, I wanted to share some tips for preparing for interviews/recruitment weekends, acing your interview, and general timeline on post-interview notifications. If you want to see more about my stats, that was described in my first post.

Okay! On to the advice!

I feel like there’s a lot of moving parts with interviews, so before we get into what the interview will be like and how to best prepare (and what really even is the purpose of an interview), let’s just get the logistical questions you might have out of the way. Starting with: when should you expect to hear about an interview invite?

**The Goal of a Ph.D. Interview**

Different programs may have different metrics for assessing candidates during interviews, but I think it all boils down to figuring out two things about you: (1) you are the person/scientist that you said you are in your statements and (2) this program is a good fit for YOU. The interview is meant to be complimentary to your overall application which means, most programs aren’t going to stop holistically evaluating you once you get to the interview stage. It’s just another piece of your application puzzle, but it uniquely gives you the chance to interview them and confirm (or maybe prompt you to reassess) that this program is a good fit for you.

Interviews (generally) are not meant to weed you out. They are meant to get to know you better and for you to get to know the program better. If they believe that you are a strong fit for the program and they are a strong fit for you, you will most likely get an offer barring other factors outside of your control.

It’s important that you remember this as you continue reading and as you prepare for your interviews.

**Interview Invite Timelines**

Most biological/biomedical sciences programs that are a part of the [April 15th resolution](https://cgsnet.org/resources/for-current-prospective-graduate-students/april-15-resolution) will try to handle their interviews sooner rather than later because they need to give applicants a reasonable amount of time to decide which program they’d like to attend before that April 15th deadline.

From personal (and anecdotal) experience, most programs in the Council of Graduate Schools (most R1 universities) will try to schedule and conduct their interviews between January and February. A decent chunk of CA schools will conduct interviews in late February/early March due to the quarter system (e.g., Stanford Biosciences, UCSF Tetrad, Berkeley Biophysics) and some schools will have a “pre-interview” or a round 1 interview in mid-December/early January.

If you want to see historical data on when your program of interest have sent out interview invites in the past, you can go to this link at [GradCafe](https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/), Hit “Filter”, and populate the form with the relevant information. If you want more up-to-date information with additional details, you can view this [crowdsourced Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PyZQYSXY2JAG2x--fZFClshIMkmmHwhx7Ez58VaGoFc/edit?gid=1252869988#gid=1252869988) from last year (it also has links to spreadsheets from previous cycles).

If you want to get live updates about when your programs are sending out interview invitations, you can find the current cycle spreadsheet on this subreddit. 

**I don’t recommend doing the latter.** Truly, it’s not worth stressing out when you haven’t received an invite from a program and someone else is saying on the sheet or Reddit that they have (*someone will lie about one popular program and send the entire grad admissions community into a downward spiral*).

***When you are invited to interview, you will receive the invite in your email. That’s it.***

**Interview Formats**

There are two major “formats” for Ph.D. interviews with some programs having just one or some combination of two or all three – it’s really program specific. While the interview itself shouldn’t vary too much, here’s a brief overview of what you can expect at each format:

**Virtual interviews** take place entirely on Zoom or some other video conferencing platform. These have becoming increasingly more common since the COVID-19 pandemic and I don’t see them going away due to its convenience and affordability (after all, why fly everyone out when you can just fly out your admitted students later on?). There may be a few general sessions with all applicants before the interviews take place such as faculty flash talks, student Q&A sessions, and a program overview, but individual interviews will take place in a designated breakout room. Recommendations for virtual interviews:

* Make sure you have reliable internet connection and no distracting backgrounds – try to find a study/conference room in a library nearby
* Wear a simple professional top like a turtleneck, sweater, button-down and enjoy the fact that you can wear anything below
* Have coffee/tea, water, and a light snack on hand – there tends to be minimal breaks for these virtual visits
* Have a bathroom nearby
* Lean forward when conversing with faculty or graduate students, it shows that you’re engaged and helps combat Zoom fatigue
* Close all windows/don’t have notes open on screen – it’s easy to tell when someone is reading off of something, especially if you have glasses

Virtual interviews do tend to happen early in the cycle and have a quicker turnaround time – you’ll know whether you have been admitted or passed to the next round of interviews (if the program does multiple rounds) within a week or so post-interview. After the interview, if you are admitted, you will receive information for their recruitment weekend.

**In-person interview/recruitment weekends** will take place at the campus and city your program is housed at. These often double as a way to both interview you and get you to join their program should you be admitted (typically an emphasis on the latter). There will be a program overview, faculty flash talks, poster sessions/happy hour, faculty/student lunches and dinners, social outings, apartment/housing tours and more. All in addition to the actual interviews themselves. So, understandably, these things can be a little overwhelming!

***Recommendations for travel:***

* Make sure you are consistently checking your email after accepting an invitation to interview in-person. Most programs will have you book through a travel agency so make sure you give them your travel details (DOB, KTN, departure airport, etc.) as soon as possible. They will reach out to you to confirm the itinerary which will typically expire within 24 hours to 48 hours so stay on top of it!
* Once you have your confirmed reservation, download the airline or Amtrak/Acela app and add the confirmation number directly to your phone. This makes check-in, luggage tracking, and travel updates come directly to your device and keeps you ready for travel day
* The hotel is almost always booked for you, but there might not always be a credit card on file for incidentals so, if you don’t have a credit card, now is the time to get one. **Most hotels don’t accept Discover, so I suggest applying for a Visa credit card without annual fees like Chase Freedom Unlimited.**
* If you are given a Lyft code, add the Lyft code to the app before arrival – it will activate during interview weekend

***Recommendations for managing the itinerary:***

* Each student will have a personalized schedule based on who they are supposed to meet with – I suggest taking the time and adding each event to your calendar along with the location (you may or may not have a graduate student host that knows your schedule, so better to be prepared in the case you do not)
* Try to arrive 5 minutes ahead of the anticipated meeting time for anything (morning group shuttle/Lyft to campus, building where interview is taking place, etc.)
* Recommendations for social events and meals:
* Alcohol is almost always served at meals and events – if you drink, make sure you know your functional limit and try to drink on a full stomach
* They will almost always provide alcohol at the welcome dinner which is usually the night before the real interviews – I would suggest abstaining from drinking that night so you can feel 100% for interview day!
* Try and get to know everyone you are interviewing with! These are people that could potentially be in your cohort if you choose to accept your offer – an easy way to do this is to change who you sit with at meal times and on shuttle rides
* If you have any dietary restrictions, make sure you inform the program coordinator ahead of time and make sure you keep medication for any life-threatening allergies (EpiPen, Benadryl, etc.)
* Be respectful and polite to everyone you engage with! And, most importantly: relax! The program would not have spent upwards of $800 on your visit if they didn’t think you were a highly qualified candidate!

***Recommendations for managing in-person interviews:***

* If you have a grad student guide assigned for the whole visit, make sure you exchange numbers in case something happens (if the students are on shifts, this isn’t necessary, they have a full copy of your schedule and know when/where to pick you up at all times)
* Always make sure you know how to reach the program coordinator!!
* Business casual (top and bottom!) – I wore slacks and a nice sweater for my interviews (it was pretty cold for most of my interview season), but there were people wearing jeans and a nice sweater/top at each of my interviews and that was also okay!
* I will advise you wear comfortable walking shoes since you’ll be doing a lot of walking- some days I wore the comfortable dress shoes I owned and others I wore my Adidas Sambas
* Keep an eye on the clock, especially for interview days that have breaks filled with housing/instrumentation tours, lunch, etc.
* Be respectful of the office/lab spaces of the faculty you are meeting with (if they want to shake your hand, they will offer it!)

**Acing Your Interview:  Questions**

Just like with job interviews or undergraduate admissions interviews, the questions you’ll be asked can vary between individual interviewers. But there are four “core” interview questions you’ll be asked and you need to be prepared to answer:

1. Tell me about yourself
2. Tell me about a research project you’ve worked on or are working on
3. Why do you want a Ph.D.?
4. Why are you interested in this program specifically?

The good news: you’ve answered all of these questions in your statement of purpose. So, naturally, **the first thing you should do before you get to work on writing out answers for these questions is re-read your statement of purpose** for that program.

Yes. I know it’s painful. You might find three typos you didn’t catch before submission. But it’s fine because they still invited you to interview anyway.

Now that you’ve done that, you need to write out answers to these questions that will only take you **sixty seconds or less to respond with**. I say this because you do not want to ramble. Interviews are supposed to be a conversation (albeit, a formulaic one, but a conversation nonetheless) and rambling without giving the interviewer a chance to ask follow-up questions or losing their attention does not allow for a conversation to happen.

It’s easier to start with the long answer, time yourself saying it out-loud, whittling down some parts that you don’t need to say and then repeating. Here’s an example of my response to #1:

>Q: Tell me about yourself  
A: I'm originally from XYZ, and I earned my **bachelor's degree in Biochemistry** from ZYX. After I graduated, I started working as a tech at YYY which is where I am currently. While in undergrad, I *briefly studied signaling during cardiac disease* and now, in my current lab, I *study antibiotic resistance in colon cancer*. This has made me interested in studying cellular or viral mechanisms with a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques during my Ph.D..

Note the three “core” components of your personal elevator pitch include your **education**, *your relevant past research*, and your research interests for grad school. Also, think of all the different ways the interviewer can follow up when you respond in this way! They could ask: how did you like working at ZYX in undergrad? How do you like the weather in YYY since you’re from XYZ?

And most importantly, they can easily transition into asking #2:

>Q: Tell me more about your current research at YYY  
A: I'm currently working with Dr. YYY in a computational structural biology lab where I study antibiotic resistance in C. difficile. C. difficile is the bacteria responsible for colon inflammation and uses a family of proteins called YFPs to become resistant to antibiotics. *To better understand how they became antibiotic-resistant*, I computationally reconstructed the sequence of the ancestral YFP protein and used in vitro techniques to find that this protein may have given up X function to confer resistance. This study has given us more insight into the evolution of C. difficile antibiotic resistance and I plan to use cryo-EM to identify structural changes between the ancestor and modern protein.

^(\*I made all of this up, if you couldn't tell by the your favorite protein (YFP) family)

The core components of your research elevator pitch include **what you’re working on**, *the gap of knowledge*, main technique, major finding, and what you plan to do next.

Once again, think of all the ways the interviewer could follow up! They could ask you to share more about how you reconstructed the protein and how you expressed it *in vitro* or even more about the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the modern protein. **The goal of this answer is to give them a brief, 60 second overview of what you do, how you do it, and why it’s important.**

You will probably spend the *most* time talking about your research so make sure you know the techniques well (especially if the interviewer is in your same field!) and **make sure you think of ways to go beyond your work:**

1. What are the therapeutic or guiding principles that could come out of your project?
2. What else could you have done to test the same question?
3. What did or didn’t work and how did you overcome it?

>Q: Why do you want a Ph.D.? A: \[Insert your answer here!\]

Only YOU know what your personal motivations are for getting a Ph.D.! Remember that wanting to become a better scientist or finding the cure for cancer isn’t what the interviewer is looking for – **focus on real, tangible goals that you have: like becoming faculty or founding a start up etc.**

>Q: Why this program?  
A: I'm really excited about this program because of its emphasis on \[insert reason 1 here\] which aligns with my goal of \[insert here\]/ I would love to work with \[insert faculty names here\].

And that’s pretty much it! There will be time for you to ask questions at the end of the interview – **make sure you ask questions.** Even if you already asked another faculty member that same question, just ask the next one: it helps to get different perspectives on the same thing anyway. I asked a lot about how the program trains students in pedagogy and scientific communication, internship and training grant opportunities, how preliminary exams are structured, opportunities for in-/out-reach, and what they liked about the research culture at that institution.

**Acing Your Interview: Practice, Practice, Practice**

Once you have your elevator pitch style answers down, the next thing to do is **practice saying them out loud**. It doesn’t have to be to anyone: it can be in the shower, while you’re alone in your room, to the kid your babysitting, etc. but you should try to say your answers out loud, twice a day, every day leading up to your first “mock” interview.

The reason I suggest practicing answering out loud is to get comfortable saying it out loud: the more comfortable you are pitching yourself, your research, and interest in the program, the smoother and more natural the words will come out during the interview. You don’t want your responses to “sound” rehearsed – remember this is supposed to be a conversation!

**Take the holiday season/winter break to really get these interview questions done and practice saying them aloud**. In the week or two weeks leading up to your first interview, do one or two mock interviews. When I practiced, I practiced with two other people that were applying to graduate school and my post-bacc program advisor. Others practice with graduate students or post-docs in their lab or even family members. I don’t think it matters who you practice with (interviews are standard across industries), just as long as you practice and get some feedback.

**After the Interview**

Once your interviews are complete (if in person) or in between interviews (if virtual), **write down what you liked or disliked about the interviews.** Where do you think you could’ve done better? What points of the conversation really stuck out to you? If you’re interested in rotating with that PI, what projects did they say they are actively working on?

Graduate school interview season is *long*. If you don’t write things down after your interviews or your visit, it’ll be hard to remember how you felt about a program you visited in January compared to a visit you had in March when you’re ready to make a decision in April.

**Thank You Emails**

Personally, I didn’t really write follow-up emails to the faculty I spoke to: it has little to no bearing on the actual admissions process (most of them would’ve submitted their evaluations and recommendations by the time you can even compose a thank you email). At the program I was the most interested in (and my current program), I wrote thank you notes because I knew I’d be interested in rotating. Here’s what I said:

>I just wanted to reach out and thank you for taking the time to speak with me on Friday during the Program visit. I really enjoyed our conversation - thank you for sharing the exciting work you are doing in your lab and in collaboration with other labs at Institution! I hope you enjoy the rest of your week.

**Post Interview Acceptance/Rejection**

There’s a lot of posts online that say getting an interview invite is an almost guaranteed acceptance. This narrative emphasizes that the interview is just a vibe check and, unless you do something really bad, you’re pretty much in.

**That’s definitely not true**. There are only two things that are definitely true at this stage:

1. You have better odds of getting into the program than people who did not get invited to interview – you are literally in the top percentage of applications and,
2. The program is impressed enough with your application that they are taking the time (and $$) to get to know you more.

With that in mind, don’t treat the interview like it’s a sure thing. Go into interview preparation and the interview itself with the same mindset you had when you were drafting your application. It’s still anyone’s game at the interview stage because you don’t know for sure how many offers are going to be going out at the end of the day! They might need to make their class size smaller than they had in the past (that was the theme of the 2025-26 admissions cycle) or they might make more offers than usual since they under-yielded the year before.

After I interviewed, I mostly received an official offer with 1 week (the earliest) and 2 weeks (the latest). I don’t think I waited any longer than 2.5 weeks to hear back from schools that I interviewed at across the board. Some schools will make their offer over the phone and then follow up with an email (typically quicker turnarounds) while others will wait for the graduate school to process the admit and you will find out with a formal letter from the Dean with a funding package (slower turnarounds).

Once again, if you’re interested in live updates on when programs are sending out offers, the spreadsheet and GradCafe will be populated with that information (I really wouldn’t recommend because sometimes acceptances can come personally from faculty that interviewed the student so there isn’t a standard release of all acceptances, e.g. some Harvard HILS and UCSF programs).

If you receive a rejection post-interview and you thought the interview went well, you might (might!) be able to get feedback from your interviewers. It’s not a guarantee, but it’s worth trying if you have future interviews coming up and you want to prepare more. Additionally, sometimes **it’s important to remember that admissions decisions often come down to things entirely outside of your control and that it isn’t a reflection on you, your interview abilities, or even your capacity to be a future leader in science. Receiving an invitation to interview is a huge accomplishment and should be celebrated as such!**

You’re just financially irresponsible.,"I'm so tired of hearing ""Our grandparents could buy a house on one salary, but now we can't even afford rent on two!""

Yeah, because Grandma wasn't blowin' half her paycheck on $12 iced coffee and avocado toast, that's why!

Back then, if they wanted coffee, they made it at home. With grounds so strong it could remove rust.

You didn't drink it... you survived it.

And Grandma wasn't out there ""brunchin."" You think she had time for brunch? No! She was at home, cooking something called whatever's left in the house.

And don't even bring up Uber Eats.

These people today are crying about money while living in a 4-bedroom house with two SUVs, six streaming services, and matching sleeve tattoos. You think Grandpa had a tattoo? Yeah it said ""Korea,

1951."" And it came with nightmares, not realitic shading.

Oh, don't even get me started on the kids. ""We can't make ends meet, but Brayden needs the new iPhone!"" No, he doesn't! You're giving an $1100 phone to a kid who still eats glue and boogers.

When we were kids, the family phone hung on the wall. It had a cord long enough to jump rope with, and if you wanted privacy, you had to go stand in the pantry. And somehow, we survived.

And the TV? There was one. One.

It was in the living room, and Dad controlled it. If he wanted to watch bowling, guess what? You liked bowling.

Now every room's got a 65-inch screen, the baby's got an iPad, and you're sitting there wondering why you can't afford rent.

Because you're living like rappers, that's why!

Grandpa wasn't out here leasing Teslas and buying $12 smoothies called ""Detox Sunrise."" He was driving a truck that sounded like thunder and smelled like oil and cigarettes.

They lived within their means. Whatever Grandpa's paycheck bought, that's what they had. They didn't try to keep up with the Joneses. They were just trying to keep the fed and a roof over their heads.

So yeah, Grandpa could buy a house on one salary.

But he also didn't have 47 subscriptions and emotional-support crystals. He had one support system, Grandma, who told him to suck it up and mow the yard.

An arena cargo train rattled its way from one chamber to another carrying a few dozen mechs and their pilots in some specialized cars. In a car dedicated to providing a bar for everyone two pilots chatted as they watched the ongoing match on a projector screen.

Angel sat in that bar section, sipping from a sweet soda while teasing the normally stoic pilot he was set to fight later.

""I don't think I could deal with that,"" Grim said next to him, ""Blow me off my feet and I'm gone, keep my leg as a souvenir. I, am, out.""

Angel chuckled and grinned, thinking but not saying the joke that came to mind.

""I think you'd be stuck chasing and evading, you didn't do too well against my barrages and I don't even have a dedicated missile build."" He nudged his new friend, who scoffed.

""You blast all your explosives out in someone's face and you'll get the same reaction every time: shock."" The older pilot sipped his tea as they watched the broadcast on a projector screen.

""How much you wanna bet Malice keeps her rank?"" Angel asked, only to get a response from behind them,

""Oh, I'd bet my favorite flask."" Came a voice like someone learned to talk from old west movies.

""Cade?"" They both tuned in unison,

The man before them looked every bit the bored arena elite that plagued the mech bays, old fighter helmet on his hip and leathers over his jumpsuit.

""One and only, I got my match a little after yours and I'd bet we're going to see Sonic in a very quiet mood when we all get back."" Angel was completely stunned, while Grim came up with a response to 'the Wild Gun of Sol'

""Why do you say that?"" the comparative rookie asked.

""'Cause she's pissed, look."" Cade gestured up at the screen and they both turned to see Chain Link standing up on its 4 legs and blasting sandy steam out all her crevices.

She jumped into a rocket flight onto one of the nearby buildings then again between them.

""Malice loves dueling in wide open spaces even though she's much better suited to closing off tight in spaces. She wants to fire her guns with no restraint but she's forced to watch and wait for the best performance."" Cade explained as he walked up to lean against the counter between them.

Cade picked up a mug of coffee from the bartender and took a deep sip of the chalky black liquid, ""Sonic relies on range, speed and surprise. He can't be as surprising or fast in spots where he has to pick paths, leaving just his range which isn't much better than Chain Link.""

Sure enough Sonic in Power Rocket struggled to navigate the city section when he had to turn down more than two roads. Ending up slowing down to hop his way to a similar hight to Malice before making an approach.

""I'm willing to bet Malice will play around cover and use that trick she picked up from your mentor to surprise Sonic back."" The veteran said directly to Angel.

They all watched as Malice jumped Chain Link from rooftop to rooftop, slapping down Power Rocket whenever Sonic got close and ducking so his missiles fell on cold concrete rather than toasty steel.

When she eventually dropped down between the buildings and onto the scarred pavement Sonic was already circling the city. Like a confused bird trying to find the right angle to dive.

""Think she's going to try and chase him around between the buildings?"" Angel asked,

""Not unless she's stupid,"" Cade said rather bluntly, ""you never want to chase a faster opponent around enclosed spaces. They'll find a good place to fight before you will and only an idiot would let an opponent lead you to where they're willing to fight.""

And just like he said she waited for sonic to come to her, still moving as she looked for a good spot for her to fight.

""They've traded armor leads a few times."" Grim noted.

Cade chuckled, ""They are both burst fighters. Each one trying to avoid the other's big volleys while they both line up for their own big hits. It is pretty rare.""

Unlike most matchups Angel knew had consistent fighting, Malice and Sonic traded who had the most armor or ammo several times. Usually each fighter chips at the other fairly consistently until whoever can't evade or withstand the other falls.

""Does Artillery fall into that category too or does he just do *that* much damage?"" Grim asked the more experienced pilot, who hemmed and hawed over it.

These two liked to finish the entire match in one big burst of firepower, repeatedly disengaging or forcing their opponent back. Artillery was different, he was content to miss or turn down an opportunity, but he had 4 grenade cluster launchers that he'd always fire as one big group.

""Artillery is a weird one, he's very defensive if you know what you're looking for, more of a test than an opponent. But yes, he does behave a lot like Malice and Sonic. He's looking for the same kind of opening to exploit and has more agility to do it."" Cade finally replied as Sonic passed by Malice for the first time in the city

Sonic couldn't turn or control his speed well enough to stay behind malice and shoot into her back.

Malice couldn't turn fast or keep up with him in wide open spaces but was good enough to avoid his missiles and frustrate his targeting when he closed in behind her.

What changed significantly was the obstacles stopping the normal evasive behavior.

Suddenly Sonic was relying on his speed to approach at odd angles and get his opponent in a spot where his missiles were harder to dodge or bait into terrain.

Suddenly Malice was in the perfect spot to hose down anyone brave enough to charge down a corridor at her.

The result was that Sonic caught fire from all 4 of Malice's guns and had to break off before he could get any missiles out.

But Cade went on talking, ""It's the same reason I like Zane ranked where he is with Tough Break, though he'll take awhile to get back onto *that* saddle. He's an excellent test, making sure pilots that get past him are much harder to pressure or can deal with the stress of a chaotic situation.""

She took up a position between two four way intersections and tracked where Power Rocket was, making sure she was in whatever lane he approached her from.

Sonic tried to get up ontop of the shorter buildings around her or launch his missiles on his way in but she didn't let him. Dodging behind corners to force his missiles into walls and following him up onto whatever ledge he landed on, or another at similar hight.

""So, Zane makes openings, Artillery waits for openings, Sonic catches people off their guard, and Malice puts to death the notion of surviving a dedicated assault."" Grim concluded

Cade smiled and gave him a pat on the back, ""Yes! Very perceptive! There's other similar pilots around at different ranks but those 4 specifically make the arena healthier overall.""

Angel's eyes were glued on the screen as the match went on through the conversation.

Sonic got one more pass where his missiles and cannons both got good hits on Malice, then it was her show. On Sonic's fourth charge the match almost looked like a tossup, but he couldn't get any missiles to land and decided to stay in her little nest to try and send another volley.

That was a mistake. Instead of running or staying nearby while turning she jumped one leg at a time to turn faster and charged up into Sonic's face on an overboost, invading the ledge he was on and gunning him down.

""And there it is."" Cade toasted to the screen and sipped his coffee.

Power Rocket fell flat on its back with craters all around its armor, the cooling system sparking and smoking beneath the plates.

Chain Link had very little armor integrity on her own, almost no ammo left, but she had won.

Cade chuckled and turned around, pulling him and Grim out of their seats, ""Finish your drinks, you're both up next aren't you?""

""Yea,"" Angel replied as he cupped his soda can close and looked at Grim, a little nervous about the group fight they were headed towards, ""what do you think our odds are?""

The veteran pilot laughed and shook his head, ""Tossup, no telling how Zane will take to his mech, nor how well your group works together. Could be a breeze, could be a clown show. Crowd thinks Zane's ready to get knocked down a few pegs, but who knows.""

Cade was certainly smiling like he knew.

\---

""Awe, I was hoping for him to win, the surfboard mech looks fun""

Fiadh laughed, already back on the stove, I was next to her, helping clean and prep things to go on the heat. Currently packing cinnamon rolls into a slightly too small tray with a gleeful smile as another tube cracked open, the foil tray only 2/3s full from the other tubes.

""That's a very shallow reason ta root for someone,"" She stirred the breakfast sausage while I worked the cinnamon rolls apart, ""An' please don't dip into my breakfast pastry reserves, I work at a bakery and you get 50% off on your ridiculous bulk orders.""

I scoffed, ""No, I did not get 50% off on my orders, and I'll pay you for the food, hell I could probably pay rent. 'Sides there are worse reasons to root for a competitor.""

""Oh you got someth'n off."" That made me chuckle and she gave me a playful kick about it.

We'd turned the TV so we could glance up at the match while cooking the food, and we did run out of food. I am very good at cleaning plates, whether cleaning them of food or cleaning them after the food.

Fiadh noticed the plates were getting cleared pretty quickly and decided to make some more food, breaking out the maple sausage links and cinnamon rolls. I noticed right around when she started the stove and went around to help.

""You're goin' ta basically pay my rent jus' pay'n me back for all the food ya eat. Did ya eat anyth'n all o' yesterday hun? Do ya even have someplace to say?"" She asked over the broadcast as it went to commercial.

I shrugged, ""I ate, mostly the second set of pastry boxes, but I did eat. I was out of the rain 'till I had to start looking for places to sell things basically.""

""An' what were you sell'n to get that pile of cash?"" She leaned over to jab an elbow at me, making me chuckle and elbow back

""Hey it's a grid, not a pile."" started rinsing the bunch of plates piled in the sink and the like 3 utensils I'd washed already, ""And I was selling circuit boards from a mech""

Fiadh paused, looking at me like I was some kinda crazy person. I was a little confused until I remembered the context she had.

""NOT from those kinda mechs!"" I said pointing at the TV, ""No, red ones. Kinda look like cavemen all hunched over, there's a big pile of them all busted up and not working in the drainage canals.""

She let out a breath and poked around at the food, turning over some sausages before chuckling, ""You live in the sewers?""

""I resent that remark"" I barked back.

That made her laugh and poke me with her elbow again, ""Ya resemble it is what you do.""

""It is not the sewers! It's like, grey water recycling I think. Road drainage!"" I defend myself in a higher pitch voice.

She shook her head and gave me a pointed poke as I finished stacking dishes and went back to washing ""Still not a healthy place to be""

""Maybe but free mechs!"" I countered.

She scoffed, ""Free parts."" waving off my enthusiasm.

""Enough parts and I'll have a whole mech, once I figure out how the fuckers are put together."" I grumble while getting back to scrubbing dishes, maybe going a bit harder than strictly needed. 

Fiadh chuckled while watching, deciding to poke at my frustration, ""Should I sign you up for a round of training from the Nest?""

""The huh?"" Nest? Did I hear that before?

""The arena people"" She clarified.

I don't think she named them before, or I was profoundly distracted, ""Ah, no. I'll get it on my own.""

Sausage sizzled and plates piled up for a few quiet minutes before the adds ran out.

""Will you?"" She eventually asked, turning to look at me as I worked on the cups.

I scoffed back, ""I'll damn well try.""

Ain't nothing keeping me from wrenching on big crunchy robots, the fact that they can wrench on each other is just a snazzy lil cherry ontop.

""Well before you get back to damn well trying, I'm dragging you along to go shopping. First for camping gear, then for something made of meat and veggies that stores so you can balance out all that bread you eat!"" She was half joking but in that motherly way that said 'i'm taking you someplace and *you* don't get to argue'.

I don't think that was all needed really, I take care of myself. Shopping isn't that needed, but a little chill on my shoulders seemed to disagree

*Yes! Finally!* Came a voice echoing around my skull, enthusiastic about shopping apparently.

Quiet ghost.

*BALANCE YOUR DIET* By all the names on the steps, I will eat as I crave. If I need it I shall crave it!

Fiadh poked my calf with her foot.

""Ugh, fine. But I only eat the toughest jerkies"" Which made her giggle.",2,1766085703.0,HFY,3,0.75,False

Advice needed","What do people usually get their partner when they first start dating for Christmas? We have known each other for 3 months because we worked together, but we have been officially dating for 3 weeks. We used to see each other a lot when we worked together.

I really care about him and want to give him a gift he will actually like. He likes anime, history, reading, football, coffee and cooking. We have nicknames for each other, I'm fox and he's goose. He has written 3 poems about me and they were all sweet. And he makes most if not all of the effort in our relationship so far so I feel even more that this has to be good enough. I haven't been to his place yet, so I don't know what he needs or wants at his place. 

The problem is, I don’t know any good books, I don’t know how much of history he doesn't know, I just know he is very knowledgeable and passionate about it and he speaks to me for hours on it. I am not a fan of the ""experience"" gifts because we are already going to do experiences together so to me it would seem low effort. I don't watch anime or football, and I don't want to get him something cringe or too loud or something like that so I don't know what to do. Also, he is 27, so what am i supposed to get that isn't too childish?

My creative outlet is drawing, so I am thinking of drawing a simple fox and goose and a little note as an extra thing, but I have never written before and I would be bad at it. Another idea is when we went to the mall together, he picked up a vinyl he wanted so that is an option maybe. And when we went to the asian market together, he pointed out some of the snacks there.

1ppze08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1ppze08/how_to_manage_not_to_care_people/,How to manage not to care people?,"At first I thought about writing at length here about my anxieties, problems, and thoughts, but then I said it would be too long, so I wanted to ask briefly: how to manage not to care about people?

I always tell myself that humans, including myself are, objectively speaking, just furry, thinking pieces of meat living on a tiny planet among quadrillions of stars, planets, and galaxies. In that case, many things we sometimes obsess over and think about so much become so trivial that you start to wonder whether they’re even worth worrying about.

But sometimes saying it is easy, and following it is hard. For example, saying “who cares if this piece of meat thinks my clothes are cheap or over-the-top?” is easy, but when you’re physically with someone, keeping that thought going isn’t so easy. Or saying “who cares what a bunch of pieces of meat might think about me if I don’t have coffee after the meal because I can’t afford it” is easy, but when you’re the only different one among everyone else, you realize it’s not as easy as it sounds.

And especially if these pieces of meat are people you know rather than strangers - friends, for example - there’s the fear of “will they distance themselves from me, will I fall in their eyes,” and so on. That’s why I want to ask: how is it really possible to not care about people, to genuinely not care?

P.S. I hope no one gets offended by me calling people “pieces of meat.” Don’t misunderstand me. I know we’re more than just pieces of meat. We have emotions, very complex feelings, thoughts, etc. I use “piece of meat” only to emphasize how insignificant we are in the universe in general. For example, just as NPCs in a game are important to you and just as much as you remember them, that’s about how important we are in the big picture of life.",1,1766085225.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

By News Desk","James Skinner LLC is recalling of a lot of Publix Maple Walnut Coffee Cake because the wrong ingredient label was applied to the packaging on certain units.

The product may represent a serious or life-threatening health risk to people with a walnut allergy if they consume the impacted product. 

The recalled product was packaged in cases with Maple Walnut Coffee Cake labels but then inadvertently individually labeled as Publix Raspberry Coffee Cake. The Raspberry Coffee Cake label declares “processed on equipment that also processes almonds, pecans and walnuts” but does not include walnuts in the ingredient list.

Observable through the clear lid, the product has visible walnuts on top of the cake and brown maple topping, whereas Raspberry Coffee Cake has no walnuts on top and red topping. The issue was discovered by a retail store employee who observed the visible walnuts on top of the product and noticed that the product had a Raspberry Coffee Cake label instead of a Maple Walnut Coffee Cake label.

The recalled product was shipped to Sourcing & Distribution Specialists, Winter Haven, FL, who then further distributed the product to Publix retail stores throughout 8 states including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

The recalled coffee cake can be identified by the following label information: Publix Raspberry Coffee Cake; 14-ounce; Lot code 5309; SKU 54591; date of manufacture 11/5/25.

It just feels expertly crafted. Like they really gave every inch of the map their full attention. From the little balls of mycelia in the swamps to the bats that fly out of the caves. 

Every biome feels unique and they transition seamlessly into each other.
The map is beautiful to just stop and look at. Waterfalls, lakes, mountains, valleys, it's all stunningly designed to be both beautiful yet practical for a factory building game. 

I find myself looking for reasons to go off exploring the map. ""Oh no, I need more Somersloops. Guess I should go off to find some."" 
I don't think even RDR2 had me so excited to stop game progression for an hour just to explore.

So, Coffee Stain, whoever it was that designed the game world,  please consider giving them a hefty Christmas bonus or at least an extra day holiday. They deserve it.

just want to contribute to this community with my personal W-Trek experience and learnings to repay for the aid I had received here. Hopefully it will help you with planning your trip. Just finished the Trek yesterday (13th to 17th of December). Feel free to ask any questions in the comments. 

In general:
I originally wanted to do the O and just kept my W parts in the end. I did the whole trek with my own tent/equipment and brought almost all the food. Weather was mixed with lucky clear days for the miradors and apart from that often rainy, windy and cold (at some campsites below 0 Celsius at night).

13th: PN to Pudeto 7 am Bus to Paine Grande with Catarmaran 10.30 am, then to Grey. Around 5 hours walking time in strong wind and rain. It's a long ascend followed by long descent 

14th: visit of Grey Glacier and then back to Paine Grande, again about 4-5 hours

15th: Paine Grande to Francés vía Italiano/Mirador Británico, took me in total around 10 hours, weather mostly pleasant, the way from PG to Italiano and Italiano to Francés is mostly flat, Británico Hike steep up and down (with big bag left behind in Italiano)

16th: From Frances to Chileno, very rainy, muddy and windy, constant up and down, took me about 10 hours (using a marked shortcut)

17th: from Chileno to Base towers and back down to Central in mostly pleasant weather, first steep up, then long descent. Left heavy bag in Chileno. Took me around 8 hours with longer break in Chileno for breakfast and tent deconstruction

Essential equipment list:

-Camping:
MSR Hubba NX1, Hyberg loner Tek quilt (-2 comfort), doite sleeping bag inliner, sea to summit light sheet, sea to summit ether light XL sleeping pad, sea to summit deluxe pillow
- Clothes:
Puff jacket, 2 pairs of hiking socks, 1 pair thick wool socks, 2 t shirts, 1 long thermal leggings, 1 hiking pants, 1 fleece, 1 vest, 1 jogging pants for camp, buff, wool hat, cap, 1 waterproof pants, boots, sandals for camp, rain poncho, rain jacket, rain cover, rain gaiters
- Cooking system:
Small camping stove, 250ml gas (free from hostal on PN), camping cup and 750ml pot, spork 
- Food: 
5 trekkn eat freeze dried meals from Germany with around 1000 calories each, 400g instant porridge, 8 energy bars, 600g but fruit mix, 4 bags of instant coffee, 5 tea bags, for day one additional sandwiches from PN (plus two super overpriced sandwiches I bought for in Frances and Chileno for lunch)
Water: carried two 500ml bottles which refilled at the streams, even that was bit too much
- Electronics: camera canon R100 and second battery, smartphone plus charger, ebook reader
-Misc: earplugs, sleep mask, towel, essential hygiene articles in small portions 



Learnings:m/comments:
- Things I brought but didn't need (necessarily): headlamp (there is daylight until after 10  from 5 and I didn't do the sunrise base tower thing), bug spray (mostly too cold for them I guess), ebook reader (no time BCS of long hiking days and camping chores), toilet paper, stove and gas (hot water provided, but still handy for early breakfast when there is no hot water in stores)
- mostly wore my full Rain protection outfit, Rain poncho (over backpack) was Very helpful, if you only use rain cover and it's raining several hours, water will leak in through the uncovered parts of the backpack
- carrying a heavy backpack through mountainous terrain and camping in adverse weather conditions diminished my enjoyment of the experience. I am a fit guy (did Salkantay Trek and Colca Canyon in Peru the weeks before), but walks were often a struggle and having the extra chores of setting up and deconstruction of tent plus food preparation was tiresome. I did it mostly for budget reasons, but would rather advise against it if you have the necessary funds and just want to enjoy landscape as good as possible 
- the campsites of Frances and Chileno which were also most expensive on this trip had worst price performance ratio for free campers. The platforms are set up high on a slope with maximum distance to the facilities. The food cooking area in Chileno is only inside the tiny cafeteria which is super crowded in the evening and has not enough seats for everyone 
- even though it is technically spring, you can find winter conditions in the park if you are unlucky. Luckily, I packed enough layers and also mostly wore them at night for sleeping 
- the earplugs helped a lot BCS wind and rain at night can become quite loud
- the paths (especially to the view points) were mostly packed full of people, I often had to stopp to let people pass from behind or in front of me. If you seek an atmosphere of remote wilderness you will rarely find it here",4,1766084605.0,Patagonia,2,1.0,False

How to make executable Linux files debug-resistant,"Plenty of anti-debugging techniques are available nowadays, but one of them stands distinctive. Its main principle is not to detect a debugger, but to prevent the app from running in it. This article explains how such a goal can be achieved using parser differentials and fuzzing. You will learn how to craft amazing ELF files that are resistant to debuggers and disassemblers but run smoothly in their native Linux environment.

Generally speaking, parsers are excellent bug-hunting tools. And the more complex is the processed format, the more interesting things you can find there. Take, for instance, XML. It’s widely used to describe documents and presentations, SOAP and RSS, etc., etc. And concurrently it’s marred by countless problems: plenty of attacks exploit XML vulnerabilities, including 20-year-old XML bombs (billion laughs attack), XXE attacks, and errors in some XML implementations enabling you to escape from the sandbox in iOS 13 and read other people’s SMS messages.

***WWW: In January 2016, LiveOverflow posted a short video showing how to create an executable file that cannot be opened in GDB and Radare2: Uncrackable Program? Finding a Parser Differential in loading ELF. This video inspired me to start this research.***

# Language-Theoretic Security and polyglot files

Parsers, as their name suggests, perform parsing of a certain language that is defined by a certain grammar. And this applies not only to programming languages, but to file formats and protocols as well.

The langsec website is dedicated to Language-Theoretic Security. Numerous researchers have contributed to this domain of science, including Sergey Bratus (some exciting features of ELFs and so-called weird machines) and Meredith L. Patterson (analysis of protocols and grammar parsers).

So what is langsec about? In an interview to IOHK, Meredith Patterson explained that langsec began with a discussion that, according to the theory of formal languages, filters based on regular expressions will never overcome SQL injections.

Another aspect examined by the langsec guys is the identification of inconsistencies between theory and practice, namely problems in the implementation of various formats and how they can be exploited. One of the main problems is adherence to Postel’s law, which states:

Initially, this approach was supposed to ensure the reliability of TCP. But today, this principle introduced in the early days of the Internet can result in interesting incidents. Take, for instance, so-called polyglot files. After all, any file is just a set of bytes, and their interpretation depends on the parser. And some parsers are very tolerant to various deviations from specifications: they either try to restore missing data from the context or ignore clearly invalid values stored in individual fields.

This makes it possible, for instance, to combine a script containing a Python web server (and other stuff) with a valid PDF file. This can be done pretty easily due to some implementation features of this standard (e.g. in practice, PDF magic is not required to appear at offset zero and can be even absent in some cases).

The creation of such files is a good exercise for your brains; in addition, they can be used to bypass file-type filters during system testing. Numerous studies are dedicated to such files; there is even a special format αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε that intricately combines PE, ELF, Mach-O, sh, and bootsector. According to its author, this format can be run without modification on Linux, Mac, Windows, BSD, and even on BIOS.

***INFO: Plenty of information on polyglot files can be found in repositories of Ange Albertini, the author of Corkami also known as the file format guy. And this title is fully deserved: in his repositories, you can find posters with visual representations of many formats: executable files, documents, pictures, archives, etc., as well as practical notes.***

The PoC||GTFO repository contains plenty of useful articles (in addition to those dedicated to polyglot files). Beware: a PDF file with his articles is actually more than just a PDF!

Overall, it’s quite fun to abuse parsers using polyglot files. But now let’s discuss a more targeted evil and then try to put it into practice.

# Parse tree differential attack

For the first time, this attack was mentioned in a 2010 presentation on protocol grammars delivered by Meredith Patterson and Len Sassaman. It was called “Parse tree differential attack” and targeted X.509 parsers (to be addressed in more detail later).

In the study “Security Applications of Formal Language Theory” published in 2013, the authors examine this attack thoroughly.

***INFO: As far as I understand, the term “parser differentials” that has existed for more than ten years isn’t commonly used outside the langsec community – even though numerous attack descriptions can be classified this way.***

Parse tree differential attacks are truly amazing. Their main idea is as simple as ABC: two implementations of parsers designed for the same format ‘see’ the same input data differently. The consequences of this seemingly innocent feature, especially in combination with other vulnerabilities, can be absolutely unpredictable. Let’s examine a few examples.

# Requests smuggling in GitLab and Zoom

HTTP requests smuggling is an attack targeting parser differentials. Such attacks exploit the fact that two servers differently parse the same HTTP request passing through them. In fact, they ‘see’ different things in the same input data, which makes it possible to ‘smuggle’ a second request into the first one.

This vulnerability (CVE-2020-6833) existed in GitLab: gitlab-workhorse and gitlab-rails parsed the same HTTP file save request differently. Exploitation of this vulnerability enabled the attacker to read files (see the GitLab blog for more detail).

But the requests smuggling attack is not limited to HTTP requests. In the report XMPP Stanza Smuggling or How I Hacked Zoom, Ivan Fratrik from Project Zero discusses the CVE-2022-22784 vulnerability making it possible to insert tags into messages (stanza) due to parser errors. Potentially, this enables the attacker to forge server messages, redirect connections, and cause memory corruption problems, which couldn’t be achieved by other means. In the end, the researcher managed to execute arbitrary code during Zoom auto-update as a result of server spoofing.

# Psychic Paper and CVE-2022-42855

In January 2023, another study by the same researcher from Project Zero was published. In this article, Ivan Fratrik mentions a variant of Psychic Paper: an attack making it possible to execute files with unsigned entitlements on macOS – while the system believes that everything is OK. This happens because the operating system contains as many as four PLIST (i.e. oldie-goodie XML) parsers that don’t produce perfectly identical results in certain cases. An incredible solution to that problem was – what would you think? – the creation of a fifth parser.

Later, Apple decided to switch to a binary DER format instead of text XML, but even in this case, Fratrik managed to find functions in `libCoreEntitlements` that parse DER elements in different ways (even though he was unable to achieve the Psychic Paper effect).

# Trusted X.509 certificates for an arbitrary domain

In 2010, in a talk entitled Towards a formal theory of computer insecurity: a language-theoretic approach, Len Sassaman and Meredith Patterson described the above-mentioned attack that targets the processing of X.509 certificates by browsers: the browser could display a wrong domain to the user (i.e. not the one the certificates were issued to) due to the incorrect parsing of the CN (Common Name) field containing a null terminator.

The certification authority won’t allow someone to request a certificate for, let’s say, www.bank.com if the requester doesn’t own such a domain. But the researchers asked themselves: what happens if you specify www.bank.comx00badguy.com in CN?

Due to incorrect handling of the null terminator, browsers ‘see’ the string www.bank.com and display it to the user, although the certificate (signed by a trusted authority!) was issued to a completely different domain. The researchers claim that such an outrageousness wouldn’t be possible if all implementations were parsing this field in the same way.

# ELF: execute impossible to parse

Alejandro Hernández, aka nitr0us, from IOactive followed a similar logic. Back in 2012, he decided to find a reliable way to prevent the analysis of binaries since runtime anti-debugging techniques can be bypassed. In the GDB version that was actual at that time (7.5.1), nitr0us found a bug in the DWARF processing procedure: an attempt to load a specially crafted ELF to the debugger caused its crash as a result of null pointer dereference.

In addition to GDB, nitr0us found a bug in IDA Pro 6.3 resulting in an internal error and subsequent program closedown, which made file analysis impossible. Needless to say, that the ELF was running smoothly on the OS and performed its functions. More information can be found in the IOactive post Striking Back GDB and IDA debuggers through malformed ELF executables.

# ELF parsers

Now that you have realized that something is rotten in the world of parsers, let’s get closer to the subject and see how are things going with the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). Have you ever wondered how many parsers designed for it operate in Linux?

# OS kernel

An ELF parser exists in the Linux kernel and in other operating systems that can interact with such files. It ensures that such system calls as `execve()`/`execveat()`do their job properly so that you can launch your favorite browser and ~~watch funny videos with cats~~ read articles.

In essence, kernel performs the following operations:

* checks for permission to run the file;
* checks whether its format is supported as executable;
* depending on the format, selects the so-called interpreter. In the case of dynamically linked ELFs, this is `ld`; while and in the case of scripts that begin with a shebang (`#!`), this is what is specified in the first string (`/bin/sh`, `/usr/bin/env python3`, or any other path – you can experiment with this at your leisure);
* in the case of an ELF, prepares memory segments as specified in its program headers;
* if the ELF is dynamic, loads all the required libraries that are also ELF files (and the same steps are performed for them as well); and 
* sets the pointer of the current instruction of the process that has called `execve*()` to the entry point.

Memory dumps that are created in Linux when, for instance, `abort()` is called or `SIGABRT` received also appear not out of thin air: the kernel kindly packs them into an ELF file whose type is `ET_CORE` instead of `ET_EXEC`/`ET_DYN`.

One might think that the mechanism that runs custom binaries in the OS has been perfectly polished over the decades of this format’s existence: its first specification (for Unix System V) goes back to 1989. But no! In 2014, IOActive has identified a problem in OpenBSD 5.5 that makes it possible to cause a kernel panic using a specially crafted file.

# System utilities

A number of system utilities from the Binutils set, including readelf, objdump, as, gcc, and ld, use the GNU BFD Library to parse ELF files (i.e. at the lower level, there is only one parser). But as soon as the logic of these utilities comes into play, differences can appear.

# Debuggers, decompilers, disassemblers, and emulators

When you debug an ELF file, say in GDB, it goes through at least two parsers: (1) the debugger parser (to load, for instance, available symbols from the file or debug info if available); and (2) the kernel parser (to run this ELF). If you use extensions, then something else can come into play (e.g. elftools in the case of pwndbg).

Various tools (e.g. IDA, Ghidra, Radare2, or rizin) also parse file headers to show you the entry point, segments, and, if possible, display debug-friendly names of functions and variables. In `angr`, executable files are loaded by CLE that internally uses `elftools`. In LIEF, custom code is responsible for this.

In addition, executable files are parsed by antivirus engines in the course of analysis; sometimes, this results in amusing incidents when an entire architecture becomes excluded from further scanning.

# Looking for differences

As you can see, there are plenty of parsers everywhere. But how to start searching for parser differentials between the OS and its apps when the number of potential targets is so high? As always, first, you have to decide what you want. Your primary object of interest is an ELF file that is smoothly executed by the OS, but cannot be opened in debuggers and disassemblers.

It is known that sections info isn’t required for an ELF to execute; accordingly, the OS disregards this information (see my previous article). By contrast, analysis tools use it when they try to read names of symbols and sections in a file. In other words, it makes sense to try fuzzing section headers.

***INFO: Important: my goal was not to search for 0-day vulnerabilities in reverse engineering tools. Instead, I wanted to figure out whether they can be tested using a bunch of ELF files. Therefore, the analyzed sample isn’t very large.***

# Fuzzers

Similar to any other format, ELF files can be fuzzed in different ways. Let’s start with the simplest one.

LiveOverflow wrote a script that assigns a random value to a random byte within a file; as a result of this simple operation, you get a workable file that cannot be opened in GDB and Radare2. Interestingly, in 2020, a couple of problems associated with the processing of PE and ELF headers were identified in Radare2 using a similar fuzzer. These vulnerabilities have been assigned identifiers CVE-2020-16269 and CVE-2020-17487.

Another possible option is to use AFL++. This approach is undoubtedly much better than simple brute-forcing of bytes and it makes it possible to track coverage in the program under test. But for the purposes of this research, I intend to test a number of different tools using the same set of ELFs and find among them one that breaks all these tools – and concurrently runs smoothly on the OS. Unfortunately, this is not exactly the use case AFL++ is designed for.

In addition, if I know which ELF parser I want to fuzz (or, to be specific, what the tested parser pays attention to in the parsed file), then I should be able to specify the task for the fuzzer more precisely. Do I want to corrupt Program Header Table (PHT), or Section Header Table (SHT), or ELF’s own header, or maybe all of them together? It seems that the best way is to use a grammar-based fuzzer. But this is a separate complex topic that goes far beyond the scope of this article. For the purposes of my research, I’m better off corrupting just section headers in an ELF, and that’s it.

Fortunately, there is a fuzzer optimally suited for this task.

# Melkor

This tool was created by nitr0us (who is already familiar to you) to corrupt ELF in different ways (depending on the task), and it bears the proud name Melkor. Despite its age, I managed to compile and run it virtually with no problems – after all, the format hasn’t changed over time. The only significant limitation of Melkor is that it supports only the x86 architecture (32/64 bit).

Its repository contains a couple of template ELF files that can be used as input for fuzzing. You can specify which headers in the input ELF you want to fuzz: PHT, SHT, symbols table, relocations table, etc., which is very convenient if you know exactly what you need.

So, I instruct Melkor to generate malformed ELF files by fuzzing only section headers in the template file `foo` stored in the `templates` folder. The generated files will be saved in the `orcs_foo/` folder.

Another advantage of this fuzzer is the presence of a ready-made script, `test_fuzzed.sh`, that can be used to run a bunch of generated files on the tested tool (be it an OS or a debugger). Let’s run the malformed ELFs on the OS using the command `./test_fuzzed.sh orcs_foo/ | tee test_OS`. Most of these files have run and finish without errors. Interestingly, some files finish with segmentation faults, but for the purposes of this research, they are irrelevant since they haven’t crashed the system.

# Testing EDB

Now let’s see the reaction of debuggers. When such tools encounter ‘bad’ files, they display error messages and wait for user instructions, which isn’t very handy when you analyze their behavior using a large number of files. I am going to use the following trick: to avoid the need to close the debugger manually every time, I launch it with the timeout command. It will complete the test case execution ~~while I can sit back and have a cup of coffee~~.

EDB (1.3.0) stumbled on the first two ELF files; while on the third one, it suggested to debug the file, but was closed due to a timeout, and then the testing continued. Amazing!

After running a hundred corrupted ELFs in EDB, I got 55 segfaults and 9 divide-by-zero exceptions (yep, despite its name, `SIGFPE` (or floating point exception) is also generated in Linux when an integer is divided by zero).

Further investigation that granted me a truly unique experience (imagine: debugging a debugger in another debugger) showed that these problems originate from the BinaryInfo plugin. It parses sections to collect information on symbols prior to running the tested ELF for debugging. In the first case, the validity of the pointer to the string containing the section name wasn’t checked, and it could point beyond the mappings of the read file. In the second case, it didn’t check the element size prior to counting the number of elements in sections containing element tables (e.g. the symbol table).

For your information: both bugs have already been fixed.

By the way, when you analyze crashes, it’s very convenient if the build of the tested software includes sanitizers. For instance, if you build EDB with AddressSanitizer (ASAN), you’ll get a handy backtrace that can be examined in logs of the above-mentioned `./test_fuzzed.sh`, which is much easier than examining each case manually in the debugger.

# Testing GDB

Since nitr0us had tested GDB as well, he took into account that it will wait for user input if an error occurs during file opening. Accordingly, instead of using the `timeout` trick, you can uncomment line 80 instead of 79 in `./test_fuzzed.sh` so that it looks as follows:

    # $2 $1$file 2>&1
    echo quit | $2 $1$file 2>&1 # Example: ""echo quit | gdb -q orcs/x""

Now let’s run `./test_fuzzed.sh orcs_foo/ gdb | tee test_gdb`.

Running ELFs in GDB

In 98 cases out of 100, GDB refused to open a file with the message `not in executable format: file format not recognized`. In one case, it reported: `Can't read symbols from /home/kali/tmp/edb-segfault/Melkor_ELF_Fuzzer/orcs_foo/orc_0063: bad value`. And one file it managed to open – albeit with issues. But unlike EDB, there were no crashes.

Overall, GDB demonstrates quite a mature behavior on a hundred corrupted ELFs: at least, it doesn’t crash on them. On the other hand, it completely refuses to deal with them, which is exactly what anti-debugging guys want.

I visited another parish—lovely people, solid sermons—but there just wasn’t much for me to do. A few of us even had the very Christian thought of, “What if we just buy a building and start our own church?”

Then—praise be—logic entered the chat.



I’m the type who works in the church. Outreach, homeless street feedings, fundraising, hauling things, fixing things, being where help is needed. I tend to throw my whole elbow into it. The new parish is good, just… established. Very set. Very “this committee was formed in 1987 and we shall not be disturbed.” Which is fine! Being new, I get that trust takes time and nobody wants a flake with a clipboard.  

   Well… lo and behold, we found a church that actually needs hands. Like really needs help—especially the parish house. “Shabby chic” would be generous. More like “shabby, with memories.”  This weekend we’re starting with a deep, deep clean and then assessing the situation. My mother and niece reworked some wreaths, a guy came by and gave the lawn a quick once-over, and honestly? Progress is progress. Now the Church has its poinsetta's, the coffee group has really done a great job with refreshments and keeping spirits going they are a great group. 

This is not HGTV. There will be no dramatic reveals, no Joanna Gaines quotes, and no surprise budget of $375,000. But listen—during tough times, people can still put up mini-blinds. These curtains? Weathered, faded, possibly historical artifacts. Forty years ago they were beautiful, I know… but saints alive, it’s time.

And then there’s the deep blue carpet. I can’t replace the flooring right now, but I have been staring at it like prayer might change its mind. Maybe down the road should everyone and everything come into being healthy and friendly -- a bingo game night? Fall fundraising? Maybe some long lost sole with no living family and an extra couple grand to donate. 

Still—this is the good stuff. People showing up. Doing what they can. No spotlight, no ego, just rolling up sleeves and saying, “Alright Lord, let’s clean.”

I'm British but travel to the US a lot with work each year: but it's always NYC, Chicago or Boston that I visit. I love all three cities (Chicago in particular - not just saying that - it was the first US city I ever visited, and the architecture blew me away) but this time around I'd like to travel to a new city.

I'm happy to take an internal flight, or the train. I don't have a huge budget and would only be looking to go somewhere for a couple of days. Ideally it would be somewhere I could either fly back to the UK from fairly easily/directly, or close enough to Chicago that I could return and fly back from there.

I won't have a car so would be looking for a city that's fairly walkable, or has decent public transport.

I don't mind too much about there being a ton of tourist attractions - I love the USA and am happy to just wander around looking at architecture and parks, and eating food/drinking coffee.

I wondered about:

Milwaukee (almost entirely because it's close and and because I watch a lot of RedLetterMedia)

Indianapolis (mostly because I like Parks & Rec and would like to visit Indiana!)

Detroit (because of the auto industry/history)

I did think about doing cities like Philadelphia/Washington etc. but thought it might make more sense to visit those next time I'm in NYC?

Grateful for your thoughts - honestly my priorities are that it's easy to get to from Chicago, and (relatively) low-cost.

Years ago, when I was a teenager, every time I went out, I felt what I thought was a need (but maybe it was more about unhealthy beliefs around food and regulating it) to always have something tasty.  

For example, I’ve always found it extremely boring to go out with friends and just order a tea, an unsweetened coffee, or to go out without having dinner together, because I’ve always seen food as an essential part of going out.  

Since I’ve always gone out often, even for work or just to get fresh air, this habit “conditioned” me to feel like every outing had to be made worthwhile with food that wasn’t exactly healthy.  

Even today, for instance, I find it pretty depressing to go to the movies and not have popcorn, or to go out for a snack and almost always order a tea or something low-calorie—because in my mind, outings feel more enjoyable if food is involved.  



Of course, this mindset over time led me to being overweight, but thankfully in the last year I’ve become aware of these unhealthy behaviors and I’ve lost weight, reaching my ideal shape.

I still really enjoy going out—and by this I don’t mean just going to restaurants (actually, that happens rarely). I love going for walks, to the beach, exploring the city center, etc. But sometimes I still get this feeling that I’m “wasting” an outing if I don’t pair it with going to a café or getting a nice drink or snack.  



Obviously, this doesn’t mean I always eat out or indulge—because again, this is something I’ve worked on and improved with food awareness. It’s just that I still find it a bit depressing sometimes, especially around Christmas, when every time I go out to shop for gifts or run errands, I feel tempted by holiday treats.  



I definitely don’t want to go back to how I was before. I like myself now, I feel good in my clothes. I’m happier and more satisfied, and I’ve started working out to feel stronger and more confident.  

But I’m also afraid that these recurring thoughts mean I’m still giving food too much power.

I’ll be spending time in Lisboa in January and would love to meet another independent, owner-operated studio — not to record or promote anything, but to spend time, observe how you run your space, and exchange ideas about community-driven studios.

I’m also inviting someone to visit my studio in the U.S. later this year as part of a reciprocal exchange. No obligations — just time, conversation, and coffee.

If you run a studio, or know someone who does in Lisboa or nearby, I’d really appreciate a point in the right direction.

Tomorrow is my last day & while I didn’t get to know the staff like I did at chemo (if you’ve done both, maybe you’ve had a similar experience- chemo just kinda has more downtime so you get to know your nurses bc you have time to chat beyond ‘deep breath…hold it…breathe out…good’), everyone has been great. I had some complications & the techs were empathetic & did their best to ameliorate my pain & make it as easy for me as they could.   
   
So I wanted to bring something to say thank you. Morning appointment, I was thinking donuts? I was going to skip the coffee bc I feel like medical offices have coffee flowing in every corridor already. Is there something else that might be better? Ooh maybe some good Christmas flavored creamers for their coffee?  
     
Also at what point did you tell them you were skipping the bell? “Fuck your bell” was a running joke between me & my feistiest chemo nurse, the infusion staff knew I was too shy for that, but it’s never come up with the radiation staff. Do they just assume people want to ring the bell or do they ask?

1ppyvqg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppyvqg,Daily Stack,"Hey guys!
I’d love to see your daily stacks & hear your stories behind them, if you’re collecting for memories.

I recently got my dream watch and I’m in absolute awe. I always wore the bracelet on my other arm because it felt a bit off, but today I decided to “soft launch” the gold and silver theme into my bracelet and got the little three-piece dangle. 

I mainly got it because I had a very important meet up with a colleague over a coffee. I tried telling him off a couple of times and he wouldn’t listen to me, and today, I finally managed to find words clear enough even he understood them. I’m over the moon (ha!) and decided to celebrate with a little reminder — the sun, the moons and the stars shine for me as they do for everyone else. I must stand up for myself, because it’s my universe just as much as it’s theirs (or his). I absolutely freaking love it, especially next to the globe stopper.

I get to travel for work, so all other charms are work and travel related.

The shrimp charm resembles me and my boyfriend eating Omakase at a sushi restaurant in Japan for the first time. The chef served him a big shrimp and when he got shy because he didn’t know how to approach eating it, the chef showed him in the most entertaining and endearing way how to pull the head off.

The white enamel moon resembles me seeing polar lights for the first time on a night shift and the sea stars resemble what my mom used to tell me about the Maldives, her absolute dream destination. To me, it’s a symbol for dreaming and hoping for better days — and what I expected coral reefs to look like (spoiler: they don’t anymore, at least not the ones I saw). 

And finally, a moon, because I made all life changing decisions in my life so far at night - and the passport + world charm at each end of it that shall remind me constantly of how going this path (moving to another country & pursuing aviation to be independent while going to uni) is the right & necessary thing for me.

So damn, that was deep. And perhaps too long to read. I’d love to read yours though! 🥹 Let’s see some bracelets 🌟",22,1766084066.0,PandoraCollectors,1,1.0,False

Hey Maximizame fam! ✨

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions? Like life's a bit of a blurry rerun? I've been there, and honestly, it can be a bit soul-crushing. But I've discovered something pretty powerful: the *magic of the micro-adjustment*. We don't need to overhaul our entire lives overnight to see massive change.

Think about it. What are those tiny little things you do each day that drain you? Or, conversely, what are those small, seemingly insignificant actions that leave you feeling a little brighter, a little more energized?

Lately, I've been focusing on these subtle shifts, and the ripple effect has been *wild*.

Here are a few things I've been playing with, and maybe they'll spark something for you too:

*   **Morning Micro-Ritual:** Instead of grabbing my phone first thing, I've been making a conscious effort to just… be. A few deep breaths, a sip of water, maybe looking out the window for a minute. It sounds simple, but it sets a calmer tone for the entire day. No pressure, just a gentle landing.
*   **""Gratitude Pause"":** During moments of overwhelm or stress, I try to find *one* thing, no matter how small, to be genuinely thankful for. The warmth of my coffee, a funny text from a friend, the fact that my Wi-Fi is working today. It’s like a tiny reset button for my perspective.
*   **""Transition Treat"":** When I finish a task, whether it's work-related or a chore, I give myself a brief, intentional break. Maybe it’s five minutes of stretching, listening to one song, or stepping outside for fresh air. It breaks up the monotony and prevents that feeling of being constantly ""on.""
*   **""Digital Declutter"" bursts:** Instead of a massive digital cleanup, I do tiny 2-minute bursts. Unsubscribe from one email, delete 5 photos, close unused tabs. It prevents the overwhelm of a big task and keeps things manageable.

It’s not about perfection, it’s about progress. And it’s about noticing the subtle shifts that lead to a more joyful, more optimized existence.

Sometimes, when life throws a curveball and the overwhelm feels too much, having a solid support system can make all the difference. If you're ever feeling like you need that extra bit of guidance or someone to talk things through with, I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be incredibly helpful. It’s a good reminder that we don't have to navigate everything alone.

What are your tiny tweaks that are making a big difference? I'd love to hear what's working for you all! Let's keep this conversation going and inspire each other. 😊",2,1766083962.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey guys, Ive been a long time lurker in this sub and now finally posting some reviews. I have been collecting for roughly 2.5 years now. 

Started with Zara series/ajmal kuro. The decant is givenchy gentleman reservee prive. Here are reviews for some of the frags please dont expect nuanced reviews/descriptive scent journeys that the very talented people of this sub write.  :p

Im writing them in the order of my preference

JPG le male le parfum:
Imagine going to a spice shop or a kirana shop which sells open spices. Now imagine someone coming in the shop and throwing vanilla / amber or something sweet in the shop. This is how it smells youll know its sweet but its not that sweet.  Got my first compliment on this and sits very close to skin after 3ish hours, lasts for days on clothes.

PS: if you imagine someone first rubs the spices on your face and then drowns you in the sweet vanilla/amber you have JPG le male le elixir.

Tom ford ombree leather edp
Take leather and tone down the  apple-ish sweet part of ysl y , you get this. I love it . Cant say much about the performance since just got it. 

Lattafa khamrah qahwa:
Boozy - coffee very sweet but not unpleasantly(unlike og khamrah imo) sweet. For sure beast mode.  Would have been the top perfume if it had more coffee notes. For sure a compliment getter.

YSL Y EDP:

this is was my first designer frag. This is my second bottle. idk why but this perfume felt like a symphony , i love the apple flower combo , the apple sweetness , i would say it is just enough to tell you that its there . The sweetness comes as an undercurrent/subtext for the florals. 

Afnan 9pm :
Bubble gum(boomer) + vanilla , ik theres no such thing as being too strong(i mean lasting and projection) but if their was this perfume might be it. This is my second bottle i ran thru the first one like a madman (12 plus sprays on outing). It can be very cloying.


Would like some suggestion on oud perfumes.

1ppys9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyStoriesArchive/comments/1ppys9n/i_visited_my_grandparents_secluded_farmhouse_they/,I Visited My Grandparents’ Secluded Farmhouse... They Were Hiding Something Terrifying,"I hadn’t seen my grandparents in years, not since I was a kid, when the long summers at their remote farmhouse felt like a welcome escape from the noise of the city. Now, standing on the gravel driveway with my car engine cooling behind me, the place looked smaller somehow, worn down by time. 

The house was exactly as I remembered it, tall and slightly sagging, with weathered white paint peeling from the sides. It sat in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by fields and thick woods that seemed to go on forever.

I had taken them up on their offer to visit for a few days. A break was what I needed, I told myself. Things in the city had become overwhelming... work, life, everything. I needed to clear my head, and when Grandma mentioned in one of her letters that they missed having me around, I thought, Why not? It wasn’t like I had anywhere else to be.

As I climbed the porch steps, they were already waiting for me, their familiar faces smiling warmly. Grandma was just as I remembered, her soft gray hair pinned neatly back, her small frame draped in one of her floral aprons. She waved, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

""Well, look at you,"" she said, pulling me into a hug as soon as I reached the top step. ""All grown up. It’s so good to have you back, dear.""

I hugged her back, the smell of lavender and freshly baked bread filling the air. ""It’s good to be back,"" I said, trying to mask the awkwardness. It had been so long, and everything felt... distant.

Grandpa stood behind her, his hands tucked into the pockets of his old work trousers. He nodded in my direction, his smile more reserved. ""About time you visited,"" he said in his low, gravelly voice. ""Your grandmother’s been going on about it for weeks.""

""I know,"" I replied, chuckling softly. ""Sorry it took me so long.""

""Well, you’re here now,"" Grandma said, stepping back and looking me over with a proud smile. ""And that’s all that matters. Come on inside, we’ve got dinner ready.""

I followed them into the house, the door creaking shut behind me. Inside, everything looked almost exactly as I remembered it, the dark wooden floors, the old photographs lining the walls, and the heavy furniture that seemed like it hadn’t moved in decades. It was like stepping into a time capsule, a place untouched by the outside world.

As we moved through the narrow hallway toward the kitchen, something caught my eye in the living room. I slowed my pace, glancing over my shoulder. There, hanging above the fireplace, was the oversized family portrait.

It was a painting I vaguely remembered from my childhood, though I hadn’t thought about it in years. It depicted my grandparents, younger and more vibrant, standing in the center, surrounded by other family members.

Most of them had passed. The colors were faded, and the faces had that old-world, serious look to them, like they were posing for something much more formal than a family portrait.

But one person stood out to me now, someone I didn’t remember seeing before. Toward the back of the group, half-obscured by shadow, was a man I couldn’t place. He wasn’t standing like the others, though, he seemed slightly turned away, as if he were just on the edge of the scene, almost like an afterthought.

""Come on, honey,"" Grandma called from the kitchen, pulling me from my thoughts. ""Dinner’s getting cold!""

I blinked and tore my eyes away from the painting, making my way into the kitchen where the warm glow of the overhead light and the smell of stew greeted me. We sat around the worn wooden table, and Grandma ladled steaming bowls of her homemade stew in front of us.

""It’s been so long since we’ve had you here,"" she said, smiling as she set a plate of bread on the table. ""I hope you’re hungry.""

I nodded, though the strange feeling from the painting still clung to me. ""Yeah, I am. Thanks, Grandma. This smells great.""

We ate in relative silence, the familiar sounds of clinking spoons and soft conversation filling the room. They asked me how life had been in the city, how work was going, and I gave them the usual vague answers. I didn’t want to get into the details of why I really needed a break, how the stress had gotten to me, how everything had started feeling overwhelming. It wasn’t something I was ready to talk about.

After dinner, I found myself wandering back into the living room. I didn’t know why, but I felt drawn to the painting again, like I needed to look at it more closely. There was something unsettling about the way that man in the background was positioned, half-hidden, his face barely visible in the dim light of the room.

I stood there, staring at the portrait for longer than I meant to, trying to figure out if I had just forgotten about him or if something was... different. His expression seemed almost blank, like the others, but there was something in his eyes that unnerved me.

""Everything okay, dear?""

I jumped slightly, turning to see Grandma standing in the doorway with a soft smile on her face. I hadn’t heard her come up behind me.

""Yeah,"" I said quickly, forcing a smile. ""Just looking at the portrait. I don’t remember it that well from when I was a kid.""

She stepped into the room, her eyes flicking to the painting. ""Oh, that old thing,"" she said with a soft chuckle.

""Who’s the man in the back?"" I asked, pointing to the man. ""I don’t think I recognize him.""

Grandma’s smile faltered for the briefest of moments, but then she recovered, shaking her head lightly. ""Oh, just another relative. He’s always been there."" She looked at me again, her smile a little more forced. ""You probably just don’t remember.""

I nodded, though something about her response didn’t sit right with me. ""Yeah, maybe.""

""Anyway, it’s getting late. You should get some rest,"" she said, her voice gentle but firm. ""It’s good to have you here again.""

I hesitated for a moment, glancing at the painting one last time before turning to follow her. As I made my way down the hall to the guest room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about that portrait.

The guest room was small, with an old wooden bed and a heavy quilt draped over it. The room was pristine, almost unnervingly so, as if no one had set foot in it for years. I felt like an intruder, like I didn’t belong there. Still, exhaustion from the long drive took over, and I collapsed into bed, pulling the quilt up around me.

The silence of the house was unsettling. I had forgotten how quiet it could be out here, so far from the city. No traffic, no sirens, no hum of life beyond the walls, just the soft creaking of the house and the distant rustle of the wind through the trees.

Eventually, sleep pulled me under.

The next morning, I awoke to the soft light filtering through the thin curtains of the guest room. The house was quiet, as it always was.

I stretched and got out of bed, the old wooden floorboards creaking under my weight. The room was still as pristine as ever, the air slightly stale, as if it hadn’t been opened up in years. I glanced around, my eyes lingering on the closed closet door. A small shiver crawled up my spine, but I shook it off.

Breakfast was simple... toast, eggs, and coffee. Grandma was already up, bustling around the kitchen with her usual energy, while Grandpa sat quietly at the table, flipping through an old newspaper. They seemed as peaceful as ever. I joined them.

“How did you sleep, dear?” Grandma asked, setting a plate in front of me.

“Fine, thanks,” I replied. “The house is... quiet.”

Grandma smiled. “That’s the charm of the country. You get used to it.”

We ate in relative silence. Grandpa glanced at me over the rim of his coffee mug, his expression unreadable.

After breakfast, I wandered through the house, reacquainting myself with its layout, its old furniture, and the relics of a simpler time. I walked through the narrow hallway that led back into the living room, my steps slowing as I approached the large family portrait above the fireplace.

The man in the back, he’d moved.

I froze in place, my heart skipping a beat as I stared at the painting. I was sure of it. The unknown figure, the man I didn’t recognize, had definitely shifted. He was no longer half-obscured in the background. He had moved closer to the foreground, his shadowy face now clearer. His eyes, dark, almost black, seemed to stare directly at me.

For a long moment, I couldn’t move. I just stood there, staring back at him, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Had I imagined it?

I took a step closer, squinting at the portrait. The rest of the people, the ones I recognized as my grandparents and long-dead relatives, hadn’t changed. Their solemn expressions were just as I remembered. But this man, this stranger, was different. His presence in the painting was more pronounced, his face more defined, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me.

I backed away. I turned to leave the room, but my gaze kept flicking back to the portrait. Something about it was wrong, and the longer I looked, the more I felt the weight of the man’s eyes following me.

I found Grandma in the kitchen, humming softly as she wiped down the counter.

“Why don’t you go help your grandfather outside? He could use an extra pair of hands.” Grandma said.

I hesitated, glancing back toward the living room. “Yeah, sure.”

I stepped outside, the fresh air a welcome relief from the oppressive stillness of the house. Grandpa was already in the yard, mending an old fence. He worked quietly, his movements slow and deliberate, as though he were trying to keep himself busy.

I joined him, picking up a hammer and some nails, though my mind was still on the portrait. The man in the painting, his face wouldn’t leave my thoughts.

For the rest of the day, I helped Grandpa with odd chores around the property, but the feeling of being watched never left me.

That night, I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling once again. The silence of the farmhouse had taken on a different tone, one that felt less peaceful and more... expectant.

I rolled over, my eyes drawn to the closet door at the far end of the room. It was closed, as it had been the night before, but now it seemed different. Ominous, somehow. I tried to ignore it, but a small part of me kept waiting for it to creak open on its own.

The minutes dragged by, and just as I started to drift off to sleep, I heard footsteps.

Soft at first, but unmistakable, just outside my bedroom door.

The footsteps continued, moving back and forth, as if someone was walking up and down the hall. I held my breath, straining my ears to listen. The sound was so faint, but it was there.

I thought maybe it's just one of my grandparents, checking in on me.

They continued, soft but persistent, the sound growing louder the more I focused on it.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore.

With shaky hands, I threw back the blankets and got out of bed, my feet cold against the wooden floor. I walk toward the door.

The footsteps stopped.

I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, listening to the silence that had suddenly filled the house. My hand hovered over the doorknob, trembling slightly.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

The hallway was empty.

No one. Just the dim light from the window at the end of the hall. Everything was still. Nothing moved. The air was thick with an unnatural quiet.

I backed into the room, my pulse racing, and closed the door quickly behind me. My hands were shaking as I leaned against the door.

The footsteps didn’t return, but the unease stayed with me.

The following morning, I woke up with a heaviness in my chest. The previous night’s event clung to me like a fog I couldn’t shake. And as much as I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, deep down I knew better.

I got dressed and headed into the kitchen, hoping that a simple morning routine might help shake the lingering dread. Grandma was already bustling around the stove, humming softly to herself. The smell of coffee filled the air, and for a brief moment, the farmhouse felt warm and familiar again.

“Good morning, dear,” Grandma greeted me with a smile as I sat down at the kitchen table. “How did you sleep?”

“Fine,” I lied, taking a sip of the hot coffee she set in front of me.

She smiled, but there was something guarded in her eyes, like she knew more than she was letting on.

I spent most of the day outside, helping Grandpa with small chores. He didn’t say much, as usual, but his silence was oddly comforting. The open space of the farm provided a welcome escape from the unnerving atmosphere inside the house.

As evening approached, the familiar tension began to settle over me once again. The house seemed to change with the setting sun, becoming heavier, more oppressive.

Dinner that night was quiet. Too quiet. I noticed that the an extra place at the table had been set. An empty chair, a plate, and silverware, perfectly arranged.

“Grandma,” I said slowly, “why did you set an extra place at the table?”

She looked up at me, her expression perfectly calm, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes. “Oh, it’s just an old habit,” she said lightly, as though it was nothing.

“Even when no one’s here?” I pressed, my voice wavering slightly.

She smiled again, that same tight smile that never quite reached her eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”

I didn’t know what else to say. I glanced at Grandpa, but he didn’t look up from his plate. The silence in the room was suffocating, like a thick blanket draped over everything.

After dinner, I found myself drawn back to the guest room. I was tired, but more than that, I was unsettled. The weight of the house, the eerie stillness, the way my grandparents seemed to dodge every question, it was all becoming too much.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts drifted back to the portrait in the living room. I hadn’t dared look at it again after noticing the figure had moved. But the memory of those dark, piercing eyes followed me into the room, watching me even here, in the supposed safety of the guest room.

Just as I felt myself drifting off, I heard the footsteps again. Pacing slowly back and forth outside my bedroom door, just as they had the night before. My heart skipped a beat, and I felt my body tense instinctively.

I lay still, listening. Back and forth. Pacing. Stopping just outside my door, as if waiting for something.

They continued, growing more insistent. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will them away, but the sound persisted, and I felt the creeping sensation of someone standing just outside the door.

With trembling hands, I threw back the blankets and stood up, my legs shaking as I approached the door. My heart raced, and my fingers hovered over the doorknob. I hesitated, the memory of the shadow from the night before flashing in my mind.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

Nothing.

As I turned, something caught my eye.

The door to the closet in my room, it was slightly ajar.

I swallowed hard, my heart skipping a beat as I slowly backed into the room. I hadn’t opened the closet. I knew that for certain. It had been closed when I went to bed.

Then, I started hearing whispers, faint, almost inaudible, coming from the closet. A soft, unintelligible murmur.

I stared at the closet door, my hands shaking. The whispers grew louder, but I still couldn’t make out the words. They were too muffled, too distant, like they were beckoning me closer.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare approach the door. The whispers seemed to press in from all sides, filling the room with their eerie, disembodied voices.

Then, the whispers stopped.

The house fell silent once again, leaving me standing in the dark, trembling, staring at the half-open closet door.

I eventually mustered the courage to approach the closet, and closed the door.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents.

“Did either of you hear anything last night?” I asked cautiously as we sat around the breakfast table. “Footsteps, or... voices?”

Grandma and Grandpa exchanged a quick glance, their expressions carefully neutral. “Old houses make noises, dear,” Grandma said, her tone light. “You’re probably just not used to the quiet.”

“No,” I insisted, my voice tightening. “I know what I heard. Someone was pacing outside my door. And the closet...”

“It’s nothing to worry about,” Grandpa cut in, his voice firm and unyielding. He glanced at me from across the table, his expression unreadable. “Just keep your door closed at night.”

The tension in the room was thick, and I knew I wasn’t going to get any more answers from them. Whatever was happening in this house, they weren’t going to talk about it.

But I wasn’t imagining things. I knew that now.

Something was happening. And it wasn’t just in my head.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of mundane tasks. I went through the motions, helping Grandpa with jobs around the property, listening to Grandma talk about the weather, the garden, anything except the house and what was happening inside it. But even when I was outside, the air didn’t feel fresh. It felt stifling, as though the weight of the house clung to me, pulling me back, refusing to let me escape its gaze.

By the time evening came around, I was exhausted, physically and mentally.

Dinner that night was as quiet as ever. The clinking of silverware was the only sound as we ate in near silence. I noticed it again, the extra place setting.

The chair had been pulled out slightly, more than it had been the previous night. The plate was aligned perfectly with the empty seat, the silverware positioned neatly beside it. My heart raced as I stared at the empty chair, the faintest hint of movement catching my eye. It was almost imperceptible, but the chair had shifted, just slightly, as though someone was sitting down.

I blinked, trying to convince myself that I hadn’t seen it. But then the chair moved again.

It wasn’t dramatic. It didn’t slide across the floor or jerk violently. But it shifted, slowly, as though an invisible presence was adjusting itself, making itself comfortable at the table.

My throat tightened, and I glanced at Grandma and Grandpa, expecting them to notice. But they didn’t react. They kept eating, completely oblivious to the chair’s subtle movement.

“Grandma,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “The chair... it moved.”

She looked up at me, her expression calm and serene. “Oh, dear, it’s just an old chair”

But her words didn’t reassure me. There was something about the way she said it, the casual dismissal, the way her eyes didn’t quite meet mine, that sent a chill down my spine.

I wanted to say more, why they pretended nothing was wrong, but the words caught in my throat. Instead, I nodded weakly and focused on my plate, pretending that everything was fine. But my eyes kept drifting back to the chair, watching for any further movement.

The rest of the dinner dragged on in an agonizing silence. I barely touched my food, my appetite completely gone.

After dinner, I couldn’t stay in the dining room any longer. I excused myself and retreated to the guest room, my mind racing. I paced the room, glancing nervously at the closet door that had been slightly ajar the night before. It was closed now, but the unease lingered.

I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The painting, the strange noises, the chair moving on its own, it was like the house itself was alive.

Just as I started to calm down, I heard it again.

The sound of footsteps.

I waited for the footsteps to stop outside my door, just as they had the previous nights. But this time, they didn’t.

The footsteps kept moving, passing by my door, fading as they traveled down the hall. I stood there, frozen, listening intently. Then, after a long moment of silence, I heard it.

The creak of a chair.

The sound was faint, but unmistakable.

With trembling hands, I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. It was dark, the faint moonlight casting long shadows on the floor. My feet were silent against the wooden boards as I made my way toward the dining room.

As I approached, the air grew colder. The faint sound of silverware scraping against a plate reached my ears.

I stopped at the entrance to the dining room, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see what was waiting for me at the table.

But I forced myself to step into the room.

The chair, was pulled out completely now.

But no one was there.

Slowly, cautiously, I approached the table. The closer I got, the colder the air became.

My hand shook as I reached out to touch the chair, and the moment my fingers brushed the wood, I felt it.

A breath. Soft and cold, whispering against the back of my neck.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the table, my pulse racing. I turned around quickly, expecting to see someone standing behind me, but the room was empty.

Empty, except for the faint sound of a low, breathy sigh, too close, too real.

I backed out of the room, my heart hammering in my chest, and hurried back down the hallway to the guest room. I closed the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to catch my breath.

I was losing it. That’s what I told myself. I was tired, stressed, and my mind was playing tricks on me.

The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I confronted my grandparents at breakfast.

“Why do you set that extra place every night?” I asked, my voice tight with frustration. “Why do you pretend nothing’s wrong?”

They exchanged a glance, their faces carefully neutral, but the tension in the room was palpable.

“It’s just the way things are, dear,” Grandma said quietly. “We’ve always done it. Don’t worry about it.”

“But I am worried,” I insisted. “The chair, it's moving. I hear footsteps at night. There’s something here, something you’re not telling me.”

Grandpa finally looked up from his plate, his eyes dark and unreadable. “Some things are best left alone,” he said in a low, gravelly voice. “You don’t need to understand everything.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words died in my throat. The look in his eyes was enough to silence me. There was a warning there, a quiet threat that told me I was getting too close to something I wasn’t meant to know.

I pushed my plate away and stood up from the table. I couldn’t sit there any longer, pretending that everything was normal. The house was wrong, the painting was wrong, and my grandparents were hiding something. Something that was growing more dangerous with each passing night.

The unease that had been simmering beneath the surface all week was now a full-blown, suffocating dread. After breakfast, I couldn’t stand being inside the house any longer. I needed to clear my head, to escape the oppressive feeling that something unseen was lurking in every corner, watching my every move.

I spent most of the day outside, wandering the property, but no matter how far I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was pulling me back. Like an invisible thread was tugging at my chest, reminding me that I couldn’t escape for long. Eventually, I returned to the farmhouse.

I hesitated at the entrance to the living room, my eyes drawn to the family portrait above the fireplace. My heart sank as I stepped closer.

The man in the portrait.

This time, he was no longer standing in the background, partially obscured by the shadows of the other people. Now, he was at the very front, his face clear and sharp, his eyes fixed directly on me. His expression had changed, too. There was something cruel in the way his lips curled, something dark and malicious in the way he seemed to be staring straight into my soul.

The other people in the painting, my grandparents, their long-dead relatives, had faded even further into the background, their faces barely visible now. It was as though the man had claimed the entire portrait for himself.

I backed away from the painting, my thoughts racing. It wasn’t possible. But I couldn’t deny what I was seeing. The man in the portrait was watching me, and he was getting closer.

I turned to leave the room, my hand shaking as I gripped the edge of the doorframe. But before I could step out, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

A reflection.

In the large mirror on the opposite wall, I saw him.

The man from the portrait, standing in the doorway, watching me.

I whipped around, my heart hammering in my chest, but the doorway was empty.

Nothing. No one.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the edge of the carpet, my legs shaking as I bolted out of the room. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what was happening. It was impossible. It couldn’t be real.

I found myself back in the hallway, my back pressed against the wall as I struggled to catch my breath. My eyes darted around, half-expecting to see the man appear again, but the hallway was empty.

But something else was wrong.

The shadows in the hallway... they didn’t look right.

I glanced down at the floor, my stomach twisting with dread. The shadows cast by the dim light were distorted, stretching out in unnatural ways. The shadow closest to me, the one near the guest room door, was too long, too large.

And then I realized. It wasn’t my shadow.

The shadow stayed where it was, unmoving, as though the figure casting it was standing just behind me, out of sight.

Slowly, I turned.

No one.

But the shadow was still there, lingering on the floor.

I backed into the guest room, slamming the door behind me, my heart racing. My mind was spinning. I couldn’t make sense of it. I didn’t understand what was happening, or why.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the wind outside sent a fresh wave of panic through me. The whispers had returned, soft and distant, coming from the closet again. They were louder now, more insistent, beckoning me closer.

I lay there, staring at the closet door, too afraid to move. The whispers were muffled, garbled, like someone was speaking through layers of fabric.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the sound to go away. But it didn’t. It grew louder, more urgent.

Finally, I got out of bed and walked toward the closet. My hands trembled as I reached for the door.

And then, slowly, I pulled the door open.

The closet was empty.

At least, it looked empty.

But the air inside was cold, much colder than the rest of the room. I could feel it, like a faint breath against my skin. I reached inside, my fingers brushing against the old clothes hanging neatly in a row. But something wasn’t right.

The clothes.

They were old-fashioned, worn but somehow still new. I pulled one of the shirts off the hanger, my pulse quickening as I inspected it. It was a man’s shirt, plain but neatly pressed, the fabric stiff as though it had never been worn.

And then it hit me. The clothes looked exactly like the ones worn by the man in the portrait.

I dropped the shirt, stumbling back in horror. My hands shook as I slammed the closet door shut.

I sat on the edge of the bed, but the room felt smaller, the walls closing in around me. The whispers were gone now, and I forced myself to calm down.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents again.

“Who is he?” I demanded, my voice shaking. “The man in the portrait. I’ve seen him. He’s here.”

They exchanged another glance, their faces unreadable, but this time, there was something darker in their expressions, something they had been hiding.

Grandma sighed softly, her eyes fixed on the table in front of her. “He’s family,” she said quietly. “He’s always been here.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my heart pounding in my chest. “Who is he?”

“He’s... one of us,” Grandpa said, his voice low and gravelly. “But he never really left.”

I stared at them, trying to make sense of their words.

Their words echoed in my mind long after breakfast was over: ""He never really left.""

What did that mean? The idea that the man from the portrait was part of the family, always present in some way, sent a cold chill down my spine. I didn’t know what was worse, the idea that my grandparents believed it, or the fact that, after everything I’d seen, I couldn’t bring myself to dismiss it as nonsense.

I spent the rest of the day in a haze, packing my bags, preparing to leave the next morning. I took most of the stuff to my car that evening.

As the evening sun began to set, casting long shadows across the fields, the oppressive weight of the house became almost unbearable. Every part of me wanted to leave, to get out of that place that night and never return, but something held me there, an invisible pull that I couldn’t shake. The house, the painting, my grandparents, they all seemed to be tied together by something darker, something I hadn’t yet fully understood.

Dinner was quiet, suffocatingly so. My grandparents didn’t say much, and I barely touched the food in front of me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the portrait, about the man who had moved so close to the front, his eyes locking with mine every time I passed by.

I needed to look at it again. To see if something had changed. It was like a compulsion, pulling me back into that living room.

As soon as dinner was over, I slipped away from the table, my feet carrying me almost of their own accord toward the living room. The moment I stepped inside, a cold chill swept over me, freezing me in place for a second. The air in the room felt wrong, as if it were heavier, more stifling than it should be.

I approached the portrait slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. The familiar people were all there, my grandparents, their long-deceased relatives, their solemn faces staring out from the past. But as my eyes moved across the canvas, my stomach dropped.

The man.

He was gone.

My breath hitched, and I stumbled back, my mind reeling. I scanned the portrait again, my eyes searching every corner, every inch of the canvas, but he wasn’t there, and the other people had faded even further into the background, their faces barely discernible.

I stood frozen, my skin crawling with the cold realization that the man had left the painting. The silence of the room pressed in around me, thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I had the overwhelming sensation that I wasn’t alone in the room anymore.

I turned quickly, my eyes darting to the doorway, but it was empty. My pulse raced as I took a shaky step back from the portrait, the cold dread settling deep in my bones.

Then I saw something.

A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye.

At the far end of the hallway, just beyond the faint glow of the light, was a person. He stood still, barely visible in the dim light.

I blinked, my heart pounding in my ears, and he was gone.

I backed away from the doorway, but as I turned toward the hallway again, I saw him once more.

This time, he was closer.

Standing just a few feet away, his dark eyes fixed on me.

My body locked up in terror, and I stumbled back, unable to tear my eyes away from him. He was tall, much taller than I had imagined, and his features were sharper, more defined, more sinister than they had been in the painting. His skin was pale, almost gray, and his eyes... they were black, bottomless, like they were drawing me in, pulling me toward him.

He took a step closer.

My legs finally responded, and I bolted. I ran out of the living room, down the hallway, my footsteps echoing in the suffocating silence of the house. My mind was a blur of panic, my heart racing as I turned corner after corner.

I reached the guest room and slammed the door shut behind me. The room was dark, the only light coming from the sliver of moonlight slipping through the curtains. The air felt colder in here, thicker.

A cold draft brushed the back of my neck, and I froze. Slowly, I turned my head towards the corner of the room, dread curling tight in my chest.

There he was.

Standing in the corner of the room, just a few feet away. His form was darker now, almost blending into the shadows, but I could see him, looming over me like a predator.

The room seemed to warp around him, the walls shifting and bending as if they were being pulled toward him. He didn’t speak, but I could feel his presence in every inch of the room, pressing down on me, suffocating me with his gaze.

I had to leave. Now.

I threw the door open and ran out of the room, down the stairs, my footsteps loud and frantic in the otherwise silent house. I didn’t stop until I reached the front door, grabing my car keys and stumbling out onto the porch.

The cold night air hit me like a slap, but it wasn’t enough to chase away the terror clawing at my insides.

I stepped out into the yard, gasping for breath, trying to make sense of what had just happened.

I hopped into my car and as I was about to drive off, I glanced back at the house one last time, and I saw them.

My grandparents.

They were standing on the porch, watching me with unreadable expressions. Their faces were calm, almost serene, but there was something unnerving in the way they looked at me, like they were expecting this. Like they had been waiting for it.

And then, behind them, the man from the portrait.

He stood tall, his dark eyes gleaming in the moonlight. His hand rested on my grandfather’s shoulder, his long, pale fingers curling around him like claws.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t move.

They just watched.

As I drove away from the farmhouse, my hands shaking on the steering wheel, I glanced in the rearview mirror one last time. The house grew smaller in the distance, disappearing into the darkness of the night.

It had been a week since I left the farmhouse.

I hadn’t told anyone what happened. I didn’t know how to explain it, didn’t know if I even believed it myself. The memories felt hazy now, like fragments of a nightmare that refused to leave me. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw him, the man from the portrait, standing there, watching.

I tried to settle back into my life in the city, but nothing felt normal anymore. The sounds of traffic, the crowded streets, they didn’t comfort me like they used to. I felt restless, anxious.

Late one night, as I sat alone in my apartment, staring at the glowing screen of my phone, it rang. The number on the screen was unfamiliar, but something about it tugged at my gut, filling me with an inexplicable sense of dread.

I answered it.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, my hand trembling slightly as I held the phone to my ear.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, a long stretch of silence that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I waited, my breath catching in my throat.

Finally, a voice. Soft, familiar.

“Dear?” It was my grandmother.

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t spoken to her since the night I left, and hearing her voice now, crackling through the phone, sent a cold shiver down my spine.

“Grandma?” I said.

“Yes, dear.” Her tone was calm, almost too calm. “It’s been a while. We were just wondering... when you might come back.”

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. “I... I’m not sure. I don’t think...”

“Your room is still ready for you,” she interrupted, her voice soft but insistent. “And the portrait... well, it’s still hanging there. Waiting for you.”

My heart pounded in my chest. I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out.

Then, in the background, I heard it.

A faint rustling, like someone moving around, adjusting something.

And then a voice, low, deep, and unmistakable.

“I'm waiting.”

It was him.

The line went dead.

I dropped the phone, my hands shaking as cold sweat broke out across my skin.

He was still there. And somehow, he had reached out to me.

The man in the portrait wasn’t just a distant relative. He was something else, something tied to this house, to the family. And now, he was trying to claim me.

1ppyrvz,https://i.redd.it/yyfgtauwd08g1.jpeg,Pale Elysium (Part I),"""There now, isn't this better? The sweet oblivion. No love, no preservation, no light in the formless nothing."" 

A scratchy and retching voice bellows as I gather my surroundings, or lack there of. The voice was right, I can't even see my own feet let alone anything beyond. Scanning the inky void for any sort of familiarity, I attempt to muster a response. There is utter silence as if vocal cords were never apart of my anatomy. My heart races as I latch at my throat while straining to scream. In my attempt to give any semblance of noise, I start to lose consciousness. As my eyes grow heavy and my breathing fades, the voice calmly speaks.

""The song of death is sweet and endless. Let it fill you with it's harmony and splendor as you decend into it's embrace. May it take your essence and keep it eternal in it's divine blight.""

This voice overtakes me with the persuasion of its words and begins to hum a soft melancholic tune. Replacing my fear of this unkown realm with peace and solace. My skin gives a warm tingling sensation as my lungs grow weaker. What feels like every emotion I've ever felt flowing in from the infinite abyss. Just as I breathe what believe to be my last breath, the voice breaks the hymn and gives a stern rebuttal.

""Like a fly to the ointment, your consciousness sticks to it. The machine of pain and undignified suffering is alive once more. You will cross into the divine blight. Your life's expiry has already been set but has been found wanting.""

My eyes shot open in an instant. A ceiling fan loosely spinning amongst dimly lit room met my gaze. After several rapid blinks to confirm the visual, I sit up from the musty battered sofa I was laying on. The smell of old liquor and sweat wafts in the air. It didn't help that I was also freshly drenched from the hellish dream I had just woken up from. The TV just a few feet away, basking a soft glow of static into my unkempt living room. As I'm combating a headache of likes that I've never dealt with, I fumbled for the remote on the coffee table that sits between me and the talking box to turn the device off. I gently toss the remote to an open space on the sofa and let go of a hefty sigh as I rub my eyes. With myself at least minimally collected I glance down at the messy pile of food wrappers, magazines, and empty bottles of bottom shelf whiskey that populate the table and sigh in disgust.

I take in the sight and state of my rats nest I call a home. I live in a cramped studio apartment on the upper west side of the city. The walls are stained from decades of smoke and neglect. Most of my furniture is comprised of thrift store finds and pitiful second hand donations.

The clock that resides on the wall above the TV told a time that flashed me through all five stages of grief in an instant, 11:17pm. ""Shit..."" I said aloud as I quickly got up and shuffled to the landline in the kitchen, almost tripping over the trash and more empty liquor bottles that litter what open floor I had in this dingy shithole. The red light from the handset blinks rapidly with the number 19 next to it. ""19 voicemails? Fuck I must've been out of it for at least a day or two."" I press the voicemail button as I try to lean against the wall for balance.

""You have nineteen new messages. First message"" *beep*

""Elias! It's Calvin, WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU? it's 10:30 in the fucking morning and you're not at work, again! This is the fourth time this fucking week. Your ass better be in my office first thing Monday morning. We're going to have a nice long ch-""

""You'll get over it Calvin."" I jokingly said to myself before hitting delete and letting the rest of the messages play.

""Message deleted. New message.""

""Hey there Eli, it's me Vincent. I'm going to be in the neighborhood later to run some paperwork for the new property across the street. I hope you have my rent money for this month... And last month. Seeya 'round""

I must've been in the biggest blackout stupor of all time, there's not too many people who can sleep through Vince's tenacious phone calls and knocking on doors. I continue to let the rest of the junk voicemail messages play as I return to the couch to finish recollecting myself. Crashing into the soiled cushions, I rub my temples as a feeble attempt to subside the headache. After a few moments the voicemails end and my apartment was introduced to a silence of which it's never met. A pin falling onto wool would sound like an explosion in comparison. The usual hustle and bustle of the outside world took the day off. The ambiance of traffic, people, normal daily infrastructure was completely MIA. Sure, it's near midnight but in a city this large, rest is not in it's repertoire.

The curiosity of this anomaly grew inside me, but was quickly interrupted by the much greater and more instinctual need, hunger. Who would've thought a diet of only junk food and liquor would have your body craving real sustenance. Rising once again from the germ sponge that is my couch, I made my way into my kitchen and inspected the contents of the fridge.

Water...
Eggs...
And... beer.

Considering this is my fridge, it's somewhat adequately stocked in it's usual comparison. My pantry told the same tale. A few cups of quick top ramen and crackers, a real king's feast. I trudge into the bedroom to grab my shoes and keys for a quick pilgrimage to the corner bodega for something more noteworthy than my current offerings. With these items in hand I made my way out the door. I made it about five steps down the hallway towards the elevator when I smelled it. It was like bag of pennies that had been taking a vinegar bath in a hot car.

This vile scent stung my nostrils like no other. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand upright with every inhale. The flickering fluorescent overhead lights providing me a swirled and blurred vision. This scent intensified when I reached the call button. It took every ounce of my will to not vomit as the reeking air battled my hungover senses. The chime of the elevator rang as the doors slowly opened.

Inside was a man who stood a little shorter than average with perfectly slicked back hair and a tattered duster that looked like it saw better days 60 years ago. You could probably run a fast food joint with the amount of sludge like oil dripping from scalp. The smell intensified ten fold upon stepping inside. As my battle against the puke in my throat waged on, the man spoke in a rich but deep and  mellow tone as the doors closed.

""What'll it be Eli? Up or down?.. Haha- just messing with you, I know it's down.""

He wittingly remarks as he gently presses the lobby button with his ungodly long index finger. How the hell does he know my name? I start to ask but before I could get a word out, he makes another remark.

""You know son, I've been doing this a long time, longer than you could possibly imagine. I've only seen three other people get this kind of opportunity that you're about to be presented with. You should feel lucky, honored even.""

He glances up and looks at me with two glass orbs for eyes. No pupils, just a raging snow storm that occupies his sockets. His skin is that of a basalt stone and dark as the midnight sky. The flurry residing in his eyes quickens as he waits for my reply.

""Who are you? What opportunity are you talking about? What the fuck is this?"" I muster with my stomach forming knots within knots of itself.

""Who I am is not of importance right now Elias. You are being given a choice, it's the most important one you'll make in your existence. Once this door opens, everything you do, word you speak, action you take will be judged by the time you make it home. If you make it home...""

I was stunned, I had absolutely no idea what this mythical crackhead was talking about. Before I could respond to his babble, the elevator door slowly creaked open to a window of pure blackout. I stare into the framed void, trying to determine if I'm dreaming or just got so drunk that I'm hallucinating. After a brief moment I take my first step out of the elevator, the man says softly speaks.

1ppyr3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ppyr3l/caffeine_withdrawal_diary_over_a_month_caffeine/,Caffeine withdrawal diary (over a month caffeine free),"I saw somebody’s post about their day-to-day experience on being caffeine free and what their withdrawal symptoms are like so I thought I would give a little insight as to what I went through and I am still going through:

Prior to me quitting I was drinking anywhere from 4 to 5 monsters a day and a huge cup of coffee in the morning, anywhere from 1000mg to 1300mg of caffeine.

October 30th - this day I drank five monsters and had a big cup of coffee that morning. I haven’t really had any issues with caffeine from this point. I don’t get jittery or anything. I just drink the monsters because I love the taste. Wife and I went for a walk late at night getting ready for our Disney World trip and after getting around the first lap, I got real dizzy and went into a full-blown panic attack. Got to the house sat down and that’s when all hell broke loose for the next three weeks.

After that panic attack, I decided to cut back my caffeine so the next day I only drank two monsters because I was worried that the panic attack was being caused from excessive caffeine intake. The next four days, I was anywhere between 1 to 2 monsters a day, but the real hell was that I had major anxiety to the point where I was having multiple panic attacks. It was literally a nightmare for me, what I went through. 

November 11th - this is when I finally went to the doctor and explained what was going on and they put me on buspirone and hydroxyzine and amitriptyline. The hydroxyzine was to help take the edge of the anxiety, the amitriptyline was an off-label use for insomnia and buspirone is obviously for anxiety. 

The issue that I ran into during this time was that I kept feeling like I was going to constantly have another panic attack. I had this pit in my stomach at all times, and it was unrelenting and so hard to just feel at ease. Over the next two weeks I started to go into what I wanna call a agoraphobia. I had this incredible fear of going outside and having another panic attack.

One day, I finally went to the doctor again and she put me on Zoloft (which I never took. The buspirone started working.) and increased me on my hydroxyzine to 50 mg. When I went home that day I took the 50 mg of hydroxyzine and it never took the edge off. I kept feeling like I was just on the edge of a panic attack so I called the doctors office., told them what was happening, and thankfully, they put me on the phone with my doctor and she could hear the shakiness in my voice and the fear. Before I called her, I was pacing the living room talking to my wife, literally crying my eyes out scared I’ll never be normal again. My main concern was that I was about to leave for Thanksgiving to go see family. I was absolutely terrified of having a panic attack there. My doctor finally gave me Xanax as a fail-safe and told me to only take it if I absolutely need to.

The blessing in disguise: my doctors office has this problem with sending my medication’s to the wrong place and in this case I wanted it to be sent to Walgreens where they had originally sent my other medication’s, sometimes I do use Walmart because they carry another medication that I use to take. They sent the Xanax to Walmart. The issue with Walmart is that it’s inside. There is no drive-thru, but I had been reading obsessively about how to get past this anxiety, and one of the ways to get past, it was to put yourself in those situations that aren’t comfortable, but where you feel safe and realize that everything is OK.

I had my wife take me to Walmart and drop me off at the front door and I walked in and there was a line of eight people at the pharmacy and during that time I didn’t really have panic or necessarily anxiety, I was thinking about anxiety, but I kept telling myself I was OK. After I got the medication instead of turning left and going out the door, I told myself to turn right in to walk into Walmart further. When I did that, I started to call my wife and I told her that I need to do this. Let me walk around for a moment and she understood. Once I got down to the electronics area, I took a look at myself and said I’m OK I’m not panicked right now. Everything is OK. This is who you are. You’re fine and I had this euphoric moment with goosebumps all over my body and started to cry (that man cry that you hold in so nobody sees). So I took it a step further and I walked over to the pretzel aisle where there were a lot of people and I realize that I’m OK. I called my wife and she asked if I wanted to grab a pizza while I was in there for dinner and I said yes, so I went and grabbed the pizza and checked out. When I got to the car, I told her about what happened and just absolutely lost it crying realizing that I’m OK.

Now that wasn’t the end of the anxiety or anything like that but going on the trip to see Family and putting up Christmas lights helped me understand that I’m OK and that Family was very supportive about my situation. I kept my anxiety medication on me at all times as a safety blanket, which is a form of panic disorder. I also started doing cognitive behavioral therapy, which I’m going into my fourth session next week. After I got back from Thanksgiving, we had a week at home and I did fine then we had a long Disney World trip and that was when I was really worried about having a panic attack there, but we went through the trip and I could not tell you how amazing I felt to not be panicked or have anxiety on this trip.

Now I’m up to today which we got back Sunday from the Disney World trip, and I’m feeling really good other than getting sick with a sinus infection.  I do have a lot of neck pain still, but that also could be because of sleeping on different pillows on our trip.

I’m mainly writing this so people can read this and understand that if you do go through what I went through with the caffeine withdrawal, not that it’s normal because not everybody goes through this, but if you are going through this, it’s going to be OK. You’re going to make it through it. You will be yourself again.

If you need to take anxiety medication, there’s no shame in that, you need to do cognitive behavioral therapy. I don’t know how well it works because I’m still early in it, but I will say that I’ve had two sessions where I cried feeling good talking about this with a therapist.

You will be yourself again and everything will be OK just give it time and be patient, I know what you’re going through right now and I know you’re panicked and thinking you’ll never be normal again, but you will be just be patient as much as you can and as hard as that can be.

Also stop googling stuff, it does nothing but raise your anxiety. I’m still guilty of this.

Note: I never ended up taking the Xanax, I’ve never taken any type of addictive type medication like that before and I have a fear of doing it because I don’t wanna become dependent on it like some of my family has. I still take hydroxyzine and amitriptyline for bedtime to sleep. After the holidays, my doctor will wean me off amitriptyline and I’ll slow down my hydroxyzine and wean off it as well. I will still continue buspirone.",1,1766083763.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
1ppyqy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1ppyqy5/22_yo_student_from_india_looking_to_start_a_small/,22 y/o student from India looking to start a small coffee brand – need guidance from coffee lovers & professionals ☕,"Hi everyone 👋

First sorry if it's too long to read or i am wasting your time.

I’ll keep this short and honest.

I’m a 22-year-old student from India. I had my first cup of coffee during my first year of college, and since then… I honestly can’t imagine a day without it 😅
That obsession slowly turned into curiosity, and now I’m seriously thinking about starting my own small coffee brand.

I already have some support on the business side (basic investment, packaging, and marketing), but where I’m completely stuck is the coffee itself.

What I need help with:

1. Coffee beans:
Where can I source good-quality coffee beans in India?
I want to start very small (around 10–20 kg).
Friends suggested Bangalore/Coorg/Chikmagalur and nearby regions—does that make sense?
If anyone has contacts (farmers, traders, or roasters), I’d really appreciate it.

2. Roasting & grinding:
After getting green beans, what’s the best way to roast them as a beginner?
Should I roast myself or work with a local roaster at the start?

3. After grinding – what’s next?
How do brands make coffee powder with that smooth, consistent texture?
What affects aroma, freshness, and shelf life?

4. Standing out:
As coffee drinkers, what do you feel is missing in existing brands?
Is it taste, strength, freshness, pricing, packaging, or transparency?

5. Experience sharing:
If anyone here has worked with coffee (farming, roasting, café, or brand), I’d love to hear your experience—what mistakes should beginners avoid?

I’m not trying to build something huge overnight. I just want to understand coffee properly, respect the craft, and start small but right.

If you think there’s anything important I should know even if I didn’t ask please share. Every bit of information helps at this stage.

And yes, if I ever succeed in this journey, coffee is on me (with a good discount 😄).

Thanks in advance ☕

Additional info: I had all four taken out at the same time and it’s only this one socket that feels sensitive.

MAIN SYMPTOMS:

Chronic tinnitus (left-sided and sometimes whole-head), beginning after loud noise exposure.

Persistent jaw clenching since getting All-on-4 dental implants; I feel my bite may be off and I don’t get normal periodontal feedback.

Eustachian tube dysfunction / ear fullness (mostly left side), significantly worse during storms, wind, or viral illnesses.

Burning or hypersensitive sensations at the base of my neck/upper back and sometimes along my arms; cold air can trigger it.

It used to feel like a “toxin” sensation along my spine, which has gradually shifted into an intense burning sensation.

Intermittent left-upper abdominal discomfort (near the spleen area) alongside a virus.

Occasional burning skin sensations without visible rash.

During severe episodes, internal tingling/itch-like sensations in arms and legs that I cannot scratch.

Extremely persistent, repetitive anxiety and dread, especially on waking, often continuous until distracted.

Memory issues, including short-term memory and concentration problems.

Episodes lasting 1–2 weeks, triggered by viral illness and bad weather.

HISTORY / CONTEXT:

I was functioning normally before tinnitus onset, COVID illness, dental implants, and a COVID vaccination (one dose in 2021).

Symptoms generally improve in summer and worsen in winter.

There was significant black mold exposure in my home for a prolonged period; it has since been reduced/removed, but I’m unsure if this contributed.

I had what felt like a psychotic episode during severe pain, almost as if I was desperate to distract myself.

Blood tests including inflammatory markers have been normal.

Nasal spray sometimes helps unblock the left Eustachian tube.

I take vitamins/electrolytes, drink a lot of water, coffee, and chamomile tea.

I use mirtazapine 7.5 mg nightly for sleep.


IMPACT AND MENTAL HEALTH:

I can usually cope with tinnitus alone, but when multiple symptoms flare together it becomes extremely difficult.

Flares disrupt any work and daily functioning.

Significant anxiety and depression related to chronic symptoms.

Intense suicidal ideation during severe flares.

One physician suggested bipolar disorder after the psychotic episode; another mentioned fibromyalgia.

I don't even know where to begin solving this, any ideas or advice would be welcomed.

Thank you.

lunch was confusing, and  probably confused itself. Spinach and mushroom crepe with fried rice 2/10 for all that jazz. Sore reminder:don't pick what sounds unusual or creative I guess. And Creamed Sago with peaches. I tried a little and it was  lightly sweet and the peaches were slightly tart 8/10

Dinner was chicken schnitzel, brussel sprouts, mashed pumpkin, and a pack of mini sandwiches. I was barely awake when they brought it around so I literally just took a picture for you guys and went to sleep. 

Woke up at 8pm with a very weirdly strong craving for apple juice, so I asked the nurse and she gave me a cute little juice box and I haven't ever drank juice out of a box before, so that was quite the novelty.

I love the memories of scooping beans and smelling this variety in particular- it had a blueberry smell to it because the coffee crop was grown on an Ethiopian farm that rotated its crop with blueberry plants. Apparently doing so kept the soil at a premium.  It was also highly regarded in Ethiopia because of its high quality, so a large percentage of it was kept instead of exported.  It was used locally for coffee ceremonies.  This raised the price on the beans that were exported because the supply was so small.

If you’ve only thought of Verrado as a planned community in Buckeye, you’re missing half the story. What really makes Verrado special is how seamlessly it blends neighborhood life with some of the best-access desert trails in the West Valley.

Tucked into the White Tank Mountain foothills, Verrado feels different from a lot of newer developments. Tree-lined streets, walkable areas, and actual town squares give it an almost small-town vibe — which is rare out here. But step just a few minutes beyond the homes and you’re suddenly surrounded by open desert, rolling hills, and miles of trails.

The Verrado Main Street District is a great starting point. You can grab coffee, walk around, and then head straight toward the trailheads without ever getting in your car. From there, you’ll find a mix of beginner-friendly paths and more challenging climbs that offer sweeping views of the West Valley and the White Tanks.

The trails around Verrado are especially great if you want:

Less crowding than Camelback or Piestewa

Family-friendly hikes and walks

Trail running routes with elevation but not chaos

Quiet sunset and sunrise hikes


One of the underrated aspects is how approachable the terrain is. You don’t need to be an elite hiker to enjoy it. There are plenty of routes where kids, dogs, and casual walkers feel comfortable — but still enough elevation and scenery to make it rewarding.

Sunsets here hit differently. The light over the desert, the mountains turning purple and orange, and the quiet that settles in — it’s one of those places that reminds you why people put up with Arizona summers.

Verrado feels like a bridge between suburb and desert, convenience and adventure. Whether you live nearby or are just exploring the West Valley more, it’s absolutely worth checking out — especially if you enjoy trails without the pressure or crowds.

Chapter 1 — The Letter in the Attic

The house smelled of paper and dust — the kind of smell that clings to old photographs and yellowed curtains. Daniel Hale stood in the attic, holding his breath against the staleness as his flashlight swept across forgotten trunks and warped furniture. He hadn’t been here since his mother’s funeral two months ago. He had put it off, telling himself there would be time to go through her things, to decide what to keep, what to throw away. But now the silence pressed in on him, demanding the work be done.

He knelt beside an old cedar chest with a rusted lock that hung open. The wood was scarred and blotched, the initials S.H. burned faintly into the lid. He didn’t recognize them at first. It wasn’t until he brushed his hand over the brand that the name came to him—Silas Hale—his great-great-grandfather, a figure so far removed from the present that Daniel had only heard of him in passing. There were no photographs, only whispered suggestions that Silas had been “a strange man” who died young.

Inside the chest lay brittle sheets of newspaper, fragments of clothing eaten by moths, and at the bottom, a folded letter sealed with crumbling red wax. The seal had split, and the paper was soft as skin in places. The ink was faded but legible:

> To Silas Hale—
I have seen the black fire again, and the river of clear death runs stronger. You must not drink from it, no matter the urging. The burning in your chest is not an illness but the beginning of the crossing. The formula is not finished. Wait for the signs. The night birds will tell you when the door is open.
—R.E.

Daniel frowned, the words lingering in his mind like an afterimage. Black fire? River of clear death? The letter read like something torn from a fever dream, or a fragment of a religious prophecy. He placed it back into the chest, meaning to close it, but his hand hesitated. There was something else beneath the folded letter — the faint metallic glint of a small glass vial, corked and clouded with sediment.

When he lifted it to the light, he saw the label was handwritten in an elegant script: Methenamine.

A whisper of movement disturbed the dust in the far corner of the attic. Daniel froze. The beam of his flashlight cut across the shadows — just trunks, boxes, an old rocking chair. But for an instant, before he could blink, he thought he saw a tall, gaunt man standing by the far wall, dressed in a dark suit that had gone out of style a century ago.

And then he was gone.

Daniel’s breath fogged in the cold air. The silence was heavier now, as though the house itself were holding its breath.

---

Chapter 2 — The Man in the Mirror

The night after Daniel found the letter, sleep came fitfully. Every time he closed his eyes, his thoughts returned to the attic — the brittle paper, the warning about the river, the way the shadows seemed to shift. When he did drift off, his dreams were muddled and feverish: a rushing sound like water beneath the floorboards, a flickering orange light that burned without heat, a whisper that repeated Wait for the signs until the words tangled into nonsense.

The next morning, the house felt different. The air was cold and heavy, and each creak of the floor sounded sharper, closer. Daniel told himself it was just the stillness, the emptiness of a place once lived in. But as he stood in the upstairs bathroom, toothbrush in hand, he noticed something that made him pause.

In the mirror’s reflection, the hallway behind him was darker than it should have been. And there — faint, but undeniable — was a figure.

A man stood at the far end of the hall, too far for details, but tall, shoulders sloping, dressed in a black suit that shimmered faintly as though damp. His head tilted slightly, as if listening. Daniel spun around, heart kicking against his ribs.

The hallway was empty.

When he turned back to the mirror, there was nothing unusual in the reflection. Just himself, pale and tired, staring back. He laughed once, dry and humorless, and muttered, “Too much coffee,” even though he hadn’t had any.

By afternoon, curiosity gnawed at him. He pulled his laptop from its case and began searching for information on Silas Hale. What little he found was buried in local archives — a mention in a county record from 1892 about an unexplained death, a line in an old newspaper describing Silas as “an amateur chemist with peculiar interests.” No photographs. No grave marker in the family cemetery. It was as if he had been mostly erased.

That evening, Daniel caught the figure again — not in the hallway this time, but standing directly behind him in the mirror as he washed his hands. This time the face was visible: hollow cheeks, deep-set eyes that burned with a strange clarity, and a mouth curved in something that was almost a smile.

Daniel jerked around so quickly he nearly slipped on the tile. The room was empty.

When he turned back, the mirror was fogging over from the hot water. And as the mist crept across the glass, words began to appear, traced in a careful, deliberate hand:

> “We are not finished.”

---

Chapter 3 — The Bitter Taste

The vial sat on Daniel’s kitchen table for two days before he gave in.
He had carried it down from the attic almost without realizing it, the cold glass clenched in his fist. He told himself it was just curiosity — he wanted to see it in better light, maybe research it. But every time he sat down to eat or drink, the vial was there, a tiny sentinel, catching the glow from the overhead bulb.

By the third night, the message in the mirror had replayed in his head so many times that the words felt like they were inside him, as though he had thought them himself.
We are not finished.
Finished with what? The formula? The river? The “crossing” mentioned in the letter?

The internet told him methenamine was a compound sometimes used to treat urinary infections, harmless in small doses. But the vial in his possession looked older than the house — older than his own bloodline, maybe. A relic from when medicine and poison were sometimes the same thing.

He uncorked it.

The smell was sharp, chemical, with an undertone of something metallic. He hesitated — not out of fear, but anticipation. The kind of hesitation a man feels before jumping into cold water.

The first taste burned. Not the way alcohol burns, but deeper, as if it etched its way through the lining of his throat. For a moment his vision blurred, his stomach twisted, and he thought he might vomit. Then, just as quickly, the sensation shifted — warmth spread outward from his chest, and the edges of the kitchen sharpened in his sight. Colors deepened. The ticking of the wall clock became a heartbeat in the air.

And then, from somewhere over his right shoulder, a voice said:
“Better.”

Daniel spun around. Silas Hale stood in the doorway — not reflected in glass, not a trick of the light. Here. Present. His suit was neat but damp at the cuffs, his skin pale as bleached paper. His eyes fixed on Daniel with the kind of focus that pinned him in place.

“You’ve taken the first step,” Silas said. “I could not finish alone. But you…”
He smiled faintly, a smile that felt more like ownership than approval.
“…you might.”

Daniel’s tongue tingled with a bitter aftertaste, his pulse thundering. “What do you want from me?” he asked, though part of him already knew.

Silas stepped closer, the air cooling around him. “We will perfect it. We will finish the formula. Then, the door will open, and the river will take us through.”

Daniel blinked — and the kitchen was empty again.

The vial sat in front of him, a single drop clinging to its rim. He reached for it without thinking.

---

Chapter 4 — Lessons from the Dead

The days blurred. Daniel stopped keeping track of time, though he noticed the light through the windows seemed dimmer each afternoon. The methenamine made the dimness tolerable — no, more than tolerable. It made the air sharper, the colors fuller, the silence richer. Without it, the house felt hollow, the corners too dark. With it, Silas came.

He didn’t always arrive the same way. Sometimes Daniel would see him in a doorway, sometimes in a chair across the room, sometimes seated at the kitchen table as though he’d been there all along. His voice was low, measured, and oddly calm for someone so… insistent.

Silas began to teach him. Not through written notes or lectures, but through fragments, riddles, and demands.

> “Boil the crystals until the water runs clear, but do not breathe the steam.”
“Measure by weight, not volume — the river answers to gravity, not the clock.”
“Salt from the living, ash from the dead.”

Daniel didn’t ask where Silas expected him to get some of the ingredients. He didn’t have to. The ghost seemed to know when Daniel was ready to hear more, as if each dose of methenamine opened another door between them.

At night, Daniel heard Silas pacing the halls, the faint squeak of leather soles on the wood. Once, he caught sight of him outside in the yard, standing perfectly still in the rain, staring at the upstairs windows. When Daniel looked away and then back, the figure was gone — but the wet footprints continued up the porch steps and into the house.

His experiments began on the kitchen counter. Mixing clear liquids until they turned milky, grinding powders until they clung to his skin like frost. He wasn’t sure what he was making, only that Silas would nod approvingly when the fumes were strong enough to sting his eyes.

He stopped answering calls from friends. Stopped going into town. His reflection in the bathroom mirror began to change — not drastically, just enough that his eyes looked darker, his skin tighter over his cheekbones. The first time he noticed, Silas stood behind him, smiling faintly.

One night, after a particularly strong batch, Daniel asked, “What happens when the formula’s done?”

Silas’s eyes gleamed.

> “The door opens. We step through. And then you’ll see the city beneath the skin of the world.”

Daniel should have been afraid, but the words filled him with the same warmth the methenamine did — a warmth that was beginning to feel like home.

---

Chapter 5 — Hunger for the Flame

Days passed like smudges on glass. Daniel no longer measured time by hours or dates but by doses—how many times he fed the bitter vial, how many whispered instructions Silas pressed into his ear.

His body ached with a restless hunger, a craving that no meal could satisfy. The methenamine was no longer just medicine or experiment; it was a flame that burned beneath his skin, drawing out shadows from every corner of his mind.

Silas was always near. Sometimes standing in the doorway, sometimes sitting with Daniel in the peeling armchair by the window, watching the sky bleed red at dusk. His voice was a steady pulse in the silence, relentless.

“More,” Silas said one evening, handing Daniel a small packet of crystalline powder that shimmered faintly like broken glass. “This will take you further.”

Daniel hesitated, the powder trembling in his palm. The hunger inside him screamed louder than reason. He swallowed the crystals dry, and the world exploded into color and sound — the walls pulsing, the floor breathing beneath him. Shadows coalesced into shapes, faces twisted in agony and ecstasy.

He laughed, a sound raw and unhinged, and Silas’s grin mirrored his own.

Outside, the nights grew colder. Daniel stopped leaving the house altogether. His skin grew pale and clammy, his eyes sunken and wild. The mirror no longer reflected him but something else — something fractured and jagged.

He began to see the other Hales Silas mentioned, flickering at the edge of his vision: men and women trapped in the walls, their whispers curling through the plaster like smoke.

One night, Daniel found himself standing on the roof, staring down at the black river Silas had spoken of — a ribbon of inky water that wasn’t there the day before. The river called to him, and for the first time, Daniel felt no fear.

He reached out.

---

Chapter 6 — The Waking Dream

Daniel awoke with his heart pounding, the taste of dirt and iron heavy in his mouth. The sky above was a bruised purple, streaked with clouds like torn silk. His feet were bare, the cold ground biting through thin socks he didn’t remember putting on. He was in the woods — dense, shadowed, and whispering with leaves.

Panic surged, but the voice from the night before echoed in his mind, steady and calm. Silas.

“Drink, Daniel. The river waits.”

He pushed through the trees toward the sound of running water, each step pulling him deeper into the forest’s grasp. The black river glistened in the moonlight, still and strange, like oil spilled across the earth. Its surface rippled, though there was no wind.

Daniel knelt and dipped a trembling hand into the liquid. It was cold, but not unpleasant. He lifted it to his lips.

The water burned. Not like fire on skin, but fire in his blood. His chest tightened, breaths coming sharp and shallow. The forest around him shimmered, warping and folding like a waking dream.

“See,” Silas whispered from the shadows, “the door opens.”

Shapes emerged from the darkness — faces pressed against the river’s surface, eyes hollow and begging, hands clawing at the air. They were the other Hales, trapped between worlds.

Daniel’s mind fractured, a kaleidoscope of visions and voices crashing inside him. The river sang promises of escape, of power, of transcendence beyond flesh and bone.

But beneath it all, a cold dread settled — the knowledge that crossing might mean never coming back.

He stumbled backward, the river’s song fading to a distant echo. The forest twisted into walls and ceilings, the ground shifting beneath his feet.

He was home.

---

Chapter 7 — Strangers in the Walls

The house was no longer a home. It was a labyrinth of whispers and shadows, a place where every creak and sigh held a secret. Daniel moved through its rooms like a ghost himself, hollow-eyed and twitching, his fingers stained with powder and ash.

At night, the plaster seemed to breathe. Faint voices murmured behind the walls, weaving patterns of sorrow and rage that scraped against his sanity. The strangers Silas had warned about—the other Hales—were everywhere, their presence woven into the very fabric of the house.

Daniel’s hands trembled as he pressed his ear to the cold wall. The whispers twisted into names—his name, Silas’s name, names he could almost remember from dreams. “We failed,” they said. “We never crossed.”

Driven by a frenzied compulsion, Daniel fetched tools from the garage—a hammer, a crowbar, a chisel—and began tearing into the plaster. Dust choked the air, and splinters bit into his skin, but he did not stop.

Behind the cracked walls, shadows stirred. Glimmers of faces appeared—skeletal, desperate, eyes filled with endless longing. They reached out, fingers slipping through the fractures, begging for release.

Silas’s voice cut through the chaos:
“Find the ash. The final key.”

Daniel’s breath came in ragged gasps as he dug deeper. Among the rubble, he found a small, charred box, blackened as if burned by unseen fire. Inside lay brittle fragments of bone and a folded scrap of paper, stained with ink and something darker.

The note read simply:
“Only through fire and sacrifice can the door open.”

Daniel clenched the box to his chest. The strangers in the walls screamed in unison—a sound both agony and invitation.

And Daniel smiled.

---

Chapter 8 — The Final Formula

The kitchen was a chaos of glass and chemicals. Beakers bubbled with unnatural hues, powders shimmered on stained surfaces, and the acrid smell of burnt ash clung to the air like a shroud. Daniel moved with frantic purpose, mixing, measuring, burning—his hands steady even as his mind spiraled.

Silas hovered near, eyes gleaming with an impossible light. “You’re close. The door is almost open.”

Daniel’s reflection in the cracked mirror was a stranger—skin drawn tight over cheekbones sharper than before, eyes hollow wells of fever. But he didn’t care. Not anymore.

He boiled the last vial, watching as the liquid turned from clear to smoky black. The fumes made his eyes water, but he breathed deep, inhaling the burn as if it were life itself.

A voice whispered from the shadows—soft, urgent, familiar.

“Step through, Daniel.”

His fingers shook as he poured the final mixture into a small glass. The bitter taste spread across his tongue, igniting fire through his veins. Colors exploded behind his eyes, the world bending and folding.

And then, silence.

For a moment, he was nothing but light and darkness intertwined.

When his vision cleared, he saw Silas standing beside him, no longer ghostly but solid—two men bound by blood and madness.

The door had opened.

---

Chapter 9 — The River Calls

The black river pulsed beneath the moon, a living wound in the earth that sang a song only Daniel could hear. It called to him with a voice like ancient stone grinding—deep, relentless, inevitable.

He stood at the water’s edge, the final vial of the formula clenched in his fist. His skin itched with fever, his breath ragged, his mind a kaleidoscope of memories and madness. Silas was beside him, steady as ever, watching.

“Drink,” Silas urged, eyes gleaming. “Your body is but a door. Beyond lies the city beneath the skin of the world.”

Daniel’s hands trembled, but he lifted the glass and swallowed. The liquid burned hotter than before, setting fire to every nerve ending, unraveling his bones and soul.

The river welcomed him.

Visions shattered around him: endless streets paved in bone, buildings writhing like living things, shadows with faces like mirrors showing his own fractured self. The other Hales reached out, their voices a chorus of lament and welcome.

He felt himself slipping — part of him drowning, part soaring — lost in the river’s endless flow.

When dawn broke, the townspeople found the house empty but for the shattered glass and the faint scent of ash. Daniel was gone.

---

Chapter 10 — Inheritance

The attic smelled of dust and forgotten memories. Light filtered weakly through the grimy windowpanes, casting long shadows across the cracked floorboards.

Daniel’s family arrived at the house, summoned by worried neighbors. The door stood ajar, the kitchen a ruin of shattered glass and chemical stains. Upstairs, they found the attic chest — the one marked **S",2,1766082839.0,JordanGrupeHorror,0,1.0,False

A few facts for context: she is 63 and has been an alcoholic since at least 2011, maybe longer but that’s when I began to notice. She started with beer and had her first pancreatitis attack in 2012. She stopped drinking for about a year then switched to wine. She had her second, severe pancreatitis attack in 2014 and stopped again for about 6 months. She started back initially with whiskey here and there and then switched back to beer. She has been on a schedule of waking up at 5am, drinking a cup of coffee then switching to beer until she goes to sleep around 6pm, around 8-10 beers a day. She somehow managed to not have another attack (that I’m aware of) until yesterday. Other contributing factors are that she is also a patient at a pain clinic and takes narcotics daily and she only eats a small amount of food every day. She’s very private with her condition because she knows the effects it has on me and my children. 
So, idk all the details from the hospital yesterday, only what was put in MyChart, but her ethanol was 90mg/dl and her lipase was >3000u/l. Her potassium and sodium were low and her wbc and neutrophils were slightly high. She asked to be discharged because the iv meds made her feel better and the dr sent her home with instructions to start a liquid diet for at least 72 hours and of course to quit drinking. I do believe she lied about the severity of her problem because I can’t believe that a Dr would ok her to detox at home With no medical intervention. She has told me this morning she is ok and not drinking but I’m scared she’s either lying or at risk for a potentially lethal withdrawal.

Even when I worked im the restaurant industry we always paid back if we asked or were asked by someone getting door dash. ,12,1766082694.0,kvssnarker,9,0.93,False

I woke up and he got into my make up again. He's 7 years old and level 3. I'm so upset because it took me a long time to build up my collection although it wasn't very expensive make up. I won't have any money to get anything like that for a long time. I'm so sad because it was the only thing besides a cup of coffee I had that kind of got me through the day. I had the make up put into my closet at the top and he moved a chair in there to get it. I did have it put up high... I'm just sad,54,1766082683.0,Autism_Parenting,36,0.95,False
1ppya89,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1ppya89/black_coffee_prohibited/,Black Coffee Prohibited?,"Colonoscopy Clear Liquid Diet Day

The particular facility I'm having my colonoscopy at is saying that I can't even have black coffee the day prior to colonoscopy.

The coffee that I drink daily is decaf and it's black without anything in it. I'm not worried about caffeine headache or anything like that. It would just be a nice change of pace from plain water, veggie broth, lemon Popsicles, Gatorade etc.

I know this is a very minor problem in the grand scheme of things. I'm just kind of annoyed that I'm forbidden something that would ring me some comfort on a day when I can't eat anything.

I'm just wondering why that would be something that is not permitted when every other site that I've seen says you can have plain black coffee without any creamer etc in it prior to your colonoscopy.

I was also told no Jello and when I asked why she said sometimes patients don't understand and then they eat the jello that has pieces of fruit in it. 

I'm of the opinion that they need to give me the information and I should be able to follow it correctly and use my own judgment. 

So I'm eating lemon jello and avoiding coffee for now but I just don't know the rationale behind it because I believe I have enough restraint not to put cream in my coffee since I never do that anyway! 

I'm just wondering why that would even be a regulation because I don't think it will stain my colon?",2,1766082673.0,colonoscopy,6,1.0,False

Motorists traveling along Thomasville Road on Elf Night are urged to slow down and drive with caution in the vicinity of the park. Pedestrians and law enforcement will be present. Drivers who typically use Thomasville Road and are not attending Elf Night should use an alternate route. Delays are expected due to heavier than normal traffic along the road during the event.

If you’d like to visit Santa and Mrs. Claus, upon arrival, check in on the front lawn to be assigned a ticket number on a first-come, first-served basis until all tickets are claimed. While enjoying Elf Night, parents will want to have their cameras ready to record all the smiles and wonderment on their children’s faces. Hot cocoa and cookies will be provided by Santa’s little helpers, while supplies last. Over 150,000 lights twinkle against the night sky in Oven Park. The holiday light display opened on Thanksgiving night and remains open through Jan. 1 from 6-10 p.m. on weekdays and 5:30-11 p.m. on weekends. Every night except Elf Night, visitors can drive through or walk the grounds, weather permitting. Use caution if driving through the park.*

I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here. I don't know if it's because of the way I am or.. something else.

I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it. If more happens, I won't say no.

I want to connect so deeply. I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. I really want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it.

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am but yeah.

The boring things: I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I starting crochet and painting abstract, cycling, knife painting, reading classics in coffee shops. I like doing different things. I'm kinky and like to experiment. I also have a high libido.. so yeah.

I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. 
Trying new things can be quite humbling and I like that.
I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know.
I don't care if we have a lot in common when it comes to hobbies or not. More to talk about.

Im have extreme anxious attachment issues and all this silence and distance started making me panic so after work I tried calling her but she didn't pick up. I felt bad for disturbing her but the pain of being left without a word was killing me so I messaged her again to apologize.

I used to think I could just do everything online, you know? But after pushing myself to go to meetups and grab coffee with local folks, it changed everything. I’ve met other builders, exchanged ideas, and even got feedback on my projects that I just wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. 

It's pretty wild how much a simple conversation can spark new ideas or help troubleshoot a problem you've been stuck on for a while. I mean, you don’t have to go into a full networking mode, just being present and sharing a bit of your journey goes a long way. 

If you’re building something solo, seriously consider getting out there. Not just for potential partnerships, but for the support and inspiration too. It’s kind of crazy how much a community can uplift you. Anyone else had similar experiences?""",1,1766081877.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for slaughter, famine as souls are examined, lack of water

The end is close in sight, newlyweds better cancel all plans, in Orwellian olympics they contend

The end is an arms reach away, you won't find dismay, when you acquire you’re cannon fodder 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself brother for the end, to so called friends, letters you will send 

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the cleansing, flesh and bloody bone, we are condensing

The end presents its serpentine fangs, hissing, slithering, it’s gonna consume all in it’s sight

The end wraps around the superannuated, cutting off bloodstreams, beams of venom dispensing

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself sister, hurricanes aren't twisters, all pray at the campsite 

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the truth, we’re detaching with age like a baby tooth 

The end looms over your psyche, you know it’s real, but it’s unrevealed and concealed 

The end knows all of your flaws, how you often feel, of what's real, you wish to save the truth

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself young men, cocks and hens in pecking orders congealed

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for extinction, from ghouls and mortal fools, no distinction

The end is the lazaretto and emergency escape, it is abstinence and rape, sledgehammer and tape

The end is the coffee in the morning, joyous cries and mourning, emotional ebbs of instinction

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself young women, you will be courted, by apes eating grapes

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the valley floor, humanity is a concubine, but not a whore

The end lulls toddlers and twiddling little ones, tells them to murder mothers, steal the only sons

The end creeps up from counters and cabinets, finds you when nothing has purpose anymore 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself engrieved for the bereaved, you too, will see the fall of the sun

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the instruction from an apparition, conditions colonial 

The end reeks of an ineffable stench, it could lie on a bus seat or a park bench, it waits patiently

The end vows fidelity and faithfulness, matrimonial testimonials of an event only ceremonial 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself intertwined lovers needing no other, for the spiritual vacancy

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for exasperation, once finished you reach a destination so rife

The end is a curse, it hands you charms that harm, it blinds you with darkness, unstraps harnesses

The end is a purse, you fill it up to try to distract yourself, from the all present emptying of life 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself triathlon triple threat jovial jock, your flesh is forever carnous

  


The end is an excessively exuberant exercise of free will, it is what birthed you, it is what kills 

Think to yourself, do you understand these words? If not, study them, for they must be heard

Beware of, prepare yourself for, the end, you cannot escape it, and no one else ever can nor will

I’m based downtown Toronto and currently in university, and I’d love to build a solid group of girl friends to do fun things together! Think PJ parties, movie nights, hikes, long walks, coffee dates, and other cute get-togethers.

A bit about me: In my last year of uni, and feeling like I was so focused on school that I didn’t go out and explore. Have majorrrr regrets about this and hoping to rectify this through all of you lovelies. I’m a crafty person by nature so I love love art, music and enjoy random side quests. I have 5 cats! Into Kpop, travelling, learning new languages. 

As the new year comes, I’d also really love to connect with girls who are interested in getting healthier together like workout sessions, trying a boxing class, fitness classes, or just keeping each other motivated.

I’m hoping to build strong, long-term friendships. With so many people working remotely or busy with school, it can be hard to meet new people, so I thought I’d put this out there.

I’m mainly looking for girls in the 21–26 age range, but all are welcome! If you’re also in the downtown core, that’s definitely a plus.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me your Instagram and I’ll add you to a group so we can start planning 💕

Whereas if it gives me anxiety just thinking about it, I know there's no way on earth I could do it no matter what so I don't apply.

Problem is that I always get my hopes up and then I either don't get a call OR I get an interview and bomb the interview followed by a rejection.

I just applied for a job at a coffee shop and feel like I could do this job, but I can only work limited hours due to being on SSDI, so I don't know if they will hire me. I've been crying and begging God every since I applied this morning, as they told me they ""may call me today"" and haven't called yet.

Ugh. Hate getting my hopes dashed. I'd love to have a job to supplement my SSDI, which is too low to really sustain myself at this point, or maybe barely sustain myself. So I currently live with my parents. Plus I've hit a lull in life and need something exciting to look forward to.
