1h46lac,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h46lac,Home Office Ideas on a budget,So I’m trying to turn the room highlighted on the layout into a home office and need some advice on how to make it feel cozy/fresh/inspiring. I need to fit two desks and chairs in there as it is for both me and my boyfriend and we’re working on a budget! The second picture included shows you the color of the walls and carpet in the room (not the actual room) and the third picture is a coffee shop that I love the style of! How would you lay out the room and decorate it? Maybe a desk against the left wall and another against the wall with the window and a big plant (like a monstera) by the window?,1,1733069350.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

I'd like to see her let go. How to address this with our managers/HR, if at all?","There are several components to this. She is a temp admin, and I am a higher level admin, directly hired by this organization. She is 30 years old (I say this because what I describe below makes her sound much younger). 

She has a very very sweet act when the principals and mid-level people are around. But also, **every day** she talks over me, interrupts me, and inserts herself into conversations she's not a part of and answers questions people ask of me, including non-work chat. She also started doing this thing on day 1 where she said she'd set up a meeting/coffee chat for us with people in our office or other offices, and then leaves me out. I let her know early on I was aware of it so she may have stopped. 

There is also a few days into the job she told me she was ""flirting with me...not flirting but like you know, like when men are trying to pick up women"". Which I notified managers about and made me uncomfortable around her. 

She also tried setting up our work relationship where she can depend on me to tell her how to do things like open up emails in Gmail, or troubleshoot tech problems. She threw a fit when I told her I was unable to help her one time. 

These two incidents led to both of us chatting with our managers. I have no idea what came of the flirtation comment but they said ""that will be handled"". 

She's now acting like she's my boss, like telling me I don't need to answer emails after hours (I most certainly do lol). 

In the two days before Thanksgiving, she literally listened to music and watched videos on her phone all day, and then stayed back half an hour to work (I'm guessing she gets paid hourly). When I let her know I could hear the videos, she just turned it down and after a while spent the day continuing to loudly play it, and the next day as well. The day before Thanksgiving, I asked her to please let me finish my conversations with people before she interrupts. She gave me a dirty look and ignored me lol. 

She also wears skirts where we can all see up to her crotch when she sits down. 

**Question:** I am unsure whether to go to management again at this stage or risk it blowing back on me. If I go to management, do I mention all the stuff that doesn't directly involve me (like the music/video stuff, which is a big no-no), or do I bring up the fact I can't talk to her about stuff like music/video playing and interrupting me without getting unprofessional responses? And that this is a problem when we're supposed to be collaborating and communicating with one another? She has been here less than a month and it's become obvious she is going to continue to be a problem, for the office's image and for me. I am not sure how Machiavellian she is and whether she's just got this natural female competition/jealousy complex, or if she's trying to take my job, but I'd like to nip this in the bud instead of finding out.

There is a 4 hour window between events (2-6pm) and we're looking for ideas of things to do that don't break the bank and don't require us to be outside the whole time. Some ideas so far: 

* Go to the movies
* Walk around (assuming weather is good) 
* Find a day spa and spend a few hours relaxing
* Go to the library and chill/read with a coffee
* Visit Brooklyn Botanical gardens (mostly for the indoor tropical stuff since it's freezing out) 

I welcome other ideas!

1h46ha4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1h46ha4/a_5050_chance/,A 50/50 Chance ,"Mike Thorn sat at the head of the table. He studied Blake with narrow eyes.

“I don’t think this is a good idea,” Blake said, then raised an empty glass to his lips. How do I get out of this? 

“It’s a great idea,” Mike said. He leaned back in his chair and yawned. “I’ll have a cup of coffee and another piece of cake,” he called.

A minute later the maid was placing each in front of him. 

Mike dismissed the maid with a wave of his hand. He sipped his coffee and ate his cake as Blake fidgeted in his chair.

“So you think it’s a fine idea, don’t you?” Mike said.

“Yes,” Blake said. “Of course.”

“That’s great! Now why don’t you go get your wife?”

Blake looked down and closed his eyes. There has to be something I can do. 

Mike drummed his fingers on the table, then checked his watch and sighed.

Blake rose and came back shortly with his wife. She had tears in her eyes and struggled to hold in shaking sobs. Blake sat her down in the chair next to him and put an arm around her. 

Mike walked towards them, and Blake jerked his hand back into his lap.

Mike stood behind her and put a hand on either side of her neck. “Don’t worry, Christina,” he said, gently massaging her. “This is a great idea,” he paused for a moment. “Our guest will be here in ten minutes.”

Blake was twice Mike’s size. It would’ve been easy for him to launch himself out of the chair and beat the man to a bloody pulp. But then, where would he and Christina stand? Killing one of the richest men in the country, a man who practically owned the local law enforcement? In a house full of cameras and servants?

Blake watched his wife’s wide eyes and trembling lips as Mike worked his greasy fingers against her skin.

The doorbell rang and the air around Mike seemed to instantly shift. He walked quickly out of the room, giggling like an excited teenager as he opened the front door.

“Mike!” The guest cheered. “It’s been so long!”

“Ah, Charles! It’s been much too long hasn’t it? We really need to get together more.”

“Of course we do,” Charles said. “I’ll make sure of it. But for now, let’s get on to the festivities, no?”

The two men entered the dining room. Charles was holding a black duffle bag over one shoulder, he placed it on the table in front of him as he sat down across from Blake. Mike sat down at the head of the table.

Charles looked knowingly at Mike for a moment, then they both turned their attention to Christina. She was fidgeting this way and that, her body tense as if she might spring up at any moment. They examined her in silence until the maid was placing a cup of coffee in front of Charles.

“You’ve brought me a great one today!” Charles said.

“Of course,” Mike replied. 

Charles turned his attention to Blake. “So, what’s your story?

Blake’s words caught in his throat twice before he managed to speak. “Wh-what do you mean?”

“Tell him why you and your wife are here,” Mike said.

“Well,” Blake said. Act scared. Be sympathetic. Make him like you, there’s still a chance of getting out of this. “I’m… well. I’m in a lot of debt. I made some bad choices. Mr. Thorn said that if we played this game then I’d be settled and everything could go back to how it was before.”

Charles was leaning forward, his lips slightly parted. “And how did you get into all this debt?”

“I stole money,” Blake said. “From Mr. Thorn. I… I–the bills just kept piling up, and I, well, I didn’t take any more than I needed. I was just trying to support my family. I’m sorry.”

“And how much money was that?”

“$40,000” Mike said. “Over the two years I’ve been keeping count, at least.”

“Must have been a lot of bills,” Charles said. “But don’t worry, Blake. Everyone makes mistakes. We’re going to get everything taken care of. How do you feel about this, Christina?”

Please, just let me go. She thought. Maybe Blake was right; if I act scared maybe they’ll feel bad and let me leave.

It turned out that acting scared felt very natural. “I… I hope we win,” she said. Tears ran down her face and her heart thundered so hard in her chest that she wondered if she might be having a heart attack.

“Oh, I just love when things work out this way,” Mike said. “This is a win-win for everybody involved. Blake and Christina’s debt has been forgiven, I get the excitement and joy of refereeing an exciting match, and Charles has the chance of winning a beautiful young lady’s hand in marriage.”

“Oh, I’ll be content whether or not I win,” Charles said. “I’ll throw them an extra $50,000 if I lose, just to make things more interesting. Now Mike, don’t leave us in suspense any longer, what game have you chosen for us today?”

Mike looked around the table, locking eyes with each person one by one. “Rock, paper, scissors,” he said.

Charles clapped his hands together. “Delightful! A game of both luck and strategy, I can’t think of anything that could get the blood pumping more.”

Christina covered her mouth with her hands and let out a muffled cry. No no no… please, no!

Blake’s hands were shaking so much that he tapped the table twice with his ring. “Are… are you joking?”

“Do you have an objection?” Mike asked with a laugh, like he was talking to a toddler.

“Well, I just…”

“Please,” Charles said. “Tell us what you’re thinking.”

“Well, I am so grateful for this opportunity. I know I did a bad thing, and I know what you could do to me instead… what you almost did to me instead, but I… well, I was under the impression that this would be a game of skill. A game where I could fairly compete for what’s important to me, a game where, if I lost it would be my own fault, and if I won it would be because I did something right. I thought… my destiny would be in my own hands.”

“Is life ever in your own hands?” Charles said. “Really, is it ever? Sure, most of the time we make bad choices and end up in bad situations, or we make good choices and end up in good situations, but… you can do everything right and one day you could just get hit by a bus, or caught up in a robbery gone wrong, or you could build a profitable business, do right by your employees, and have one steal from you,” he gestured to Mike and then Blake. “You can make good choices and you can make bad choices. Sometimes the consequences are just and sometimes they aren’t.

“Now, is anything more fitting to life than rock, paper, scissors? You can spend thirty minutes thinking of the perfect move, only to lose. Or, you can pick randomly and win. I think this is the perfect game,” Charles folded his arms and looked intently at Blake and Christina, waiting for further objections.

“Agreed,” Mike said. “Now here’s how we’re going to do this. Charles, take your money and place it next to Blake.”

Charles unzipped the duffle bag and pushed it to Blake. Several stacks of cash fell out in the process.

“Now Blake,” Mike continued. “Kiss your wife. Maybe for the last time, maybe not.”

Blake did so.

“Teasing me,” Charles said, and winked at Christina.

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for a weapon.

“Now Christina, go sit next to Charles.”

She looked at Blake with wide eyes. Please don’t make me do this. But he wouldn’t meet her gaze. Her legs shook as she walked around the table and sat next to Charles, who put an arm around her shoulders.

I’ll win this for you Chrstina. Blake thought. I’ll find a way, I promise. “Is it a best two out of three?”

Mike smiled and shook his head. “Just one game,” he said. “More exciting that way. Gets the nerves up even more.”

Mike pulled out his phone, tapped a few buttons, and then held it up for everyone to see that it was a ten minute timer. He slid it forward to the middle of the table. “When the alarm goes off,” he explained. “You will each make your move.”

I will find a way, Blake told himself. No matter what, I always find a way. There is always a way to make the right move. There is always a right choice, I just have to figure out what it is. He pushed his shoulders back and closed his eyes. When he opened them, he studied Charles with a steady gaze, as if something in the man’s face would tell him exactly what to do. 

Charles, on the other hand, took this time to catch up with Mike: how’s the family? House looks great…

Okay, Blake thought to himself. He has all the power. He thinks I’m scared; he thinks I’m weak. What would a weak player choose? Something that keeps them guarded, right? I would choose rock. The tiniest physical expression possible, a weapon, but something natural, not like scissors. So that means he’ll choose paper. So, if I want to win, I need to play scissors.

But no. I’m at their mercy. They expect me to be meek, subconsciously afraid to show aggression. He wants me to pick something safe, he thinks I’ll pick paper. So, he’ll play scissors.

But wait… wouldn’t a nervous player want something to protect them? The strongest weapon, right? Something to stab? Something to cut himself out of this situation? He thinks I’ll pick scissors.

Charles’ arm was still around Christina, but he couldn’t have been paying her any less mind. He was fixated on his conversation with Mike; they were talking about property taxes.

Blake looked worriedly at Christina. When their eyes met she whimpered.

The clock was down to two minutes.

I have to make a choice, Blake thought. Rock, paper, or scissors?

Blake looked around all around the room, searching for a sign. Charles and Mike each asked for more coffee.

The alarm rang and the maid placed the cups down and ran fast out of the room. She’d seen this before.

“Everyone ready?” Mike asked.

Blake nodded.

“Charles?” Mike asked.

“Actually,” Charles said. “I have a little twist if you don’t mind.”

“Go ahead,” Mike replied.

“I’m going to have Christina play in my place.”

“No,” Christina said. She tried to get up from the table but Charles kept her firmly in place.

“No,” Blake said. “That’s—what?”

“I don’t see a problem with it,” said Mike. “Let’s get to it. Go.”

Neither of them moved.

“Now.”

Blake stood up. Christina stood up. Their eyes met; they each desperately tried to read the other’s mind. 

What’s she gonna do?

What’s he gonna do?

How do I win?

How do I lose?

Mike watched eagerly and bit at his thumb. Charles leaned so far forward that his chest was almost flat against the table.

“I want you two to go at the exact same time,” Mike said. “If you cheat, then Charles wins. Got it?”

“Yes,” they said in unison.

“Rock,” Mike said, slow and prompting, they each feigned rock over a flat hand.

 “Paper,” they continued. “Scissors, shoot!”

Christina’s eyes were closed. Blake’s were wide open. They each threw their hands forward in a closed fist.

“It’s a draw!” Mike called.

“Unbelievable!” Charles cried, spit flying from his mouth. 

“Again!” Mike yelled.

And they both played rock again. Then again, and again. 

“Stop!” Charles yelled. “Stop that!”

“If you play rock again then Charles wins,” Mike said.

“What if we both play paper?” Blake asked. They’re addicted to it. They’ll never do anything to hurt us because they need to see the game play out. There is a way to win this.

“You may not intentionally play the same move,” Charles said. He was shaking with anger.

“But now we can’t play rock, so there’s a 50/50 chance we play the same thing. I promise I was trying to win. I just thought she might move to scissors eventually, thinking that I would try paper.”

“We’ll have to play a different game,” Charles said. “These two are ruining it with this foolishness.”

“That’s fine,” Mike replied, he looked at Charles with a smirk. “Did you bring your pool stick? If I recall you’re quite good.” Mike turned his gaze to Blake. 

“Ah, I might as well give you the win. I’m terrible at pool,” Blake said. 

Charles groaned in anger and slammed his fist on the table. “It’s no fun if I know I’ll win.”

“Why don’t we just flip a coin?” Blake asked.

Please, Christina thought.

“That works for me,” Charles said. He was back to his desperate self, staring at Blake as if he were holding his next fix.

“A coin flip it is,” Mike said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a quarter. He held it between his thumb and forefinger. “Heads or tails?” He asked Charles.

“Don’t you think we all need a chance to inspect it?” Blake asked.

“Of course,” Mike said. “But you should already know that we wouldn’t cheat.”

Mike handed the quarter to Charles who inspected it with one quick glance. Charles in turn handed it to Blake.

The second the coin was in Blake’s hand Christina elbowed Charles in the stomach and started running toward the hallway.

Both of the men chased her, and before she could get ten feet away they were pulling her back to the table, the fight completely out of her.

“I’m sorry,” she said, crying. “I’m sorry. I was just scared.”

“No matter,” Charles said. He was standing behind her and had both arms wrapped around her stomach. “Let’s just do this.”

Blake handed the coin back to Mike. “I’ll take heads.”

Mike nodded at Charles. “Count me down.”

Charles spoke with the low, dramatic voice of a sportscaster. “Three. Two. One. Go!”

Mike flipped the coin in the air. Every pair of eyes in the room watched it intently as it spun and spun, light from the chandelier reflecting against it as it flew so high in the air that it almost hit the ceiling. It came teetering down, seeming as if it were falling in slow motion.

Finally, it clinked against the table, rolled, came to a halt, and then spun in place for half a second before stopping directly in front of Blake. 

Blake held his hands up above his head as he stared at the coin. “Heads!” He yelled. “It’s heads, it's heads!”

Christina cheered, Mike and Charles ran to Blake’s side of the table to get a closer look.

“Damnit!” Charles yelled.

“So I won?” Blake asked. “You agree I won?”

“You won,” Mike said. “Fair and square.”

As they shook hands Blake reached for the coin and placed it in his pocket. “So no tricks. I’ve really won?”

“We play by the book,” Charles said, letting go of Christina. “You two are free to go.”

The couple embraced. Blake grabbed the bag of cash, not bothering for the money that had fallen out. They ran quickly out of the dining room and to the front door as Charles raged behind them.

“$500,000 if you go again!” He screamed, but they were already closing the door behind them.

When they were safe inside their car Christina cheered. “I can’t believe that worked!”

Blake pulled the double sided coin from his pocket. “I knew this thing would come in handy one day.”

1h46fnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1h46fnb/returning_to_twin_peaks_s3e18_what_is_your_name/,"Returning to Twin Peaks [S3E18, What Is Your Name?]","Is it strange to say that this episode felt the most like old Twin Peaks to me? Something about the melancholy dark night-time mood, having Coop drinking coffee in a diner and not trying to focus on a million ongoing wild goose chases... there's a focus and an atmosphere here that I sorely missed.

It's a very abstract story even by Peaksian standards though. On my original watchthrough, I didn't get into it at all. I thought it was a poor way to end the story. And since I disliked Part 17 on this rewatch, I thought the same would happen. But instead, I *really* enjoyed it. So I'll try to share my interpretation of what happened, and how I feel about it.

Cooper returns into the Black Lodge, seemingly to figure out what to do with Laura gone. I think the Arm is chastising him here. ""Is it the story of the little girl who lives down the lane? Is it?!""

It's as if he's telling Cooper that Cooper should *know* this is Laura's story, and not to interfere with it or make it about himself. But instead, Coop takes advice from the most unlikely of people: Leland Palmer. Even though it's basically the same scene they already had, I felt a strange emotional callback to Arbitrary Law here. I felt that Cooper might still believe Leland is innocent, and genuinely wanted his approval to go 'find Laura'.

Seeing Coop finally emerge from Glastonbury Grove was another big moment, and I'm convinced that the colder, harsher version of the character we see from this point forward is **the real Cooper**. His familiar self from the previous two episodes was either him putting on a happy face for his friends, or a dream. But the Cooper that actually aged 25 years is here.

And this bitter, desperate Cooper wants nothing more than to escape the original timeline and move to the one where Laura lived (a scheme that was possibly hatched with Diane inside the Black Lodge, since she seems to already be aware of it).

It's my perspective that in the world of Twin Peaks, changing history does not rewrite timelines, but creates new ones. That's why it was important for Coop to defeat Mr C before leaving. And that's why him and Diane have to pass through a portal. The new world was born when Laura was saved, but the old world still exists and keeps ticking. They have to go from one to the other.

Laura vanished at the end of Part 17, because Cooper was still in the old world and he could not take that version of Laura into the future. She still died and met the angels.

I'm not sure why the sex in the motel was necessary (some kind of vague ritual?), but I think it reminded Diane too much of Mr C and caused her to give into the temptation to become one with her New World persona.

Another thing I'm sort of iffy on is Coop conveniently finding the Judy restaurant, but I can chalk it up to him being supernaturally inclined now more than ever. I mean, he is basically the boss of the Black Lodge these days, so why not?

My feeling on the ending is that it's a bit of a wink to the fans. Coop expected history to change in a logistical sense (Laura does not die and therefore led a different life), but instead the world has changed in an abstract, emotional sense. This Laura did not lead a different life, but her essence - her soul, if you will - was reformed into the person known as Carrie, who has all the emotional woes that Laura did, but with some different context. You can't undo the wounds of the soul with trickery, I suppose.

And the real irony that I love is that Carrie is the perfect cynical match to what Cooper has become. She's clearly as fucked up as he is.

NOTES:

* I've liked most of the special effects this season, but that shot of Mr C burning is dreadful.
* Why did MIKE not speak backwards when he created Dougie 2.0?
* I'm guessing there's still a version of Gordon Cole in this universe since ""he'll remember the unofficial version"". (That line is also a cute way of ensuring that a potential season 4 doesn't have to rely on a deceased actor a la Don S. Davis. Lynch is the lynchpin!)
* I do kinda wish we got an infodump at one point. I mean, Cole and Albert blabbed endlessly about Judy, can't Coop be a bit more transparent?
* I wonder if Diane covering Cooper's face during sex is what inspired David to have her be Naido?
* The curtains at the motel have the Black Lodge zig-zags.
* A lock of Coop's hair being out of place after sleep was a cute nod to season 1.
* I love MacLachlan's expression after the motel changes (no idea what that's about btw). It's this mixture of a frown and a scowl, and it's the most old man thing I've ever seen.
* ""I tried to keep a clean house. Keep everything organized."" is the line that made me think of Carrie as a parallel to current day Cooper. Him leaving the Old World is the equivalent of Carrie leaving Odessa.
* Despite the sadness about Michael Ontkean not participating, I do feel that his absence helps this episode in particular. The fact that Cooper can't even bear to visit Harry before leaving is so telling of how tired he is. He just doesn't want to deal with more hurt. And maybe he knew Harry would have talked him out of it. ",3,1733068926.0,twinpeaks,0,1.0,False

**Synopsis:**

Gloria Winters is a politician working for the federal government tasked with filmming a social media campaign for the next election. Her crew travels to Snowpoint where they meet up with the town's mayor, Christian Baker. From here, she starts to realize that she needs to make changes to her life if she wants to truly get ahead.



**Background:**

*A Law for Christmas* is a 2023 Christian Christmas film made by the faith-based production company Wesely Bros (known for producing the infamous 2021 Christian Dystopian film *2025: The World Enslaved by a Virus*). The film's production is something that I've followed since its announcement back in late 2022. I was curious to see how they make their films and eventually edit the final product which I expected to be terrible. That turned out to be the case because the film is terribly written with little to no subtlty (despite [the trailer](https://youtu.be/SHtuaDVZMaY?feature=shared) saying otherwise), editing while better than 2025 still feels like a YouTube production than a film and makes some odd choices, and tons of padding which overall add up to a boring 2 hour and 21 minute film. It is an hour longer than your average Hallmark Christmas film and somehow longer than Christmas classics like *Love Actually* and *It's A Wonderful Life*.

If you want to knowing some information about the film, check out [Kurtis Conner's video on this](https://youtu.be/T8fAquggNl8?feature=shared) and [on 2025](https://youtu.be/D152lWYtMuA?feature=shared) if you're curious about that film.



**Goals:**

One of the major goals is to cut the film down from its drawn out 2 hours and 21 minute runtime to a shorter runtime that's more digestable. The end result is a film that is now 1 hour and 40 minutes long. Along with this is the monumental task of rescoring the entire film. I chose John Williams' score for *Catch Me If You Can* and *The Terminal* to be the music to be used. They give me Winter vibes so I decided to use them as part of planning; I rolled with them since they managed to fit in perfectly. Long moments of padding/uneeded scenes such as long scenes of the characters single filing one-by-one on to the bus, Gloria trying out dresses and trying to fit lemonade into her bag, etc. are completely removed. This also includes the Jannet subplot that goes nowhere and the scene of Christian and Gloria walking in the ""snow"". I want the film to have a tighter pacing and one that is watchable so even a faith-based audience can sit through it. I also retitled the film from *A Law for Christmas* to *Campaigning for Christmas* because it just sounds better and not clunky or awkward like the original.

**Change List:**

• Added Starlight Fan Edits logo.

• Added a new color grade to make the setting feel more like Winter rather than it looking like it was filmmed in the Summer.

• Replaced the Wesely Bros logo music with a John Williams & Boston Pop Orchestra recording of Styne's ""Holiday Cheer - Medley"".

• Sped up the Lifelong Inc. logo to match it with the audio.

• Replaced the Hallmark-esque opening credits with white text (that includes the newly changed title for this film) on a black background which gets straight to the point. The sounds are also office ambience noises to create this contrast of the countryside of Snowpoint to the workplace environment of D.C. The absence of music also emphasizes this.

• The scenes of Gloria such as her first scene, the meeting of public Wi-Fi in the subways, scenes with her and Jill, and more have been removed to get straight to the point of Gloria being a politician that doesn't care about Christmas and her being rude and selfish. It also helps to remove some of the more awkward and stilted acting (as a result of the awful writing). The first scene is now just the scene of Gloria firing an employee which I think does a good job in showing the kind of person she is.

• Added ""The Tale of Viktor Navorski"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) in the scene where Gloria is appointed as the Secretary of Agriculture to the scene of Gloria telling Jill to get ready for the trip. 

• The scene of Gloria's promotion has been trimmed to speed up the pacing and once again get straight to the point.

• Removed the first scene of Gloria watching an awful social media campaign video to line up with the new music and to remove a continuity error.

• Rescored the scene of Gloria and Jill watching the videos and taking notes with ""Learning the Ropes"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Trimmed the scene of Gloria and her crew arriving at the airport and meeting Christian to keep the pacing flowing. This whole sequence from the airport to the arrival at Christian's Inn in Snowpoint is rescored with ""A Legend is Born"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*).

• Added new propeller sounds to the plane.

• Used the shot of the plane flying overhead in the trailer to remove the original film title.

• Added new plane interior ambience in the plane scenes.

• Removed the line of Gloria calling Christian a ""bumpkin"" due to an awkward delivery.

• Removed the scene of Christian talking about the last time a D.C. politician visited Snowpoint since it's a failed attempt at humor and disrupts the pacing.

• Added new truck sound effects when Christian drives them to the Inn.

• Removed the music that plays during the outside shot of the Inn at evening.

• Removed a cut to a close-up shot of the bottom of a Christmas tree to have the scene flow better. The scene of the next day now fades in rather than an awkward cut.

• Trimmed the scene of Gloria talking with Jill in the dining room to keep the pacing flowing (a reversed scene of Jill is used to extend the clip to accomodate for the change).

• Added the score ""Finding Coins and Learning to Read"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) in the scene where Gloria's crew travel on the bus to the first farm. 

• Trimmed down the first bus scene to fit it in with the music. Gloria's dialogue at the end is removed to make her facial expressions when Christian talks more emphasized in showing what she is feeling (the principle of ""show, don't tell"" will be used a lot since it's something Wesely Bros is unable to do). Their arguement about democracy is also removed as well since it feels clunky (especially with the acting).

• New (school) bus sound effects have been added for the bus scenes.

• Removed the inside shot of Johnny's trailer to keep the pacing flowing along with the new music. It also manages to make the introductory of show flow naturally and avoid continuity errors.

• Removed the scene of Christian and Gloria's crew getting on the bus the next day. Instead, after Christian closes the door, we cut to them on the bus the following day heading to their next location. This helps to remove padding which is a lot in this film.

• Removed the montage (set to music) of the crew setting up the cameras before the next video to get rid of padding. The scene now cuts from the last line of dialogue in the bus to Gloria asking the farmer questions in the video.

• Jill's line ""Make his words fit the script"" has been removed since the audience already knows what's going on and doesn't need the character actions and motivations spelled out. 

• Removed the scene of of Christian and Gloria's crew single filing off the bus at the next location to reduce padding.

• Rescored the scene of the interviewed farmer scolding Gloria and her getting mad at Jill with ""The Flash Comics Clue"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Removed the scene of Gloria walking to the bus before breaking down. We now just simply cut to her at the bus with her upset (the cut is synced to the new music).

• Bird chirping ambience has been added to remove the original music that plays in the scene where Gloria talks with a little girl.

• Removed the brief shot of Gloria walking back to where the crew is to get rid of padding.

• Removed the scene of Christian and Gloria's crew single filing back on the bus.

• Rescored the scenes from Gloria telling the crew ""we're done"" to Christian and Gloria arriving at the diner with ""A Broken Home"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Added the score ""Dinner With Amelia"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) to the diner scene with Gloria and Christian to give it more life rather than an awkward sequence with no music. The same applies for the scene where Carol consults Christian about Gloria and when Gloria gets on the plane with Christian. Trims have been made to fit the scene with the music and reduce unnecessary dialogue. New coffee shop ambience sounds have also been added.

• The second half of the scene of Carol talking to Christian has been cut out to fit in with the new music and to remove padding.

• Removed the scene of Christian and Gloria talking with the pilot and a brief shot of Christian looking at the flight time (which makes the scene realistically inconsistent since it lasts 5 minutes). The scene now dissolves from Christian closing the plane door to them already inside (with the plane already in the air).

• Trimmed the scene of Christian and Gloria in the plane where Gloria talks about her backstory. This entire scene has little to no music, has no interesting visuals, and is the epitome of terrible editing and writing in this film. I have reduced it to 3 minutes by cutting out some unnecessary piece of dialogue.

• Rescored the scene of Gloria talking about her backstory with ""Jazz Autographs"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*). This is to keep the scene engaging and create at least some sort of emotional weight (even if its flimsy at best).

• Removed the scene of the pilot telling the crew they will be landing. The scene now cuts to them at the next farm after the conversation between Gloria and Christian wrap up.

• Replaced the music in the background in the farmer dinner scene with ""The Christmas Song"" by Nat King Cole (with radio effects to give the impression that its playing on an old radio).

• Removed the scenes of Gloria and Christian awkwardly saying goodnight to each other and going outside to walk in the ""snow"" (the snow doesn't look good when they're walking on it since it's pretty much foam dipped in water if you look at the behind the scenes stuff) since the chemistry is just not there (even the outtakes had more chemistry) and to reduce the runtime. The scene now cuts from the dinner to Gloria tossing and turning in bed.

• Rescored the scene of Gloria making overnight preparations for a town hall meeting with ""Doctor, Lawyer, Lutheran"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Removed Gloria's line ""Good morning"" since the scene of the next day fades in awkwardly and feels like an editing mistake. The fade in has been redone as well.

• Replaced the song ""Why I Love Christmas Time"" by Savannah Lathem with ""Looking for Work by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) in the montage of Jill and Gloria contacting farmers to set up the town hall meeting. The music also starts earlier in the scene continues into the next scene.

• Trimmed the scene of the plane arriving before the (censored) number is shown. While I understand blurring out the plane number, it does take me out of the film.

• Rescored the scene of Gloria calling George Wesely with ""Refusing to Escape"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*). Trimmings are made to the phone call to speed up pacing.

• Removed the montage of Gloria getting dressed up and trying to fit the bottle of lemonade into her bag.

• Added the score ""Dinner With Amelia"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) in the scene of Gloria meeting and talking with Christian's parents (there are some possible minor trims I made to this as well).

• Added a few seconds before fading into the town hall meeting for pacing purposes. The town hall scene has been rescored with ""The Wedding of Officer Torres"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*).

• Removed the scenes of the farmers applauding (and fade out) and George Wesely parking up to the diner for pacing (and to make the scene feel less disjointed). We now cut from Christian's closing statement to George arriving at the front door.

• The meeting between George and Gloria has been trimmed and added the score ""Refusing to Escape"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*).

• Added ending half of ""Finding Coins and Learning to Read"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) to the scene of Gloria telling Jill that she can choose to stay at Snowpoint or return to D.C. A fade to black has been added to end the scene .

• Removed the scenes of Gloria's phone call with Carol and the cameraman asking Gloria where Jill went to.

• A fade in has been added to the establishing shot of Carol's house.

• Trimmed out some unnecessary dialogue between Gloria and Carol to get straight to the point.

• Have the scene of them getting in the truck dissolve to them arriving to the town hall to remove a jarring jump cut from them getting in the truck to them driving it out of the parkway.

• Rescored the whole sequence of them arriving at town hall and decorating the place with ""Learning the Ropes"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Removed the entire Jannet subplot which includes all scenes involving her. This removes a total of 10 minutes from the film and the fact that this barely plays a role aside from a terrible misunderstanding plotline and bad acting. Some scenes involving Christian and Gloria have been repurposed in the decorating montage. It also removes a questionable age gap situation between Christian and Jannet that pointed out in Kurtis Conner's video.

• Dialogue that references a bit of the Jannet subplot is removed in the second family meet up scene and John Williams' piano version of ""The Christmas Song"" (from the Home Alone 2 soundtrack) has been added in the background.

• Rescored the scene of Carol telling the Christmas story of the bird of Christ with ""The Fountain Scene"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*).

• Rescored the scene of Gloria talking to Carol one last time before heading back to D.C. with ""Deadheading"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*).

• Remove the whole sequence of Gloria sitting the car as Christian drives to one of the farmers' place. It helps to remove some weird editing choices like making the background black-and-white (which is shoddy at best).

• Trimmed down the scene of Christian giving the presents back to the farmer's kids to keep it in-line with the new music and keep the pacing flowing.

• Rescored the scenes of Christian giving the presents to the farmer's kids to Gloria leaving on the plane back to D.C. with the second half of ""A Broken Home"" by John Williams (from *Catch Me If You Can*). This replaces the song that plays when Gloria leaves on the plane.

• Rearranged (and trimmed) the shots of Gloria crying to match the shots of the plane taking off for continuity purposes.

• Rescored the scene of Gloria getting a phone call from George Wesely with ""Gupta's Deliverance"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*).

• Rescored the sequence of Gloria heading to the airport to get back to Snowpoint with ""Viktor and His Friends"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*). The music also plays in the scene where Gloria drives to the town hall only for the car to breakdown on the way.

• Slowed the down the shot of the plane taking off to allow for a dissolve transition to indicate a passage of time (rather than the straight cut used).

• Removed Gloria's dialogue when she's starting up the car since it seems to be poorly ADRed and unnecessary. This scene has also been trimmed to match with the music.

• Trimmed the down scene of Gloria upset that the car broke down.

• Added new party crowd ambience sounds for the town hall celebration to remove the original music. The door sound has been reused from a previous scene as well.

• Removed the ending song (""O Come Ye All Faithful"") sung by the Noelle at the end (I'm sorry, it just goes a bit too long and it isn't sung that well. I tried to use John Williams' rendition of this song from the Home Alone 2 soundtrack, but it didn't work out).

• Rescored the ending of the film with """"Destiny""... ""Canneloni""... and The Tale of Viktor Navorski Reprise"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*) A lot of the ending has been cut down and the ending sequence has been refitted into a montage syncing up the with the music. The ending is now a straight cut to black. 

• The end credits now has a new ""The End"" and ""Campaigning for Christmas"" title cards along with a traditional credits sequence to match with the music.

• The music for the end credits have been replaced with ""Destiny""... ""Canneloni""... and The Tale of Viktor Navorski Reprise"" and ""A Happy Navorski Ending!"" by John Williams (from *The Terminal*). The credits have been slowed down a bit to match the new music.

1. **Hercules**

Inspired By : Aventus Old batch

Impression: This is like a fruity blast. Initial 60 mins the projection is strong and then it slowly settles into a very mild musky+fruity smell. The drydown if that is what it is called is pretty sophisticated.

Rating: 7

2) **Serenade of Matsukita**

Inspired By : Matsukita by Clive Christian

Impression: This is like a mix of a very ripe orange and spice. According to me this fragrance is very complex and somehow I dont like it very much. Projection wise it is there for 1hr and lasts long. It stays in the cloth for a longtime. It smells musky and aromatic once the citrusy effect is gone.

Rating: 6

3) **White Knight**

Inspired By: Mind Games by Blockade

Impression: This is one of the best from scentrix. It has a fruity citrusy feel. But the best part is the drydown. It has a very sophisticated musky kind of fragrance which feels nice. Initial projection is good but reapplication is needed after 4 hrs.

Rating: 7.5

4) **Beauty of the Moon**

Inspired By: The Moon by Fredric Malle

Impression:  This one is very strong. Like rose, incense aroma. By mistake I applied 10 sprays and it was very overpowering. I am not a fan of this type of smell. This reminds me of kewra essence which is used in the preparation of biriyani. I wont buy it again.

Rating: 5

5) **Vibrance**

Inspired By: Vibrato by Sospiro

Impression: Very fresh flowery, talcum powdery feeling. It feels like some talcum powder with flowers in it. Pleasant smelling but not a beast in projection. Will need reapplication every 3 hrs. It will stay in ur skin for 6-8 hrs and in clothes for more than that.

Rating: 7

6) **Power of Goddess**

Inspired By: Goddess by Burberry

Impression: This is a sweeter fragrance. It smells like a vanilla late with a lot of vanilla. Even though it is classified as a feminine frag, I wont mind this as I like the smell of coffee. Projection and longevity is very subtle but whatever you get is pleasant.

Rating: 7

7) **The Obsession**

Inspired By: Hybrid of Most Wanted Parfum & Most Wanted edp Intense by Azzaro

Impression: One of the best from the house. The citrus in here doesn’t smell like straight citrus but it comes mixed with some vanilla,musk and floral. Overall a very pleasing fragrance and the projection is loud for the initial couple of hrs. It lasts long time on the skin and clothes. The tshirt I was wearing to office, I kept it on a chair and on entering the room I was getting this soft pleasant smell. Straight away I ordered 50 ml post trying this.

Rating: 9

8) **Entice of Vanilla Pie**

Inspired By: Allure Homme Edition Blanche By Chanel

Impression:  Strong citrus with an aromatic smell resembling eucalyptus plant. It smells very refreshing and the projection is very loud for the first hour. Later it subdues and stays on the skin for 4-5 hours. Clothes it stays longer. I didn’t get the the smell of vanilla. Dont know if I was blind to that note. Overall it is a good performer

Rating: 8

9) **Gods Flame**

Inspired By: God of Fire by Stéphane Humbert Lucas 777

Impression:  Raw mango, ginger lemon is what I got. That smell when you cut a raw mango open with added ginger and lime. Initial projection is good but it fades away. It is not loud. Overall not quite satisfactory.

Rating: 5

10) **Dreamscape**

Inspired By: Dream Sea by Lorenzo Pazzaglia

Impression: Fresh aquatic smell with lots of vanilla and spice. The spice was mostly smelling like cardamom. Longevity and projection was upto 3\~4 hrs. In clothes it stayed for much longer. Overall a good one and felt like a mild warm fragrance.

Rating: 6.5

11) **Lunar Zest**

Inspired By: Blue Moon Ginger Dash by Kilian Paris

Impression: Ginger lemonade, very refreshing. There is a hint of white liquor smell. Smell is very close to bacardi limon. Since it is my favorite goto drink, I like it even more. Initial projection is good but longevity could have been more better.

Rating: 7

12) **Crab Apple Delight**

Inspired By: Crab Apple Blossom Clive Christian

Impression: My next best one from the house. This has lemon,mint and some marine so it makes it a perfect virgin mojito. What makes it sophistacted is the fact that it has hint of sandalwood as well later. It is very pleasing to the nose after the initial lemony blast. Projection is decent and it stays with you for a while. Must buy.

Rating: 9

13) **Aqua Essence**

Inspired By: Acqua di Gio Essenza by Giorgio Armani.

Impression: This is very fresh aquatic citrusy kind. As soon as you spray you get a very nice balance of citrus and aqua. The best part is when the initial blast has faded as it gives a mix of musky powdery smell which stays with you. Projection wise not a beast but definitely not an underperformer. Even though mild this stays with you for a long time. Time to time you keep getting the pleasant smell.

Rating: 8

14) **Dunes of luxury**

Inspired By: Sand Dance by Stéphane Humbert Lucas 777

Impression: This is more like a milder version of the moon perfume above. Spicy and dark rum just like a hot toddy feeling in winters. When the initial effect is gone there is a hint of vanilla as well. I dont dislike it but I won't prefer it due to my liking for freshies

Met IRL in a coffeeshop a 5 minute walk from my house. We both said on the first date that we weren't sure what we were looking for but were open, he wasn't really dating because he is starting a business and really focused on it and I'm newly out of a LTR. He even spent the night date 2 and we only mild hooked up intentionally since we had only known each other a week but it was frustratingly sexy behaving ourselves, and we stayed up making out and laughing til 3 am, snuggled the entire night while we slept, hung out in bed til 2pm then had coffee and gabbed for 2 hours. I went home for thanksgiving for a week and we had plans to hang when I got back. I don't hear from him for 5 days over the holiday which was surprising and weird. I reach out and he breaks it off- says he spent a lot of time talking to his sister over the holiday about me and his life and he figured out he wants to focus on his business and be selfish and self-focused. For context- from our dates I learned he is starting a business and spends like 85% of the time he isn't in his 9-5 working on it, which I knew, and it brings him a lot of fulfillment and he really wants it to work so he can quit his 9-5. He had said it was fun and relieving to be away from his computer and hanging out with me and it was like physically relieving the crick in his neck from working. Then a random dump.

So my question is- this is a really common refrain women hear from men when they break up- the ""focus on my career"" bit. Is this an actual thing or an excuse?

We (women) are all confused by it because ideally having a supportive partner in your life- though it may take some TIME away- is such a net positive for your life that it ends up impacting your career positively. Studies show this- so why are we seen as some distraction especially when everything is going well? Or is this just a thing guys say when its actually other stuff?",0,1733068410.0,AskMenOver30,8,0.5,False
1h468d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityPals/comments/1h468d0/how_to_improve_self_motivation/,How To Improve Self Motivation?,"Hey everyone! 

I want to share something that completely changed my life - learning how to stay consistently motivated. A few years ago, I struggled with procrastination and always felt stuck. Now, I've developed systems that keep me driven and focused, and I want to share what actually works.

First off, let's get real - motivation isn't just about feeling pumped up all the time. It's about building sustainable habits that keep you moving forward, even when you don't feel like it.

Here's what I've learned works best:

1. Start Ridiculously Small
Instead of saying ""I'll work out for an hour,"" start with ""I'll do 5 push-ups."" Your brain won't resist tiny tasks, and once you start, you'll often do more. I've seen this work wonders with my own fitness journey.

2. Use the 5-Minute Rule
When you're avoiding something, commit to just 5 minutes. Usually, you'll keep going once you've started. I use this trick for everything from writing to cleaning.

3. Track Your Progress
This is huge. Seeing your progress visually is incredibly motivating. I created a free Daily Habit Tracker spreadsheet that's helped me and thousands of others stay consistent. You can grab yours at https://theexcellenceeffect.com/ - it's completely free and has been a game-changer for many people.

4. Create Environmental Triggers
Make your environment work for you. Want to read more? Keep a book by your coffee maker. Want to exercise? Sleep in your workout clothes. Your environment shapes your behavior more than willpower ever will.

5. Find Your Peak Hours
I discovered I'm most productive in the morning, so I schedule important tasks then. Figure out when you're naturally most energetic and leverage those hours.

6. Use the ""If-Then"" Strategy
Instead of vague goals, create specific triggers: ""If it's 6 PM, then I'll go for a 10-minute walk."" This removes decision fatigue and makes habits automatic.

7. Celebrate Small Wins
Don't wait for big achievements. Celebrate completing small tasks - it releases dopamine and builds momentum. I keep a ""wins journal"" where I write down three small victories daily.

8. Connect with Your ""Why""
When motivation dips, reconnecting with your deeper purpose helps. Keep reminders of your goals visible. I have a vision board on my phone's wallpaper.

9. Build Accountability
Share your goals with others or find an accountability partner. The social pressure helps maintain consistency when motivation drops.

10. Make it Fun
Add elements of play to boring tasks. I turn cleaning into a timed challenge with music, making it more engaging.

Remember, motivation isn't about feeling inspired 24/7. It's about building systems that keep you moving forward consistently. Start small, track your progress, and celebrate your wins along the way.

I share more detailed strategies and actionable tips in my weekly newsletter, where we dive deeper into personal development and productivity. Many readers have told me it's helped them stay accountable and make real progress.

What methods do you use to stay motivated? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!

I bought a ""1 lb/1000 worms"" bag of 'garden mix' worms from a local (central Florida) worm farmer for $30. (Opinions were mixed on Uncle Jim's and Memes were out of stock of the $60 entry level worm package and $120 for the next size up was outside my budget).  I cut a piece of cardboard for the base of the working bin, spread out the reconstituted coir,  then put the worms on top of that with the compost (about  a gallon/5l volume) they came in. With hindsight  I think the coir was too wet and I added too much food (two cut up banana peels, some tea bags and coffee grounds) because the worms seem sluggish and a nasty fishy smell developed especially in the goo that dropped into the bottom 'bin' or base (along with escapees). I added some shredded cardboard and brown paper to the contents of the tray but then had to put the lid straight on top of it, because the level is already too high to allow the spare tray to 'nest/stack' on top.

I'm feeling overwhelmed and like I've wasted 100 bucks but even worse, fear I have murdered my worm buddies, so be gentle with me please...

1h4652p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaveWeMet/comments/1h4652p/a_moment_etched_in_time/,A Moment Etched in Time,"I’m staying in an Airbnb in Bangalore for a little while—a first for me, choosing this over the usual hotel stays. It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh. So she booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room. The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

I gently said, *“Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly, “*Was I too loud?”*

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career stories, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we were chatting, I kept her engaged sharing my silly funny stories, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai aa main Muslim hoon”* , I responded, *""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube dosen't discriminate like our politicians"".*

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. “This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.” I added, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".

She laughed and said, *“Good luck with…”*

*“Life,”* I finished for her.

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

If you are reading this (very limited chance)  whereever you are, I wish you goodluck stranger, don't ever give up on yourself. I hope you shine brighter than the North Star, And don't forget to travel other places too, magical one like Gili trawangan and Airport halts doesn't count :)

We were FWB for a few months before that and then he initiated getting closer to me by inviting me over for sleepovers until it just became the routine. 
My problem is, he won’t touch me. Sure, he will walk up and give me a quick hug, a quick kiss, maybe once per night, but any form of longer intimate touch is off the table. He says he feels extremely uncomfortable by it. 
On the couch, if I move closer to him, he quietly moves away. In bed, he’s on his side, I’m on my side; no goodnights, no kiss, no intimacy of any kind unless he’s initiating sex. 
He explained he’s a very unaffectionate person and he doesn’t express himself well… but when his dog comes up to him? He’s all over him. Kisses, cuddles, petting, hugging, loving stares, all of it. 
We will be on the couch, I’ll be touching his leg, arm; whatever, and nothing in return unless it’s 2 seconds and then he pulls away again. 
Then the dog will get up and he will full on grab the dog (80-90 pound dog mind you, not a lap dog) and cuddle him. I sit there feeling like nothing. 
I cook him dinner every night on my dime, clean up, make his lunches, bring him coffee in bed, run errands for him, exercise his dog, everything I can think of to help him have an easier life… and for me, he’s… well I’m not sure? He said he has shown his affection and care in small ways and I should notice more.  He lets me come over.. he let me use his spare room for my art project (painting at the desk)… he said all this “stuff I want” is hallmark shit and it’s not real and I shouldn’t be guilting him into doing more than he is. 
He’s smart, talented, but so full of himself and self absorbed I can’t take it. Anytime I have an opinion that differs from his he scolds me. He has never been to my house or asked to come over. He called my animals “cunts” when I asked if he would like to meet them sometime saying “im open to meeting the cunts”. He seems to have no room for me in his life. He hasn’t given me any impression that he’s falling in love with me at all.. I’m not an ugly woman and I try so hard to show my love and care. I’m trying every angle I can and nothing is working. It’s like I’m just, there. Is 2 months of sleeping in the same bed, spending all our free time together too early to be seeing progression into love? Is he just not capable of love? Is it me? What the hell. I feel so lonely and starved of affection. And I feel like an idiot being jealous of a dog but… what the hell gives. 
For additional context: he hates his mom, thinks she’s a bitch and a whore. He’s never officially met his dad. He has trauma… but I mean… so do I.. I’m doing my absolute best to not make him pay for it… so am I just screwed here? He says he sees a future with me, and he loves having me around. I don’t understand this.

Based on their behavior, I believe we have a mouse in the house. We had a couple 2 years ago, before one of the three cats brought us 2 of them and haven’t seen any since then.

There is a .5 acre woods next to my house, and it just turned 30 degrees this week. It will be a high of 30 degrees for at least the next 10 days, and presumably not much higher until spring.

I found one golf ball sized hole in the garage dry wall that leads to the kitchen. I’ve patched plenty of drywall, but in these temps I think I’d just be wasting my time. It’s a large 2 car garage and I’d have to spend some decent money on heaters to get it to a consistent 60+ degree temperature for multiple days.

I’ve read that expanding foam may work but I think the mice would make quick work of it too. Maybe if I put steel wool in the hole first? What else could I do? I haven’t checked around the foundation yet, need more coffee first…

1h45so8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1h45so8/date_with_mrdecent/,Date with Mr.Decent! ,"
So, what was I up to today? Based on the title, you might have guessed it- I went on a date! But let me take you through how it all happened.   
I’ve been back in my hometown for a little while now. My work is online and I’d really missed being home so I decided to stay here after Tihar. And that’s when I met someone interesting. We will call him Mr. Decent for now.

Our first encounter happened at my Bhauju's office event. After talking for just 5 mins, I realized he was also visiting home and we had something in common(we both went to the same school.) He was my senior butwe never really spoke back then. When he asked for my socials I politely told him I don’t use any and he smoothly accepted that and moved on. I thought that would be the end of it. 


The next time we spoke was when I was looking into colleges for my younger brother. My Bhauju suggested Mr. Decent could help with discounts/scholarships as he knew someone at the college. So I called him and he gave some advice and contact info of a person from the college.  He then asked if I’d like to meet for coffee to discuss it further. I politely declined and explained that I didn’t have breaks during the week (which was true, but I was also feeling a bit lazy).


Over the next few days/week, we crossed paths a few times and talked casually (most of the time I was with my mom or cousins. And I am also confused how I never noticed him before and now I see him everywhere) Then one day Bhauju invited me to a momo party at her office. I wasn’t sure about going but I felt good that day and was not busy so decided to show up. To my surprise, Mr. Decent was there. It turned out he was in close contact with my extended family. We spoke politely in front of everyone, but when we found ourselves alone, he teasingly asked “You go out on weekdays too?” I felt a little off about it (my schedule is my business and who's he to comment?) So I just distanced myself and helped Bhauju. He didn’t try to talk to me again after that.  
Later that evening, I received a text from him apologizing if he’d offended me. He mentioned he’d just been trying to make friendly conversation. I responded that I wasn’t offended, and we ended up texting a bit more and I finally called as I am lousy texter (its not my thing) The next day, he called.

A few days later, he asked me out. I was hesitant at first and asked if it was as friends but he made it clear it was a DATE. I tried to explain why it wasn’t a good idea like he’s close with my extended family, I wasn’t looking for a relationship and I wasn’t even going to be here for long. But he listened calmly and responded in a way I didn’t expect. He said“ Oggy I am a grown up man. I can handle rejection. If you’re not into me tell me and  I’ll back off but if you’re even 1% curious about me as I am about you please let’s meet. I promise, I won’t tell anyone not even your Bhauju.” I was speechless. Most men would either get offended or shut down after a rejection, but he was mature about it. So, after some thought I agreed to meet him.
We set a date for Sunday. I had my usual skincare routine planned for Saturday (I didn’t tell him that! of course!). I told him I was busy and we both agreed to meet the next day.


On the day of the date (today), I dressed casually in jeans, a high-neck top and a jacket and asked him to meet me at a location that was away from my home. ( I have a thing about not meeting people close to where I live- no judgment please!). He suggested a popular cafe I declined knowing I’d probably bump into someone I knew. We went through a few more restaurant options but I rejected all of them for the same reason. Eventually, we were both frustrated. He then suggested driving to nearby town. A big NO from me! I was over the date (I am a different person now-a-days and get easily frustrated this is the reason for taking a break and travelling back to my hometown, even starting Reddit. I don't want to explain more but I have become a difficult human)
I told him to just drop me back at the spot he picked me up from. He paused  and said, “Oggy this isn’t just your date. I’ve thought about how today would go too and it’s not working out. I am equally confused as you. Please sit down. Let’s go somewhere quiet and actually talk.” Guys I was sat!hehe!  

After a 30-minute drive, we ended up at this peaceful riverside spot( I don't want to disclose the name of the place and it's how I can describe it) there were no restaurants but a little hut that only served tea and snacks. We sat down and he ordered two cups of tea and a cigarette for himself. I asked ""do you smoke?"" “Only when I’m frustrated.”  “Am I frustrating you?” He just laughed it off and said, “No comments.” We spent the next half hour in comfortable silence, sipping tea and enjoying the calm. It was one of those moments where time just slipped away.
As we chatted more, I couldn’t help but notice how genuine and relaxed he was. There was no pressure, no awkwardness. Just two people sharing a moment. By the time we headed back he dropped me a few blocks away from my house (as I’d requested.) Before I left he made me pinky promise that I will be honest. That if I wasn’t into him I’d tell him, and if I was I wouldn’t lie or avoid him. ( Pinky promise is one of few inside jokes from my teenage years hahah- he remembers that) It was a sweet personal moment that made me smile.


I came home, got busy but I kept thinking about the day. I even replied to a few of his texts but I didn’t want to overthink it. I thought about journaling my experience but it felt too raw, too soon to write down. So, I’m sharing it here instead. Reddit it is!


One moment keeps replaying in my mind. He was telling me a funny story and started laughing( the kind of laugh that’s all in, with his eyes squinting and his hair falling over his forehead). I couldn’t focus on the story because I was so captivated by how genuine his laugh was. I thought to myself ""charming!""

 I’m not sure how this is gonna end. But for today, I can say this- I had fun.   
Is love real? I don’t know. But is decency charming? Absolutely.

I'm 22 years old, weigh 93 kg, and am 180 cm tall. For most of my life, I was unfit, tried the gym several times, but kept circling back to square one for various reasons. However, after starting my new job, I’ve been able to establish a stable routine, which has made it easier for me to focus on fitness. I’ve been consistent with my workouts for about 3 months now, and I’ve noticed positive changes.

In the first month, I focused on eating home-cooked meals, combining it with cardio and full-body workouts. The next month, I switched to a PPL (Push/Pull/Legs) split, and this month, I’ve started paying more attention to my diet and supplements. I recently bought some supplements:

ASITIS Unflavoured Whey Protein

MuscleBlaze 200mg Creatine

MuscleBlaze Protein Oats

Now, I’m a bit uncertain about how to split my meals and supplements throughout the day. I’ve created a basic plan for my meals, but I’m looking for advice on when to take my creatine, protein, and how to structure my overall meals. Here's what I’ve selected so far:

Meal Plan:

1 scoop of protein

4 soft-boiled eggs

1 roti + any sabji (vegetable dish) made at home

1 scoop of creatine

50 grams of high-protein oats

100 grams of soya chunks

Daily Schedule:

4:30 AM: Wake up, freshen up, and head to the gym

7:00 AM: Reach the gym, workout (Post-workout, I eat 4 boiled eggs)

8:15 AM: Leave the gym and head to the office

10:00 AM: Reach the office, have snacks (chai and poha or upma from the canteen)

12:30 PM: Espresso + 4 bananas

4:00 PM: Another chai or coffee, but by this time I’m extremely hungry, and I might end up snacking on junk food, which makes me feel bad.

6:00 PM: Leave office and head home

8:00 PM: Reach home, have boiled red rice with any dish made at home

11:30 PM: Work until bed

Questions:

How should I split my meals throughout the day? When should I have my protein, creatine, oats, and other meals?

When should I take creatine? I’ve read about different timings, but I’m unsure if I should take it pre-workout, post-workout, or any other time.

When should I take whey protein? Should it be taken post-workout or as a meal replacement at another time?

How should I manage hunger during work hours? I tend to get super hungry around 4 PM, which leads me to unhealthy snacks. Any tips on healthier snacks or how to control my hunger during the workday?

Bonus Question:

What exactly is a sauna, and when should I incorporate it into my routine?

I’m looking for advice from anyone who has a solid understanding of meal timing, supplement intake, and managing hunger throughout the day. Appreciate any help, and thanks in advance! 🙏",1,1733066788.0,Fitness_India,1,1.0,False

I'm fairly new to the espresso world. Recently bought a Bambino and started drinking proper espresso, usually buying beans from a local coffee shop that were roasted in the last 2 weeks.

A friend of mine gave me this package as a present, it's a 250g package for 10 Euro, which is insane, because the freshly roasted beans that I buy are cheaper. These were probably roasted more than 6 months ago. The package has best before date 02.2026.

The shots that I pulled were absolutely disgusting, the most acidic and sour coffee with NO FLAVOR whatsoever.
I noticed that my grind was full of these lighter particles that can be seen in the middle of the bean. What exactly causes this? Spoiled coffee, uneven roast? 
I want to contact the manufacturer, because there is clearly something wrong with this batch, but I don't really know what exactly. What do you think based on the photo?

Shilpa didn't needed defence cuz rajat wasn't using gaali, he was just being vocal and kept all valid points. It seemed more like he jumped cuz his friend told him he was going wrong and need to up his game so he picked on rajat at the moment where kashish, chahat, shilpa were already fighting him and was easy to confront. Since rajat is strong and standing against him will up his game so KV started verbal fight with rajat and what he used against him in argument ???? He started going personal (the people who sympathized when his personal life was brought up forgot when KV did the same to rajat which is pathetic) and cuz of which rajat didn't said that much cuz obviously he didn't want to go personal and tells him by giving example of his marraige, rajat also didn't want to risk getting his personal history on the show and didn't want to use gaali or aggress he only was fighting shilpa at the time and had no business with KV. Honestly KV did nothing against rajat there and went personal and the fight looked forced and fake which was done by KV only to make himself look as the bigger better man among the 2.

In weekend ka vaar KV told rajat beta sambhal ke chal nhi toh phisal kar gir jayega. Which again looked more like targeting and total bullshit and rajat stayed calm there and explained himself well.

He tried to manipulate digvijay in fighting rajat by provoking him using the vivian's coffee thing in which he was successfull.

He tried to manipulate chahat against rajat.

He never stepped in any of house fights and kept on saying why should I get in kids fight.

He instead of solving a simple issue created a massive fight indirectly between chahat and shrutika. He instead kept on fighting shrutika and sara on useless stuff.

He keeps playing victim card. 1st time he played against avinash by saying he doesn't gave food but was seen eating from others and took from avinash also. 2nd time he played it against vivian by saying that a friend didn't supported him. 3rd he played it against shilpa he kept on getting backstabbed and showed that he still cares for her and tries to be both victim and the bigger man. 4th he played it against sara when he provoked and irritated her and made her say bad stuff about him and when she threw water on him he didn't gave her back anything and played victim again by keeping quit, I mean common if he can fight with rajat and avinash how he can't fight against sara.

KV is calculative person. When he comes to his calculative self he fights. Like in Live feed he was seen discussing with shilpa about fighting with rajat.

He always gives that repeated papa response to avinash and the only good joke he ever made was on weekend ka vaar on avinash when rohit shetty and ajay devgun came.

He called avinash chutiya when needed to do so.

He never showed any disagreement to salman khan when he made fun of his personal life.

He never spoke against bigg boss interupting him each time and being made fun of.

He kept getting backstabbed by shilpa.

He kept making same mistakes despite being spoonfed the most in this season.

He chose to fight rajat instead of shilpa even if at that time he didn't had any problem with him.

He didn't gave back to bagga when he was constantly mocking him.

KV's biggest comeback was: 1st when rajat was at the weakest and fighting 3v1 and in that to his only point was rajat's cases and his physical injury and later said stupid papa stuff on weekend ka vaar. 2nd when fighting avinash he said him chutiya and later relied on dumb papa beta stuff. 3rd was when he brought bagga's political career and tells him that his career will fail cuz of him.

He invited rajat for talk and starts the talk by showing his connections.

He tried to manipulate rajat many times in which he failed.

He kept on sitting in the corner.

When rajat says to shilpa ki mere bare mai baat kar rahe ho and to which KV thought that rajat said that to him and that to replied in such a low voice like kitten.

He is a calculative, manipulative, fake person who also tries to gaslight others.

Vivian never used any 3rd person to convince or talk to KV and KV seems to be doing so most of the times.

His game seems to be more about playing victim card, being calculative and manipulative instead of being real and forming real relations. His relation with chum also seems fake from his side. Like how the hell the guy wasn't by chums side when she was having a breakdown and instead KV seemed more focused on proving shrutika and sara wrong.

He seemed to be recollecting himself when on the other hand people like vivian, avinash, rajat, eisha, digvijay, kashish was playing the game simce the day they joined.

He tried to play on both rajat and shilpa's side in time god task. Who's playing safe???

He formed or tried to form alliance with digvijay, kashish, eden, chahat and many others. Who's thali ka baingan if you talking about changing sides (alliances forms and breaks all the time in house)???

He tries to be mahaan insaan.

He said he like to be taken for granted which is pathetic.

Upon getting all the eggs and most of the ration he says something like ""abh sabhko bataunga"". This same guy told avinash was wrong for not distributing ration. Is this okay now??? Who's wrong now???

I see Vivian, Avinash, Eisha, Rajat, Digvijay, Kashish's game to be far better then his.

I've been living in the Netherlands with my wife for the last 2.5 years. Being an introvert, making new friends has been a bit challenging. I have some issues with my lower back, so gym and sports clubs are not an option either.

I've been inspired by a Meetup group I attend called No Small Talk, where we dive into deep topics without the usual small talk. I'd love to try something similar on a more personal level by having one-on-one coffee meetings, and we can have one as soon as next Sunday. These meetings would focus exclusively on meaningful conversations.  
  
If you're interested in exploring these deep questions and building friendships along the way, feel free to reach out. I'll share the topic beforehand so we can dive right in! Some example topics could include whether free will exists, the impact of technology on society, or the concept of happiness.  
  
Looking forward to some great conversations and hopefully making new friends!

My life used to be simple. I’d eat wherever I could, happy as long as there was food. I never went to places like Simple Origins—I felt like I didn’t belong in spots like that. My go-to coffee was SB, not because I was trying to be fancy, but because it was the only thing my taste buds knew. I never thought about traveling abroad or even wanting to. I didn’t bother getting a passport because I didn’t think I’d ever need it.

But life has a way of surprising us. Today marks one year since we first traveled together to Baguio. Just a week after that, we went to Bicol, where I met your family—the same family that welcomed me with so much love. I’ve tried food I never thought I’d get to taste, and now, not only do I have a passport, but I’m excited to use it—with you by my side.

You’ve taught me to dream again. My family likes you, my friends adore you, and I am so grateful that someone like you chose to walk this path with me a year ago.

Thank you for everything—for inspiring me, for being my partner, and for making me believe in a future that’s even brighter than I imagined. Here’s to more love, more adventures, and more dreams fulfilled—together.

Posted quite a lot in here the past two weeks and I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped me out. 

So quick rundown, all of this started November 3rd, and got bad November 10th, tried to fight it for a week on my own and then decided to go to the hospital and spent 4 days there. Diagnosis was necrotizing pancreatitis, duodenal flare/ swelling and what appears to be a cyst by my pancreas. While in the hospital I seen every doctor you could possibly want. Two G.I specialist, surgeon, liver, the whole book. Went through two CT’s with contrast, they said the necrotizing is so small that they don’t want to do anything as of yet and the persistent 1.3 cm cystic  uncinate process lesion is nonspecific, but may be focal duct  disruption. Follow up in 4-6 weeks. If any pain come back to hospital. Did well in the hospital with no pain, they released me and have been home since last Monday. 

I did however have one small bout of pain that worried me on Friday, but I got it to go away, I think I set it off with coffee, and I have been experiencing little “ tightening pains “ occasionally throughout the day, with occasional gas but I noticed with the little pains you can hear the digestive system working, ( gut noises ), and if I lay on my right side it can begin to start up but if I get up and sit for a little bit it’ll calm down. Other than that it’s been manageable, no nausea, vomiting, extreme pain, etc. just the little bought of tightening for 1 or two seconds and that’s it which I’m associating with gas and digestion. 

So I’m hoping this is the up and up, I’ve been following a good diet, haven’t had anything but water and coffee, zero dairy, lean meats, lots of vegetables and greens and have been prepping and planning a full diet change. I am a pack a day smoker, I haven’t smoked but have switched to chewing tobacco for now until I’m fully committed to just putting the patches on.

I’m praying and I mean praying 🙏 that in 4 to 6 weeks all this effort shows improvement and not more destruction because this time, this all truly terrified me to the core, being only 34 , and thinking I could develop worse symptoms, infections, something terrible going wrong, cancer, and just the thought of dieing so young with a million plans for life , because of addiction and actions I could of prevented if I would of just not been a stubborn AH and listened more and more but I always have to push the limits in the worst way, it has riddled my mind and makes my anxiety go through the roof, but I’m staying positive and keeping it out of my head. When it’s our time to go it’s our time, all I can do is try my best to keep moving forward. ",1,1733065655.0,pancreatitis,0,1.0,False

Ordered twice, ice cream at night, coffee morning. Super prompt both times. Great coffee. 

Public areas— 

Lobby is nice but looks worn around the edges. Obviously the Edition does white furniture, so it’s hard to keep clean in high traffic areas. Also the walls have some sort of paint style that makes them look dirty. At first I thought the walls were super dirty until I realized it was how the paint is applied to the walls. Kinda weird. 

We had drinks at the clock tower bar which was really cozy and fun. 

Overall 8.5/10 

Really surprisingly very excellent. Super solid choice, especially in Flatiron. Would definitely stay again. Fantastic, spacious, very comfy room for NYC.  ",5,1733065515.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

1h454g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/storyyourwrote/comments/1h454g3/unexpected_happenings/,Unexpected happenings," ""You're going to be late,"" Rachel's mom called out from the kitchen as the screen door slammed shut. Rachel rolled her eyes and climbed into her beat-up Toyota, tossing her backpack onto the passenger seat. She had a love-hate relationship with her small town; it was comfortable and familiar, but she longed for the excitement and anonymity of the city she'd only ever seen in movies and read about in books.







""Hi, Rach,"" a cheery voice sang out from across the street. Rachel waved half-heartedly at Mrs. Jenkins, her neighbor, who was watering her garden. Mrs. Jenkins always had a smile and a piece of gossip to share, but Rachel was in no mood for chitchat. She had to get to her part-time job at the diner before her boss, Larry, started breathing down her neck.







As Rachel pulled out of the driveway, she saw him - the new guy who'd moved into the old Murphy place last week. He was tall, with dark hair that had a bit of a wave to it, and he was unloading boxes from a sleek, black pickup truck. Rachel's heart skipped a beat. He was definitely not from around here. She'd heard whispers that he was from the city, but she didn't dare believe it. City people never stayed in places like this.







""Hey,"" he said, catching her gaze. Rachel felt her cheeks burn as she offered a shy smile in return. ""Welcome to Nowheresville,"" she thought to herself, her voice barely audible over the engine.







At the diner, Larry barely looked up from his newspaper as Rachel clocked in. ""Your new boyfriend's moving in today?"" he asked, his tone dripping with sarcasm. Rachel's face flushed even more. She didn't have the heart to tell Larry that the new guy was the only thing that had made her look forward to coming into work all week.







The smell of grease and burnt coffee filled the air as Rachel tied on her apron and began her shift. The regulars came and went, sharing their usual complaints about the weather and the price of gas. Rachel listened with a polite nod, her thoughts drifting back to the mysterious stranger. Who was he? What was he doing here?







Her curiosity grew stronger with each passing minute. She couldn't help but wonder if he was as out of place in this town as she felt. Rachel found herself glancing out the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. Maybe, just maybe, he'd wander in for a bite to eat. And when he did, she'd be ready.







The bell above the diner door jingled, snapping Rachel out of her daydream. She looked up to see him, the new guy, standing in the doorway. He scanned the room, his eyes landing on her. Rachel's heart pounded as he made his way over to the counter and slid onto a stool. She took a deep breath and approached him, trying to act nonchalant.







""What can I get you?"" she asked, her voice shaking slightly. He looked up, and his eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint. ""Just a cup of coffee and a slice of that heavenly-looking apple pie,"" he said with a smile that made Rachel's knees feel like jelly.







""Name's Alex,"" he said, extending his hand. Rachel took it, feeling a jolt of electricity pass between them. She tried to play it cool, but her hand lingered longer than it should have. ""I'm Rachel,"" she replied, her voice a little too high. She quickly turned to grab the coffee pot, hoping he hadn't noticed her nervousness.







As Rachel poured his coffee, her hand trembled. She didn't know if it was the excitement of finally meeting him or the fear that he'd see right through her. She hoped it was the former. With a deep breath, she placed the pie in front of him. ""So, what brings you to our little town?"" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.







Alex took a bite, his eyes closing in pleasure. ""Long story,"" he said with a wink. Rachel felt a thrill run through her. This was it. A chance to learn more about him, to find out if he was just passing through or if he might actually stick around.







He took a sip of his coffee, his eyes never leaving hers. ""But I've got all the time in the world if you're willing to listen."" Rachel's heart raced. This was the kind of conversation she'd always dreamed of having with someone who didn't know every embarrassing detail of her life.







They talked for hours, the diner's usual hum fading into the background as Rachel and Alex shared stories and laughter. Rachel had never felt so alive, so seen. It was as if she'd been living in black and white, and Alex had brought a vibrant palette of color to her world.







But as the sun began to set, casting an orange glow across the diner, Rachel had to face the inevitable. She had to ask the question that had been burning in her mind since he walked in. ""What are you really doing here?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. Alex leaned closer, his gaze intense.







""I'm here for a fresh start,"" he said, his voice low and earnest. Rachel felt her heart flutter. A fresh start. That's all she'd ever wanted. Could it be that the universe had sent her a kindred spirit, someone who understood her longing for something more?







The air between them grew thick with unspoken desire. Rachel knew she was playing with fire, but she couldn't resist. ""What if I said I wanted that too?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Alex leaned in closer, his hand reaching for hers. ""Then maybe we could start it together,"" he replied, his eyes filled with a promise she hadn't dared to hope for.







Their fingers intertwined, and Rachel felt something she hadn't felt in a very long time - hope. This was just the beginning of a secret love affair that would change everything she knew about herself and the town she'd always called home.







For the next few weeks, Rachel and Alex met in secret, stolen moments between her shifts at the diner and his mysterious work that kept him out of sight during the day. They'd sit in his living room, the shades drawn, and talk about their dreams and fears. Rachel had never been so open with anyone, and it was intoxicating.







One evening, as they sat on the couch, a bottle of wine between them, Rachel took a deep breath. ""There's something you need to know,"" she began, her heart racing. Alex looked at her, his expression serious. ""What is it?""







Rachel pulled a small vial out of her pocket, the liquid inside swirling with an otherworldly glow. ""It's a love potion,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""It's supposed to make you fall madly in love with the first person you see."" She'd found it in her grandma's dusty attic, a relic from a past she hadn't known existed.







Alex's eyes widened in surprise, and Rachel could see the cogs turning in his mind. ""And you want to try it?"" he asked, his voice a mix of excitement and skepticism. Rachel nodded, her eyes pleading. ""I want to know that what we have is real,"" she whispered. ""I want to feel something so powerful that it can't be ignored.""







With a grin, Alex took the vial from her hand. ""Alright, but we both have to drink it,"" he said, his eyes gleaming with mischief. Rachel's stomach flipped, but she nodded in agreement. They each took a deep breath and downed the potion in one go.







The taste was unlike anything Rachel had ever experienced - sweet and bitter, with a hint of something ancient and wild. Her vision swam, and she felt a warmth spread through her body. When she opened her eyes, Alex was leaning over her, his face a mask of concern. ""Are you okay?"" he asked, his voice filled with genuine worry.







Rachel nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. ""I've never felt better,"" she said, her voice filled with wonder. And she meant it. The love potion had done its work, and she was madly, deeply, irrevocably in love with the man in front of her. The only question was - what would happen when the town found out about their secret?







As the weeks turned into months, Rachel and Alex grew bolder in their affections. They'd hold hands in the darkened alleyways behind the diner, steal kisses in the moonlit parking lot, and whisper sweet nothings in the quiet corners of his house. Rachel had never felt this alive, this consumed by another person. It was like the whole world had been painted in vivid color just for them.







But secrets in small towns have a way of slipping out. One evening, as Rachel was closing up the diner, Mrs. Jenkins peeked her head in, a knowing smile on her face. ""I see you've been spending a lot of time with the new man in town,"" she said, her eyes twinkling. Rachel felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. Had they been found out?







""Don't worry, dear,"" Mrs. Jenkins continued, her voice a soothing balm to Rachel's racing heart. ""Your secret's safe with me. But just remember, love potions can be tricky. They don't always last forever."" Rachel's heart sank. What if the love she felt for Alex was just a fleeting illusion?







The next day, Rachel found Alex waiting for her outside the diner, his eyes filled with an intensity that made her knees wobble. ""We need to talk,"" he said, his voice urgent. Rachel followed him to the park, her stomach in knots. As they sat on the old swing set, he took her hand. ""I think the potion is wearing off,"" he admitted, his voice filled with regret.







Panic gripped Rachel's chest. ""What do we do?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Alex looked into her eyes, his expression earnest. ""We make a choice,"" he said. ""We choose whether to love each other with or without the potion. Because what we have is more than just magic - it's real.""







Rachel searched his eyes, looking for any sign that he was lying. But all she saw was truth and love, raw and unfiltered. She took a deep breath and squeezed his hand. ""I choose you,"" she said, her voice firm. ""I choose us.""







Alex leaned in and kissed her, a kiss that spoke volumes without a single word. Rachel felt the love potion's grip on her heart loosen, replaced by something more substantial, more tangible. The love that grew between them in that moment was not born of magic but of their shared experiences, their stolen moments, and the truth of their feelings for one another.







They decided to tell the town together, standing hand in hand at the town square. Rachel's heart hammered in her chest as the townsfolk gathered, their whispers turning into a murmur of anticipation. Alex took the microphone that had been set up for the town's announcements and cleared his throat. ""I'm here to tell you all about Rachel and me,"" he began, his voice steady. ""We've fallen in love, and we're not going to hide it anymore.""







The crowd gasped, and Rachel felt her cheeks burn. But as she looked around, she saw smiles and nods of approval. Maybe this town wasn't so small-minded after all. Maybe, just maybe, they could make their love story part of the town's folklore. A tale of a city boy and a small-town girl who dared to break the mold.







The tension grew as Rachel took the microphone from Alex, her voice trembling. ""We know it's not what you expected,"" she said, her gaze meeting the eyes of her friends and family. ""But love rarely is."" And with that, she leaned in and kissed him, the applause and cheers of the townsfolk ringing in their ears.







From that day on, Rachel and Alex became the town's favorite couple. They faced their fair share of challenges, of course, but with every whisper of doubt or gossip, they had each other. And as the seasons changed, so did their love, growing stronger with each shared laugh, each whispered secret, and every challenge they faced together.







Their love was a beacon of hope in a town that often felt stuck in its ways. And as Rachel looked into Alex's eyes, she knew that no matter what the future held, she had found her home in him. They had chosen love, and in doing so, they had chosen to write their own destiny.







But as the months passed, Rachel couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Alex seemed distant at times, lost in his own thoughts. He was still the charming, mysterious man she had fallen for, but there was a shadow that followed him like a ghost from his past. Rachel knew that he had secrets - everyone did in this town. But she also knew that if they were going to build a life together, she had to know everything.







One night, as they lay in bed, the crickets outside singing their lullaby, Rachel gathered her courage and asked the question that had been gnawing at her. ""Alex, what aren't you telling me?"" she whispered into the darkness. Alex was silent for a long moment before rolling over to face her, his expression serious. ""There's something you should know,"" he began, his voice heavy with a weight Rachel hadn't heard before.







He told her of a past filled with pain and regret, of a life in the city that had left him scarred and searching for a new beginning. Rachel listened, her heart aching for the man she had come to love so fiercely. And as he spoke, she realized that the love potion had not just brought them together - it had also allowed her to see the parts of him that he had tried to hide, the vulnerability that made him human.







The revelation didn't scare Rachel; instead, it made her love him even more. They talked late into the night, sharing their fears and dreams, piecing together the puzzle of their lives. Rachel felt a deep sense of connection, a bond that transcended the whims of a magical potion. This was real love, the kind that grew from shared experiences and the willingness to be vulnerable.







The next day, Rachel decided to confront the whispers and rumors that had been swirling around them. She marched into Larry's office at the diner and slammed her apron on the desk. ""I'm not going to hide anymore,"" she announced, her voice filled with determination. ""I'm going to tell everyone about Alex and me. We're going to live our lives out in the open.""







Larry raised an eyebrow but said nothing, his expression unreadable. Rachel took a deep breath and left the diner, her heart racing. As she walked through the town, she felt the weight of a hundred eyes on her. But she didn't care. She was going to claim her happiness, no matter what anyone thought.







As she approached Alex's house, she saw him sitting on the porch, his elbows on his knees, staring off into the distance. Rachel climbed the stairs and took a seat beside him, her hand finding his. ""I'm ready,"" she said, her voice steady. ""Ready for whatever comes next.""







Alex turned to her, his eyes searching hers. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice filled with doubt. Rachel nodded. ""More than I've ever been,"" she replied. And with that, they stood up together, hand in hand, ready to face the future and whatever it had in store for them.







The town's reaction was mixed. Some were overjoyed for Rachel, thrilled that she had found love with someone who truly understood her. Others were skeptical, convinced that no good could come from a relationship born of magic. But Rachel and Alex didn't let the naysayers deter them. They held their heads high, their love a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most unexpected things could be the most beautiful.







They faced their fears and their pasts, growing stronger with every challenge they overcame. And as the seasons changed, so too did their relationship. It grew roots, deep and sturdy, anchoring them to each other and to the town they had come to call home. They were the proof that love, even when found in the most unlikely of places, could thrive.







The love potion had been the spark that lit the fire, but it was their shared experiences and the choices they made that kept it burning. And as Rachel looked into Alex's eyes, she knew that no matter what the future held, she had made the right choice in choosing to love him. The town of Nowheresville would never be the same again, and Rachel was more than okay with that.







Life was not always easy for the couple. The whispers and the stares followed them wherever they went, but they had each other, and that was all that mattered. Rachel continued to work at the diner, bringing a new energy and enthusiasm to her job that even Larry couldn't help but notice. Alex, on the other hand, remained a bit of a mystery. His work was still a secret, but Rachel trusted him implicitly.







One evening, as Rachel was serving coffee to the usual suspects at the diner, a group of tourists walked in. They were a rowdy bunch, loud and unfamiliar with the quiet charm of the town. Rachel couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as they talked about the big city, the lights, the sounds, the excitement that she had always dreamed of. But as she watched Alex from across the room, she realized that she didn't need the city anymore. She had her own slice of adventure right here.







After work, Rachel found Alex waiting for her in the parking lot, his eyes filled with excitement. ""I have a surprise for you,"" he said, leading her to his truck. Rachel's heart raced as they drove down the old dirt road, the stars above them a canopy of wonder. They reached a clearing, and Alex stopped the car. ""Look,"" he whispered, pointing up. Rachel's eyes followed his finger, and she gasped as she saw a meteor shower, the stars seemingly raining down around them.







It was in that moment, as they lay on the hood of the truck, hand in hand, that Rachel understood the true power of the love potion. It wasn't about making them fall in love; it was about opening their eyes to the beauty in the world around them. It was about finding magic in the everyday, and in each other.







As the months turned into years, Rachel and Alex's love story became a part of the town's fabric. They faced challenges, just like anyone else, but they faced them together. Rachel watched as Alex slowly began to open up, sharing his past with her in bits and pieces. And she shared her own dreams and fears with him, finding solace in his understanding.







Their love was a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most unexpected things in life could be the most beautiful. Rachel had found her prince charming, not in a far-off city, but right here in the town she had always called home. And as they grew old together, their love story became a beacon of hope for anyone who felt like they didn't fit in, a reminder that love could find you in the most unexpected of places.







And so, Rachel and Alex continued to live their lives, hand in hand, heart to heart, in the town that had once felt so small. They had their ups and downs, their fights and their reconciliations, but they never lost that spark that had brought them together. The love potion had started it all, but it was their shared experiences and the choices they made that kept their love alive.







The townsfolk watched them with a mix of awe and envy, whispering about the magic that had brought them together. But Rachel knew that it was more than magic; it was the courage to take a chance, the willingness to be vulnerable, and the strength to stand up for what you believe in. It was the kind of love that didn't just happen to you; it was the love you chose every single day.







And as they watched the stars fall, Rachel knew that she had chosen wisely. She had chosen a love that was as vast and unpredictable as the universe itself, and she couldn't wait to see where it would take them next.",2,1733065341.0,storyyourwrote,0,1.0,False

When I was a server we once had a reservation for a party of six. It turned out they needed table space for reviewing architectural plans and were conducting a meeting. After several hours they ordered a total of two iced teas and were told to leave.

This week I had a two top sit in our lounge during lunch. The pushed their menus aside and loudly discussed that neither was going to order anything. They eventually got two coffees and sat there through the entire day and into the night shift. Our bartenders cover the lounge/high top area during the day and a server covers them at night. I told the assigned server to just ring in two coffees and saw they were there for nearly an additional hour.

I feel like this is getting more common, that we're viewed as a public location where you can just sit and hang out without spending money. 

Anyone else seeing this?

On Friday I went to the encampment and handed out hot food, granolas, vitamin, melatonin, tylenol.

However yesterday I wanted to do something a little different, I had realised I still have about 6 tomatoes left so I put them in a bag and went back to give the camp then gave them a carton of native smokes, just BB, and 10 bucks. Then I began my morning journey to a grocery and grabbed my breakfast which is like a can of Monster, a loaf of bread and some hummus, then more granolas. I met an unhoused elderly named Noel in a coffee shop, I initially gave him two packs of smokes, one BB and menthol but he said he would only take the BB, and I gave him a 5 bucks, we fist bumped. I left to take the bus downtown, and then the street car.

I arrived at a liquor store and saw an elderly with a beer can, so I asked him if he wanted a pack of menthol, and he nodded so I gave him then a 5 bucks, but he wanted another 5 and I also gave him, he asked for my name and said his was Josh. We fist bumped. I went to the store and grabbed two cans of Sapporo because I felt someone might ask. I walked down the street to a Freshco and met Roger, he remembered me from the last time we met that I gave him smokes and cash, I gave him a pack of BB and a 5 bucks, we fist bumped.

I continued down the road and met an Asian youth who was crossing the street with a blanket, he seemed like just woke up. I asked if he wanted smoke, he thought I would charge him some amount and hesitated, but I shook my head, and took out a pack of menthol for him and a 5 bucks, I can see tears in his eyes.

I kept walking for a long time until I met three indigenous women in Kensington-Chinatown, one was on a wheelchair and another was trying to stay warm under a layer of blankets. I gave the first woman a pack of menthol, and she said today is the birthday of the lady in the layer of blankets, I also gave her a pack of menthol along with 5 bucks. The two other women would like it also, so I gave them each a pack of menthol, and each a 5 bucks. Then I took out two cans of Sapporo and gave to the lady in the blankets and wished her happy birthday. She said she's grateful for my presence. I then kept walking. Then I met an indigenous person standing in the cold, and gave him a pack of BB, he said his name is Lawrence and thanked me, we shaked hand, and I kept walking.

In the busy intersection of Spadina and Dundas, I saw a person covered in a sleeping bag in cold, and I put a pack of BB next to them. Then I saw another youth sitting below a street lamp in the freezing windchill, trying to have an eye shut sleep. I put a pack of menthol, a 5 bucks and a few granolas between their hands. I kept walking and walking until I met Henry and gave him a pack of menthol, he asked if I had two bucks, but I gave him a 5 bucks, he asked for my name, said that he is Chinese and said thank you in Cantonese. We parted way and I kept walking in the cold. I went to LCBO to get 6 cans of beer because once again I feel like someone might need it. I don't give a hoot about outreach etiquette.

I finally got on a bus and sat right in front of another unhoused person. He was trying to not make eye contact, but I broke the silence and gave him a pack of menthol, then a 5 bucks, and asked if he wanted a can, he nodded. We talked for a while, and he said he's on his way to meet a friend, so I gave him another pack of BB and another can for his friend. He was so excited. He said his name is Séamus but people around these part called him Baba. We fist bumped and he left the bus, that before he go Baba waved bye to me. I continued my journey to the subway station and saw a person on wheelchair, I walked to them and asked if they wanted smoke, and they said yes, so I gave them a pack of BB, and a 5 bucks. They said name is Dan but they don't drink.

I kinda did drank on the subway on the way home because I was exhausted and commuters assumed that I was unhoused so they all moved away from me, which I laughed out loud at their behaviors, and shook my head. The petite bourgeois in this city is so doomed, like Marx has said, they have more to lose in the long run than the proletariat and lumpens. I despise way they looked at unhoused people, as if they were afraid, worse, disgust at them. If I can't convince labor aristocrat communists in book club to do outreach then I will do it on my own, and I put theory where practice at. I hate people who just talk and talk but don't do stuff.

I still go to meetings and participate in party politics, but I feel something died inside me. I want my comrades to just go out and feed ppl. Maybe I put too much hope on these things.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of Atalantanet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of Atalantanet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.

Got started last night. It took me a few tries to get out of the starter dungeon but nothing too horrific. I rest one more time outside just to be safe then venture off into the wilderness where a wandering NPC picks me off pretty quickly. Oh well, I guess I SHOULD have tried the fast travel system like they recommended and...this game doesn't autosave on rest. Or at all. Fuck.

Oh well, I wanted better rolls anyways! Rebuilt my guy and made my way to the mages guild to sign up, first quest was to get some research from a dude in another town, easy peasy!

Second quest is to grab my guy some magical shoes he wants to study. I get two leads, an NPC to talk to or a dungeon to track down a lead. I figured the NPC would be easy, but he's tucked away In a dungeon, nbd. I fight my way through and he doesn't know where the Jordans are so I circle back to the other dungeon to look for the note. I find a notebook page pretty early on but it doesn't have any information on where these fucking shoes are.

Now I'd heard tell of uncompleteable quests in this game, and while I did think a bug of some sort was possible, I figured it was much more likely that I had failed to notice something as a new player. My first thought was there must be another page SOMEWHERE in these massive fucking dungeons that had the information, so I proceed to go through all three of them meticulously, robbing every enemy, picking up anything I can. The guild gave me 39 days to find these shoes and that's quickly running out given how often I have to rest to make it through these dungeons. 

I finally concede this dungeon is a dead end, but maybe I need to go back to the first NPC WITH the letter in my possession and it will jog his memory on where these Loubitons are hiding, but no dice.

I really didn't want to fail my second ever mages guild quest, and I thought I may have sequence broke things by going to the NPC before the dungeon. I decided to call it a night at that point and decide how to proceed with fresh eyes.

This morning giving it some thought over a cup of coffee I decided to check UESP. I want to stay mostly unspoiled, but given how early on I am I wanted to KNOW if this was a bug I'd need to look out for again, or if I'd just missed something.

Turns out it was neither, there's just a 25% chance this particular quest will not be completeable 😂. I think I'm gonna like this game!",5,1733063507.0,Daggerfall,2,0.78,False

I clarified 2 drinks at one go, so here's the recipe
- 3 oz London Dry Gin (I used 94 proof Broker's) 
- 2 oz Campari
- 2 oz Sweet Vermouth (I used Cocchi Di Torino) 

Pour over 2 oz whole milk (3.25% fat). Give it a quick stir and let it sit for a minute. 

Strain over coffee filter (Restrain the initial drops as they won't be clear).

Pour the quantity you need for a glass and stir with ice. 

Flamed Orange zest expressed on top with an orange coin for Garnish.

I loved this one more than the original Negroni - you can actual appreciate the flavors in the Campari on this one. The Mellowed Campari blends well with the Juniper notes of the Gin and has the right amount of sweetness from the Vermouth. 

Clarification may not improve all your favorite cocktails, but the Negroni is one that definitely benefits from clarification.

I’m starting to realize there are far better coffee shop options than Starbucks or Dunkin’, and today I discovered another hidden gem: Plum Coffee in Cypress. After hearing several recommendations, I decided to give it a try.

From the moment I walked in, I was warmly greeted—a small gesture that left a great first impression. I already knew I wanted my go-to drink, an iced caramel latte, but they also have a menu on the counter. The interior was stylish and unique, featuring a cool wall design and plenty of seating, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

I was impressed with their payment options, which even included Cash App—a rare but convenient addition. The pricing was reasonable and comparable to Starbucks, but honestly, I’d rather spend my money at Plum Coffee.

My drink was prepared quickly, though it wasn’t busy at the time. For those on the go, they also offer a drive-thru option. The latte itself was excellent—the caramel flavor was perfectly balanced, allowing the coffee to shine through. Plus, they didn’t overload the cup with ice, so I felt like I got my money’s worth.

The staff was friendly and made my morning feel a bit brighter. Overall, if you’re looking to support a local coffee shop with great coffee and a welcoming vibe, I highly recommend Plum Coffee. It’s definitely worth checking out!",3,1733062828.0,CypressTX,1,0.59,False

I used to own a Severin KA 5995 espresso machine along with a blade grinder. I didn’t look up anything about espresso. I simply ground grocery store coffee beans, put a certain amount into the portafilter, pulled a shot and the result was always good. It might not have been « actual espresso » but it was definitely stronger than any pourover coffee and was enjoyable.

Now I upgraded to a Bambino Plus with a DF54, bought better coffee grounds, paying more attention to pulling consistent shots by spreading the grounds evenly and tamping properly, while trying to use the same volume of coffee beans. The results are always bad so far though : usually too bitter/burnt, sometimes too sour, sometimes too watery, depending on what factor I change.  I am still awaiting my delivery of my coffee scale and wdt tool so that should help a lot with consistency, but I just feel lost and discouraged. I try to dial in according to the taste and it’s always bad tasting. 

Why was it not that bad when I didn’t even try to make it consistently with my previous setup? Why is it so difficult to get one good shot right now? It’s probably that this is actually how espresso is and so pulling a good shot requires more skill. I probably should be able to pull okay shots even without a scale though. Is this a common occurence in people’s espresso journey?",1,1733062560.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1h444uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1h444uy/im_so_annoyed_at_all_the_men_in_my_life_cats_and/,I'm so annoyed at all the men in my life (cats and human),"WHYYYY must there be a mountain of clothes on the bathroom floor??? Two days worth of clothes just deposited there, I don't understand- we don't live in a mansion, there are hampers JUST DOWN THE HALLWAY. After waking up this morning to a vomiting cat, and then trying to feed them all including the picky one (who at this point is causing me to lose at least 5-10 dollars every week on wasted cat food because of course, one of our cats is in kidney failure, the other one has a serious grain allergy, and the third is the pickiest cat known to mankind- I spend 400 dollars on prescription food and grain free food every month, and the picky one turns up his nose at all of it). 

So I get up this morning to the vomiting cat, try to get the picky cat to eat two different foods, one of which I have to throw away because if the other cats don't finish it, the kidney failure cat will meander over to try and get a bite and he needs to be on a strict diet. I refrigerate food sometimes but if the picky cat won't eat it, it feels pointless. And then I go into use the bathroom and can't even close the door because of the mountain of goddamn clothes my boyfriend can't be bothered to take five steps to a hamper. He leaves ALL cabinets open, I've NEVER experienced him taking something out, putting it back when done, and closing the door. I make messes too, I'm not perfect, but I clean them up. How many weeks should I give him to pick his things up?? After one month this place would be unlivable if I didn't clean up his stuff as well as mine.

I wake up two hours before work so I can feed the cats, do a load of laundry, clean the litter box, unload the dishwasher, make us tea or coffee, do my makeup and plan out the day. He rolls out of bed ten minutes before he has to clock in for remote work. And I'm ok with that because, I accept that I just feel compelled to do these things, but sometimes I think, golly it sure would be nice getting those extra two hours of sleep and just not giving a damn. But what state would our home be in??? 

I love them all but ... bad morning lol",1,1733062421.0,Vent,3,0.6,False
1h444sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1h444sr/my_bumble_date_went_well_kinda/,"My Bumble Date Went... Well, Kinda","Okay so I went on this Bumble date last night and let me tell you it was a whole experience I matched with this guy a couple of weeks ago and we had pretty good conversations leading up to the date nothing too crazy just casual stuff He seemed super chill and definitely cute in his pictures so I was feeling pretty hopeful

We decided to meet at a coffee shop that was kind of a halfway point for both of us I get there first and I’m doing that thing where I’m scanning the place for any sign of him Then I see this guy who kind of looks like him but something’s off he’s wearing a completely different outfit than in his pics But I decided to go with it anyway and just walked up to him Turns out it was him and we both kind of awkwardly laughed about how he looked way different than his profile pics which okay fair enough

But the weirdest part The conversation Like we were talking but the whole vibe felt off He’d keep making these random off the wall comments that would come out of nowhere At one point he started talking about his crazy ex and then immediately turned it into this long rant about how he doesn’t trust people I’m sitting there sipping my coffee like wait what just happened

Then as the date went on it was like we hit this weird awkward silence point where neither of us knew what to say He kept checking his phone every 5 minutes and even got distracted while I was talking and that was the moment I knew this was probably not gonna go anywhere

In the end I was polite but I could just tell we were both kind of relieved when it was over We hugged goodbye and I got in my car thinking well that was interesting He messaged me afterward saying he had a great time and would love to do it again but like I don’t know The whole thing left me feeling a little off and I’m just not sure I’m feeling a second date

Has anyone else had a date where the vibe was just way off and you’re not sure what to even think Honestly I thought it’d go better but guess that’s Bumble for you

1h444ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1h444ql/how_to_cope_with_broken_boundaries/,How to cope with broken boundaries,"I (46M) and my wife (40F) have been together and poly for four years. We went into the relation with well discussed and solid boundaries on what we were comfortable with, expectations on communication and so on. 

Up to this point there have been the minor bumps and so on of navigating a poly relationship with her being far more 'active' than me in that she dated another woman for two years separately with no issues until they went their separate ways amicably. I had a short term relationship with another woman for 3 months that wasn't the right fit and again ended amicably.

We had agreed to an open phone policy where we are free to go through each others phones if we were feeling insecure about something which was never used until last night. 

She had mentioned that a guy she ran into through work had asked her out for coffee, she had told me and I was genuinely excited for her as she was getting back out there so to speak. 

Over the next few days I noticed drastic personality changes in my wife, not negative per se but enough that it got my attention. Things like taking a sudden interest on what shifts I was working through the week (I work rotating shifts that can change the day before, etc) and other where and when I'll be places type questions. I had asked her several times if there was anything going on to which she gave a hard no to every time. 

So last night when she was in the shower I popped open her phone and low and behold there were all the conversations about asking him when he can get away to see her, can't wait to spend time, pictures, the whole nine yards. 

When she got out of the shower I again asked if there was anything more than a coffee date going on with him, she again doubled down saying that nothing was going on, they don't talk all that often, it's rather innocent, and so on. 
I told her I saw the messages, pictures and so on, and now we're at this point of where to go from here. 

Our one main rule and condition was open and total honest communication. If things between then had escalated they way they did with me being in the loop there would of been literally zero issues or problems coming from my end, I again, would of been genuinely happy and excited for her honeymoon phase of a new relationship. 

Now I'm left feeling betrayed and unable to trust anything she says. 

I'm just looking for a bit of advice from anyone who has been in similar circumstances and how the navigated through it. ",2,1733062411.0,polyamory,36,0.58,False

1h444aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1h444aq/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.
","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none
* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)
* certik 50k votes done and is about to be audited
* Bitget is partnered with kendu recently

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.",21,1733062375.0,Crypto_General,9,1.0,False
