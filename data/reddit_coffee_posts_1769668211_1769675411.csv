Meanwhile, I'm stuck at like 5 hours since I'm too distracted. On instagram, I saw an advertisement for these caffeine chewing gums to boost focus and thought I could try those since I have a sort of tolerance to caffeine from tea/coffee. I went to chatgpt to ask about any known disadvantages of caffeine gum and it brought up nicotine gum. On further research, I found out that it's not illegal for me to buy it, and apparently it should help me focus better.. ChatGPT says that it may not be the best idea since people get addicted quite easily.. but are there any disadvantages apart from that?",1,1769675334.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

Whether you're a content creator building your audience or a small business owner trying to drive traffic, managing your links effectively can make a real difference in your results. Here's a comprehensive guide covering the essentials.

---

## Link-in-Bio Setup Tips

Your bio link is often the only clickable link you get on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Make it count.

**Organization matters:**

- **Top link = your #1 priority right now.** New product launch? Latest video? Put it first. This spot gets the most clicks.
- **Second link = trust builder.** Your portfolio, a testimonial, or your best free resource.
- **Middle links = evergreen content.** Things that stay relevant (your main website, services page, newsletter signup).
- **Bottom = optional fun stuff.** Personal projects, playlists, etc.

**Keep it focused:**

Start with 4-6 links. Enough to be useful, not overwhelming. Studies show optimized bio pages see 25-40% higher conversion rates compared to cluttered ones.

**Design for mobile first:**

Over 95% of social media users access from mobile devices. Every page you link to should be fast-loading, responsive, and easy to tap. Test your links on your own phone before publishing.

**Update regularly:**

- Update your top link weekly (or whenever you have something new)
- Review the rest monthly
- Remove anything outdated or underperforming

---

## UTM Parameters: The Basics

UTM parameters help you understand exactly where your traffic comes from. If you're running campaigns across multiple channels, these are essential.

**The five UTM parameters:**

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| utm_source | Where the traffic comes from | `facebook`, `newsletter`, `twitter` |
| utm_medium | The type of channel | `social`, `email`, `cpc`, `referral` |
| utm_campaign | Your campaign name | `summer_sale`, `product_launch_jan` |
| utm_term | Keywords (mainly for paid ads) | `running_shoes`, `best_coffee` |
| utm_content | Differentiate similar links | `header_button`, `footer_link`, `variant_a` |

**Best practices:**

1. **Use lowercase only.** UTM codes are case-sensitive. `Email` and `email` will show as separate sources in your analytics. Stick to lowercase.

2. **No spaces.** Use underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`) instead. Spaces break UTM links.

3. **Be consistent.** Create a naming convention and stick to it. Document it in a shared spreadsheet if you work with a team.

4. **Don't use for internal links.** UTM parameters on internal site links will restart user sessions in analytics and skew your data.

5. **Keep a record.** Track all your UTM codes in a spreadsheet. This prevents duplicates and keeps naming consistent.

**Example of a properly tagged URL:**

```
https://yoursite.com/product?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=spring_launch&utm_content=bio_link
```

---

## Understanding Your Analytics

Not all traffic data is straightforward. Here's what you need to know.

**Why traffic shows as ""Direct"":**

Direct traffic doesn't always mean someone typed your URL directly. It often means the referrer information was lost. This happens when:

- Someone clicks a link from a mobile app (Instagram, TikTok apps don't pass referrer data)
- Links are clicked from desktop email clients like Outlook
- Someone clicks a link in a PDF or Word document
- HTTPS to HTTP transitions

**Solution:** Use UTM parameters for any traffic source that might not pass referrer data naturally.

**Metrics that actually matter:**

- **Click-through rate (CTR):** What percentage of people who see your link actually click it?
- **Unique clicks vs total clicks:** One person clicking 5 times is different from 5 people clicking once.
- **Geographic data:** Know where your audience is located.
- **Device breakdown:** Are your visitors mostly mobile? Desktop? Optimize accordingly.
- **Referrer sources:** Which platforms send you the most engaged traffic?

**Common analytics mistakes:**

- Obsessing over vanity metrics (total clicks) instead of engagement quality
- Not segmenting data by campaign or source
- Ignoring mobile vs desktop differences
- Not tracking over time to spot trends

---

## QR Code Best Practices

QR codes bridge physical and digital marketing. Here's how to use them effectively.

**Design tips:**

- **Size matters.** Minimum 2cm x 2cm for print. Larger for posters or signs viewed from a distance.
- **High contrast.** Dark foreground on light background. Black on white works best, but dark blue or green on white also scans well.
- **Don't invert colors.** Light-on-dark QR codes often fail to scan.
- **High resolution.** Generate at high resolution to avoid pixelation. Pixelated codes won't scan.
- **Leave quiet zone.** Keep white space around the QR code - it helps scanners read it.

**Use dynamic QR codes:**

Static QR codes encode the destination URL directly - if you need to change the destination, you need a new code. Dynamic QR codes point to a redirect URL that you can update anytime. This is crucial for printed materials.

**Placement strategy:**

- Eye level for in-store displays
- Not too small on business cards (at least 1.5cm)
- Visible in well-lit areas
- Multiple placement points along customer paths

**Always include a CTA:**

""Scan to get 15% off"" works better than just a QR code sitting there. Tell people what they'll get.

**Test before printing:**

Scan your QR code with multiple devices before committing to print. Test in the lighting conditions where it will actually be used.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Broken links**

Nothing kills conversion faster than a 404 error. Regularly audit your links. Use tools that let you update destinations without changing the short link.

**2. Inconsistent branding**

If you use multiple link management tools, your analytics will be fragmented and your branding inconsistent. Consolidate where possible.

**3. Not testing on mobile**

Your desktop experience and mobile experience can be completely different. Always test the full user journey on a phone.

**4. Ignoring page load speed**

Your short link redirects in milliseconds, but if your landing page takes 5 seconds to load, you've lost the visitor. Optimize your destinations.

**5. Over-linking**

More links is not better. Every additional option reduces the likelihood of clicking any single one. Be strategic.

**6. Forgetting to track**

If you're not tracking performance, you're guessing. Set up proper analytics from day one.

**7. Using link shorteners for internal links**

This breaks analytics and adds unnecessary redirect latency. Use short links for external sharing only.

---

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Before publishing any link:**

- [ ] Tested on mobile device
- [ ] UTM parameters added (for campaigns)
- [ ] Landing page loads quickly
- [ ] Clear call-to-action
- [ ] Analytics tracking confirmed

**Monthly link audit:**

- [ ] Check for broken links
- [ ] Review click performance
- [ ] Update or remove underperformers
- [ ] Refresh top bio link if needed

first the usual quick recap of my situation: dad passed in 2020, i quit job in IT to a care for mom as primary caregiver, sister helped as my backup/breakgiver and we kicked ass as Team Mom. mom passed in jan 2025 and thus ending my 4 1/2 year caregiver journey.  prior to 2020, i had never worked in healthcare or been a caregiver. my sister and i basically jumped head first in after dad suddenly passed.  he was mom's caregiver up to that point.  

the first few months flew by and mom and i found our groove very fast. thankfully her and i got along great. minimal outburts/sundowning.  a key thing we established early was a very strict routine/meal schedule.  that consistency i feel helped mom stay 'here' mentally longer and kept her at ease, comfortable. 

the hardest parts of caregiving is the isolation from our own peers, friends, people in general. every night i would usually unwind for an hour upstairs and play some video games and stream/chat w/people. that saved my mental health a ton. sure it wasn't like being in a room w/a person but it let me at least vent or recap what the day was like, decompress.

however, the last three months i could see the decline. it came fast. less talking to just two or three words. more sundowning and crazy nights. more days of sleeping till 12pm. and the falls. she fell only twice but the second time nearly broke me physically and mentally. 

it was a month before she passed and after we had just gotten out of the shower, bathed. it took me an hour (i'm 105lbs, mom is about 280lbs) to get her in a chair.  after that, i felt like i was out of my element, in over my head. but... she rebounded for a month and we were able to even have a final christmas (i told our closest relatives that this would most likely be the last one too).  then, it happened. i was on my little break for a few days and my sister was taking care of mom and mom had another stroke. she passed that evening with my sister and i holding her hand. she was finally at peace. we gave her a dignified end of life and that is what i am most proud of. 

my mom was able to live her last days in dignity, in a place she knew and loved with her son and daughter at her side.  yes, my career in IT prob is over or needs me to really work to get back to where i was but.. i don't care really. my job and purpose in this life i feel was to be my mom's caregiver. to show and give her the love she gave my sister and i (we are adopted).  sorry if this sounds super cheesy but damn thats who i am and why i'm balling my eyes out right now typing. 

its been months since i last cried... like i mentioned in my six month update... i am forgetting what it was like to be a caregiver.. how i felt back then.. and i miss it oddly.. not the bad stuff but i guess the routine, mom helping me dry dishes, fold the laundry, playing cards and having coffee.... it feels so empty not having that.. it was my identity...

yea, thats what is the hardest part of not being a caregiver anymore is that when we are caregiving, it is our life, our identity, our purpose in life.. and once its gone.. 

now what?.... now what?

and that my friends is where i am now...  figuring out a new purpose in this life.. however no matter where my path leads, being a caregiver is one chapter in my life i will forever hold in my heart and consider it one of my most important ones..

i love you all. i see you. i hear you. i was you. 

may your days be filled w/hope and moments of joy.... keep carrying the light in the darkest days and keep the fire lit.. 💕❤️

ps me and mom the day i was adopted. 🥹

I’m a screenwriter & filmmaker relocating to Bhubaneswar and looking for area recommendations.

Some context:

1. I’ve previously stayed in Shaheed Nagar and Madhusudan Nagar (during my NEET prep days).
2. My DOP and Director friends are living in Kalinga Nagar and Baramunda respectively.
3. I’ll mostly be working independently / creatively, so the neighbourhood vibe matters a bit.

Primary requirements:

A) Decent cafés (good to sit, write, think, not just quick coffee)

B) Gym access — entry to mid-level gyms are totally fine (not looking for ultra-premium only)

I’m open to central or slightly upcoming areas as long as:

i) Cafés are walkable / nearby

ii) Gyms aren’t a pain to reach

iii) The area isn’t completely dead socially and which will help me in networking with more film industry people,

My budget is 8k for 1bhk

Thanks in advance! 🙌",2,1769673900.0,Bhubaneswar,1,1.0,False

I am tired of the machine grind and automatic drip coffee machine setup that I currently have and convinced myself to setup a home coffee bar. I love pour over coffee and I am ready to invest upto 25k on equipments. Can you all suggest the right tools please? I am envisioning manual grinder, cone, carafe, filter paper stock, weights(?), any other nice-to-have tools. I am a newbie for this setup, so I may not know the best list of tools. Appreciate your suggestions! Also, I have a fixed taste for a branded medium-dark coffee beans, and hence won't need any suggestions on the beans.",1,1769673669.0,coffeeindia,0,1.0,False

I bought my first Gaggia Espresso Evolution (2025) machine and a manual Timemore C3 ESP Pro grinder. This machine originally came with a 53mm pressurized basket.  
I would like to try the non-pressurized baskets.  
  
Does it make sense to buy it without a naked portafilter?   
Can I use it with my original Gaggia portafilter?   
Is this grinder enough for that non-pressurized basket, or will it take forever to grind coffee with it ? 

I currently grind coffee to the proper quality in 40-60 seconds (14 grams, 1.1 circle setting)

1qq2kz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qq2kz6/am_i_cooked/,Am i cooked?,"So, I got a deal on some Colombian Gesha, the catch tho is that its didnt fit the peofile the roaster went for+ theyre now \~8 weeks of roast, hence the deal, but anyway.. 

I have a temp controlled kettle, glass v60, array of filters, but used the t-90 now, 1zpresso X-ultra grinder.

First recipe I did was:

15g coffee at 2:2:0 grind, 

250g 94C water, 

cafec t-90 filter. 

Pouring 0-30s +50g, 30-60s +50g, 1min-1:20 +150g. Drawdown at 2:30. 

Not much aromatics, not really any sparkle or brightness, no really clear flavor or profile, though nice mouthfeel light, no lingering taste really. Essentially a balanced but very boring cup, general light coffee taste.

Second cup i did was:

15g coffee at 2:3:0 grind

260g 95C water

T-90 filter

2-pour, 50g bloom, rest poured after 40s, drawdown \~2:40-2:45

Still acking on the nose, maybe some hint of something on 1-2 sniffs. On the palate, some citrus brightness initially on the first sips, but it faded quickly, kind of bland still, generic light coffe aftertaste.

Help me 😭 I know its a gamble, but I wanna get something enjoyable at least, I know 8 weeks is meh, but it should still be better than this. The coffee is from one of the better Scandinavian based micro roasters... ",0,1769673589.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

Some people might be excited, but no people means no tips. I walked to the back and set my bag on the breakroom table. “Marie.” I turned to see Elma, one of the waitresses that helped to open this cafe 20 years ago. “Hi Elma! I will be right out.” “Denny wants to see you first.” “Oh Ok.” I made my way to Denny’s office right off the kitchen. “Hey Denny. Elma said you wanted to talk to me?” I said, tucking a strand of my dirty blonde hair behind my ear. “Yeah Marie, come and have a seat. As you know, we have been really slow lately.” “Don’t worry, Denny, business will pickup. It’s almost time for college kids to rush to visit for spring break.” The cafe was tucked away from the main strip in Miami. “That’s the thing, Marie. I don’t have the ability to keep you on.” He slid an envelope toward me on the desk. I looked up at him confused. “I am sorry Marie, but I have to let you go.” I smiled back at Denny. I knew he didn’t have a choice. I took my last pay check and grabbed my bag and headed to the door. Thank goodness this was only my part-time job. I still had my full-time job. I decided instead of heading home I would head to see Luca Salvatore, my boyfriend of almost a year. He recently started working with his Dad, which I wasn’t pumped about, but it was inevitable. His Dad owned one of the largest strip clubs in Miami and Luca was training to take over the family business. I wasn’t worried about him being around stripers all day because my best friend worked with him and she always had my back. She has since we were placed in a group home together. I wasn’t always in the system. My mom passed away from cancer when I was 11 and my Grandma took care of me till I was 16, when she had a heart attack and I lost her too. I had never met my father, which was fine because I had two amazing women in my life. Before my Grandma passed, she asked my Aunt to take care of me if anything happened to her. My Aunt agreed but when my Grandma died she was only interested in how much money she was going to inherit. My Grandmother had set up for me to inherit $150,000 when I turned 18 and then another $300,000 when I turned 21 and finally $500,000 when I was 25. Nobody knows about the money my Grandma left me and I planned to keep it that way. My aunt was left some, but when she found out there was nothing she could do about my inheritance, she sold everything my Grandmother owned and left me a ward of the state. When I turned 18 over a year ago and graduated, I got two jobs and had yet to touch the money my grandmother left me. I know she wanted me to go to college but I wasn’t sure if that was what I wanted. I decided to give myself till I turned 20, which wasn’t that far away. It wasn’t a far walk to the bus stop. Once I was on the bus, it would only be a few minutes until I would be with Luca. We had gone to school together and I was in love with him. He didn’t even know I existed in school since I was two years younger than him, but when Chantelle, my best friend, started working at his father’s strip club, he started showing interest in me. Chantelle said it was because I was a virgin, which is probably the reason I have yet to have s\*x with him, but I knew he loved me. He wouldn’t have stuck around for a year. Stepping off the bus, I quickly made my way to the club. “Hey Marty.” I gave the bouncer a quick hug. “Hey Pretty girl. You here to see your lover boy?” “You know it.” “He is in his office upstairs.” “Thanks.” I bounced up the stairs two at a time. I reached for the door and noticed it wasn’t latched. I pushed the door open and my heart stopped. I felt like my entire world was crumbling around me. In front of me was Luca, my boyfriend having s\*x with my best friend as she was bent over his desk. I wanted to scream and hit them both, but instead I turned and ran down the stairs. I brushed past Marty and I could hear him yelling behind me, but I didn’t stop, I just kept going. The bus had just pulled up and I wasted no time getting on the bus and made my way home. Home to the apartment I shared with Chantelle. Anger filled me as I made my way up the stairs to our one-bedroom shack. Chantelle was a year older than me and when she turned 18 she got this place. For a year I have lived out of a suitcase and slept on the couch, paying half of the rent. She kept saying we would find a two-bedroom apartment but here I was still on the couch. Sitting down on the couch, I felt numb. How stupid could I be? I knew she had been messing around with somebody for the past 3 months. I should have known it was Luca. She would have bought any other man here. It took me all of three minutes to realize I needed to get the hell out of here. I didn’t own much, so it didn’t take long for me to grab my suitcase that I had been using as a dresser and shoved any of my few personal belongings into the bag. As I made my way to the door, I looked back and realized nobody would have even noticed I was gone. Removing the key, I set it on the TV stand next to a picture of me and Chantelle. Anger overwhelmed me. Without thinking, I went into the kitchen and pulled down the coffee container that Chantelle hid her tips in from dancing. I grabbed out half of the rent and anything I had paid for over the last 3 months. Realizing I was still wearing my work uniform, I went into Chantelle’s dresser. I grabbed out a pair of her favorite jeans and a tank top. I went back to the bathroom and gave myself a touch up. Looking at my reflections, I was drawn to the heart necklace I wore every day. A gift from Luca. I took it off and on my way to the door I dropped it next to my key to the apartment. I grabbed my bag and suitcase and walked out of the apartment forever. Pulling out my phone, I requested an Uber and I had a ride within 3 minutes. He drove me to a bakery where I spent 40 hours a week. Making my way to the back with my suitcase in tow, I turned a lot of heads in the bakery. “Hi Casey.” My boss turned around and gave me a big hug. “Hi Marie, what is wrong?” I explained what I had seen and before the tears could fall Casey ushered me into her office. She handed me a tissue and I just let the tears flow. “What are you planning on doing?” “I don’t know. I can’t stay around here. I can’t take the chance of running into Luca and you know how his family has connections everywhere.” Casey took a deep breath and started to rub her temples. “His family scares me to be honest. But I think you should go and start over. But I would stay away from planes or renting a car. I don’t want them to find where you are going.” “I don’t even know where to go. Do you really think his family would go that far?” “Marie, there is a lot about that family that you don’t know and it’s safer for you if you don’t know.” “I don’t think I have to worry about him trying to find me, but if I don’t use a plane or car, I guess my only option is the bus.” “Or train?” “Where do I go?” Before she could answer, my phone started ringing.

She would have bought any other man here. It took me all of three minutes to realize I needed to get the hell out of here. I didn’t own much, so it didn’t take long for me to grab my suitcase that I had been using as a dresser and shoved any of my few personal belongings into the bag. As I made my way to the door, I looked back and realized nobody would have even noticed I was gone. Removing the key, I set it on the TV stand next to a picture of me and Chantelle. Anger overwhelmed me. Without thinking, I went into the kitchen and pulled down the coffee container that Chantelle hid her tips in from dancing. I grabbed out half of the rent and anything I had paid for over the last 3 months. Realizing I was still wearing my work uniform, I went into Chantelle’s dresser. I grabbed out a pair of her favorite jeans and a tank top. I went back to the bathroom and gave myself a touch up. Looking at my reflections, I was drawn to the heart necklace I wore every day. A gift from Luca. I took it off and on my way to the door I dropped it next to my key to the apartment. I grabbed my bag and suitcase and walked out of the apartment forever. Pulling out my phone, I requested an Uber and I had a ride within 3 minutes. He drove me to a bakery where I spent 40 hours a week. Making my way to the back with my suitcase in tow, I turned a lot of heads in the bakery. “Hi Casey.” My boss turned around and gave me a big hug. “Hi Marie, what is wrong?” I explained what I had seen and before the tears could fall Casey ushered me into her office. She handed me a tissue and I just let the tears flow. “What are you planning on doing?” “I don’t know. I can’t stay around here. I can’t take the chance of running into Luca and you know how his family has connections everywhere.” Casey took a deep breath and started to rub her temples. “His family scares me to be honest. But I think you should go and start over. But I would stay away from planes or renting a car. I don’t want them to find where you are going.” “I don’t even know where to go. Do you really think his family would go that far?” “Marie, there is a lot about that family that you don’t know and it’s safer for you if you don’t know.” “I don’t think I have to worry about him trying to find me, but if I don’t use a plane or car, I guess my only option is the bus.” “Or train?” “Where do I go?” Before she could answer, my phone started ringing. I glanced down at the caller ID and saw Luca’s name.",1,1769673560.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I stay near HSR Layout, Bangalore, and I’m a typical introvert trying to do a slightly extrovert thing — make new friends 😄

By profession, I work in digital marketing and data analysis. I genuinely enjoy talking about things like campaigns, analytics, growth strategies, tools, startups… basically anything in this space.

That said, you don’t have to be from the same domain — I’m totally open to meeting people from different backgrounds too. Sometimes the best conversations come from unexpected places.

If you’re someone who:
Works in digital marketing / data / tech. Likes meaningful conversations over loud parties. Enjoys coffee walks, casual meetups, or just chilling and talking life.…we’ll probably get along just fine 🙂

No pressure, no awkward expectations — just looking to meet good people and see where it goes.

It's really insane how much mental and emotional space in my head is taken up by firstprince, now that the production has started and we are being fed crumbs every damn day! 

and it doesn't help that i day dream of them every minute when i have some free time at work. so i made this small (really not so small) list of things i want to see Alex and Henry do in the movie, which like may not be big gestures, but tiny domestic/ coupley things that would just look so cute on screen.

Would love to hear all about your wishlists too!

So here it goes:

1. Sharing clothes

2. Matchy mugs

17. Pez video calling Alex while Henry is cooking in their brownstone and says ""Say hello to your strumpet, Henry."" and Henry chuckles and says ""Hello strumpet!""😍😍😍

18. Feeding food to each other

19. Alex coming home tired from work and collapsing on Henry's lap on their couch, while Henry reads and gently runs his fingers through his hair and kisses him \*Dreamy\*

20. Redo of the deleted Paris scene when Alex blows raspberry to Henry's neck 

21. Showers and Baths together!

\#### Numbers

Kuma's number system is revealed through the calendar structure:

| Number | Cardinal | Weekday (-ta) | Month (-tar) |

|--------|----------|---------------|--------------|

| 1 | pran | Pranta | Prantar |

| 2 | dor | Dorta | Dortar |

| 3 | tras | Trasta | Trastar |

| 4 | kar | Karta | Kartar |

| 5 | lim | Limta | Limtar |

| 6 | shes | Shesta | Shestar |

| 7 | net | Netta | Nettar |

| 8 | pol | Polta | Poltar |

| 9 | kun | — | Kuntar |

| 10 | rek | — | Rektar |

\*\*Number Formation:\*\*

\- \*\*11-19:\*\* rek + number (e.g., rek-pran = 11, rek-dor = 12, rek-tras = 13)

\- \*\*Tens:\*\* number + rek (e.g., dor-rek = 20, tras-rek = 30, kar-rek = 40)

\- \*\*Compound numbers:\*\* tens + ones (e.g., dor-rek-pran = 21, tras-rek-kar = 34)

\*\*Large Numbers:\*\*

\- \*\*100\*\* - sent (hundred, from Latin \*centum\*)

\- \*\*1,000\*\* - kil (thousand, from Greek \*chilioi\*)

\- \*\*1,000,000\*\* - milon (million)

\- \*\*1,000,000,000\*\* - bilon (billion)

\*\*Examples:\*\*

\- 456 = kar-sent-lim-rek-shes (4-hundred-5-tens-6)

\- 2,000 = dor-kil (2-thousand)

\- 3.5 million = tras-milon-lim-sent-kil (3-million-5-hundred-thousand)

\*\*Cultural Note:\*\* The internet is called \*\*Net\*\* in Kuma because it was widely adopted during Nettar (the seventh month) and represents the seventh major era of communication technology. This historical coincidence made ""seven"" synonymous with ""the network"" in Kumandan culture.

\#### Seasons

Seasons are numbered systematically using \*\*sez\*\* (season):

| Season | Kuma | Meaning |

|--------|------|---------|

| Winter | pran-sez | one-season (1st season) |

| Spring | dor-sez | two-season (2nd season) |

| Summer | tras-sez | three-season (3rd season) |

| Autumn/Fall | kar-sez | four-season (4th season) |

\- \*\*san-shakata\*\* - sunset

\- \*\*mun-pranta\*\* - moonrise

\#### Deities

\- \*\*san-taran\*\* - sun-citizen = solar deity, Creator (rules the day)

\- \*\*mun-taran\*\* - moon-citizen = lunar deity (rules the night)

\- \*\*stel-taran\*\* - star-citizen = stellar deity (rules the conjunction, transitions between day and night)

\*\*The Conjunction Deity:\*\* Since the Kumandan day begins at conjunction (when stars first become visible), \*\*stel-taran\*\* holds special significance as the deity of transitions, thresholds, beginnings and endings. Stel-taran is invoked at important life transitions and is associated with navigation, guidance, and the liminal space between day and night.

\#### The Three Daily Prayers

Traditional Kumandan religious practice centers on three daily prayers (div-shara) that structure the day:

1. \*\*San-shara\*\* (sun-prayer) - Recited \*\*after waking up\*\* in the morning

   \- A prayer to san-taran to begin the day

   \- Obligatory upon waking

2. \*\*Stel-shara\*\* (star-prayer) - Recited \*\*at the midday meal\*\*

   \- A prayer to stel-taran at the day's transition point

   \- Marks the pivot between morning and evening

   \- Universal participation regardless of age or occupation

3. \*\*Mun-shara\*\* (moon-prayer) - Recited \*\*before falling asleep\*\* at night

   \- A prayer to mun-taran to end the day

   \- Obligatory before sleep

These three prayers create the natural rhythm of Kumandan daily life and are practiced by most Kumandans who follow the traditional pantheon of the three div-taran.

\*\*Note on vocabulary sources:\*\* Kuma's core Swadesh vocabulary shows a mix of naturalistic development (a-priori forms like shum, tot, ket) and historical borrowings from regional trade languages and international vocabulary (a-posteriori forms like akwa from Latin aqua, petra from Greek). This reflects the language's development in a highland trade-route region with historical contact with multiple language families.

\## 6. Culture & Society

\### 6.1 Notable Institutions

\#### The Black Hand (Shaka-Shakal)

A private military company (zen-bel-kompani) officially registered in the Commonwealth era, though rumors suggest it predates the formation of Kumanda as a secretive guild operating in the highland passes during Kumanda-ke times. The organization is strongly associated with the Shadow birth sign (Limtar - shaka-zen), and its operatives are known for discretion, mountain expertise, and tracking skills.

The extent of the Black Hand's current operations remains unclear. While officially a legitimate security contractor, highland folk tales speak of the organization's roots as an assassins' guild that controlled mountain trade routes in pre-Commonwealth times. Some believe those born under Limtar are naturally drawn to the Black Hand's service, though the organization neither confirms nor denies this.

\*\*Cultural Note:\*\* The name ""Shaka-Shakal"" (Black Hand) is sufficient - Kumandans already understand it refers to a kompani. Adding ""kompani"" would be redundant in casual speech.

1qq2h3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kemetic/comments/1qq2h3u/accepted_the_call_of_both_thoth_and_hathor/,Accepted the call of both Thoth and Hathor.,"This is going to be very long and I apologize.

So, I have been a practicing spiritualist for most of my life though I never really felt called to any specific deity. I would acknowledge them as needed, but that's about as far as it goes.

My mother however, has always been beholden to Sekhmet. Needless to say I learned a lot about the Egyptian deities growing up and it was always my favourite subject in history class too.

  
Now, many years later, within the last couple months, I have been told by multiple people out of the blue to 'pay attention' and that someone is calling out to me. Now, this falls in line with my own experiences during that time frame. Dreams, Tarot Readings, etc, all pointing to 'utilizing wisdom' and answering a call.

  
There was a point just earlier today where I was hit with a sudden realization that gave me chills while wondering who it could be.

 Then I thought about my whole life leading up to that point.

I'm named after the moon.

I have a love of mathematics.

I love to write. To me it's more than just telling stories. I use my stories to share my wisdom of life experiences in creative ways.

Coupled with the fact that, at my mom's house, I have a particular item that is Thoth themed. That alone isn't the important part. What's important is that a couple weeks ago, I woke up craving it. Like I just absolutely NEEDED to have it in my hands.

  
So, I went home and said a prayer to Thoth and made an offering of white oak and coffee (didn't have sandalwood but white oak is important to me for reasons) and a hand written message of acceptance. I was awash with a feeling of contentment, but also like.. that feeling you get from someone who's been telling you the same thing for years and you finally heed their advice.

  
In a strange twist though, I recieved a message from someone I don't talk to a lot that said 'Thoth isn't the only caller. Look to the Eye of the Sun.'

I was very thrown off, but at this point, I'm not ignoring that kind of message so eventually I was brought to Hathor.

  
I don't regret a thing and am actually quite excited to take this step.

I was just curious what people who are more experienced think, and wondering if it's normal to be called by two deities at once.",1,1769673211.0,Kemetic,0,1.0,False
1qq2gvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qq2gvb/asked_a_guy_from_my_gym_for_coffee_trying_to/,Asked a guy from my gym for coffee. Trying to understand how men interpret this?,"Everything written here is true and has happened. I asked ChatGpt to make it consise and legible, and then made some additions in some places.

I’m a woman in my early 40s and there’s a man in his mid-30s who I’ve been seeing regularly at my gym for several months. We’re not friends, but we’re familiar. We’ve had occasional light interactions, shared some jokes in group settings such as our gym Christmas party and chatting with our trainer, and there has been consistent polite eye contact and friendliness over time. Nothing overtly flirtatious, and neither of us had directly expressed interest until recently.

Two weeks ago, as we were both leaving the gym after chatting with our trainer, I asked him directly, “Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?” He said yes, clarified that he doesn’t drink coffee but would have tea instead, smiled, said goodbye, and left. He didn’t ask for my number or suggest a time or place, and I didn’t push further since he seemed to be in a rush.

Since then, interactions at the gym have remained normal and friendly. Our workout timings matched only once in this time, where he quickly asked me how I'm doing during one of my rest times. No awkwardness, no avoidance, but also no follow-up from his side yet. I’m not planning to bring it up again, since I’ve already made my interest clear once and want to respect his space and autonomy.

I bumped into him again yesterday when leaving the gym, so just a quick hi, oh back day/chest day exchange. I understand there hasn't been an ideal time for him to move this forward, but also I can't tell if he's friend zoning me!

My question for men: when a woman asks you for coffee like this, is that generally understood as interest beyond friendship? And if a man is interested but very cautious or slow-moving, is it normal for him to take time before following up, or would most men who are interested act more decisively after saying yes?

I’m trying to understand how men typically interpret and respond to this kind of situation, not looking for validation or speculation about outcomes.

P.s. I do understand every man is different, I'm here for different perspectives.",0,1769673185.0,AskMenAdvice,39,0.5,False
1qq2glf,https://www.reddit.com/r/theBoyfriendNetflix/comments/1qq2glf/huwei_x_ryuki_fight_me/,Huwei x Ryuki. Fight Me,"Going to be frank here, I don't ship Huwei and Bomi together. Huwei has been my biased choice from the get-go. Literally the moment he entered the Green Room in Episode 1. I have been keeping most of my focus on him and what love could develop for him throughout the season. 

  
Just to quickly put to the side, I quickly grew very little interest to zero in Izaya and William's relationship. I found myself skipping a lot of scenes that were just the two of them especially towards the later episodes. It started to feel like the show became ""Izaya x William and the Boyfriends"". 

  
Anyway, back to my husband (kidding), I was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting more of the guys to lean more towards Huwei. But this is just me being subjective as I find Huwei physically and now emotionally attractive AFFF. Fast forward when Ryuki enters mid-season, I was going CRAZYYY. Why? Because I smiled when Huwei said one of his type from S1 is Shun. I friggin shipped Shun all throughout S1. So to see Ryuki with similar soft features, and when he talks, am I the only one who notices how eloquent and soft spoken he is? Including his manners and yes, the obvious touching of his face and hair which I believe is sort of a comforting mechanism when you're placed in a situation like in the show. 

  
Come to find out, Huwei has had history with Bomi and Ryuki. Bomi being much more aggressive, I would say Huwei succumbed to those advances where I want to believe Ryuki is just holding himself back due to being youngest in the group and as a late participant in the season. He probably felt and wanted to respect the spaces and relationships that had already been established and are slowly developing amongst the rest. Ughhh it just frustrates me you have no idea. 

  
One other thing, I really get frustrated with post-production when I see possible footages that weren't featured I wished to have seen. One example, in the group trip while everyone was in the bus. Huwei was friggin sitting next to Ryuki the ENTIRE trip both ways!! But instead, the focus was on William and Izaya's already established relationship (rolling my eyes). I wanted to see and hear what Huwei and Ryuki could have been talking about even if it wasn't lovey dovey. I don't care if they were talking about ducks or snowflakes. The only thing that disappointed me about Huwei is he did admit during the trip that Ryuki was in his top 3 choices of interest, yet, I did not see any actions from him to put effort in making anything possible. Of course, this is only based on observation and what the show chose to show on screen. But he could have approached and asked to speak to Ryuki and get to know him. It didn't have to be a romantic approach but because they've met each other in the past, I would have wanted to see Huwei put more actions into his words and see them also go on a date or work together in the coffee truck (sigh).

  
So now, we're nearing the last few episodes and I don't care, my heart is still with Huwei + Ryuki. Ugh it's not fair... ",0,1769673158.0,theBoyfriendNetflix,5,0.36,False

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention. 

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks. 

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire. 

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister. 

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest. 

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely 

toward the door. 

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood. 

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age. 

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page. 

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?” 

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.” 

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see. 

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’ 

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go. 

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself. 

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly. 

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at 

once. 

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.” 

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether. 

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third. 

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn- out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV. 

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark. 

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.” 

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.” 

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite. 

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month. 

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.” ",1,1769673155.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go. 

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself. 

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly. 

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at 

once. 

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.” 

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether. 

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third. 

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn- out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV. 

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark. 

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.” 

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.” 

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite. 

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month. 

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.” ",1,1769673095.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

There was this one time, I sat down for coffee with a friend. We ended up sitting saying nothing, just two friends sipping warm lattes in the comfort of each other's company. Our silence felt more personal and intimate than any conversation we'd ever had. 

This seemingly insignificant experience made me realize that silence isn't just the absence of sound, it's a language in itself. Sometimes, it communicates more than words ever can. 

So, is it strange to revel in the silence, or is it just an underappreciated form of communication?",3,1769673086.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention. 

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks. 

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire. 

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister. 

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest. 

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely 

toward the door. 

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood. 

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age. 

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page. 

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?” 

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.” 

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see. 

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’

We've talked a few times - she's from Nicaragua, works as a cs manager at Walmart US, and seems very traditional/conservative.

I've asked her out twice - once for coffee, once for lunch. Both times she politely declined saying ""I can't, you're a stranger"" and explained her culture doesn't allow her to meet men one-on-one like that.

Here's the thing: I genuinely just want to be friends. I'm not pushing for romance (though I'm open if it naturally happens). I respect her culture - I'm from a traditional Asian background myself, so I understand family honor and reputation matter.

But I feel like we could have a good friendship. She reminds me of my own family - similar values, conservative, traditional. I want to help mentor her (she has a lot of potential) and just be a good friend in her life. (I know I'll be made fun, but I don't have anyone to share my feelings!)

**My question:** Is there a respectful way to ask her again, maybe frame it differently? Or should I just accept her boundary and move on?

Hey zusammen,

ich schreibe gerade an einem Mystery/Thriller mit 80er-Atmosphäre (Kleinstadt, geheime Militärprojekte, Jugendliche, düstere Entdeckungen).

Das hier ist ein Auszug aus Kapitel 5. Zwei Männer treffen sich nachts in einem Diner und sprechen über etwas, das es offiziell nicht geben dürfte.

Mich interessiert vor allem:

– Trägt der Dialog?

– Baut sich Spannung auf?

– Würdet ihr weiterlesen?

Auszug:

Kapitel 5

Gute Mine zum bösen Spiel

„Some of the most important conversations in life happen over coffee at 2 a.m.“

Eine Woche zuvor

Irgendwo am Rand der Stadt, in einem Diner.

Es roch nach Sirup und Pancakes. Im Radio lief Kenny Rogers – We’ve Got the Night.

Hinter dem Tresen schenkte Paula, eine abgehalfterte Kellnerin, gerade Kaffee nach.

Walther hob kurz die Hand. „Paula, Liebes.“

„Moment, bin gleich da“, sagte sie mit verrauchter Stimme. Diese Lady hat gelebt, dachte er und wandte sich wieder Ed zu.

„Und? Gibt’s was Neues? Wie war die Schicht?“, grinste er.

„Hör auf so doof zu grinsen. Fachangestellte und Akademiker – und die Toiletten sehen schlimmer aus als in jedem Affenhaus.“

Er nahm einen Schluck Kaffee. „Ich hab das Gefühl, die Angestellten drehen langsam durch. Aber am meisten macht mir der Affe in Uniform Angst.“

„Du meinst den Colonel.“

„Angst? Niemals. Ein Silberrücken, der Befehle befolgt. Genau der Richtige, um die Horde Affen zu leiten.“

Paula kam an den Tisch, Block und Stift gezückt. „Jungs, was darf’s sein?“

Ed überlegte kurz. „Ich nehm das Übliche.“

„Alles klar. Einmal Royal Brunch.“

Sie sah Walther an. „Und für dich?“

„Kannst du mir eines deiner weltbesten Clubsandwiches machen?“

Sie nickte routiniert. „Noch Kaffee?“

Beide schüttelten den Kopf.

Als sie außer Hörweite war, beugte sich Ed wieder zu Walther.

„Es wird schlimmer. Und dieser Chinese … ich hab ihn beobachtet. Nicht nur, dass er innerhalb von ein paar Monaten eine komplette Wesensveränderung durchgemacht hat – ich hatte das Gefühl, dass er etwas zu verbergen hat.“

Er lehnte sich noch näher zu Walther und flüsterte:

„Also bin ich ihm gefolgt. Unauffällig, natürlich …“

Er nahm einen Schluck Kaffee, warf einen Blick zum Tresen.

Paula war in eine Zeitschrift vertieft. Besser Wohnen stand auf dem Cover.

Dann sah Ed Walther direkt an.

„Walther … da ist was im Keller.“

„Keller?“, fragte Walther und runzelte die Stirn. „Was für ein Keller?“

Ed sprach hastig weiter.

„In den Bauplänen und den Sicherheitsunterlagen ist kein Keller verzeichnet. Aber ich bin ihm in ein angebliches Büro gefolgt. Normale Tür, normaler Raumname. Doch als er den Raum betrat, konnte ich einen Blick erhaschen – da war eine Treppe nach unten. Und bevor die Tür zufiel …“

Er schluckte.

„… habe ich ein Brüllen gehört.“

Walther starrte ihn an.

„Ein Brüllen, das mir das Blut in den Adern gefrieren ließ“, sagte Ed leise.

„Ich habe so etwas noch nie gehört. Und du weißt, der Typ ist irre. Einer, der über Leichen geht.“",2,1769672425.0,Schreibkunst,0,1.0,False

I’m not really ready to start a relationship yet. Just looking for someone cute / pretty to consistently chat or flirt with, send updates. If you’re into voice calls, too, that’d be great.

About me:

Music: I’m mainly a YTube Musci person: Been getting into house music and guitar meditations.

Interests: Video games and card games (I grew up to YGO!). Magic: The Gathering. Computers and anti-GenAI trends. News on tech, industry, and utilities. I enjoy meal prepping sometimes. Tocilog supremacy. Watermelons are my fave fruit. Walks a lot and wishes Metro Manila would be more commuter friendly. Minty lattes and other dark-colored drinks. I’m avoiding pork now but I’d indulge in some burgers if I’m not cooking for myself.

Series: Parks and Recreation. Used to watch SNL a lot and its old skits. I’m hoping to get more into sci-fi and high fantasy, so looking forward to start on Samurai Jack and LotR.

Trivia about me: I almost d!ed on a field work as an engineer, because some island dogs cornered me. Overcame my fear of dogs and I’m comfortable with them now.



About you:

Age: -4 / +5

Petite to mid-size (Just a preference).

Knows how to converse well, na may saktong energy / kulit lang to chat.

Passionate about something outside of their work (A hobby? Advocacy work?)

1qq23le,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qq23le,"My 5-Year-Old Says Dad WILL Cheat—Dumped That Scumbag, Rewrote Our Fate, Girls Thriving Now","Mom, stop being the perfect wife. I'll take care of you.""


My five-year-old squeezed my hand tight.


Everyone said I hit the jackpot—great husband, cute daughter, perfect life.


But Emma? ""Dad's gonna cheat.""


I laughed it off until his ""little sister"" moved in.


Wore my pajamas. Raided my skincare. Acted like she owned the place.


2 a.m. Emma shook me awake.


""Mom, why do you even want him anymore?""


My stomach dropped. ""What?""


She let out this long, tired sigh.


""Last time, I lived to twenty-five. I watched you swallow everything.""


She looked straight into my eyes.


""This time, leave him. Before he destroys you again.""


My five-year-old told me her dad was cheating.


Emma walked in, dumped her backpack, marched right up to me.


""Mom. Dad's screwing around.""


I kept wiping the counter.


""Emma, don't—""


""I saw him."" She climbed onto the stool. ""At the mall. Holding hands with some chick. Long hair, white dress. The whole thing.""


I threw the rag in the sink.


""You're wrong.""


""I'm not."" She looked right at me. ""Mom, just cry. You'll feel better.""


I laughed. ""You've been binge-watching too many soap operas, haven't you? kiddo.""


She grabbed my hand.


""I'm not a kid."" She said, slowly and clearly. ""I came back from eighteen years in the future.""


Slience.


""You die in eighteen years."" Her eyes flooded. ""Cancer. Stage four. Dad remarries three months later.""


The light flickered.


""I didn't cry at your funeral."" She wiped her face. ""Grandma said I was heartless. But those last six months when you couldn't sleep? Nobody cared then either.""


I stumbled back. Hit the fridge.


""Stop cooking for him."" She wrapped her arms around my leg. ""He treats your food like garbage.""


I wanted to say that's not true.


But last Wednesday flashed through my head. Honey garlic ribs—his favorite. He'd picked at them like they were poisoned. Too dry. Too sweet. Overcooked.


""Come with me."" Emma looked up. ""I'll take care of you.""


""You're five—""


""I'm twenty-three. VP at Goldman. I can buy us a house.""


I dropped to my knees. Those weren't a kid's eyes.


""Why come back?""


""Because I missed you."" Her voice cracked. ""Every day for eighteen years.""


Her hand touched my cheek.


""He doesn't deserve you. We didn't either. You destroyed yourself for us and we still turned out like shit.""


Keys rattled outside.


Emma's face changed. She grabbed a picture book. By the time Ryan walked in, she was pointing at a cartoon bunny.


""Mommy! Look at his cute little ears!""


Ryan dropped his briefcase. ""Where's dinner?""


Emma bounced over. ""Daddy! Can we get pizza? Please?""


He frowned. ""What's wrong now?""


""Nothing! I just really want pizza!"" Big smile. ""We eat Mommy's cooking every day!""


Ryan looked at me. ""You sick?""


Seven years I'd been staring at this face. Now all I saw were frown lines. Eyes that slid right past me.


""Migraine.""


""Fine. Order something."" He loosened his tie. ""Got a call in thirty.""


He disappeared into his office.


Emma grabbed my hand.


""Let's change your clothes.""


""What?""


""The red dress."" She dragged me toward the bedroom. ""You wore it once. My fifth birthday.""


The red dress was buried in my closet. Anniversary gift. Ryan said it was too loud.


Emma yanked it out.


""Put it on.""


""Why?""


""For me."" Dead serious. ""Mom, you're twenty-nine. Not dead yet.""


I changed. The mirror showed a stranger—yellow skin, dark circles.


Emma climbed onto the vanity. Grabbed my lipstick.


""This one."" She opened it. ""Wear it.""


I did.


She grabbed my foundation like she'd done this a million times.


Dusted powder on my cheeks. Fixed my brows. Every move was confident.


""You're gonna be hot as hell one day."" She tilted her head, studying me. ""Way hotter than this. People will line up for you. This one guy who owns an art gallery? He'll chase you for three years straight.""


My heart skipped. ""How could you possibly—""


""I've lived it."" She put down the brush. ""Before this timeline, I was in another one. You didn't die there.""


She looked straight at me.


""You left Dad. Opened a bakery. Dressed like a goddamn queen every day. At fifty, you learned to scuba dive. Your Instagram was fire.""


She hopped down. Grabbed my hand.


""Every time I saw that version of you, I bawled my eyes out."" Her voice cracked. ""Because she wasn't my mom. My mom died at twenty-nine telling me not to forget the oatmeal on the stove.""


She shoved the door open.


Ryan was coming out of his office. He stopped cold.


""What the hell are you—"" His eyes went wide. ""Why are you dressed like that?""


Emma bounced over. ""We're going out! You order your own food, Daddy! We're getting steak!""


She yanked me toward the door.


""Sarah!"" Ryan's voice cracked behind us.


I didn't look back.


Emma unlocked the door, shoved me through, squeezed out, kicked it shut.


The hallway light flickered on.


She pulled me down the stairs. Two at a time. Her little legs flying.


We burst outside. Cold air hit my face.


She stopped under the streetlight. Breathing hard. Grinning up at me.


""Mom."" She squeezed my hands. ""From now on? I've got you.""


I stared at this tiny girl with ancient eyes.


Maybe I really had died once.


Maybe this was my do-over.


Chapter 2


Dinner cost three hundred bucks.


Emma sat across from me, cutting her steak like a pro. She even ordered wine. The waiter looked at her like she was insane.


""Kids can't drink.""


""It's for my mom."" She didn't blink. ""She needs it.""


The wine came. She poured me a glass. ""Drink up. When's the last time you had a drink?""


I tried to think.


Nothing.


Wedding day, maybe. The toast. Ryan said I couldn't handle alcohol. Told me to stop. So I did.


I took a sip. Tasted like regret.


Emma watched me. ""Remember when I was three? The amusement park?""


""Yeah.""


""Dad ditched us last minute. Work emergency."" She cut her steak. Knife scraped porcelain. ""You did everything alone. Carousel. Cotton candy. Carried me two miles to find a bathroom. I fell asleep on your shoulder. Your arm was wrecked for a week.""


I remembered.


Ryan never showed. Said he had a VIP client. Got home at ten smelling like perfume. I asked about it. He said I was crazy. Said it was the client's perfume.


""I promised myself then—"" She chewed slowly. ""When I grow up, Mom's never working this hard again.""


She swallowed. Met my eyes. ""But you were dead by the time I grew up.""


Around us—laughter, couples feeding each other, kids screaming.


Our table was a graveyard.


""Mom."" She put down her fork. ""Divorce him.""


Silence.


""The house, car, savings—take it all. He's got the company, the stocks. You're his wife. That's half yours."" Her voice went flat. Clinical. ""I know you're soft. Don't be. Last time you took nothing but us kids. He dragged his ass on child support for years.""


I stared at her.


Five-year-old face. Dead serious eyes.


""How do you know this?""


""Your diary."" No hesitation. ""Found it after you died. Bottom of your closet. Cracked plastic cover. You wrote everything. Wedding day to diagnosis day.""


She stopped. Dropped her voice. ""Last page said: 'Biggest regret—gave everything away, kept nothing for myself.'""


My hands shook.


She grabbed them across the table.


""This time's different."" Her grip was steel. ""I'm here. I know his games. I know Grandma's bullshit. I know how to get evidence, hire lawyers.""


She squeezed harder.


""Trust me. Just once.""


I looked at her forever.


Then I said it.


""Okay.""


She grinned. Finally looked five again.


Chapter 3


We got home at ten.


Living room blazing. Ryan on the couch, ashtray full of cigarette butts.


""Look who decided to show up."" His voice was pure acid.


Emma stepped between us. ""We went to dinner!""


""Was I talking to you?"" He stood up fast. Pointed at me. ""Sarah, what the hell is this? No dinner, kid's out of control, and you're dressed like a hooker?""


""Watch it."" Emma's voice went sharp.


I couldn't move.


Emma grabbed my hand. ""Mom. Shower. Now. I've got this.""


""Emma—""


""GO."" She pushed me.


I went.


Hot water pounded down. Voices exploded outside.


""Dad. We need to talk.""


""I don't take orders from a five-year-old!""


""Then listen—I know about the woman in the white dress."" Calm as death. ""Got pictures. Want to see?""


Silence.


Then Ryan's voice cracked. ""What are you—""


""Mall. Third floor. Coffee shop. Yesterday at four."" She didn't stop. ""She was all over you. You bought her a necklace. Thirty-eight hundred. Receipt's in your jacket. Should I go get it?""


I turned off the water. Pressed my ear to the door.


Ryan sounded scared. ""Did your mother—""


""Mom knows NOTHING."" Emma's voice climbed. ""She's still defending you! 'Oh, he's tired. Oh, he would never.' But I'm not blind!""


""EMMA!""


""Keep your voice down, Mom's showering!"" Her voice stayed flat. ""I'm not here to fight. I'm telling you how this goes. You want to cheat? Fine. Keep it away from us. You want to bring your girlfriends home? Divorce first. Split everything. Then do whatever you want.""


Lighter clicked. More smoke.


""Your mother put you up to this—""


""Mom doesn't know anything!"" Emma exploded. ""She's making excuses for you right now! But I SAW you! Last Wednesday? Your 'work emergency'? You took that bitch to the movies. Back row. Making out while Mom reheated your soup three times.""


Nothing.


I yanked the door open.


Ryan went white. Emma ran to me, palm sweating.


""Mom! Done already?""


I looked at Ryan. ""Is it true?""


He reached for me. ""Sarah, just listen—""


""True or false.""


His mouth opened. Nothing.


I stared at him.


Seven years. Seven years I gave him everything. Every meal, every shirt, his kid, his parents. When his company was dying, I gave him my wedding money—every cent my parents saved. He said quit your job. I quit. Threw away my career.


For what? So he could ""blow off steam""?


""Ryan."" My voice came out dead. ""Let’s get divorced.""


He stumbled back.


Emma's hand gripped mine hard.


""What did you say?""


""Divorced."" I stepped forward. ""House—split. Car—split. Savings—split. Company shares—I want half. Emma's mine. You pay child support.""


Ryan stared like I'd lost my mind. ""Are you insane? Do you know what my company's worth? You want half? You can't even run a business!""


""No."" I smiled cold. ""But my lawyer can.""


His face went dark.


""Dad."" Emma cut in. ""You don't agree? I send everything to your company chat. Your phone syncs to your work computer. I know the passwords. I can get in.""


Ryan's head snapped to her. Eyes wild. ""You little bitch—""


""I'm five!"" Emma screamed. ""Can't even go to jail! What are you gonna do? Hit me? TRY IT!""


His hand shot up—


I jumped in front of Emma.


""TOUCH HER. I FUCKING DARE YOU.""


His hand froze.


We stood there. Breathing hard. Clock ticking like bombs.


Ryan dropped his hand. Ripped his tie loose. ""Fine. You want war, Sarah? You got it.""


He grabbed his keys. Slammed the door. A picture crashed off the wall.


My legs gave out. I hit the couch.


Emma caught me. ""Mom!""


I grabbed her. ""Those photos—did you really—""


""I lied."" She grinned wild. ""I don't even have a phone! Made it all up!""


""But the mall—""


""That was real. Just no pictures."" She bounced. ""You gotta be meaner than them, Mom! You go soft, they destroy you!""


I pulled her close. Shaking all over.


""Emma."" My voice breaking. ""Last time... was I—""


""Don't."" She pressed into my neck. ""Don't ask.""


We sat forever.


Finally she whispered—


""Not this time, Mom.""


""I promise.""


Next morning, Ryan didn't come home.


Emma got up, heated milk, toasted bread, fried me an egg.


""Mom. Breakfast."" She carried the plate to my bed.


I stared at the egg. Perfect shape. Edges crispy and golden.


""When did you learn to cook?""


""Last life."" She climbed onto the bed next to me. ""When you got sick. After you died, I had to feed my brother.""


She took a bite of toast. Chewed slowly.


Something clicked. ""Wait—your brother. Where is he?""


""Daycare."" She swallowed. ""It's Friday. We pick him up this afternoon. Mom, you need to see a lawyer today. Before Dad figures out his next move.""


I sat up. ""That fast?""


""That fast."" She nodded hard. ""He's gonna run to that woman right now. They'll plan something. By the time they're done, you're screwed.""


She hopped down. Dug through her tiny backpack. Pulled out a folded paper.


""Best divorce lawyer in the city. Her name's Morrison. She's a woman. Destroys guys like Dad for a living. Go see her. Tell her I sent you.""


I took the paper. Name and number written in careful print.


""How did you—""


""Did my homework before I came back."" She grinned. ""Mom, your daughter's pretty badass.""


I looked at her smiling face.


That last bit of doubt in my chest vanished.


""Okay."" I said. ""I'll go.""

Usually just a stalker and fan of this subreddit, but thought I’d give it a go making a post on here. My car was broken into around 10pm tonight (Jan 28th) on Red Bluff Rd. And they stole my black backpack. It super sucks, but the backpack didn’t have too much in it, just some sweaty gym clothes, an old beaten down laptop, and my AirPods. Which I was able to hunt down on find about a mile away where they had been tossed on the side of the road with no headphones. 

The one really annoying thing is my retainer was in the bag. So super shot in the dark but if anyone who lives on the Eastside near Pleasant Valley Rd or off E Cesar Chavez St, finds a black backpack with a red stripe and a gross retainer in it, that would be mine. I’m just a broke 25 year old but would love to take you to coffee as a thank you.

1qq20ug,https://i.redd.it/3oocris5q8gg1.jpeg,Three Days to End My Marriage,"
Chapter 1
The elite of Houston all knew that the second son of the Crawford family, Merrick Crawford, had offered an astonishing 1.6 billion dollars to marry his girlfriend, Priscilla Burnett.
On what should have been her wedding night, Priscilla, expecting to see the man she loved, found herself facing his older brother instead—Garrett Crawford, who had been confined to a wheelchair for six years.
Five years passed. Priscilla drowned in the sea while trying to recover a lost ring for Garrett.
In her final moments, the Grim Reaper told her, ""Your marriage was never consummated. The path ahead is closed to you. Sever the tie within three days. After that, you may proceed.""
\*\*\*
Priscilla returned to the Crawford's villa, her body battered and soaked through.
She clutched a diamond ring tightly in her hand.
Entering her room, she saw her husband, Garrett, seated in his wheelchair, dressed in a finely tailored dark suit.
He ignored her disheveled appearance, his voice cool as he inquired, ""Did you find it?""
Priscilla handed him the ring.
""Don't lose it again.""
She couldn't go searching for him anymore.
A flicker of something unrecognizable passed through Garrett's eyes at the sight of the ring, yet his words were curt. ""You were slow.
""Go kneel in the chapel.""
Priscilla was accustomed to his mercurial temperament. She simply fetched a blanket and carefully draped it over his legs.
""All right. I'll go in a moment.
""It's getting colder now. Don't catch a cold when you go out.""
A car accident eleven years ago had damaged Garrett's legs, abruptly ending the promising future of the family's golden boy and leaving him wheelchair-bound.
His health had never fully recovered, leaving him vulnerable to illness.
Her concern drew a scornful laugh from him. ""Five years of this charade. Doesn't it wear on you?
""It's my brother you love, yet you play the devoted wife for the world to see.
""It's disgusting.""
Priscilla wasn't angry. ""You should rest. I'm going to the chapel.""
She turned and left without another word.
Watching her slender, retreating figure, Garrett finally registered that she was soaked through.
He frowned slightly and summoned a maid. ""Have the floors cleaned wherever she walked.""
His gaze fell to the blanket on his lap.
""And dispose of this.""
\*\*\*
On her knees in the Crawford family's small chapel, Priscilla felt cold to her core. Her eyes were fixed on the somber pictures of the family's ancestors.
""So it was true. There is an afterlife,"" she thought.
She had drowned while searching the sea for Garrett's ring. The Grim Reaper told her, ""Your marriage was never consummated. The path ahead is closed to you.
""Sever the tie within three days. After that, you may proceed.""
Her options were stark: consummate her marriage with Garrett or divorce him. Only then would her soul find rest.
But Garrett felt nothing for her but disgust. Affection was out of the question.
Five years ago, the Burnett family was drowning in debt, pursued relentlessly by creditors.
Then Merrick—Garrett's younger brother, and also a celebrated racing driver—had arrived with an offer: 1.6 billion dollars for her hand.
On her wedding night, the deception was revealed.
The man waiting was not Merrick, her boyfriend of three months, but his older brother, Garrett, who had lived with paralysis for six years.
Garrett's hatred for her was rooted in her past romantic relationship with Merrick.
When Priscilla sought a divorce from the Crawford family, Merrick warned, ""Divorce Rett if you wish. Just return the 1.6 billion dollars.""
But her mother and brother had already used the money to settle their debts. Repayment was impossible.
Seeing her helplessness, Merrick had laid down her new duty.
""You're part of the family now. Your role is to care for Rett.
""Our family will manage the Burnett family's affairs.""
For her family's survival, she forced down her bitterness about the deception. Tending to Garrett became her duty—the only way to settle the immense financial obligation of 1.6 billion dollars.
Somewhere along the way, her feelings for Garrett had begun to change...
Just then, a maid's voice carried from the hallway.
""Welcome home, Mr. Merrick.""
Merrick's voice, tinged with happiness, followed. ""Mm.
""Cara and I are to be married soon. Replace all the flowers with the roses she loves.""
Caroline Murphy was the cherished heiress of the powerful Murphy Group.
She was not only Merrick's fiancée, but also Garrett's ex-girlfriend.
Chapter 2
The staff murmured their assent.
Once Merrick was gone, their hushed conversations resumed.
""Caroline is a piece of work. Engaged to marry Mr. Garrett, then she breaks it off after his accident.
""She's set to marry Mr. Merrick.
""Both brothers fell for her...""
Someone sighed softly. ""Poor Priscilla.
""I heard Mr. Garrett made her search for a ring—the very one he used to propose to Caroline.""
A sharp pang shot through Priscilla's heart when she heard their conversation.
She had long known that Garrett's true love was Caroline, and she knew the profound significance that ring held for him.
That was precisely why she had risked her life to retrieve it for him, never imagining it would cost her own.
Priscilla knelt in the cold chapel all night. Soaked through, she felt no chill.
Early the next morning, she rose stiffly.
It took her a long moment to steady herself before she could walk, trembling, out of the chapel.
Once outside, she saw her mother, Monica Burnett, standing in the courtyard as if she had been waiting.
""Mom, what brings you here?""
Seeing her daughter's disheveled hair and wrinkled, soaked clothes, Monica frowned.
""You look nothing like a young lady of the Crawford family.""
Priscilla lowered her gaze and explained, ""I searched for a ring for Rett yesterday and accidentally fell into the sea...""
She wanted to tell her mother about her own death, but Monica cut her off.
""I came today because I need your help with your brother.
""His investments failed again. We've already mortgaged the family company. You must ask Rett for help.""
Priscilla hesitated before finally voicing the thought that had taken root.
""Mom, I want a divorce from Garrett.""
Monica stared at her, momentarily speechless.
Then her expression hardened. ""Don't be absurd!
""A divorced woman? Who would marry you then?
""And what would become of our family without the Crawford family?""
Priscilla's heart constricted. ""What if I said I'm dying, Mom?""
Monica dismissed the notion outright.
""If you die, you die as his wife!""
Then, with a final statement, she turned and walked away.
""I have to go. Remember what I said about helping your brother.""
Priscilla stood for a long time, watching her mother leave, before finally returning to her room.
Once there, she took a hot shower.
Even immersed in the steaming water, she felt no warmth.
Her blood no longer flowed, her skin deathly pale. She applied heavy rouge after bathing to make her look normal.
When she was finished, she retrieved the document from a drawer—prepared long ago for this moment.
She made her way to the study.
Garrett was seated behind the desk, reviewing documents.
He glanced up as she entered. ""Here to ask for more money for your brother, I suppose.""
Priscilla was momentarily speechless.
Before she could respond, he continued, his voice laced with scorn, ""Tell me, did I marry you, or your entire family?""
Steeling herself, Priscilla explained, ""You're mistaken. I need you to sign a document.""
She placed it gently on the desk before him.
Garrett's gaze fell upon the bold text printed on the cover: Divorce Agreement.
Chapter 3
A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. In five years of marriage, this was only the second time Priscilla had mentioned divorce.
The first time, she couldn't produce the 1.6 billion dollars, so she had to let it go.
Now she dared to bring it up again.
Garrett couldn't help a cold laugh. ""Using divorce to threaten me for money?""
Without waiting for her reply, he tossed the divorce agreement into the wastebasket.
""You chose to marry a cripple for money. Now you get to live with that choice for the rest of your life.
""Get out.""
Priscilla instinctively took a few steps back. When Garrett was angry, he refused to listen to anything.
Discussing divorce was impossible now.
""We'll talk when you've calmed down,"" she said.
With that, she turned and left.
Leaving the study, Priscilla quietly closed the door behind her, only to turn and bump into a solid chest.
She looked up and saw Merrick's defiantly handsome face.
Dressed in his red-and-white racing suit, Merrick instinctively took a step back, putting distance between them.
""Priscilla.""
Priscilla was about to respond when she noticed Caroline standing behind him, wrapped in a crimson coat.
She was radiant. With her impeccable makeup and rare, high-end jewelry, Caroline carried herself with elegance and wealth.
""Ms. Burnett, it's been a while.
""You look terribly worn out.""
Her eyes swept over Priscilla, filled with pity.
In the past five years, Priscilla and Caroline had crossed paths many times, but Caroline never addressed her as ""Mrs. Crawford"", always sticking to ""Ms. Burnett"".
""I haven't been sleeping well lately,"" Priscilla replied calmly.
""I have things to attend to. Excuse me.""
She hadn't gone far when Caroline's voice, faint yet clear, carried from behind. ""Don't forget, she became Rett's wife through a transaction you facilitated.
""But she looks so pitiful...""
Their voices gradually faded away.
A self-mocking smile touched Priscilla's lips as she continued toward the main living room.
Upon entering, she saw her mother-in-law, Chloe Crawford.
In an elegant dark dress, she was trimming rose stems and arranging them in a vase.
Chloe's expression cooled the moment she noticed Priscilla.
""Cara and Rick will discuss their wedding plans over lunch today. As the eldest daughter-in-law of this family, must you present yourself like this?
""You're deathly pale. Who are you trying to impress?""
Without waiting for a response, Chloe looked at Priscilla's flat stomach.
""Five years, and still no sign of a child. Did we spend 1.6 billion dollars to bring a decorative piece into this house?""
A bitter taste rose in Priscilla's throat.
""Chloe, the truth is, Rett and I have never been intimate in these five years.""
Chloe was visibly startled, her words catching in her throat.
""Could it be that Rett is...""
Priscilla understood her mother-in-law's unspoken suspicion and shook her head.
""Rett is perfectly healthy. He simply doesn't want me.""
She continued, ""Chloe, I want to divorce him. Can you help me?""
Chloe's brow furrowed deeply as she studied Priscilla.
The woman looked ghostly pale and frighteningly thin, as if a strong gust could topple her—hardly the picture of a woman fit for motherhood.
Yet she seemed skeptical. ""Do you truly wish to divorce Rett? Your family would actually give up the Crawford family's backing?""
Priscilla nodded.
""You're a woman too. You must understand what it's like to live as a wife in name only for five years.""
The moment the words left her mouth, Chloe laughed.
""Who would have thought that behind that gentle, virtuous facade, you're so desperate.
""If you're that desperate for a man, fine. I agree. I'll see to it that you get your divorce.""
Priscilla ignored the scorn in her mother-in-law's words, relieved only by the promise.
This lifetime had brought her only misery.
Once she divorced Garrett, she could finally find peace.
Chapter 4
Soon, the luncheon began.
It was then that Priscilla fully understood the stark difference between people.
She, the so-called eldest daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, and Caroline, the soon-to-be second daughter-in-law, were treated worlds apart.
Seated beside Garrett, Priscilla watched as Chloe—who never did any domestic chores—personally sliced fruit for Caroline.
She watched as her father-in-law, who had seldom spoken to her in five years, instructed the staff to place all of Caroline's favorite dishes before her.
Merrick peeled shrimps for Caroline.
Even Garrett's gaze remained fixed on Caroline throughout.
For the first time, Priscilla learned what it truly meant to be a cherished daughter-in-law in the Crawford family.
The agonizing luncheon finally ended two hours later.
As usual, Priscilla wheeled Garrett to his study for a video conference with the Crawford Group's senior executives.
Once in the study, as she helped him transfer from his wheelchair, his hand accidentally brushed against hers.
He paused.
""Your hands are freezing.""
Priscilla was momentarily taken aback. ""I guess what I'm wearing isn't thick enough.""
At her words, Garrett withdrew his hand, his usual detached manner returning instantly.
""My meeting is about to start. You may go.""
""Alright.""
Priscilla turned and left the room.
Garrett disliked being interrupted while working. As always, she waited outside the door, staring out at the snow that had begun falling quietly at some point.
Though she barely felt the chill, she instinctively wrapped her clothes a little tighter.
For a moment just now, she had almost believed Garrett was showing concern for her.
Suddenly, laughter drifted up to her.
She glanced out the window.
Down below, Caroline had her arm through Merrick's, the two of them admiring the snowfall.
""Rick, enjoying the first snowfall with you at your home means we're meant to grow old together,"" Caroline said.
Merrick had always been cavalier, yet this simple statement brought a deep blush that crept from his ears to his neck.
""We will,"" he answered, his voice uncharacteristically shy.
Priscilla had never seen Merrick blush before.
Five years ago, before she married Garrett, Merrick had pursued her with relentless intensity.
He'd skipped a major race he'd trained six months for, just to go shopping with her.
He'd confessed his feelings for her on live television after winning a championship.
Sweet words flowed effortlessly from him when they were together.
But he'd never blushed.
It seemed a man only grew truly shy around the woman he genuinely loved.
Just then, Caroline's voice pulled Priscilla from her thoughts.
""But I'm feeling a bit nervous.
""Priscilla is so capable. I worry I won't live up to that, and you'll all slowly start to dislike me.""
Merrick laughed fondly and drew her into an embrace.
""You and Priscilla aren't the same.
""She came into our family as part of an arrangement to look after Rett. You're joining us because you're loved and wanted.""
Reassured, Caroline nestled into Merrick's arms, and they stood quietly watching the snow.
Priscilla couldn't quite define the ache in her chest.
Although Merrick stated a simple fact, hearing it aloud left her feeling unsettled.
At four-thirty in the afternoon, Priscilla went to the kitchen.
Every day at five o'clock sharp, Garrett required a cup of Americano, brewed by her personally.
Though he disliked her, he enjoyed the coffee she prepared.
Today was almost over, leaving her with only one day remaining. After that, she would no longer make coffee for Garrett.
She jotted the coffee-making steps on a sticky note and attached it to the machine.
Then, she found herself adding a second note.
""Helps you focus, but rest is important too.""
Putting the pen down, she placed this note beside the coffee mug.
Once the coffee was ready, Priscilla checked the clock: 4:50.
Her limbs stiff, she carried the mug to the study.
The door stood partly open.
Caroline's words reached her clearly. ""Rett, my wedding to Rick is in two days. I don't want to marry him. If you can divorce her, I'll back out today.""
Chapter 5
Priscilla froze in place.
Caroline and Merrick had just been sharing a sweet moment in the snow...
Yet, she needed to hear Garrett's response.
Through the gap in the door, she saw a rare flicker of anger in Garrett's usually impassive eyes.
""Caroline, what game are you playing with Rick and me?
""You broke off the engagement the minute I was injured. Priscilla stayed.
""I'm not divorcing her. You should go.""
Caroline wasn't ready to yield.
""Did you know my parents made me break it off?
""I tried everything to fight them—refusing to eat, hurting myself. Nothing made a difference.""
She paused before continuing, ""Everyone knows Priscilla's brother burns through money. She only stuck around for your family's wealth.""
Garrett said nothing, as if accepting the statement.
At her explanation, his face lost some of its earlier severity.
Then Caroline asked, ""If you won't divorce her, is it because you love her?""
""I never loved her.""
Garrett's answer came instantly, without hesitation.
At the words, Priscilla's hand trembled, making the cup rattle on its tray.
The door swung open immediately.
Caroline went pale seeing her.
""How long have you been standing there?""
Priscilla pushed down the swell of emotion inside. ""Since you asked him to divorce me.""
Hearing that, Caroline dropped all pretense of politeness. Her parting words were a direct order.
""Don't you dare repeat any of this.""
Once Caroline was gone, Priscilla stepped into the study.
She placed the tray down and handed the coffee to Garrett.
""Your coffee, Rett.""
Garrett knocked the cup over. ""Did you make a habit of eavesdropping?""
It hit the floor with a sharp crack, shattering.
Hot liquid splashed over Priscilla's hands and clothes, her skin reddening.
She felt no pain, only murmured, ""I'm sorry. It won't happen again.""
Then she bent to pick up the broken pieces.
At that moment, Garrett threw a blank check onto the floor in front of her.
""Write whatever your brother needs.
""I don't want a single word about this getting out.""
The sight of the blank check struck Priscilla as deeply ironic.
""Is this for my silence?""
""Think whatever you want,"" Garrett said, his voice icy.
Priscilla looked down. For a second, when Garrett spoke of her staying by his side, she had actually thought he recognized her loyalty.
But it was just to get a reaction from Caroline.
Priscilla stayed quiet, focusing on cleaning the spill.
Then, dark blood began to drip from her nose. She wiped at it with the back of her hand, but it kept coming.
She had no choice but to take the check and go back to her room.
In the room, as Priscilla was cleaning the blood from her face, she heard the door open.
""It's done. You and Rett are legally separated.""
Chloe's voice came from behind her.
Priscilla turned. Chloe held out a formal document.
It was a divorce certificate.
Five years ago, the Crawford family had obtained the marriage licenses for her and Garrett without either of them needing to be present.
They had ended it the same way.
Seeing her silence, Chloe spoke again, mistaking it for regret.
""When do you intend to leave?""
Priscilla gathered herself. ""Tonight.""
Tomorrow, she would be gone for good...
Chapter 6
Chloe gave a cold laugh. ""In such a rush. Your family isn't just social climbers—the women in your family seem absolutely desperate to land a man.""
She continued, ""Go if you must, but Rett doesn't hear a word about this until the wedding is over.
""I don't want your presence putting a damper on our family's happiness.
""And once you leave, stay away from us. For good.""
With that final remark, Chloe left.
Priscilla put the certificate away and, as usual, saw to Garrett's dinner.
Heavy snow fell outside. Instead of their walk in the gardens as usual, Priscilla helped him back to his room early.
When he was ready to retire, Priscilla assisted him to bed.
But after two days, her body was stiff and unresponsive.
As Garrett lay back, she lost her balance and fell against him.
For a moment, she seemed to hear the sound of his heartbeat.
The subtle, clean scent of his skin surrounded her.
""Sorry.""
Priscilla pulled away quickly, her fingers stiff and awkward as she tried to smooth his clothes.
Garrett noticed her clumsiness and frowned.
""Five years, and you still can't manage this properly?""
The words left Priscilla momentarily disoriented.
""Five years, yes...""
She heard herself ask, ""There's something I've always wanted to know.""
""What?"" Garrett's tone was flat.
Priscilla looked directly at him and asked, ""Did you ever love me a little?""
Silence hung in the air.
Garrett met her gaze, then looked away.
""Never.""
She had expected that.
A faint smile touched her lips. Her hand, resting on his chest, moved to undo the buttons of his pajama tops.
""Since you never truly cared for me, just be with me tonight.""
Garrett's brow furrowed. ""What did you say?""
Priscilla held his gaze.
""I want to sleep with you as your wife.""
Garrett stared, taken aback, as she continued unfastening the buttons.
Only when her hand moved lower did he catch her wrist.
""Priscilla, I don't sleep with women I feel nothing for.""
Seeing the complete lack of desire in his eyes, Priscilla paused. Shame washed over her, her cheeks burning.
She pulled her hands back and pushed herself up with effort.
""Get some rest.""
Garrett said nothing more. He turned on his side and closed his eyes.
Priscilla quietly drew the covers over him.
She turned off the light and went back to the sofa she'd used for five years.
Only when Garrett's breathing became slow and even did she finally rise and go to the study.
She didn't see his eyes open the moment the bedroom door shut.
In the study, Priscilla smoothed a sheet of writing paper on the desk.
She picked up a pen and began to write.
""Rett, by the time you read this, I'll be gone.""
""You might not believe me, but these last five years, my feelings for you were real.""
""I know you never stopped caring for Caroline. Now that we're divorced, you're free of a wife you never wanted.""
""May you spend your life with someone who truly matters to you.""
Her handwriting was clumsy, her fingers too stiff to hold the pen properly.
When she finished, she carefully placed the letter, along with the blank check and his divorce certificate, into the second drawer on the left side of his desk.
That drawer held all his keepsakes of Caroline: photographs, letters...
When she was done, Priscilla couldn't help one last look at Garrett.
She returned to the bedroom.
In the faint light from the streetlamp outside, she watched him sleep soundly and murmured silently in her heart, ""Goodbye, Garrett.""
Chapter 7
Then, taking only her own divorce certificate, Priscilla left the Crawford's villa.
She stepped outside the gates, snow still falling steadily.
Priscilla looked at the document in her hand, brushing off the flakes that had settled on it.
Now she was no longer a daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, nor Garrett's wife.
She was just herself.
She was finally free to leave.
But first, she wanted one last look at her mother and brother.
Her movements were more stiff as she made her way to the curb and hailed a taxi.
""Westheimer Road, number fifty-nine.""
Thirty minutes later, she arrived at her parents' house.
She approached the front door and keyed in the security code she knew by heart.
The door stayed shut. A cold, automated voice responded.
""Invalid code. Please try again.""
Priscilla paused, then tried several more times. The same message greeted her each time.
They had changed the code without telling her.
Snow settled heavily on her, dusting her hair and eyelashes white.
She felt no physical cold, but a deep chill settled in her heart.
She understood it then. For a woman, adulthood meant being without a true home. Neither her parents' house nor her husband's house was really her own.
Priscilla remained standing there through the night.
The sky gradually lightened at dawn.
Muffled voices reached her from inside—her mother and her brother, Raymond Burnett.
She was about to knock when Monica's voice grew louder as she moved closer to the door. ""Ray, I saw your sister yesterday. Can you believe she told me she wants a divorce?""
Raymond sounded stunned. ""A divorce?
""The Crawford family paid us 1.6 billion dollars for her to marry Garrett, that invalid.
""If she leaves him, how are we supposed to pay that back?""
At his words, Priscilla's hand froze mid-air. Disbelief washed over her.
She had always blamed Merrick for the arranged marriage. She never knew her own family had sold her.
Everyone knew. She was the only one kept in the dark.
Her knuckles turned white.
A sudden, overwhelming fatigue hit her.
Just then, the front door swung open.
Monica, standing behind it, stared at the sight of Priscilla—deathly pale and blanketed in snow.
""Lurking out here in silence! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?""
Priscilla looked at her mother, eyes growing moist. ""I'm back, Mom.""
Monica frowned.
""You're married. What are you doing here?""
Priscilla didn't answer.
She carefully pulled the formal document from inside her coat and held it out.
""Mom. Garrett and I are legally separated.""
Monica stared, speechless for a moment.
She snapped back to reality and struck Priscilla with a sharp, stinging slap.
""Who said you could do that?
""Didn't I make myself clear? You die as a Garrett's wife!""
A metallic taste flooded Priscilla's throat. Dark red blood seeped from the corner of her lip.
Drop by drop, it stained the pristine snow at her feet.
She looked at her mother numbly. ""Mom, I am dying.""
Rage flashed in Monica's eyes. She shoved Priscilla backward.
""Then go die somewhere else!""
Priscilla landed hard in the snow. The hand she braced against the ground was so pale that it was almost indistinguishable from the snow.
She looked up at her furious mother, unable to speak.
Monica glared down at her.
""If you're not dead, get back to the Crawford's villa on your knees. Apologize to his parents. Apologize to Garrett.
""Beg for their forgiveness. Beg him to take you back.
""Or I swear, I'll disown you. Don't you ever come back here.""
Any last hope Priscilla held for Monica died then. She pushed herself up with great effort.
""Don't worry. I won't come back.
""I just wanted to see you both one last time.""
Wiping the blood from her mouth, she added, ""Dad supported you when he was alive. The Crawford family has supported you since he died.
""You'll have to manage on your own now. No one is coming to support you.""
With that, she turned and walked away into the relentless storm.
Chapter 8
In the Crawford's villa, Garrett woke to an empty room.
Priscilla was gone.
The staff entered to help him begin his day.
Seeing them, he frowned slightly.
""Where's my wife?""
A maid answered promptly, ""The housekeeper said Mrs. Crawford returned to her parents' house, sir.""
Garrett said nothing.
His expression remained cold as they assisted him.
Priscilla knew he disliked being helped. She always made sure he was settled before attending to anything else, no matter how urgent it was.
""Is it because I turned her away last night?"" he wondered.
After breakfast, Garrett went straight to his study.
He had just opened his laptop when Merrick walked in without knocking.
Garrett looked up, puzzled. ""What is it?""
Merrick hesitated, then spoke his mind.
""Rett, my wedding is tomorrow. I need to hear you say it. That you feel truly happy for Cara and me.""
He knew about Caroline and his brother's past.
He needed this settled before he married her.
A chill entered Garrett's eyes.
""I wish you both happiness,"" he said slowly.
Hearing that, Merrick finally relaxed.
""Thank you, Rett.""
As he turned to leave, he noticed Garrett's pallor.
""You look awful. Are you okay?""
For a second, Garrett seemed uneasy.
""Didn't get much rest. I've got work to do. Leave me alone.""
In truth, he hadn't slept at all, only closing his eyes briefly near dawn.
""OK.""
After Merrick left, Garrett took out his phone.
He opened a private, locked album containing 1,390 photos of Caroline.
He selected all and deleted them.
Then he blocked her number and all her WhatsApp account.
Finished, he looked out the window.
The snow continued to fall, heavy and unceasing.
Almost without thinking, he picked up his phone and sent a message to Priscilla.
""When are you coming back?""
An hour passed. No reply came.
His frown deepened. He sent two more.
""If you like it there so much, then stay.""
""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""
He set the phone aside and focused on his work, ignoring it completely afterward.
Priscilla never replied.
That evening, Merrick's bachelor party filled parts of the house with friends, while everyone else there bustled with his wedding preparations, except Garrett.
He stayed alone in his room, reading.
Suddenly, he heard his door open quietly. Assuming it was Priscilla, he asked coldly, ""Decided to return?""
But when he turned, it was Caroline standing there, her eyes red.
""What are you doing here?""
Caroline asked, the question sharp with accusation, ""You blocked me on everything. Why?""
""I'm marrying your brother tomorrow. Do you really want to stand there and watch?""
Garrett saw the hurt in her eyes. His fingers tightened around the pages of his book.
""Everyone lives with their choices.
""You'll be my brother's wife. We should keep our distance.""
Caroline's heart sank at his words.
""If that's how it is, at least make sure Ms. Burnett keeps our secret.""
Garrett looked away, avoiding her gaze.
""Priscilla isn't one to gossip.""
Caroline watched him for a long moment, then offered a bitter smile.
""You know, Rett?
""The way you just defended her reminds me of how you used to defend me when you loved me.""
Garrett closed his book and looked at her, his expression blank.
""You should go.""
Chapter 9
Caroline gave him one long, last look, then left.
Only after the door clicked shut did Garrett look toward where she had been standing, then back out the window, watching her figure disappear into the distance.
He took out his phone again. Still, no reply came from Priscilla.
What he didn't know was that Priscilla had already purchased a burial plot for herself.
After leaving the Burnett's residence, she had gone to the funeral home.
She bought a plot next to her father's, then paid the staff to arrange her own funeral service.
By the time she finished, it was evening.
Priscilla stopped at a florist for a bouquet of white roses, then hailed a taxi.
""Evergreen Cemetery, please.""
The driver hesitated for a moment at the destination, then replied, ""Sure.""
On the road, the driver's wife called. He spoke to her gently.
""Sweetheart, I'll be home for dinner after this ride.
""If it gets too late, don't wait up.
""I love you.""
Through the rearview mirror, Priscilla saw his smile linger long after the call ended.
That sort of happiness was something she'd always yearned for.
Garrett would never speak to her with that kind of tenderness.
Catching her pale reflection in the mirror, the driver asked, ""It's late, miss, and snowing hard.
""Are you sure your family knows you're going to the cemetery alone?""
Priscilla tried to smile, but her face had grown too stiff.
She answered slowly, ""I don't have any family left.
""Last night, my husband and I separated legally.
""This morning, my mother and brother disowned me.""
""I'm sorry..."" The driver was taken aback, quickly apologized, and fell silent.
Watching the snowy landscape pass by, Priscilla felt she finally understood why she hadn't been able to move on—her ties to this world weren't fully severed.
In this world now, she had no one left to miss and nothing left to care for.
Two hours later, they arrived at the cemetery.
The driver dropped her off and drove away.
Priscilla walked through the gates and laid the roses at her father's headstone.
She checked the time: 11:30 PM.
She had fallen into the sea at midnight. Only half an hour remained...
Her gaze lifted to her father's portrait on the headstone, a gentle smile captured in the monochrome image.
""Dad, I'll be with you soon.""
Speaking to the air, she dragged her rigid body to her own adjacent plot.
Leaning against the headstone, she took out her phone and sent a WhatsApp message to the funeral director.
""Please come to Evergreen Cemetery first thing tomorrow.""
""Bury me deep. I don't want to be walked over.""
Only then did she notice Garrett's three messages.
""When are you coming back?""
""If you like it there so much, then stay.""
""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""
After a long moment, she decided to say goodbye.
She dialed his number. When he answered, his voice was icy.
""It's 11:45. What do you want?
""If you're done being my wife, then stay gone.""
Fifteen minutes remained.
Blood rose suddenly in Priscilla's throat, spilling onto her white coat.
She wiped at it clumsily.
""Don't worry,"" she managed. ""I'm already somewhere you'll never find.""
Garrett let out a cold, dismissive sound.
""What are you talking about? Get back here.
""Or don't ever come back.""
She kept wiping the blood from her mouth as he spoke, but it kept coming.
""Garrett, I can't come back.""
She struggled to speak, but Garrett said nothing in return.
A long silence passed before Garrett's voice returned. ""Fine. Stay with your family, then. I don't want to see you again.""
With a sharp click, the call ended.
Priscilla listened to the dial tone with a faint, pained smile. Her thoughts began to blur. ""But my family doesn't want me either...
""I picked a good spot right next to Dad. He dedicated his whole life to the family. Now I can keep him company.
""Finally, I'm only my own.""
She murmured as the blood flowed freely, too weak to wipe it away.
Slowly, her stiff body grew still, the faint rise and fall of her chest fading.
The moment her consciousness faded, the phone slipped from her hand.
The screen still glowed, showing the time: 00:00.

Ranchi doesn’t have too many places where you can slow down, work peacefully, or just spend a calm evening, and Cafe Mysa really stands out for that reason.

The space itself is beautiful and cozy. It’s one of the more aesthetic cafés in Ranchi, with warm lighting, indoor plants, and really comfortable seating. It’s great for hanging out with friends, working on your laptop, or even going alone with a book.

Their coffee is consistently good easily among the better coffee shops in Ranchi. The cappuccino and iced coffee are my go-to, but their whole menu feels thoughtfully done. They also serve really comforting food, which makes it a solid brunch café in Ranchi as well.

What I personally like most is the vibe. It doesn’t feel rushed, noisy, or commercial. It feels like a place you return to.

1qq1svk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1qq1svk/how_to_flirt_subtly_the_psychology_thatll_make/,How to Flirt Subtly: The Psychology That'll Make You Dangerously Attractive,"Okay so I've been down a ridiculous rabbit hole lately. Started with a breakup (lol classic), spiraled into ""why am I so bad at this,"" and ended up reading like 15 books, binging psychology podcasts at 2am, and watching way too many YouTube videos on human behavior. 

Here's what I found: most people think flirting is about being smooth or having perfect lines. It's not. It's about making someone feel SEEN in a world where everyone's distracted and half present. The people who are magnetic? They've figured out this tiny shift in how they show up. And honestly, it's less complicated than we make it.

I pulled together everything that actually worked from legit sources (not random dating gurus selling courses). This is what made the difference.

## the foundation: presence over performance

Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested instead.

Actual flirting isn't about impressing someone. It's about creating a bubble where they feel like the most fascinating person in the room. When you're genuinely curious about someone, your body language shifts naturally. You lean in slightly. You ask follow up questions that aren't just polite filler.

Dr. John Gottman's research (he's the guy who can predict divorce with 94% accuracy after watching couples for 15 minutes) found that successful connections happen when people respond to ""bids for attention."" Someone mentions they like hiking? That's a bid. You either turn toward it (""oh really? what's your favorite trail?"") or turn away (""cool"" then change subject).

The move: Next conversation, catch yourself when someone shares something. Pause. Ask one more question about THAT thing before moving on. Watch what happens.

## body language that doesn't scream desperation

The 70% rule.

Face someone about 70% of the time, not 100%. Full frontal attention feels intense and interview-like. Angle your body slightly, like you're both looking at the world together instead of examining each other. Creates way more comfort.

I learned this from Vanessa Van Edwards' work (she runs a human behavior research lab and her book *Cues: Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication* is borderline life changing for this stuff). She breaks down how the most charismatic people use ""friend signals"" vs ""romantic signals"" and how to blend them.

Touch, but make it casual.

The research is wild on this. A study in Social Influence journal found that light, brief touches on the forearm increased compliance and positive feelings significantly. But here's the key: it has to feel accidental-ish. Touching someone's arm when you laugh at their joke. Guiding them through a door with a hand on their back for half a second. 

Not: grabbing, lingering, or touching anywhere that requires a signed consent form.

## verbal game that doesn't feel like game

Playful disagreement > constant agreement.

This one blew my mind. Everyone thinks you need to agree with everything someone says to make them like you. Nope. Dr. Robert Cialdini's research on persuasion shows that small, playful challenges actually build attraction because they signal confidence and create fun tension.

Someone says ""I hate coffee""? Don't go ""omg me too!"" Try ""okay that's genuinely concerning, we might not be able to be friends"" with a smile. You're teasing, not attacking. Big difference.

Compliment the non obvious.

Everyone comments on looks. It's boring and puts pressure on the person to perform attractiveness. Instead, notice choices and actions. ""I like how you talk about your friends"" or ""you have really good taste in [whatever they just mentioned].""

The book *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer (ex FBI behavioral analyst who literally got paid to make people like him) breaks down why specific, unexpected compliments work better than generic ones. They show you're actually paying attention, not just trying to score points.

## creating intrigue without being mysterious and annoying

The curiosity gap.

Don't dump your entire life story. Share enough to be interesting, but leave threads hanging. Mention you're working on a project but don't explain what yet. Say you had ""the weirdest conversation"" with someone but pause before explaining.

Humans are wired to close information gaps. It's literally how clickbait works, but you're using it for good instead of evil.

I got this from Robert Greene's *The Art of Seduction* which sounds sketchy but is actually a deep dive into psychology and historical patterns. It's less ""pickup artist trash"" and more ""here's how humans have been attracted to each other for centuries.""

Strategic unavailability.

Don't always be available immediately. Not because you're playing games, but because you actually have a life worth living. The app Ash (relationship and attachment style coach) helped me figure out my anxious attachment patterns and why I used to be WAY too available. Turns out, having your own full life isn't selfish, it's attractive.

When someone texts, it's okay to respond in an hour because you were actually doing something. Not three days because you're ""being strategic."" There's a difference.

If you want to go deeper without spending months reading through all these books, there's this app called BeFreed that pulls insights from dating psychology experts, relationship research, and books like the ones I mentioned. You can tell it your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" or ""improve flirting skills without being creepy,"" and it generates a personalized learning plan with audio lessons tailored to you.

What's useful is you can switch between quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks. The voice options are honestly addictive too, you can pick anything from a calm, thoughtful tone to something more energetic. Makes the commute or gym time way more productive than scrolling.

## the energy shift that changes everything

Assume attraction.

This is the cheat code honestly. Instead of wondering ""do they like me?"" just assume they probably do and act accordingly. Not arrogant, just... relaxed. Your whole energy changes when you're not constantly scanning for rejection signals.

Mark Manson talks about this in *Models: Attract Women Through Honesty* (ignore the gendered title, the principles work for everyone). He argues that neediness is the attraction killer, and the antidote is having a genuinely full life where this person is a bonus, not the main event.

Practice on everyone.

Flirt with the barista. Flirt with the person at the grocery store. Flirt with your friend's grandma. Not sexually, just... be warm, playful, present. You'll get so much more comfortable with that energy that it won't feel like you're DOING something when it actually matters.

The podcast *Where Should We Begin?* with Esther Perel (couples therapist who's basically a wizard) has an episode on flirtation in long term relationships that applies here. She talks about how flirting is really just expressing aliveness and curiosity. It's not a skill you turn on and off, it's a way of moving through the world.

## what actually matters

Look, I wasted so much time thinking I needed perfect lines or a different personality. Turns out the people who are good at this just give a shit about making others feel good. They're present. They notice things. They're not so caught up in their own head that they miss the moment.

The subtle flirting that works isn't a trick. It's just being genuinely interested in someone and expressing that interest in ways that feel playful and low pressure. That's it. Everything else is just different flavors of that same thing.

Start small. Pick one thing from this list. Try it this week. See what happens. You'll be weird about it at first, everyone is. But then it starts feeling natural and suddenly you're the person people gravitate toward without knowing exactly why.",1,1769670819.0,Datingat21st,0,1.0,False

So I went to the grocery store today and there was a lady in there the very nicest lady I've ever met and her husband and they had all of their kids all of them and they were all well behaved very well mannered and didn't talk back to their parents and they were very intelligent 3-year-old spoke like an 8 year old. I asked her how she did it with all them kids she said because she puts herself as a parent first then a wife. I asked the husband if that was okay with him and he said yes he said because he does the same thing he's a parent first then he is a husband second. 

I told them that I didn't have kids so I wouldn't know how to even raise one even though I know I can. And the lady told me that is the first thing you have to do is take care of your children because if you don't nobody else will. I asked her how does she get her kids so well behaved and she said that she has instilled in her children that respect is earned and if you act up and if you don't have good manners and everything is taken away I said oh their phone and she said no only the three older children have phones. She said that she takes other things away like their favorite toys and she will put them in a closet until they behave and then they have to ask permission to get their toys back. She said her kids don't watch TV the older ones each have a laptop that they do their homework on and at night their phones and their laptops get put away they're not allowed to have their phones at bedtime only during the day and they are not allowed to use them at the dinner table and everybody eats together. 

They weren't shopping down the pantry aisles either they were getting dairy meat vegetables and fruit. She told me she does not allow their kids to have anything with sugar in it unless it is approved by them she said they don't have soda pop in their house she said it's water, milk, juice, coffee or iced tea and that's it. She was not a bad person if anybody is thinking that she just has control over all of her kids and she's not controlling. 

I told her that there's a family vlogger crazy pieces and I told her that they have like 20 kids and she stopped me in my tracks. She told me that family vloggers should be ended because it is ruining our society as the human population gets dumber when it comes to the camera and electronics. 

I told her kudos to you because I know I couldn't do it I told her I can barely take care of my two dogs sometimes because of my autoimmune and she asked me about my diet I told her and she said that that stuff will ruin your gut and your brain. She said that sugar gives you a high that not many drugs can compete with. She said people shouldn't even have sugar in their house let alone snacks with sugar and I told her that I'm addicted to chocolate LOL and she said the darker the better because that's when they put less milk and sugar in it. I told her about you must have done a lot of research you know a lot about stuff like that and she said that she is a board-certified dietitian and has been a dietitian for the last 23 years and her husband is a heart surgeon and he's been a surgeon for the last 16 years. She said the things that people put in their body that ruined their organs especially the heart have a high mortality rate. 

She said that her kids are very healthy and she says what she cooks for her family everybody eats. She said that red meat isn't as bad for you as everybody thinks it is and neither is most other meat you just have to watch where you buy it at. She gives her kids fruit and yogurt in the morning when they wake up in 2 hours later she gives them each a hard boiled egg and a strip of bacon and then 2 hours later they get a snack in the snack can be vegetables or fruit she feeds her kids every 2 hours but she feeds them lightly and she said that's what you have to do she said no bread no noodles no sugar and she said corn is not the best vegetable to eat she said it's got to be greens. 

She said that she and a few other dietitians from other states have been fighting to change the food pyramid because bread should not even be on there. 

I told it as I'm sitting at home eating chicken noodle soup for dinner you're probably in something a lot better for you she said she'll make chicken noodle soup but she doesn't put the noodles in with the soup when she cooks it she said she puts her carrots celery peas onions and real pressed garlic with a whole chicken and she lets that simmer for 3 hours and then she said she takes the chicken out and she said the broth comes from the chicken the bones and the skin she said bone broth is one of the best things for you if you have autoimmune diseases and she also said that the broth that you get from the skin gives you the fact that you need she said but you don't want to eat the skin because the skin is very fatty. 

I can go on and on about the things that she told me today but I won't and I actually got her phone number so I can call her because my boyfriend and I are both diabetic and she said she could help us plan our meals even with eating cheap. I said you don't have to do that I said we probably couldn't afford a dietitian anyway and she said she likes to teach people how to cook and eat healthy and it still tastes good. 

What I'm trying to get at is that crazy pieces make enough money to get a dietitian in their house and get rid of all that junk food and start putting good food in that house for those kids and they need to take their phones away at dinner time and after and they're only allowed so much time on it.  Crystal would rather have her face in front of the camera and she would rather buy junk food because it's easier just get a bag of chips and eat that get a soda pop and drink that. Crystal and Aaron do not take the time with them kids because if they did they wouldn't be the way they are I'm not blaming the kids I'm blaming Crystal and Aaron because those kids should have a better life than they have and has nothing to do with money. They need support they need love they need time taken with them the lady told me today that each kid gets 15 minutes to tell them about their day and once a week they take two of the kids and they take them shopping or whatever they want to do she said if she can make time with all of her kids so can other people. People just like to make excuses like Crystal. 

Crystal can afford to put Aurora in some types of classes and learn speech therapy, every single one of them kids should have gone to college that have graduated I know a few of them did but they all dropped out or most of them at least. And the lady told me today once they turn 18 they are still my children I still take care of them mentally and emotionally she said she would never turn her back on any of her kids even if they were adopted. She said these families that adopt kids and put them on camera should have the cameras stripped from them because they're only doing it for the money and the notoriety I think that's the word I'm thinking pretty much saying that they want to be out there into the public. 

Anyway today's been a long day for me so I'm closing this out and going to bed. Sorry for the long read but this lady really taught me a lot today more than I'm sure Crystal's kids have learned in their lifetime. ",1,1769670778.0,Crazymiddles,0,0.67,False

1qq1s4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qq1s4v/i_think_i_escaped_a_cult/,I think I escaped a cult,"This is a little hard for me to write. I haven't spoken about it in-depth with anyone.

At my previous job, I had a coworker I was very close with. She had met a patient that told her that it looked like she was struggling, and he has a group she can go to that can help

her. She was going through a horrible break up and has a REALLY awful relationship with her parents who she lives with. They ended up communicating, she was feeling apprehensive. One day, she asked me to go with her to meet him at a coffee shop. I agreed.

We met, my guard was high. He bought our drinks. He spoke only about her. Didn't say much about himself, and he left me alone. Then he invited us to his group, that it's free. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sundays. 6-30PM to 12am or so.

We went. There were about fourteen people there, and they were all welcoming, maybe apprehensive themselves. I felt very tense. I didn't understand much of what they were talking about, but they spoke about their traumas, what they thought about themselves, spoke their 'true' thoughts without judgement from him.

When we left, I didn't expect my coworker/friend to want to go back. I didn't want to go back, but because I felt lonely, I went anyways.

So for six months, maybe eight, we went to that group. All of the scheduled days except Sundays. For all those hours. We had a group chat where I would put out thoughts in. And we had to do it daily. He would teach us about how to learn where our self-judgement comes from. He spoke about God and evil. He would use the bible to explain what he was teaching. That there is evidence. That everyone around us is fighting evil as we speak, just like we are.

Except, he wasn't. Except, he knew he was loved by God. And that he could accept that love. He told us we don't think, that we don't believe God loves us because we judge ourselves. He told us a lot of things.

And in that time frame, I really tried to understand his words. I wanted to help. I wanted to be part of something.

And then things started getting weird. I noticed that the people would cater to him, and the others would look up to him. Ask him for advice. Call him 'shepard'. Other people

became jealous of another person because he was hanging out with them. Freak outs happened, jealousy, ""he doesn't like this cheese, he only likes the other one"". Something that put me off.

But I ignored all of that. That's their problem. This guy seems to really want to help. I visit his place once or twice with my coworker. It's not bad. It was a little weird, but he was very open and welcoming.

One day my friend comes to me after the group. She looks distraught. Didn't look right. She was crying. She told me she wants to tell me something about someone, but the leader of the group had instilled into us that talking about others to other people is gossiping. And at that point, it was so ingrained in our heads we just never did talk about other people. And if we did, we'd feel guilt.

""It's about someone, but I don't want your opinion to change of them. I don't want to make you think bad about that person for what they've done. But I feel so confused. I feel awful.""

I figured there was an inappropriate interaction between my friend and the leader of the group. Turns out I was right. But before I even knew I was right, I didn't dig too deep into

it. I didn't want to push her.

Around August of 2025, it happened to me. I had gone to his place multiple times by myself, and each time he was coming closer. It was like the frog inside the slowly boiling water bs. He'd end up giving me a massage on my shoulders. Then my arms. Then stop. Then start talking about inappropriate things. I never wanted to talk about that, I never gave him much to talk about.

On the day it finally happened, we were talking about God. And I thought that this time, he wasn't going to bring it up because we're talking about something that doesn't involve

touch.

I began to cry about the conversation. Basically, what happened next was not what I wanted to happen. And it was difficult, because he continued to tell me I could stop it. That I'm in control of the situation. Yet, I felt like I couldn't. At the end, he told me, ""Remember, don't tell anyone else. If you have thoughts or feelings about this, tell me. In the bible, it says when you have a problem or issue with a brother, you go directly to them. Alright?""

I just said okay. I thought I was fine. Looking back, I was just trying to shove that experience to the back of my mind. I didn't know what to think about it. I just promised myself I will never be around him by myself. I thought maybe I did want that to happen. I was confused.

The whole thing with my friend began to make a lot more sense. She began to leave a lot of clues. It was something ongoing. One day, she began to act weird around me. She had found out what happened between me and him.

During work, we had a heavy conversation. We told each other the truth. It was happening to her around four times a week. She told me she wanted it. I have a hard time believing that, even now.

We reached out to this other person that had left that group a month prior. She was very apprehensive when I called her. Very defensive. And as soon as I began to cry, she understood. Basically it was happening to her too. For three years, he was doing that to her. And finally she left.

My friend and I went to go meet her the next day. It was very refreshing. The leader of the group kept blowing up my friend's phone. He also messaged me, asking me where I was.

""Is there anything you want to tell me?"" is what he asked. I played dumb.

I never went back. Though I still hear his words in my head sometimes. Why I do something, why I think what I think. Like somethings wrong with me. I feel isolated now. I feel alone. My friend still goes back, and I broke contact with her. I couldn't do it anymore. She feels betrayed because I had also done IT with him, and she's mad at me. He's old enough to be our father.

Why did I keep going back? I don't know. I thought I needed to get better before I could see that it was good for me.

Is my relationship with religion fricked? No. I just realize it’s between me and whatever deity I want to believe in. 

Did I report it? Yes, I made a report. Collected evidence. The police are actually taking it seriously. Apparently there's been reports before.

I didn't explain it in much detail, I just needed to get it off. My mind is okay one day, and a mess another. I have therapy, but even then it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm not normal. That I believed a person could ""wash me"" from my judgement for a couple of months straight.

I went to that place so I could get help, not to join a 'cult', if it even is that. I don't even know

I drink my coffee as espresso or black and my review is based on that. Your mileage may vary if you try it with milk.

1. Mysore Nuggets - works marginally as a single espresso. There is persistent bitterness at the end of each sip, with a relatively thin body and limited mouthfeel. The bitterness feels unstructured rather than intentional. Overall, passable but unremarkable — 3/5. 

2. Baba Budangiri - is thinner and more bitter, with a slight sour note that cuts through the cup. The texture feels watery and the balance is off. This rates closer to 2.5/5 for me.

Both coffees perform slightly better as a short Americano (40 ml espresso + 40 ml hot water), but the improvement is marginal and does not address the underlying issues with body and balance.

The aluminium foil feels thicker than many other pods, but the material quality appears cheaper, which may affect extraction consistency and contribute to the thin mouthfeel.

Not coffees I would repurchase, especially for Nespresso Machine. I got taken in by attractive looking packaging and description and picked it at heavy discount on Amazon. But I would not buy this again.",1,1769669840.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.67,False

I am trying to find out what I can take alongside taurine to keep the calming effect while avoiding the fatigue. Ideally something that supports motivation or dopamine without pushing me toward mania.

I am currently considering:

* L theanine 
* L tyrosine 
* Coffee
* Caffeine 
* Lithium orotate

My main issue is that I constantly **shift between two states**.

One state is mania, which for me mainly shows up as anxiety, stress, and fear.  
The other state is depression, with low dopamine, fatigue, and lack of motivation.

What I am looking for is a **stable middle ground** where I feel calm, emotionally positive, and motivated at the same time. In other words, a balance between serotonin, GABA, and dopamine, without the constant swings between extremes.

I strongly dislike both mania and depression. My goal is not to push myself in either direction, but to find a more stable baseline.

I’m 61 and have noticed something about myself — the only movement I stay consistent with is the stuff that feels more like having an experience, not a workout.

Traditional workouts never really stuck for me long-term.

Would other women over 50 - 70 try a fitness approach that felt more like a game or an adventure — simple, flexible, not intense — or does that just sound gimmicky?

1qq1gjh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qq1gjh,Häagen-Dazs Coffee Almond Toffee (new flavor),"As promised in my post yesterday about the new Häagen-Dazs’ flavors, I’m offering up a longer review and more photos for anyone who likes to dive deeper on a particular flavor …

**Their description:** “Brazilian coffee, buttery toffee, and California almonds. No, this isn't your new coffee order. This is your new favorite Häagen Dazs flavor.”

**My take:** Coffee is a top three flavor for me, and for decades I’ve considered H-D the best, which pretty much puts it in contention for the best ice cream of all time (and it might be). So anything added is almost like subtraction from that creamy perfection. But it doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy the occasional H-D side trip, like chocolate chips or brownies (they really need Coffee Cookies N Cream next). Here the adornments are tasty, a good amount and the right size for little bits of crunch throughout. H-D always handles nuts well, but here those buttery toffee bits are the highlight, giving the coffee base a run for its money.

**What I’d do differently:** I think the amount of mix-ins is decent by H-D standards, but I’d put more in myself. 

**In an alternative universe:** This is H-D’s take on a classic Mocha Almond Fudge, with the chocolate swapped out for toffee. But why not both? I do think it’s nice to have some options without chocolate, but here it would have been quite welcome with pools of fudge complementing the toffee and nuts.

**Among its peers:** Is Baskin Robbins’ Jamoca Almond Fudge the classic for this flavor, or did someone else innovate it? Regardless, while I like that one, I do prefer H-D’s coffee base and toffee bits. Tillamook had one I enjoyed years back, but I’d hate to venture a guess on quality now, especially with the declining mix-ins. I’ve seen one from Blue Bell, too, but have not tasted it.

**Possible pairing:** H-D's Rocky Road. If you’re missing the fudge, bring it in with this chocolate base, the almonds in both offering the bridge between two fun flavors.

**Make your own collection:** Pair all of H-D’s coffee flavors together for the highly caffeinated ice cream lover in your life — Coffee, Coffee Chip, Coffee Chocolate Brownie —then round out a six-pack with Vanilla for the creamer and Dulce de Leche for a caramel macchiato mashup.

1qq1f3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCUMgame/comments/1qq1f3s/hot_drinks_and_poison/,Hot drinks and poison,"Weird combination, I know, but it just hit me (as always): D

Since we have generators of electricity, among all rubbish we find at houses, there could be a tea kettle, electrical or not. With whistle. Repairable like pot or pan. Fill it with water (any water - can make water from river or pond safe) ---

\* Safe water - lets assume all (unboiled) water in rivers and ponds has little chance to give a gastro infection or cause indigestion with vomit and diarrhea. Causes can be different - hunters/zombies/anything were chasing deer and it died in upstream somewhere above, contaminated water. Or someone throw something in the river, or someone's car sunk in water and all liquids leaked and contaminated.

\--- So fill it with water and put on fire or turn on electrical. After 2-3 minutes it will whistle, telling water is boiling and switch off (electrical) or will keep boiling until you take it off fire, while water in it will go down. If let boil for long time, water will evaporate and fire will start damage kettle until it's death.

Then, when we have boiling water, we can make a tea or coffee, or any remedy in form of infuse.

\* About remedies in form of infuses, must be different post.

If we want to drink it now, we take cup (new asset needed), add coffee, tea, sugar, lemon, milk, cream, like in existing recipe, only without cooking after, and drink is ready. If we want to take hot drink (it stays hot in open air for about 15 min real time) with us in to cold areas expedition, for example, we can make few cups more and pout them into vacuum flask (new asset needed), where it stays hot for 2-3 hours of real time (tweaking and research needed). So when you are cold in northern areas, you can take a sip of hot tea or what you have in there and get warmer for 10, 20, 30 min of real time (tweaking needed).

So that's that about hot drinks so far. Game is quite complex, so why not make drinks cooking like they really should be, and making them in pots is very basic or placeholding for upgrade.

Now, since we have only one poisonous mushroom Fly agaric or Amanita Muscaria. Not very poisonous thing but among all effects take your pick: mild [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea) and twitching to drowsiness, [cholinergic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_crisis)\-like effects (low [blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure), [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat) and [salivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva)), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, [euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(emotion)), relaxation, [ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia), and [loss of equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(medical)), larger doses mean delirium, seizures and coma. So, I guess for starter we can take drunk visual effects, then nausea/vomit, ataxia - blocks character movement, loss of equilibrium, also new effect causing character to fall down a lot. So not that bad in effects for start.

Next, how to deliver these effects to someone. Since it is water soluble, can take a bad pot (now really a pot) and mix mushrooms with water, get some ""poison"" in pot. Fill used bottles of beer for example ---

\*Reusing beer, alco and other bottles. Should be action allowing to stick a label on them (from paper, we have it in every ammo box), allowing to change name from beer bottle to anything selected from list, like poison, or any other existing liquid that can be filled in these bottles.

\--- add a label and there you go - poison. Combine it with arrows, to make them poisonous. They can stay poisonous forever or loose that condition over time (tweaking needed). And when you hit someone with them, all nice effects, mentioned above start for that character.

The cure is just time, since there are no real antidote (for real, I try to back all my ideas to real life conditions as possible), well, then we can go home and lie in bed for some time, have high fever, drink some water.

If we would dry these mushrooms, effect is said to be stronger and let's say, more lethal, so it could be used in hunting, drying shrooms (new asset needed) could be dried in dryer then grind into powder (either new asset grinder needed found in pharmacies, or can do with hands) and mixed with meat to make poisoned bait for bears or wolves.",2,1769669465.0,SCUMgame,0,1.0,False

Before starting, I was told that we are free to take a short break during work hours to chat with co-workers. They encourage it so everyone doesn't get burnt out. However, we need to keep it under 10 minutes each time and get all our work done before leaving. Mind you, people curse and talk about nsfw stuff all the time. I do not do it because I don't want to offend anyone.

The first 7 month, I hardly talked because I am the type who does not want to bother others. I was raised to respect others and only speak when spoken to. However, I still try my best by asking everyone if they want any snacks or coffee when I go get myself some. I want to show people I that even if I don't talk, I am still nice and would like to be friends. But I have poor social skills and am a bit shy. I'm also the only Asian in the company and maybe even in the town. So I do not know what to say to connect with others.

Still, despite me trying my best to be kind and quiet, people find a way to talk crap about me. They would saying, oh, you don't talk to us because you don't like us. Or she thinks she is better because all she do is work and not talk. I was baffled and cut them off saying ""That is not true, I have tried talking but I get ignored by everyone. If you talk to me, I will talk with you."" They just look at me as if I didn't say anything and continue talking to each other.  
Everyday they talk shit about others behind their backs as if they are perfect. The top shit talker is Brittany, a F-White (38) . The others aren't as bad as they are just listening and agreeing with her.

She talks very loud about none work related thing everyday and say things that probably shouldn't be said at work. She always try to make every conversation about herself. Which can be distracting when I am working.

Hearing what they said about me and what they say about others, I decided that I should at least make one friend so they don't think I am stuck up for not talking. I do not like drama so I started opening up more to one of my co working name Leah, F-White (24). She is very sweet and funny so it was easy to get along with her.

It has 9 month now, I am still quiet but talk here and there with Leah.

Yesterday, I was talking to Leah about "" What if ghost can't swim and they died at the bottom of the ocean, it would be sad because all they see is darkness."" It was about a good 5 minutes of the conversation and Brittany cut in mid conversation. She said. ""Excuse me, but are you guys talking about work related stuff?"" I replied ""no."" Then she stated, ""Then why are you guys talking if it isn't work stuff?"" I replied, ""well, you do it all the time, so why can't we? ""She said, ""Well, you never said anything about it.""

We have worked together and she has been friends with a male coworker and they would chat at work sometimes. I never read much into it but on occasion would have my suspicions. 

She recently left on a trip for a week and I happened to find out that he was also out of town in the same city. 

when she returned I confronted her about this and asked her if they met. she denied it. 

We do have shared locations on our phones and I did check her Google timeline and I know she has been going to get coffee with him as well. We all know each other, I know his wife and we had dinners together. 

I asked her what they had been doing and she finally opened up and confessed that they had been going to get coffee sometimes (namely on days that I was off work).

She did tell me that on one of the coffee runs he had told her that he liked her and she wasn't sure how to react and that they'd talk about it later - so she claims. 

On a coffee run she told me that on the way back he reached to hold her hand while driving back to work and they did hold hands for ""3 minutes"".

I was devastated when she told me. 

I pushed her more over the course of a 4 hour conversation and she did tell me that he had previously told her she is sexy and smart and tough, all things he admires. This happened back in August as I learned. 

Since then she says they had seized any contact for about 3 months and she has been carrying this guilt since. 

I asked her if they met again (I already know from her shared location about two other instances. 

The first time they met in his car again, they parked down the street to talk and that she asked him that nothing good can come from this so it is impossible. 

The second time I knew she came to a shopping mall near our work and through looking on our mobile providers app I knew she had called him, only to see him leave in the middle of the day to go see her. I called her a little later acting like I don't know what she's doing so I asked her to meet up. We did and she acted like she was just shopping. I returned to work. She admitted today that they sat in his car and talked about her recent termination and then he went back to work. 

The most recent shot to my heart was that she left town to be in Vegas with a female friend but I found out he was also there. I pushed her on that fact and she reluctantly admitted they had sushi together.

On all occasions she claims nothing happened but the coffee run and that he confessed feelings for her. I am so heartbroken and shaking typing this. 

She asked me what I would like her to do and I told her to text him that I know everything and that they can't communicate anymore. 

She has been hiding this since August, if not more at this point. I don't know what to think anymore. My world of trust is shattered and while she says she wants me, I feel so betrayed by this. 

she did change his name in her phone at one point to a female coworker name but I caught that as well. 

She claims she may have had feelings for him at one point but wouldn't say what kind of feelings and that is was ""impossible"" and couldn't work since they're both married. She said that many times over. 

While I want.to believe her and I truly think she is the love of my life, I don't know where to go from here. 

I read up on emotional cheating and affairs and it seems to carry the hallmarks of it from her actions of going behind my back. 

What hurts the most is that I at no point have had any intentions of my own to ever flirt with someone else and I thought we were aligned. 

this is a long rant and I'm sorry but I want to ask if this is truly an emotional affair or if the situations she did confess (she swears that's all) were something more. She said they did not kiss or anything beyond holding hands and him telling her she's sexy but I simply don't know how to trust her at this point. ",19,1769669186.0,survivinginfidelity,55,0.95,False

I moved into my apartment last year in the summer. About a month later my roommate moved in. At first we were friends—went out, talked a lot, normal roommate stuff.

Things started changing once dating got involved. We both started seeing people and naturally separated a bit. When she got a serious boyfriend, she became colder/weirder toward me. I ignored it.

Early on, I came home one day to a random man on my couch with no warning. I didn’t know who he was. He ended up being her boyfriend’s friend (and eventually became my boyfriend), but the point is: she set the precedent of having people sleep over without telling me, then later acted like I was the one crossing boundaries.

She starts sabotaging my relationship

Once I started dating him, she told me I “shouldn’t date him” and that he “wouldn’t be my husband.” Later my boyfriend told me she had also been saying nasty things about me to him (calling me a gold digger/whore/cold). That’s when I realized she was playing both sides. I Ignored her and continued to see him she hated him, one night when he came over and she freaked out and immediately went to security concerning that she felt unsafe with him being there. The next morning she went to the manager and told her she felt threatened by him and even went to the extent of hiding her car keys from him because she felt that he would steal her car. ( he has 3 cars). absolutely no reason for her to do that. again being very dramatic even threatening to call the cops on him. She had also gotten upset that one time I used one of her coffee pods which i had asked her if that was okay with her she said yes. But later complained to her boyfriend which my boyfriend informed me about so we went to costco and he bought her a bulk pack which she didn’t say thank you or anything. 

Noise complaint becomes a huge escalation

One night my boyfriend and I were cooking, laughing, and playing music. We got a noise complaint from a neighbor who has complained before (even when the TV wasn’t that loud). Management emailed everyone. I apologized just to keep the peace.Instead of talking to me directly, my roommate sent a long message to a group chat with multiple people (including parents) basically listing “issues” and demanding rules. She framed it like boundaries/safety were being violated and she “needs clear expectations” going forward. She then proceeds to put a camera in the living room without telling me.

She had brought a cat into the apartment which was fine at first but then it started to damage the apartment and I realized she had no intention of paying any pet deposit nor monthly pet payment on top of that she put the litter box in the area where we eat. It smelt absolutely horrific yet I dealt with it. Fast forward about few months I was cooking in the kitchen and a random cat comes running by feet. She comes out telling me she had just bought him. No communication about it or asking if i was fine with it before hand. I just brushed it off, until more damage and her not taking care of them, leaving them alone on the weekends with no water. ( they drink out of my toilet) I finally told her I was not okay with pets and in return she said I was being petty and they are still here. 

This is a HUGE ongoing problem. Her cats have:

	•	scratched up my couches

	•	peed on the couches

	•	pooped on the couches

	•	peed on the wallboards/baseboards

And she does not clean it up consistently, and I didn’t even make it a “big public thing” at first because I was trying to keep the peace.

Pet fees / lease issues

 I eventually went to management because I was genuinely concerned she wasn’t paying pet fees correctly (and I didn’t want the apartment/lease to fall back on me).

The worst incident: after I raised concerns with management about the pet situation, she barged into my bedroom while I was sleeping, screaming, calling me a bitch/insulting me, and her boyfriend had to drag her out. Since then I don’t feel safe or comfortable in my own home.

She also insults my ability to live on my own by saying I don’t understand “basic principles” like cleaning up after myself (and criticizes not doing it “1–2+ hours after”). 

Later she came back from a break/vacation and sent another dramatic group message saying most of the stuff in the apartment was “gone,” she was furious, and she wanted everyone to get on a phone call because it’s “completely out of hand.” She said she’ll be moving out as soon as possible but until then she wants the apartment to still feel like her home.When my mom asked what of hers was missing, she replied that it wasn’t her personal stuff—it was the stuff that was in the apartment when she moved in that made it a “living space.” She also said she wasn’t under the understanding she had to split/pay for what was already bought.

For context: my family bought all of the apartment items (including furniture). I moved a TV into my room for my own use, and I threw out a rug that smelled like cat pee and was filthy because it was stinking up the place.

The last and most recent situation that I can not get over nor don’t know how to handle was when she had brought over a friend and they stayed up super late causing lots of noise, despite all the drama and resentment towards her I simply texted her saying hey you know how the neighbours are do you mind keeping it down. She ignored it and kept being loud until security came to our door to warn us. I never even brought it up. In the morning I wake overhearing her friend asking her “ what if she bitches to her dad about it”. She replies with “he’ll do nothing her dad’s a pussy.” At this point after everything she has caused all the drama, inconveniencing and now disrespecting my dad is what infuriates me I don’t know what to do. I simply cannot live with a person like this anymore.",0,1769669145.0,badroommates,1,0.5,False

1qq1a64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qq1a64,"Cornad, Bangkok","Currently staying in the Conrad in Bangkok. Checked in yesterday, with two separate bookings. One with Amex and one directly through Hilton. This seemed to be a little challenging, but they managed to check us in eventually. Amex promo for 3rd night free was first charged, but swiftly removed from the bill after we noticed. We also received vouchers for canapes and a drink, to use in the lobby bar.

The Amex credit converts to 2885THB, and can be used in restaurants, bars and room service. We had reserved a Thai dessert cooking class, as offered with Conrad Moments. Unfortunately the credit could not be used towards that. 

The room booked through Amex was originally booked to ”Premium King High-floor”, and one week before arriving, the app showed our upgrade to ”Grand Premium room”. The room booked through Hilton directly, was to a regular ”Deluxe Room”, and like the other booking, it was upgraded one week prior to arrival to the ”Premium King High-floor”. Concierge reached out one week prior, to arrange anything we’d need, and also confirmed our upgrades. eStandby upgrades showed upgrade to ”Executive King room” for 215THB++/night, which would’ve been a steal, but unfortunately not available when checking in.

Arriving to our room, we noticed that the rooms seem somewhat run down, even though they are supposed to be recently renovated. This however is my personal opinion, and I don’t have previous stays in this hotel before the renovations. The Grand Premium room is spacious, and there is a nice view when taking a bath. We quite immediately ordered some fruits and cake to the room. The order was delivered pretty quickly, in about 20 minutes. Honestly, I expected the fruit to be more flavorful and ripe, which was a little disappointing. The cake and drinks were good though!

Both rooms were booked with Hilton Gold status, so we received complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is served on the 2nd floor. I found the breakfast cafe/restaurant to be quite small, and actually very crowded. Coffee was brought to table, and ice coffees and iced thai tea was available too. Some made to order options were available too. Food was good, and the pastries really impressed us!

The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the nearest BTS station. The bus runs every 5-15 minutes, and we found it extremely nice, even though the walk wouldn’t be too long.

We also booked the Pickleball practise, included in Conrad Moments, and we found it pretty fun. It was quite hot, as we played in the sun, so definitely wear light colored clothes. Tennis and Pickleball courts can be reserved in advance, and each room includes 1 hour free per night. Equipment is available for rental.

Quite frankly, there is nothing wrong with the hotel. I just think we had our expectations higher, and were hoping for that wow factor. Unfortunately we were not amazed. If you can get an Executive Suite room in DoubleTree Ploenchit for about the same rate as in Conrad (which you can), I’d say it’s a better choice. The rooms are in better condition, but the hotel lacks some additional services that Conrad offers, like a better pool and tennis court.",20,1769669007.0,Hilton,8,0.96,False
1qq1a2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlopeciaBarbae/comments/1qq1a2w/caffeine_is_the_culprit_or_is_it/,Caffeine is the culprit… or is it? ☕️🤔,"Hey everyone,

You’ve probably seen those viral-style posts (or similar ones) claiming: “If you’re wondering if your hair loss is from caffeine… IT IS!” They get shared a lot in hair loss subs, especially blaming coffee for alopecia areata, alopecia barbae (beard patches), or general thinning. There are plenty of anecdotes from people who say quitting coffee “cured” their beard alopecia—before/after pics of patches filling in after dropping their daily brew.

That resonated with me. For years, I was a full-time firefighter/EMT, and anyone in the fire service knows: there’s always a pot of coffee going at the station—24/7, ready for that 2 a.m. medical transport call when you need to stay sharp. I was a heavy coffee guy: 4–6+ cups a day of strong, home-brewed coffee (often from whole beans I ground fresh). And I grew a full, thick beard with zero problems—no patches, no thinning, nothing.

Then, a couple years ago, I moved right next to a Starbucks. Convenience took over: I started grabbing my morning coffee there every day. About a year into that routine… bald spots appeared in my beard. First one small patch, then more, then overall thinning. What changed? My coffee habit had been heavy for years with no issues—until I switched to that pre-ground chain routine.

So I started researching. I read through tons of those coffee-quit anecdotes for beard/hair loss. Many claimed stopping coffee fixed their alopecia barbae or slowed shedding. But digging into the details—especially stories naming brands—a pattern stood out: Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks popped up disproportionately as the “problem” ones. Not random home coffee—mostly chain pre-ground or bulk stuff. People noted things like “Dunkin’ wrecked my facial hair until I quit.”

That made me wonder: Why those brands in particular? They’re big users of pre-ground (bulk tins, pods, in-store brewing from pre-ground). So I looked into what differentiates pre-ground from fresh whole-bean.

The key difference? Pre-ground coffee often comes from large-scale industrial processing: beans stockpiled in huge warehouses before roasting/grinding. Those bulk piles can pick up trace insect contaminants (FDA allows low “unavoidable” levels in foods like this—up to \~10% of green beans can be insect-infested/damaged per FDA defect guidelines, mostly from pests like beetles, but storage insects including cockroaches can occur). Grinding mixes everything uniformly, distributing any traces evenly throughout the final product—meaning consistent daily micro-exposures.

This ties into a documented anecdote from biologist Dr. Douglas Emlen (shared on NPR in 2009, fact-checked by Snopes, Food & Wine, Treehugger, etc.). He described his entomology professor/advisor who, after years of handling cockroaches in labs (a common “lab rat” insect for entomology), developed a severe allergy to them. The professor started getting identical allergic reactions from pre-ground coffee in tins/bulk packs—but not from whole-bean fresh-ground. Why pre-ground specifically? The bulk stockpiles and grinding process made trace insect proteins (allergens) more uniformly present and detectable to his sensitized system. He had to detour for fresh-ground whole-bean to avoid it.

It’s not that every pre-ground bag is loaded—FDA regs keep levels low and safe for most people (similar to allowed traces in chocolate, spices, grains). But for someone already sensitized (e.g., via occupational exposure or building sensitivity over time), those consistent micro-doses in pre-ground could trigger chronic low-grade allergic responses—cytokines, immune activation, subtle inflammation—while whole-bean/fresh-ground skips much of the bulk exposure and even distribution.

Chronic low-grade inflammation from allergies is a known contributor to hair loss: it can trigger telogen effluvium (shedding), exacerbate autoimmune alopecia areata/barbae (immune attack on follicles), or worsen patterns via ongoing stress.

No large studies prove “pre-ground contaminants → alopecia” (variables are huge: individual sensitivity, exact exposure, genetics), but the mechanism is highly plausible for a subset—especially if allergies or immune issues are in play.

For me? Switching back to fresh whole-bean grinds (home-grinding each time) dramatically slowed shedding, and beard patches started filling in. No other big lifestyle changes—just ditching pre-ground. The timeline matches perfectly.

TL;DR / Conclusion:

Caffeine (or coffee itself) might not be the real culprit—some research even shows topical caffeine can help block DHT for hair growth! But in some cases, trace contaminants/allergens in pre-ground coffee (from industrial bulk processing and uniform grinding) could lead to low-grade allergic inflammation → systemic immune stress → autoimmune-ish hair loss flares (like alopecia barbae). If your issues started/worsened with chain/pre-ground coffee (Starbucks, Dunkin’, etc.), try fresh whole-bean grinds and see. Consider cockroach/insect allergen testing if it fits your history.

Anyone else notice brand-specific differences (chains vs. home brew)? Or regrowth after switching to whole beans? Share your experiences—let’s compare!",2,1769669000.0,AlopeciaBarbae,10,1.0,False

Their dynamic makes me uncomfortable my girlfriend does a lot for her, like picking up her kids, hiding her overnight bags in our apartment, and running errands. I’ve told my girlfriend that this makes me uneasy and asked her to keep the relationship work‑relatede, but the rides still happen.

Tonight was particularly hard for me. I’ve been dealing with a lot of family stress, and my depression has been heavier. I really wanted some comforting time with her. She told me she was on her way home, then stopped texting. I saw through location sharing that she was near the building, and later she texted saying they couldn’t find parking.

I had made coffee and was waiting for her so we could decompress together. When I tried to tell her why I felt upset and triggered, she said I “start problems for fun” and that I’m only reacting this way because of what’s going on with my family.

Here’s what’s happening with my family:

• My mom 52F is moving back here with my younger brother 20M after losing her job and apartment. But they have no where to live and barely any savings.

• My younger sister 23F recently left an abusive relationship and is staying with my older sister 30F, who is also struggling herself so she only gave her a month.

• My older brother 28M is renting my spare room, so I don’t have space to take in anyone else.

• Another sister 24F is also dealing with her own problems.

We grew up in an abusive household and we’re very close, so seeing multiple siblings struggle at once has been mentally draining for me. I’ve also tried not to dump too much on my girlfriend because she recently went through something painful with her brother 22M, who lived with us before being sent back to Ecuador.

Something else I’ve been struggling with is that I feel like my problems aren’t “real” problems compared to hers. I minimize what I’m going through because I know her situation with her brother hurt her deeply. But this has made me feel like my pain isn’t taken seriously, like she believes her struggles matter more and mine don’t carry weight. It leaves me feeling guilty for needing support and ashamed for having emotions at all. I even at times feel that my problems truly aren’t real problems. I fear I’m being dramatic and that everything I feel is just too much. I try to stop feeling but I can’t. I want to sleep it all away but I can’t because I have to get up and go to work. I’m emotionally exhausted and I’m trying very hard not to lose my battle but it’s even harder not having a person. I thought she would be my person. But it’s like she’s only focused on her life and her goals and I don’t matter. I question why I’m around.",1,1769668614.0,Advice,8,1.0,False

About a year into that routine… bald spots appeared in my beard. First one small patch, then more, then overall thinning. What changed? My coffee habit had been heavy for years with no issues—until I switched to that pre-ground chain routine.

So I started researching. I read through tons of those coffee-quit anecdotes for beard/hair loss. Many claimed stopping coffee fixed their alopecia barbae or slowed shedding. But digging into the details—especially stories naming brands—a pattern stood out: Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks popped up disproportionately as the “problem” ones. Not random home coffee—mostly chain pre-ground or bulk stuff. People noted things like “Dunkin’ wrecked my facial hair until I quit.”

That made me wonder: Why those brands in particular? They’re big users of pre-ground (bulk tins, pods, in-store brewing from pre-ground). So I looked into what differentiates pre-ground from fresh whole-bean.

The key difference? Pre-ground coffee often comes from large-scale industrial processing: beans stockpiled in huge warehouses before roasting/grinding. Those bulk piles can pick up trace insect contaminants (FDA allows low “unavoidable” levels in foods like this—up to \~10% of green beans can be insect-infested/damaged per FDA defect guidelines, mostly from pests like beetles, but storage insects including cockroaches can occur). Grinding mixes everything uniformly, distributing any traces evenly throughout the final product—meaning consistent daily micro-exposures.

This ties into a documented anecdote from biologist Dr. Douglas Emlen (shared on NPR in 2009, fact-checked by Snopes, Food & Wine, Treehugger, etc.). He described his entomology professor/advisor who, after years of handling cockroaches in labs (a common “lab rat” insect for entomology), developed a severe allergy to them. The professor started getting identical allergic reactions from pre-ground coffee in tins/bulk packs—but not from whole-bean fresh-ground. Why pre-ground specifically? The bulk stockpiles and grinding process made trace insect proteins (allergens) more uniformly present and detectable to his sensitized system. He had to detour for fresh-ground whole-bean to avoid it.

It’s not that every pre-ground bag is loaded—FDA regs keep levels low and safe for most people (similar to allowed traces in chocolate, spices, grains). But for someone already sensitized (e.g., via occupational exposure or building sensitivity over time), those consistent micro-doses in pre-ground could trigger chronic low-grade allergic responses—cytokines, immune activation, subtle inflammation—while whole-bean/fresh-ground skips much of the bulk exposure and even distribution.

Chronic low-grade inflammation from allergies is a known contributor to hair loss: it can trigger telogen effluvium (shedding), exacerbate autoimmune alopecia areata/barbae (immune attack on follicles), or worsen patterns via ongoing stress.

No large studies prove “pre-ground contaminants → alopecia” (variables are huge: individual sensitivity, exact exposure, genetics), but the mechanism is highly plausible for a subset—especially if allergies or immune issues are in play.

For me? Switching back to fresh whole-bean grinds (home-grinding each time) dramatically slowed shedding, and beard patches started filling in. No other big lifestyle changes—just ditching pre-ground. The timeline matches perfectly.

TL;DR / Conclusion:

Caffeine (or coffee itself) might not be the real culprit—some research even shows topical caffeine can help block DHT for hair growth! But in some cases, trace contaminants/allergens in pre-ground coffee (from industrial bulk processing and uniform grinding) could lead to low-grade allergic inflammation → systemic immune stress → autoimmune-ish hair loss flares (like alopecia barbae). If your issues started/worsened with chain/pre-ground coffee (Starbucks, Dunkin’, etc.), try fresh whole-bean grinds and see. Consider cockroach/insect allergen testing if it fits your history.

Anyone else notice brand-specific differences (chains vs. home brew)? Or regrowth after switching to whole beans? Share your experiences—let’s compare!",2,1769668495.0,alopecia_areata,4,0.75,False

Chapter 1 Deceptive
Cecilia's pov

My werewolf mate had cheated on me.

I stood outside the Alpha conference room and through the half-open doorway, I witnessed him entangled with another female werewolf. His fingers threaded through her blonde hair and his l\*\*s pressed against her n\*\*k, just as he had once done to me. Even though as a human I couldn't feel the pain of a torn mate bond, the sight still made me choke with nausea.

Eight years of my life melted into pieces in this moment. My legs frozen, my heels nailed to the marble floor. An inner voice laughed at my naivety-a human trying to hold onto a werewolf's heart forever. My throat tightened and my stomach turned, and I forced myself not to break down on the spot.

After what felt like an eternity, I finally raised my hand and knocked.

""Come in,"" a deep, husky voice called from inside.

My fingers tightened around the files I was holding, my knuckles turning white as I struggled to maintain my composure. The other pack members might sense my distress if I lose control. As a human married to the Alpha of Blood Moon Pack, I had learned to mask my emotions well.

As I pushed the door open, I forced my l\*\*s into a practiced smile. I walked directly to Xavier's side, careful not to inhale too deeply. I didn't want to smell her on him – that other female whose scent had been lingering around our home for weeks.

""Busy?"" I asked, my tone deliberately light. ""I have some documents that need your signature.""

My question was purely rhetorical. I had already placed the files in front of him, helpfully turned to the pages requiring his signature. My perfect act, still performing even as my heart turned to stone.

Xavier had just returned from Switzerland this morning. He'd gone straight to the office to catch up on work, and his desk was already covered with paperwork. Fatigue marked his handsome face, though I knew the real reason for his exhaustion had nothing to do with business meetings. Without even glancing at what I'd brought, he signed every document.

""Thanks for handling this,"" he said, still not looking up.

I gathered the signed papers, tucking them carefully against my chest. ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?"" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

""I've got plans. Don't wait up for me,"" he replied dismissively, attention already shifted back to his computer.

""Alright, I'll see you later then,"" I said, turning to leave.

The moment my back was to him, my smile twisted into something cold and bitter. The facade of the devoted Luna crumbled with each step I took toward the door.

As I passed the attached rest area of his office, I heard a soft thump from inside, like someone small trying to move quietly. My eyes darted to the side, taking in the scene: scattered snack packages on the coffee table, a half-empty bubble tea, and a pale pink high heel toppled on its side on the floor.

At that instant, my heart turned to ash.

The walk back to my own office depleted whatever energy I had left. I collapsed into my chair, exhaling a long, defeated breath. From among the stack of papers, I pulled out one specific document.

Divorce papers.

I flipped to the final page, tracing Xavier's signature with a mixture of vindication and sorrow. Memories flooded my mind... how he'd once vowed that I was his one true mate, how fiercely he had pursued me in high school, insisting that even though I was a human, the Moon Goddess had destined us for each other. I remembered how Dora, his mother and the Elder Luna, had sneered at me, warning me not to get too comfortable. ""Wolves may claim to mate for life,"" she'd said, ""but an Alpha male will never be satisfied with just one woman, especially a human one.""

I had defended him then. ""Xavier is different,"" I'd insisted. ""Our bond is different.""

How naive I had been.

He wasn't different at all. He'd cheated with a younger wolf girl, foolishly believing he was hiding it well. While enjoying the thrill of his infidelity. He'd even taken her on his business trip, and then had the audacity to bring her back to the pack's headquarters.

I snapped a photo of his signature and sent it to Luna Dora with a simple message: He signed it.

A week ago, I had negotiated terms with Luna Dora. She wanted me to initiate the divorce quietly, keeping our secret marriage from becoming pack gossip. In return, I demanded ten million dollars in compensation. In one month, Xavier would be completely removed from my life.

...

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.

I quickly hid the divorce papers. ""Come in,"" I called out.

Henry, Xavier's Beta assistant, entered my office.

""Luna Cecilia, Alpha Xavier asked me to deliver this to you,"" he said, placing a dark green velvet box on my desk.

I opened it casually, revealing an obscenely expensive diamond set. But instead of feeling pleased, all I could picture was the short-haired girl wearing nothing but a bathrobe, playfully dangling a similar diamond necklace. I imagined the dim, romantic lighting, the rumpled bedsheets, and the k\*\*s marks dotting her n\*\*k and chest that Xavier had left as he betrayed me.

The bile of betrayal rose in my throat, thick and bitter. I reminded myself—one more month. Just one. I've had enough of playing the dutiful Luna in a kingdom built on lies. Nothing will derail my exit this time.

""Thank you, Beta Henry,"" I said, looking up with eyes that could cut glass.

""The Alpha picked it himself,"" he added hastily, voice cracking. ""It's one of a kind. There's nothing else like it in the world.""

Pity his loyalty wasn't as rare as his taste in jewelry. I had no desire to wear anything he'd touched after touching her.

I curled my l\*\*s into a smile sharp enough to draw blood. ""How thoughtful of him,"" I said sweetly. ""Imagine finding time for jewelry shopping in between board meetings... and bedroom visits.""

I could practically hear Beta Henry's soul trying to climb out of his body. They didn't expect that I knew Xavier had cheated on me long ago. Fear radiated from him as he quickly excused himself from my office.

Once he fled, I stared down at the diamonds like they were crawling with maggots.

My fingers flew over the screen, finding the contact saved as 'LUXE RESALE - Elena'. The photo attached with a satisfying ping. My message was terse, final:

【This set. Sell immediately. Liquidate. Donate every cent to the Sunrise Pediatric Rehab Center.】

【Estimated market value exceeds $500,000. Are you sure?】

【Looking at it makes me sick. Get rid of it. Yesterday.】

【...Okay.】
Chapter 2 Shattered Illusions
Cecilia's pov

5:00 PM. Parking garage.

I had just reached my car and was opening the door when my eyes inadvertently drifted across the lot. A sleek black SUV was already running, and through the window, I could see Xavier in the back seat. Pressed against him was a girl with short hair and a round, youthful face, radiating the boundless energy of youth that apparently my Alpha mate found irresistible.

""Alpha Xavier!"" Beta Henry's panicked voice rang out as tires screeched. He slammed on the brakes, but it was too late.

Through the thick pane of glass, Xavier's eyes locked with mine. His gaze flared, black with fury.

Mine stayed flat. Dead. Hollow.

Across that silence, the girl noticed me—but instead of pulling away, she doubled down, looping her arms around his n\*\*k, her l\*\*s brushing his ear with a whisper.

My eyes burned as if someone had thrown acid into them. The partial mate bond, even incomplete as ours was, made witnessing his betrayal physically painful. I know it - she's publicly challenging my position as Luna..

I tore my gaze away, slipped into my car, and drove off without a second glance in their direction. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to confront them, to challenge her—but I wasn't a wolf. I was just a human who had been foolish enough to believe in forever with an Alpha.

When I arrived home to our spacious apartment, I barely had time to set down my bag before movement outside the window caught my eye. Xavier's car pulled into the garage below, its headlights sweeping across the concrete. The sight of it made my stomach clench with a mix of dread and simmering anger.

I stood in our walk-in closet, removing the diamond necklace he'd given me last month—another guilt offering I now realized—when a wall of muscle pressed against my back. The familiar cedar cold scent that had once brought me comfort now made my skin crawl.

Xavier braced his hands on the glass cabinet on either side of me, leaning down to peer at my face from the side. ""Are you angry?"" His voice carried that commanding Alpha tone that had once made me weak at the knees.

Without looking at him, I carefully placed the necklace back in its box with deliberate slowness. My voice was ice when I finally spoke. ""Angry enough to commit murder. You'd better watch your back.""

Xavier stared at me in silence for a long moment, his wolf clearly assessing the threat in my words. Finally, he spoke again, his tone carefully measured. ""The White family is interested in collaborating with us on the Nova Star project. I've been in discussions with Gavin, their eldest son. The girl you saw is his sister.""

""What, you need to get cozy with his sister to secure his business?"" I turned to face him, my gaze piercing. ""Is that how Blood Moon Pack conducts business now?""

""Cecilia, I'm trying to explain. Stop with the attitude!"" His Alpha voice slipped out, a desperate attempt to control the situation.

""There's nothing to explain,"" I finally turned to look at him, my eyes clear and cold, peering into his soul. ""Xavier, if you're tired of me and want her to be the Luna of this pack, I'm willing to step aside.""

Xavier's face darkened instantly. ""What did you just say?"" His wolfish side is about to appear, eyes flashing with gold.

I sighed. ""I said, we can get divorced.""

When I tried to walk away, he grabbed me and pulled me back forcefully. Xavier gripped my chin, his fingers pressing into my skin as he growled a warning. ""You'd better not even think about that.""

I remained silent.

Not only had I thought about it—I'd already set it in motion.

I.

Was.

Done with him.

Xavier stayed home late that night, but was summoned away by a phone call. I clearly heard a soft, feminine voice on the other end, whimpering like she was crying.

The next morning, my lawyer friend and confidante, Harper sent me a screenshot: his little girlfriend's latest social media update. It showed a sunrise from a mountaintop, with two hands forming a heart shape—one large, one small. The caption read: ""Sunrise hearts with my soulmate. ""

I recognized Xavier's hand immediately. The bond between us may have been incomplete, but I knew every inch of him—every scar, every callus.

I sat there, holding my water glass for who knows how long.

For several days after that, Xavier didn't come home.

We only saw each other at company meetings. He sat in the center seat as Alpha, while I sat with the other executives. We never once made eye contact during those meetings.I didn't bother going to his office.

In my spare time, I busied myself with finding a new place to live, viewing apartments, and getting rid of all the gifts he'd given me over the years—anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding gifts... I even sold my wedding ring.

When you no longer want the person, what's the point in keeping the emotional garbage of your past?

...

That evening, Ana, the owner of the Jade Palace club, invited me out. It was nearly eleven o'clock, and I initially didn't want to go, but considering that after divorcing and leaving Blood Moon Pack's company, I would need my own network of connections to start my business, I decided to accept.

As soon as I entered the club, I spotted Ana.

""Ana, I could have found my way up. You didn't need to come down,"" I said with a smile that didn't reach my eyes.

Ana linked her arm with mine affectionately as we entered the elevator. ""I was worried you might get lost, honey. You've never been here before, right?""

That was true. This was my first time here.

We went upstairs, and Ana led me into a large private room divided by an ornate Chinese-style screen in the center.

Upon entering, I noticed several people on the other side of the screen, but Ana didn't lead me there. Instead, she took me to the side where only one person sat—someone who looked vaguely familiar. I recognized her as the girlfriend of one of Xavier's friends.

She seemed to recognize me too, and her expression turned awkward, though she managed a small smile.

After I took off my coat and sat down, Ana left again.

I took a sip of the drink placed before me, and gradually the boisterous conversation from the other side of the screen reached my ears. As they continued talking, they began discussing me.

""When it comes to this, Xavier hasn't brought that human to the party lately,"" a voice said with contempt.

""It's obvious. Cici has purebred Alpha heritage—young, gorgeous, and the real deal. Xavier flaunts her at every event like she's some prize jewel. He doesn't bother hiding his human wife anymore."" Another voice echoes.

""I finally got my idea. After eight years, Xavier finally figured out the importance of bloodline.""

""No matter how beautiful a human is, it's just a plaything. Eight years, tsk, it's so patient. What can human women have? They can't even mark it.""

""And she is so stubid, she has been fooled for so long and kept in the dark. She think she can really be Luna? She has been useless for so many years except for a beautiful face and a good figure.""

Someone laughed, ""I want to say that when Xavier is completely tired of it, I don't mind taking over to show her what another wolf is like.. I've been coveting that slim w\*\*\*t for a long time.""

""Be careful, human women cannot withstand the power of our werewolf,"" another voice joined in teasing with a nasty hint.

I stood around the corner, my eyes cold. I was very familiar with these voices - they were all Xavier's friends, and they called me ""Luna"" intimately when they saw me. Now that they had revealed their true faces, and just treated me as a joke in their circle.

The woman sitting with me looked so uncomfortable she couldn't even meet my eyes. When she saw me stand up, she probably thought I was going to flee in humiliation.

Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and walked toward the screen. I leaned against it casually and joined their conversation in a relaxed tone.

""Gentlemen, I couldn't help overhearing—and I think you've got the story a little backward.""

Their laughter choked off.

""When Xavier first got with me,"" I continued, tilting my head with mock sweetness, ""he was just a sweet little virgin Alpha, all awkward hands and wide-eyed promises. If anyone's been doing the using for the past eight years... wouldn't that be me?""

Silence.

Absolute, stunned silence.

Everyone on the couch stared at me in horror.

And then—

Two tall figures stepped into the room behind me.

I didn't turn. I didn't need to.

Their presence spoke for itself.

And judging by the looks on their faces, everyone else in the room got the message loud and clear.

Dam.
Chapter 3 Confrontations and Broken Promises
Cecilia's pov

Xavier stood behind me, his face ice-cold with rage.

My wolf mate—no, soon-to-be ex-mate—was watching this whole scene go down.

I turned back to face the group, my eyes landing on the pixie-cut girl sitting in the corner of the sofa. Just moments ago, she'd been crossing her legs confidently, twirling her hair around her finger with a smug expression. Now her face had completely soured, looking at me like she wanted to rip my head off.

So this was where they'd been having their little meetups. From the casual way these men spoke, this wasn't the first time. They were already showing up in public together without any attempt to hide their relationship.

Xavier stepped forward, his Alpha presence taking over the room.

Suddenly, like puppets yanked by their strings, everyone sprang into motion.

""Luna Cecilia, we're so sorry, we were just talking trash,"" one of them stammered, the title 'Luna' ringing hollow now.

""Luna Cecilia, there's nothing going on between Xavier and Miss White,"" another added desperately.

""Luna Cecilia, please don't read into any of this.""

Xavier grabbed my wrist, his grip firm as he tried to drag me toward the exit. Our partial bond sparked painfully at his t\*\*\*h, a cruel reminder of what we once had.

I spun around and threw my drink directly into his face.

The room went dead silent.

Everyone watched with b\*\*\*\*\*g eyes, their shock obvious. How dare a human challenge an Alpha wolf in public?

My wolf instincts should be screaming at me to submit if I had any—but I didn't. I was just a human who had finally hit her limit.

The next moment, I smiled sweetly and said, ""Go ahead and keep partying with your little sweetheart. I won't crash your fun anymore.""

I tried to pry his fingers from my wrist, our bond crackling with each t\*\*\*h.

Xavier's face turned dangerous, his wolf clearly going nuts beneath the surface. Without warning, he hoisted me up and threw me over his shoulder.

Everyone in the room: ""...""

In the hallway, I fought like god against his grip, dangling over his shoulder.

The elevator doors opened right on time.

As Xavier hauled me into the elevator and turned around, I saw a man—his tall frame took up half the Dam elevator. The tailored black suit showed off broad shoulders and a powerful silhouette, and expensive leather shoes complemented his long, lean legs. Even his casual stance showed the power contained within, and his presence was overwhelming.

The elevator instantly felt suffocating.

I couldn't help but look up at him as we prepared to leave. What hit my eyes was a handsome, angular face with deep-set eyes beneath steel-gray werewolf eyes that radiated danger. He surveyed me with obvious disdain, his thin l\*\*s slightly pursed, his jawline sharp as a blade. Such an intensely aggressive face, but with an aristocratic elegance and cold detachment.

I quickly covered my face and looked down again. My human senses might be weak compared to a wolf's, but even I could feel the power radiating from that stranger. An Alpha, definitely—and not just any Alpha.

Outside the club, Xavier tossed me into the back seat of his car before climbing in himself.

I struggled to sit up, dizzy from being carried upside down and then thrown around. My head was spinning, and I felt like I might have a concussion.

Xavier grabbed wet wipes from the car's glove compartment and started cleaning his face.

My sharp eyes caught sight of what looked like a protection package behind the tissue box. Evidence of his cheating was literally everywhere. His accusatory voice filled the car, ""What were you doing there? Trying to catch me red-handed?""

I opened the car door, intending to get out. This car felt toxic.

""Cecilia!"" Xavier growled, yanking me back inside. ""Where do you think you're going? Don't you know when to quit?""

My breathing quickened as I pressed my fingertips together to calm myself. ""I want to go home,"" I managed to say.

Xavier called Beta Henry, who had been waiting outside the club, to drive us.

The entire ride home, neither of us spoke. I sat as far away from him as possible, my face pale as if I might puke any moment. The scent of alcohol clung to him—sharp, heady, and laced with a perfume that definitely wasn't mine.

At home, I immediately got out of the car.

In the kitchen, I chugged an entire glass of ice water before I felt somewhat better.

When I came out, Xavier was sitting in the living room. I went over and sat down.

Another crushing silence fell between us until Xavier finally spoke. ""I was there for business. You storming into the club and causing a scene like that—you've really embarrassed me. Don't you realize how stubid and pathetic you look right now, making a scene like that?""

""That it?"" I responded calmly, my emotions locked away behind walls of ice.

""If you still want us to have a future together, drop these paranoid suspicions. I don't have time to deal with your drama.""

""Got it. That it?"" My voice remained steady.

""..."" Xavier scowled deeply. ""Cecilia, do you know how irritating you're being right now?""

I stood up, a slight smile curving my l\*\*s.

Soon enough, you won't have to deal with me anymore.

I went upstairs.

After showering, Xavier slid under the covers beside me. In the darkness, I lay on my side facing away from him, shifting further toward the edge of the bed to avoid any physical contact. Among wolves, t\*\*\*h was sacred—it strengthened the bond between mates. But we weren't true mates, were we? Our bond was never real, and now it was falling apart completely.

Xavier turned and pulled me forcefully into his arms, dragging me from the edge of the bed into his embrace with barely controlled anger.

His tall, strong body easily overpowered mine. Once he tightened his grip, I couldn't move at all.

I spent the entire night stiff as a board in his arms, imagining the same arms wrapped around Cici White.

In the morning, I made breakfast just for myself.

Xavier came downstairs and saw me sitting alone eating toast. He was about to leave but turned around and approached the dining area, leaning down to whisper in my ear in a gentler voice, as if trying to sweet-talk me: ""This weekend, let's go out on the boat for a couple of days. Just the two of us.""

I continued drinking my milk and gave a noncommittal ""Mmm"" under my breath.

Not surprisingly, by the day before the weekend, he canceled again, saying he needed to fly to Hong Kong.

I felt nothing. Not even a hint of disappointment.

Perhaps he hadn't even realized how long it had been since we'd shared a meal together or truly spent time with each other. His words warned me against thinking of divorce, but in reality, he treated me like I was invisible. If I disappeared one day, he probably wouldn't even notice.

That weekend, I removed my books from our shared bookshelf and packed them in a suitcase to take to my new place.

While sorting through them, I received a rare call from Dora.

I answered politely, ""Hello, Luna Dora.""

Dora responded with cold arrogance, ""Get over here. About what we discussed before—let's make it official.""

""Is that really necessary?"" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

""I say it is, so it is,"" she snapped, her authority as Elder Luna evident in her tone.

""Fine, I'll come by this afternoon.""

""Be here at noon.""

""Fine.""

Hanging up, I could almost imagine Dora's nasty face. I bet she'd cooked up some petty scheme to mess with me, nothing more than a sick display of Xavier and that little homewrecker getting intimate. She was probably hoping for me to see those two scumbags going at it, wasn't she? After all, in her eyes, only a pureblood werewolf was worthy of her precious son. But sadly, that wouldn't break me.

I didn't care what kind of game she was playing. Bring it on, my dear mother-in-law Dora!
Chapter 4 He Just Doesn't Care.
Cecilia's pov

At 11:40 a.m.

My silhouette appeared in front of the Grimm family mansion, the territory of the Blood Moon Pack. The scent of pine and earth hit my nostrils, uncomfortably familiar.

This had been a second home, and now every visit made me feel like a stranger. The pack's werewolf steward's eyes went wide when he saw me at the door.

""Lu...Luna Cecilia."" He stammered out, his eyes darting around nervously. Obviously he knew someone was coming today, but didn't think it would be me. He was already sweating bullets.

In the social circle of the wolves, our civil marriage was like a dirty little secret.

The marriage certificate was hidden away, as if it were some kind of embarrassing liability, known only to both parents, Beta Henry and a few inner-circle members.

In the world of the wolves, one is never truly accepted without a formal mate ceremony. For the past eight years, I'd been nothing more than an oddity, a barely tolerated human woman. Every time I attended a wolf gathering, the dirty looks reminded me: You're just an outsider, someone who could get tossed aside at any time.

""Please... Follow me."" The butler approached reluctantly, as if he were about to walk to his execution.

Before we could reach the living room foyer, a sickeningly sweet flirtation pierced the air: ""I win again! Xavier, are you going easy on me?""

My footsteps stopped cold. My brain went blank for three seconds before all the clues clicked into place. This was why he bailed on our weekend date - the so-called ""business trip"".

""Ha."" A cold laugh escaped my l\*\*s as I continued to walk forward.

Xavier's eyes went huge when he looked up and saw me, ""What are you doing here?"" His tone sharp as a blade. ""Your mother invited me."" I said coldly, sarcasm dripping from my voice, ""That's rich, shouldn't you be in Hong Kong right now? Since when did you develop teleportation powers?""

His eyelashes fluttered rapidly - a telltale sign of guilt I knew by heart after our years together.

The Shadow Pack she-wolf on the couch - Cici White - deliberately sauntered over to extend her hand.

The room reeked of her mingling with Xavier, and the nausea made my stomach lurch. ""Hi\~ I'm Cici!"" She flashed a fake smile, clearly trying to get under my skin.

I didn't even look at the outstretched hand. In the pack hierarchy, even as a human, I'm still nominally the Luna of the Blood Moon Pack - even if it's just a title.

No point in stooping to her level. Dora Green, The Blood Moon Pack' elder Luna, appeared at the door right on cue.

She gave Cici an affectionate, warm greeting before looking me up and down with trash-can eyes: ""Having fun dear? Just make yourself comfortable."" her voice to Cici was sweet as honey.

Turning to me, her tone immediately turned to ice, ""This is a manager from our company, Cecilia, here on work stuff."" Everyone in the room knew my identity perfectly well, but she deliberately demoted me to a regular employee.

This was her way of announcing to everyone that for Xavier and Cici's possible marriage, I, a human wife, wasn't even a speed bump.

Cici lifted her chin smugly, ""Oh\~ so she's just an employee."" Every word carried the attitude of a wolf marking territory.

I ignored their stares, locking my gaze straight onto Xavier's face. I wanted to see how he would react-would he stick up for me? Would he acknowledge my position?

But his face was cold and hard as marble, he didn't even flinch. He didn't care that his mother had publicly humiliated me.

""Luna Dora,"" I looked directly at Dora, keeping my voice level, ""Since you brought me here on purpose, why don't you just say what you want to talk about?""

""Some other time."" She dismissed me arrogantly, as if shooing away a servant, ""Since you're here, stay here for lunch."" She didn't even look at me when she said this, as if I only deserved this kind of brush-off.

""Thanks, but I have plans."" I felt a dull ache in my chest as I turned, but I still kept my spine straight. For eight years, I had gotten used to pretending not to see their contempt in this house.

""When an elder tells you to stay and eat, what's with the attitude? No manners whatsoever."" Dora Green snapped behind me, her voice loaded with contempt and disdain.

I stopped. Twenty days, I silently calculated to myself. Twenty days left to file the divorce papers. What was another twenty days of humiliation?

""Fine, I'll stay."" I turned to meet her eyes and sneered. I walked straight to the table and sat down off to the side.

But Dora clearly had no intention of letting me off the hook. She looked around proudly and suddenly said, ""Why don't you make yourself useful and pour tea for everyone?""

A few snickers went around the dinner table. I balled my fists - that's what she really wanted me to stay for, to serve tea like a servant was a deliberate demotion, a public stripping of my status.

""What, you won't even do that much?"" She scoffed, ""Humans really can't be trusted, they don't even know the most basic etiquette.""

I slowly stood up, picked up the teapot, and walked over to her with a sweet smile. To everyone's shock, I poured hot tea over her perfectly styled hair.

""I'm sorry, Luna Dora,"" I said, setting down the teapot in the sweetest voice, ""my human hands are just so clumsy. Hope you enjoyed this cup of 'tea'?""

The dining room went dead silent, save for the sound of tea dripping down Dora's frozen cheeks.
Chapter 5 The Man Feels So Familiar.
Cecilia's pov

The rain had stopped by the time I drove off the property.

In the rearview mirror, the gates of Blood Moon Pack disappeared.

For the first time in eight years, I felt true relief.

Pulling out my cell phone, I sent Dora a message, ""Dear Dora, I assume you've received that little surprise. Remember our agreement - the ten million must be transferred into my account by noon tomorrow. Otherwise, I don't mind letting everyone know how the Luna of Blood Moon Pack pulled dirty tricks against a human daughter-in-law.""

The phone quickly vibrated. Dora's reply came surprisingly fast, ""You Beach!""

I laughed softly and sent another message, ""Is the tea hot enough? If it needs more heat, I can always come back and add some fuel to the fire.""

Turning off my cell phone, I took a deep breath. I might be destined to be the underdog in this game with the wolves, but I would never make it easy for them. Xavier betrayed me, Dora humiliated me, so in return, I would make them pay what they owe.

Money? It was pocket change to them. But it was worth the deal to make that arrogant Luna suffer, and to show the man who betrayed me what his mother really was.

""Goodbye, Blood Moon Pack,"" I said, hitting the gas.

...

The road stretched before me as I drove through the increasingly heavy rain. My thoughts scattered like the droplets hitting my windshield, memories of eight years flashing through my mind—eight years of being treated like garbage, eight years of hoping for a mating ceremony that would never come.

Suddenly, a flash caught my eye as a yellow motorcycle cut dangerously in front of my car. My heart jumped into my throat as I slammed on the brakes.

BANG--

The impact came from behind, sending me flying forward. My forehead connected with the steering wheel hard. Sharp pain radiated from my temple, and when I looked up, everything was blurred red.

I grabbed a tissue and frantically wiped the blood from my eyes. The yellow motorcycle was long gone, vanished into the downpour like a ghost.

""Tap, tap—""

Someone was at my window. I lowered it, raindrops immediately splashing onto my l\*p.

Outside stood a classy-looking man in his early fifties, wearing glasses and holding a sleek black umbrella. His expression conveyed genuine regret—something I hadn't seen from a wolf in forever.

""Miss, I'm terribly sorry. We're totally at fault for rear-ending you,"" he said with unexpected politeness. ""My employer is in a rush. Would you consider exchanging contact information? You can send us a list of damages, and I assure you we'll take care of everything.""

""I'd prefer to call the cops,"" I replied, my voice strained.

The day's events had pushed me past my breaking point—the confrontation at Xavier's, discovering his betrayal, and now this accident.

I was done playing nice today and didn't have the extra energy to accommodate anyone.

I stepped out into the rain, wincing as droplets hit my wound. The back of my car had a huge dent where the Bentley had smashed into it.

Annoyed, I took photos for evidence and called the police.

The man accepted my decision without argument and returned to the Bentley to report to whoever waited inside.

The rain got worse, pounding against the pavement. My white blouse clung to my skin as I stood exposed to the elements, one hand pressed against my bleeding temple while I spoke with 911.

I returned to my car to escape the downpour, but my clothes were already completely soaked. Within minutes, police arrived, followed by a silver Maybach that pulled up at the same time.

Stepping out again into the rain, I noticed another person exiting the Bentley besides the older man—a tall, lean figure with a silhouette like a Greek god. With aristocratic indifference, his eyes were sharp and deep, in which something wild underneath.

When he caught me staring, he returned my gaze with an intensity that made me shiver, awakening something primal within me.

A weird sense of déjà vu washed over me...

""Give it to her,"" his deep voice commanded, removing the suit jacket from his arm and handing it to the older man. Without another glance in my direction, he strode to the Maybach and disappeared inside.

The older gentleman hurried over with the jacket. ""Miss, you're drenched. Please take this.""

Looking down, I realized with horror that my blouse had become see-through. Heat rushed to my cheeks as I gratefully accepted the jacket and slipped it on. ""Thank you.""

The older gentleman spoke quietly with the police officer while the Maybach drove off, cutting through the curtain of rain. I caught only a fleeting glimpse of the stranger's refined profile, but it stuck with me.

The jacket still held his body heat and carried a distinct scent—sandalwood mixed with something wild and untamed that instantly calmed my frayed nerves.

After the police finished their report and we exchanged information, the older gentleman offered to take me to the hospital for my head wound.

I declined politely, my initial anger having subsided. ""I apologize for being such a pain earlier. I've had the worst day, and I took it out on you. It wasn't even your fault."" I gestured to the jacket. ""I'll have this cleaned and returned to you.""

The older gentleman nodded graciously.

...

As I drove myself to the hospital, Xavier was blowing up my phone.

I laughed coldly - this man was always like that, vanishing when I needed him, and then showing up when I didn't want to see him. Just like now, knowing that I hated his ""white knight"" attitude, he had to play hero at a time like this.

After eight years, he never learned to understand me, or rather, he couldn't be bothered to understand the feelings of a human being. When he should have been by my side, he chose someone else; when I had already decided to let go, he acted like he cared.

What a clueless i\*\*\*t.
Chapter 6 The Wolf's Possessive Nature
Cecilia's pov

I sat in the emergency treatment room, wincing slightly as the doctor cleaned the cut on my forehead. The antiseptic stung, but it was nothing compared to the emotional wounds I'd been nursing all day.

Suddenly, the door burst open with such force that the doctor jumped. Xavier stormed in like a territorial alpha defending his claim, his eyes wild with a mixture of anger and concern. The scent of his distress and dominance filled the small room instantly.

I glanced over my shoulder, meeting his intense gaze. ""It's okay,"" I assured the startled doctor. ""He's my... boss."" The word 'husband' had nearly slipped out from habit, but I caught myself. He wasn't my husband—he never truly had been.

Xavier's throat worked visibly, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed whatever words he'd been about to growl out.

""How serious is it?"" he demanded of the doctor, his voice rough with an emotion I couldn't quite place.

""Just a superficial wound,"" the doctor replied professionally. ""Nothing to worry about.""

The medical professional showed no interest in our complicated relationship, finishing up the bandage on my temple before prescribing some topical medication.

I thanked the doctor and left the room, feeling Xavier's presence behind me like a shadow. In the hallway, he pushed ahead to pay my bill and collect my medication, performing the role of the dutiful husband with an audience present. The irony wasn't lost on me.

I didn't bother arguing. What was the point? My bond with Xavier had been severed the moment I'd seen those messages on his phone.

Outside the hospital, I pulled out my phone to call a rideshare. Xavier snatched it from my hand with the swift reflexes. His arm wrapped around my shoulders, guiding—no, forcing—me toward the parking lot. The possessive gesture might once have made me feel protected; now it felt like chains.

He opened the passenger door and practically shoved me inside before stalking around to the driver's side. The door slammed with enough force to make the car shudder, sealing us in a bubble of tense silence.

""You blocked my number,"" he finally said, turning to face me with a stormy expression. ""Were you trying to kill yourself to punish me?""

I stared at him, momentarily shocked into silence. Then, against all odds, laughter bubbled up from my chest. It was either laugh or cry, and I'd shed enough tears.

The absurdity of his statement—that I would risk my life just to make him feel guilty—was peak narcissism. In eight years together, how had I never noticed this side of him?

""Rest assured,"" I said, reaching for my phone, ""you won't have that burden on your conscience. Now give me back my phone.""

Xavier pulled it away from my grasp. ""I admit I lied to you today, but you ignored her like air, embarrassed her. You even disrespected my mother! Don't you think that's a problem? She's just a young girl who's been spoiled all her life. Why take offense?""

Oh, Xavier. If only you could see yourself through my eyes right now.

After a long silence, I spoke, my voice hollow. ""I won't confront her anymore. I won't interfere with whatever is between you two. But please, keep her away from me. I don't need her 'spontaneity' in my face.""

""She's like a sister to me. Cici and I are brother and sister."" Xavier insisted, his brows furrowing. ""Wolves are loyal to their mates. Our relationship is not what you think it is.""

""Mmm,loyalty,"" I echoed, fighting the urge to pull out my phone and show him the evidence I'd collected—the late-night calls, the intimate texts, the hotel receipts.

""Fine. I overreacted. I misunderstood. Congratulations on your new sister.""

The cold silence hung between us like a physical barrier.

""Just drive,"" I said, wrapping the borrowed suit jacket tighter around myself. The fabric carried that intoxicating scent—sandalwood with wild undertones—that somehow brought me comfort.

On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area

I am 14 weeks pregnant and I have had excruciating lower back pain where I can’t sit down for long periods of time since I was 11 weeks meaning I haven’t been able to go into the office. I have been working from home with no issues. Also to note my probation ends in February. 

Due to my back pain I had to tell my boss last week, he sounded so happy and cheerful telling me all about  how he wanted more kids and how amazing this news is.

Today we had a change of tune, he said to me that his main concern is the baby, my family and I but also within the same sentence stating that my job requires me to be in 4 days. 

From the beginning I told him my main goal is to make it back to the office which is why I see a Physio, Chiro and Remedial Masseur to help fix my lower back. I am taking all the steps. He said he wants an action plan to what are the next steps and how long this pain is expected which no one can tell me as this happens in pregnancy. He also said things like I have been trying to see if you love your job and I just haven’t seen that yet, which is untrue because in our last catch up he said the exact opposite. 

This sounds great to some but I know what is coming. As I look after his emails I also have been he has reached out to people on Linkedin with the same skill set as me and wants to have a “Coffee catch up”. I am scared that he will dismiss me unfairly due to my pregnancy and blame my back pain. 

My husband said next week just to go in and cop the pain because I can’t afford to loose my job at the moment.

1qq11tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qq11tu/how_to_be_romantic_the_science_based_playbook/,How to Be ROMANTIC The Science Based Playbook That Actually Works,"Been studying this for months because honestly, modern dating feels BROKEN. We're all chronically online, overstimulated, and have zero clue how to connect without it feeling forced or cringe. Scrolled through endless relationship advice, dove into psychology research, listened to Esther Perel's podcast religiously, read actual studies on attachment theory. What I found completely changed how I see romance.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: romance isn't about grand gestures or expensive dates. It's about intentional attention in a world designed to distract you. We're all so dopamine fried that genuine presence feels revolutionary. The dating industrial complex wants you thinking you need perfect date ideas and flawless execution. Bullshit. What people actually crave is feeling SEEN.

**The art of paying attention** is where real romance lives. Not checking your phone during dinner. Remembering the small stuff they mentioned three weeks ago. Noticing when their mood shifts. Sounds obvious but when's the last time someone gave you their full attention for an hour straight? Probably never. We're all half present, half scrolling, always waiting for something better. Break that pattern and you'll stand out like crazy.

Dr Sue Johnson (she literally wrote the book on emotionally focused therapy and has 30+ years researching couples) talks about this in **Hold Me Tight**. She breaks down how emotional responsiveness creates secure bonds. The book won awards for basically proving that vulnerability and attentiveness matter more than compatibility. Read it and you'll understand why your ex relationships failed. Seriously, this book will make you question everything you thought you knew about love. Best relationship psychology I've ever encountered. It's not some fluffy self help garbage, it's clinical research made digestible.

**Ask better questions**. Stop with the ""how was your day"" bullshit. Try ""what made you feel most alive today?"" or ""what's something you've been thinking about lately that you haven't told anyone?"" Genuine curiosity is disgustingly romantic. Most people ask questions just to fill silence. Ask because you actually want to know their inner world.

**Create tiny rituals together**. Could be making coffee a certain way every Sunday. Could be a specific song you play on car rides. Could be a dumb inside joke nobody else gets. These microscopic traditions build your own private universe. Couples who last have their own language, their own ecosystem.

The Paired app is actually clutch here for building that connection. It's like Duolingo but for relationships, sends you and your partner daily questions that get progressively deeper. You'd be surprised what you DON'T know about someone you've dated for months. Helps you move past surface level conversation into actual intimacy territory without it feeling like therapy homework.

There's also this AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that's been useful for understanding relationship dynamics better. It pulls from relationship research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content based on what you're struggling with. You can tell it your specific situation, like ""I want to be more emotionally available but not needy"" or ""help me understand attachment styles in my relationship,"" and it generates a custom learning plan. The depth is adjustable too, so you can get a quick 15-minute overview or a deep 40-minute dive with real examples. Makes absorbing this psychology stuff way easier when you're commuting or at the gym.

**Anticipate needs before they ask**. This is next level. Notice they always get cold at restaurants? Bring a jacket without being asked. Know they stress about work presentations? Text them encouragement that morning. See they're exhausted? Run them a bath. Small acts of service that show you're paying attention to their patterns. That's the language of devotion.

Alain de Botton's work on this is unmatched. **The Course of Love** explores how relationships actually function past the honeymoon phase. He's a philosopher who founded The School of Life, and this book reads like watching your future relationship play out with all its beautiful messiness. Insanely good read that shows romance isn't about constant passion, it's about choosing someone even when it's boring or hard. Most romantic books are fantasy, this one is REAL.

**Be present during sex but also outside of it**. Physical intimacy matters obviously, but romance is sustained through nonsexual touch. Holding hands while walking. Playing with their hair while watching TV. Random hugs from behind while they're cooking. Skin to skin contact releases oxytocin which literally bonds you together. We're just mammals who need touch.

**Write things down**. Doesn't have to be poetry or love letters. Just observations. ""You looked happy today when you were talking about your friend's wedding."" ""I love how passionate you get about random documentaries."" Keeps you noticing the details that make them THEM.

The Gottman Institute's research (they've studied thousands of couples over 40+ years) shows that successful relationships have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. Basically you need five good moments to balance one shitty moment. So romance isn't perfection, it's consistently showing up with small kindnesses that outnumber the inevitable conflicts. They have a card deck app that's weirdly helpful for sparking actual conversations instead of just existing next to each other in silence.

**Be emotionally available but not needy**. Share your feelings without making them your therapist. Ask for support without demanding they fix you. Secure attachment looks like ""I'm struggling with something, can we talk?"" not ""you're making me feel this way."" Understanding this distinction is massive.

Here's what's wild: once you start practicing this stuff it stops feeling like effort. Becomes automatic. Your brain literally rewires to notice opportunities for connection. Neuroplasticity works for love too. You're training yourself to be someone who SEES people fully, and that skill transfers everywhere.

The real enemy of romance is autopilot. We get comfortable and stop trying. Stop noticing. Stop being curious. Relationships die from boredom and neglect way more than dramatic betrayals. So the ultimate romantic move is refusing to let your attention drift. Staying fascinated by this person you chose. That's the actual work, and nobody warns you about it because it's not Instagram worthy.

But when you get it right? When someone feels truly cherished and known by you? That's the stuff that lasts past the butterflies and initial chemistry. That's the foundation for building something real in a world full of shallow connections and infinite options. Romance isn't dead, we just forgot it requires intention.",1,1769668246.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False
