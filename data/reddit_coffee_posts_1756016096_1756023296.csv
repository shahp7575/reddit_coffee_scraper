1mypt5e,https://v.redd.it/496mwch1dxkf1,First brew with the moka pot! Would love some feedback!,So this was my first brew with the moka pot. Tried to follow Hoffman's recipe! For context this is a 4 cup aluminum moka pot! Used 20g of coffee(ground fresh using timemore c3s at 11 clicks) and 190 g of water in the bottom chamber! Also used an aeropress filter as recommended in Hoffman's recipe! I think I stopped the brew a little early since I got only about 90g of coffee at the end which I diluted with hot water to make the final drink around 150g. I've brewed the same coffee with an aeropress before and this brew tasted a lot more intense but also a bit bitter. Thinking of trying 12 clicks tomorrow to grind a little coarse to help with the bitterness. Any other tips? I don't like small drinks so also needed a bit of advice on how much water I can add before making the final drink too diluted! From my understanding if I brew it properly I should expect around 120g of coffee from the moka pot itself. So any suggestions on how much more water I can add? ,2,1756022701.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False
1mypt2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mypt2s/i_went_to_the_church_in_majenica/,I went to the church in Majenica,"

The town of Majenica has around 80 permanent residents. It is little more than 24 houses. It has no post office or general store. There is a gas station, but it closed back in 08. The town is the halfway point between the interstate and an actually notable town. The only real draw to Majenica was the fact that it had the church. If you lived in the area you have undoubtedly heard of the church. Saint John’s - Bastion of Faith. It was much larger of a church than a town like Majenica warranted. I’m not entirely sure how the town afforded the building. It was a big beautiful building with well designed limestone and brick. The windows were massive, beautiful portraits made of stained glass. I had never gone there myself, but most people in neighboring towns attended the Sunday services. 

I stopped being involved with church after my father died. I fell out of the routine. Too many people told me it was “god's plan”. What a load of horse shit. Their insistence upon the matter only made me more upset. That was a few years ago however. It’s been long enough now that I'm ready to try it again. I’ve been talking to my family friends and they asked me to join them this next sunday. Everyone who goes talks about the church fanatically. I figured that I might as well try. 

I woke up that Sunday at 10 am. I was still tired from the night before. I didn't get much sleep. I was still dreading the idea of a pastor rambling on about his warped interpretation of the Bible and how my life is in peril. I pulled myself out of my bed regardless. I put on my Sunday best, which happened to be a polo shirt I got from a thrift store and some black slacks from the same thrift store. I looked presentable. I decided to skip breakfast as that would take too long. I wanted to get there early. If I was lucky I'd be able to find the people I knew and I'd sit with them. I walked past my kitchen, grabbed my keys, and walked out my front door. 

The morning greeted me with a gray misty rain. It was rather brisk out, but it was honestly quite pleasant. I decided to open my door and grab my sweater. I tossed it over my polo shirt in order to keep some warmth. I walked through the rain to my car. My key fob was always finicky. This meant that I had to press the unlock multiple times before the headlights of my car blinked signifying that the doors were indeed unlocked. I hopped into my car, slightly wetter than I would've liked. I plugged my phone into the cassette tape/aux cord. It was something I picked up from the hardware store here in town. I put on some music before starting my drive to church.

Once arriving I find it very hard to find a spot to park. I was about a half hour early, but the parking lot was full. Every spot has been taken. Some of the patrons took to parking on the grass. I was hopeful that my car wouldn't get stuck in the mud. I decided to go for it. I walked through the grass into the parking lot. The parking lot was quite large. Unfortunately for me, I had a small walk ahead of me. I should have brought my umbrella. “It’s too late to go back now though.” I thought to myself. 

Approaching the big wooden doors of the church, I was a little intimidated. I looked up at the massive windows collecting rain. I turned to look back at the parking lot and thought about leaving. I was psyching myself out for no reason. I was not going to leave now. I pushed open the solid oak doors. The inside of the church was just as breathtaking as the outside. The roof was ornate and wooden. The stage was marvelous. The air inside was warm like a blanket from the dryer. There were people everywhere. I began to feel out of place. I looked around for people to talk to or something to do. That's when I noticed the little coffee bar that they had inside the church. It was embedded in the wall and the room could really only fit 3 people. It looked cozy though. I walked up and asked for a cup. I had skipped breakfast and groggy, I could use the pick me up.

The cute girl behind the counter asked if I was new. It must've been obvious. I was looking around in amazement and wasn't talking to anyone. I admitted that I was a newcomer and I was a little nervous. She giggled at that. Usually that would have embarrassed me, but her voice was so soothing that it eased my concerns. She pointed to a spot in the middle of the room on the left side of the pews and recommended that I sit there.

“It's cozy over there. It's out of the way, but you get a good view.” 

I thanked her for the advice and tried to pay for my drink. She smiled and told me that the drink was free since I was new.

I walked to the area she pointed out for me and took a seat in the far end of the pew. I continued to look for my friends, but they were lost in the sea of unfamiliar faces. It was hopeless. I sank into my seat and drank my delicious coffee. Despite my friends being elsewhere, I was actually quite content and cozy. I was excited to see if this sermon was really going to be life changing. 

I waited about 12 minutes before the lights dimmed. I had chatted up some elderly folks in the meantime. They looked like the kind of old person that had very little time left. Purple skin around their arms indicated that they bruised easily. I felt bad for them, but they seemed as cheerful as ever. The lights became very atmospheric. They illuminated just enough to keep the room visible. It was like going to the movie theater when they play the trailers. The crowd went quiet. Everyone was waiting for the pastor. I was intrigued. I could feel the anticipation of everyone around me.

I heard a man's voice projecting from the speakers on stage. He had a golden tone to his voice. He walked on stage and I was confused. He wasn't exactly what I imagined in my head. He was no older than 50. He looked to be wearing a twill suit, the kind with the large checkers on it. He was quite handsome. The spotlight shined down upon him as he introduced himself to the crowd. 

“Hello people. I am pastor Zacharious. Today is a special day. We are going to be performing miracles”

With that the entire room erupted in cheers. 

“What the hell? Miracles, really? Maybe this was more of a cult than a church.”

I was uneasy, but I decided to stay. I was probably just over reacting. He went on.

“I see a few new faces in here today, let's not scare them off, okay? If you see someone new, make them feel welcomed and introduce yourself. It makes me happy to see our union grow so much over the last several years. Today the Lord will thank us for all our hard work. We have been planning this holy day for a few weeks now. Now it is finally time to produce the miracles I promised you.”

Again applause.

“Before all of that we must praise our Lord in song”

I thought to myself.
“Oh shit, fuck me. I didn't really want to sing hymns today.”

I had completely forgotten that this was a part of church. I scrambled to find a hymn book as everyone had already stood up and opened the pages. Kindly, a stranger handed me their book and pointed to the area we would be singing from. I was very appreciative of that. 

It was some generic song about how Jesus is Lord and how we aren't grateful enough for his salvation. Call me cynical, but they all sound the same. After singing, I thought we'd be sitting back down. Instead, the pastor beckoned the crowd to the stage. Everyone flocked the stage in a frenzy. I was startled. There was shoving and screaming. It was anything but dignified. I backed out of my pew and clung to the wall, watching in utter confusion. The people washed up to the stage like a roaring wave. The pastor reached down to a few of their heads and grazed them with his hand. Every person he touched seemed to faint out of pure excitement. I was creeped out. Right as I turned to leave, the cute barista was beside me. She scares the shit out of me even more than I already was.

She hurriedly responded trying to calm me down.
“Oh my goodness I'm so sorry, are you alright”

I told her I was fine and that I was just disturbed by the events going on. I told her that I was probably going to leave.

She sounded like a disappointed mother.
“Leave? But you haven't even witnessed the miracles.”

“What? What're yo-”
I turned around to see each crowd member grazed by the pastor's cold hands suspended in air. They emanated a holy glow. The light emanating from them was warm and bright. It lit up the room. I stopped mid sentence and every other thought in my head ceased to exist. 

I said in utter bewilderment 
“Oh my god.”

She said innocently.
“I know, isn't he amazing?”

I whipped my head between the girl and the act of God that was currently happening at the foot of the stage. 

I thought to myself.
“Is she really acting as if this was completely normal? Is this completely normal? How often does he do this? What happens next?”

 I needed to know more.

I sat back in my pew and clapped. I didn't know what else to do. The glowing ones slowly descended. People cheered again. The pastor said that was all he could do for this week. He took a knee as if it had drained him. 

When the pastor was done handing out miracles everyone returned to their seats. I noticed that the elderly couple who had conversated with me before the sermon were heading back towards their seats too. They seemed different. Their skin was no longer bruised or thin. They looked younger? A lot younger, by about 10 years.

“What the fuck” 
I thought.

The sermon continued like a normal church for a while longer. After the sermon ended. The pastor said as charismaticly as a politician.

“Will those new to our union join me in the front. I'd love for the chance to meet you all.”

The rest of the congregation fled to their respective lives. Me thought? I was going to meet this pastor. I walked to the front. I was both excited and nervous. On my stroll to the stage, I noticed that I was the only newcomer. I looked around looking for the other “new faces” the pastor talked about. 

He chuckled when he saw my confusion.
“Oh boy don't worry, it's just you. I just didn't want to make you feel too targeted. I said “new faces” to put you at ease.”

I thought to myself.
“He noticed me out of the 200 or so people in the church?”

We talked for a bit. He said that it was great to have more members in the church and he told me about his time teaching God's word. I listened in pure fascination. He was an even better story teller than I had previously conceived.

He ended the conversation with a request.
“Well I have to attend other business” he then pointed at his stomach signifying he was going to go get lunch. “But I wanted to personally request that you do come again next week.”


I said as cautiously and politely as possible.
“thank you sir, it was great to meet you”

I instinctively stuck my hand out to shake his, but he recoiled as if my hand was a venomous snake.

“Oh sonny, you don't want to do that. My hands are capable of a great number of things.”

Instead he gave a gentleman's bow. 
With that he walked away

Well about 10 minutes ago I was standing in the kitchen and out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a black cat run across the living room behind the coffee table. (We do have a black cat but he is an outdoor barn cat) I thought I was imagining things and brushed it off not saying anything about it. As me and my bf were going outside to smoke as he goes to open the door we both hear and see the outdoor cat jump onto the porch, as this is happening he turns to me and says ""I swear I just saw a black cat run behind the coffee table before I opened the door but the cat just ran onto the porch.""

I live in a place where the only soil is a park, near a CATHEDRAL so I'm like maybe not here, and I have a river but it houses a protected bird species, so I'm like maaaybe not here either. 

And suddenly I had an idea, can I put everything in a jar ? light another white candle on top of it to seal it, and tadah ?

I put rosmary, coffee, cinnamon, pink himalayan salt and sea salt, dried rose petals, catnip, the ashes of my petition, as well as bay leaves ashes where i had written ""remove blocages"" on it. Also I have another question about remains disposal but maybe for another post.

1mypp47,https://www.reddit.com/r/DF64/comments/1mypp47/off_to_a_rough_start/,Off to a rough start,"Hi all,

Long time lurker here but first post. Recently upgraded to a DF64 Gen 2 from an Ode 2 as I wanted future flexibility to begin experimenting with espresso.  

In any case, made a 1L batch brew with my Moccamaster and the DF64 this morning and it was probably the worst pot of coffee I’ve ever made with the Technivorm. It honestly reminded me of watery hotel room coffee from a Keurig. It was that bad. I’ll add, it wasn’t a fast extraction either. Brew time and water level were what I’ve come to expect from the Moccamaster after many years of use.

Specs were 60 grams (Ethiopian SO light roast coffee) and setting 75 on the DF64. Followed my usual process including blooming the coffee and 45 second rest before brewing.

I’m still in process of seasoning the burrs and the grinder is still at factory alignment. The grind size seemed reasonable and comparable to the Ode (around setting 8) when I eyeballed it before brewing.

What could be wrong here? Has anyone had the same issues with batch brewing or pour over initially? How long did good results take?

Appreciate any thoughts.

Nay, it wasn't just any visit; it was their last attempt at convincing me to stay within the INC and ""sumunod sa pamamahala"" without questions.

As we sat down, I baited them with an innocent question into telling me about the INC's reasoning kung bakit mga ministro lang ang ""pwedeng"" magbasa at ""makaintindi"" ng Bible. 

So basically, as if on cue (Pavlovian, even), they went on and on about how the Scriptures were ""shrouded in mystery"" and read Romans 16:25 from a copy of the Bible that they brought with them. They then proceeded to give this grand lecture of how that ""clearly"" explains why only they, as ministers of the INC, can interpret the Scriptures correctly and no one else.

I was almost biting my lips at this point, trying so hard to stop myself from laughing out loud because of how easily they fell for my trap. 

So to finally twist the knife, I asked them to read the next verse (Romans 16:26) and explain what that means. Natatawa na ako at this point because they were trying so hard to justify na that only further proves their claim na sa kanila lang daw nahayag yung hiwaga dahil sa sugo and all that nonsense.

To further drive my point (natameme na sila at this point btw), I took out my phone and showed all other translations of the same verses (Romans 16:25-26) and told them that no matter which translation you read, if something is true, then the message stays the same: 

>**There's no ""hidden mystery"" and therefore no need for such intermediaries like yourselves and this false church that is the INC. No need for countless translations. Everyone can know the truth just by picking up a copy of the Bible and reading it (with comprehension, of course). Wag ka lang magla-lock sa kwarto ng tatlong araw at gabi, that is.**

Seeing that they couldn't prove themselves further, they just gave out some fake pleasantries and left.

Even if I didn’t take a specific GCSE, feel free to ask the question anyway, because I’m sure there will be someone else here who can answer them :) The idea is that if you’re curious about anything you can put it here. 

Something else that I’ve noticed on this subreddit is that although stress (which is a completely valid and horrible experience) is mentioned a lot, mental health problems are not mentioned as much. So I’d be happy to answer any questions on how my mental health problems (namely <!spoilers!> depression, OCD, eating disorder, dysmorphia and SH <!spoilers!>) affected my learning/ revision and how I managed to deal with/manage it. I’ll show my grades, so that you can see that these things don’t limit you. I was often told that I would fail (mostly bc of the <!spoilers!>Anorexia<!spoilers!>), wouldn’t achieve my dreams, that I should take only 6 GCSEs, etc…
But this is proof that anyone who tells you that is wrong. 

For context I’m going from year 11 to year 12 and took these subjects: 

* English lit (8 with a potential remark, aqa)
* English lang (9, Aqa)
* Maths (9, Edexcel) 
* Physics (9, aqa)
* Chemistry (9, Aqa) 
* Biology (9, Aqa)
* Geography (9, Aqa)
* R.E (9, Edexcel, Islam and Christianity) 
* Business (9, Edexcel) 
* Computer science (9, Edexcel) 
* Music (8, OCR)
* Further maths (9, Aqa) 
* French (9, Aqa)

I’d like to point out that I took French as a home language, which meant that I took it a year early in year 10. This means that I didn’t do French lessons and didn’t really have support from the school (no mocks or anything). So I could give my thoughts/advice on French only in the context of taking it as a home language. 
I go to a state school kinda in the north of the UK, which might tell you a bit about the support and resources I was given (underfunded state schools for the win 💪) 

Anyways, I hope everyone has a nice day, and good luck for anyone beginning their GCSE journey (you’ll do great dw)

A little background story: we've been doing long distance our entire relationship and only met for a few months when I went back to my country to visit my relatives. He's a really nice and loving person in real life, but when it comes to long distance, he has many issues. From the beginning of our relationship, he always ditched me to be with his friends, wouldn’t reply to my texts, and wouldn’t even tell me if he was going to be gone. After a few arguments, he agreed to at least let me know, but he still went out with his friends every now and then.

The problem really started when his family moved closer to his friend in another place. There was a time when he would go out five days a week, and on the other two days he would sleep until noon. I’m two hours ahead of where he lives, and there were times I would stay up until early morning just so we could spend some time together. It felt like I was giving my best and he was giving the leftovers of what he could. The thing that broke me was when he wanted to spend time over at a friend’s house on our first anniversary. I burst out crying on call and he got mad, and by the time he got home the anniversary was already over. Not to forget, he missed my birthday and our first ever Valentine’s Day. I had to beg him to spend time with me. We always fought, and he always promised to change, only to return to his old self slowly.

He also always goes back on his words, and it’s frustrating to talk to him because he always thinks I’m arguing. He was really sweet and attentive when I was with him in person, and he would cancel his plans with his friends to spend time with me because I was only there for a limited time. But he also made me feel insecure about his friends. Every time he goes over to his friends, it reminds me of all the past things, and I naturally become moody, but at the same time I don’t want to keep him away from his friends. To his credit he did change, but he always slips and makes a valid excuse and it makes me feel worse about getting the insecurities best of me.

So, what really led to the talk about the break? Well, my bf was going over to his friend’s house to do his assignment, as his friend was his senior and knew what to do. He went over to his friend’s house around 2, but he spent more time going around instead of doing his work, which always happens. He had recently bought a new bike, and I was not comfortable with him driving at night, as my country doesn’t have many street lights, no traffic lights, no guard rails, and is overall very dangerous since it’s mostly hills with no barricades and many blind turns. But I didn’t want to stop him since he was so excited. We had a talk, and he said he wouldn’t go because he knew I wasn’t comfortable. I told him I knew he would go either way and I was just saying it to make myself feel okay with his decision later, and he still convinced me he wouldn’t go. And as you can guess, he went for a coffee break even though the plan was only to work on his assignment. He was going to go for a ride before it got dark, and I encouraged it, but he didn’t end up going — and he didn’t get to his friend’s place either. After getting to his friend’s place, he left after an hour for that coffee break.

The second thing was when I needed his help making a ppt. I was waiting for him to finish his work, and by the time he got home it was 10pm for me. I felt tired because I had heavy period cramps all day and wasn’t even able to stand. As he was doing his assignment, I asked him to call me when he was done and told him I was going to take a nap. A little background information: I work better at night when everyone is asleep, and I had to finish making the ppt that night so I could record the audio the next day, which I let him know. He called after he was done, but he was cooking then, so I asked him to call after he was done eating — and guess what? He didn’t. The next morning, he said he didn’t want to wake me up because it was late, but then he changed his words to, “I didn’t wake you up because you were in pain yesterday and I wanted to let you sleep,” after I told him I was in pain. That’s why I was tired and fell asleep. But the fact is, he didn’t know I was in pain when I fell asleep.

This whole situation made me realize how he will never change, and I’m just hanging onto the idea that one day we won’t have to do long distance anymore. I asked for a break so we could start over, where I forget everything he has done in the past and we begin fresh. But after thinking, I don’t think I can ever forget what he has done, including the fact that I had to teach him how to love me right. I really don’t want to break up with him — he’s my whole world and I love him, and I know he loves me too, but he’s just not good at showing it. So, AITA?",35,1756021958.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

For a long time, game development felt way too complex for me, but now it finally feels manageable/doable. Recently, I asked my Computer Science professor what kind of project he’d recommend. His response stuck with me: *“What do you want to do? I built a Pinterest-like web app even before Pinterest existed.”*

That inspired me to stop overthinking and start working on my own game ideas.

I’ve been really inspired by **Project Kat**, which was also made in Godot. My dream is to start small...making fun, cozy games like dress-up or coffee-making .. and eventually move toward something bigger, like an RPG in the style of **Project Kat** / **Paper Lily**.

Right now, I don’t have an iPad or drawing tablet for making my own assets, so I’m practicing with free ones from Itch.io.

My main question is: **Is it too late to get into game development at 25?**

**Chizuru heard the request to meet in a hotel room, and her soaring hopes crashed back to reality. Her mind spiraled with turbulent thoughts:**

*“As expected, my efforts aren’t truly valued—they have ulterior motives.”*

*“Is this how you survive in this industry? I’m so unwilling to accept it!”*

*“I was too naive… How could anyone be kind to me without strings attached? Such people don’t exist, do they?”*

**Kazuya’s gentle smile flashed in her mind, a bittersweet warmth piercing her heart:**

*“If only he were here… I miss him so much.”*

**Despite the chaos in her heart, Chizuru quickly regained her composure, calling on her acting skills to respond politely. With a sweet, heart-melting smile, she said to OMATA:**

“OMATA-san, I’m so sorry, it’s really too late now. It’d disturb the boss’s rest. Can we reschedule for another time and place?”

OMATA (coldly): “Chizuru-san, the boss is very busy—this is his only available time. Miss this, and the opportunity’s gone.”

**Chizuru lowered her head, silent, as disappointment washed over her like a cold tide.**

OMATA (pressing, his tone firm): “You’re beautiful, hardworking, and talented. But you need to understand, girls like you are a dime a dozen in this industry. If you’re not willing, plenty of others will jump at the chance.”

**His words dragged Chizuru from reality into a deeper abyss. She kept her head down, still silent.**

OMATA (softening): “I’m just the messenger. I don’t know what he wants. It’s just a hotel room—no one’s saying you have to do anything.”

**Chizuru remained quiet, her thoughts sharp:**

*“Does he think I’m some naive girl? What good could come from a hotel room this late?”*

OMATA (coaxing): “Just see it as an experience. Don’t overthink it—try looking at it from another angle.”

**After a long silence, Chizuru finally spoke, her voice calm but resolute:**

“I’m really sorry, OMATA-san. When I entered this industry, my grandma warned me never to discuss work in such settings.”

OMATA (with a slight scoff): “I know your grandma passed away. You don’t need to cling to her outdated ideas.”

Chizuru (firmer, with a touch of nostalgia): “I think her advice makes sense. Honestly, meeting you this late already pushes my boundaries. But I know you’ve always looked out for me and wouldn’t harm me.”

OMATA (smiling warmly): “You get it—I’d never hurt you. Boundaries are flexible, aren’t they? If the deal’s sweeter, would you adjust them? I can negotiate for you.”

Chizuru (shaking her head, eyes clear): “I’m sorry, OMATA-san, but I can’t compromise on this. I want to be chosen for my performance, not anything else.”

OMATA (paternalistic): “Your performance is top-notch, but you need to understand how the world works, especially in this industry.”

Chizuru (unyielding): “I’m sorry, I can’t accept such a request.”

**OMATA, assuming Chizuru was negotiating, grew impatient:**

“Let’s cut to the chase. What do you want? Name your terms.”

**Chizuru stood, bowing deeply to OMATA, her voice steady but resolute:**

“I’m sorry, no matter what, it’s absolutely impossible.”

OMATA (irritated): “I checked your file—you have a side job as a ‘rental girlfriend,’ right?”

**Chizuru nodded twice, her gaze darkening.**

OMATA (pressing): “That’s just getting paid to act as someone’s girlfriend, isn’t it?”

**Chizuru nodded again, silent.**

OMATA (blunt): “So that’s it? Name a price—‘rental girlfriends’ do this, don’t they?”

Chizuru (voice cold): “I’m sorry, absolutely not.”

OMATA (sneering): “Stop pretending. It’s all selling yourself, just with a prettier name.”

**Chizuru had been restraining her emotions, knowing the importance of maintaining ties with the agency. But the misrepresentation of her rental girlfriend job was her breaking point. She stood tall, eyes blazing, and said:**

“Please don’t misunderstand my work. Our service focuses on emotional support—no physical intimacy is allowed, and we never stay alone with clients in a room. Don’t speak so carelessly.”

OMATA (raising his hands): “Sorry, sorry, I misunderstood. Sit down, let’s talk calmly.”

**Chizuru felt there was no room left for discussion, her heart heavy with disappointment. Holding back tears, she said politely:**

“I’m sorry, I can’t take this job. Please give the opportunity to someone else. It’s late—goodbye.”

**She gave a 90-degree bow and turned to leave, her heart aching:**

“My dream’s shattered… I want to cry so badly. If only someone were here for me to hold and sob.”

**After a few steps, OMATA caught up, lightly tapping her shoulder. Startled, Chizuru turned, her heart still drifting toward Kazuya’s comforting presence.**

OMATA (apologetic): “Chizuru-chan, don’t be like this. We’ll need to work together in the future.”

OMATA (bowing deeply): “I’m truly sorry for my offensive words. I apologize sincerely.”

**He returned a 90-degree bow, continuing:**

“Since you’re here, stay a bit. Let’s find a solution.”

*Chizuru thought: “He’s apologizing sincerely. I shouldn’t burn bridges. I’ll hear him out.”*

**They returned to their seats. OMATA shifted topics:**

“I heard you made a crowdfunded movie. I missed it—couldn’t join the campaign. Can you tell me about it? It might help your career.”

**The topic lit up Chizuru’s passion. She opened her phone, playing clips of the movie, explaining with enthusiasm while memories of Kazuya’s efforts warmed her heart. Her eyes softened, a faint smile tugging at her lips, and the atmosphere thawed like a winter day touched by sunlight.**

OMATA (smiling): “Chizuru-chan, you’re talking a lot! Must be thirsty. You’ve got half a cup of coffee left.”

**Chizuru, feeling parched, took two big sips of her coffee. OMATA lowered his head, concealing a sly, sinister smile.**

Hi everyone,
I (M, 21) have been close to this girl (F, 21) for about a year now. In the beginning, things were going well — we were spending a lot of time together, going out for coffee, shopping, and just hanging out. Back then, I felt like we had a strong connection.

Over time, though, things became… complicated. She often gives me mixed signals:

She comments on my appearance, blushes when looking at me, and sometimes flirts.

She suggested spending time alone at her place, which felt date-like.

 I’m confused whether she sees me as just a friend or quasi boyfriend till she find someone else


There are also moments when she avoids me or prioritizes other things. For example, we had plans but she chose to play Minecraft with her sister instead, even though earlier she told me she was “too tired” and “everything hurts.” Sometimes she ignores my texts for hours, even when I see her active online.

A few months ago, she told me directly that “I shouldn’t expect anything.” But despite that, we still spend time together, and she invites me on trips, like an upcoming 4-day trip we’ve planned.

I feel like I’m stuck in a situationship:

I’ve been trying for a year.

I care about her a lot, but I’m not sure if she feels the same way.

Sometimes it feels like she enjoys my attention but doesn’t want to commit.

Her dad even joked with mine that I should “keep trying because she’s sensitive,” which only makes things more confusing.

I’ve managed company setups in Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area—the efficiency compared to Dubai is real. But, as with anywhere, the devil is in the detail when it comes to shareholder requirements.\
\
Foreign Shareholding in Bahrain: The Current Regulatory Context\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. implemented an update on February 1, 2025:\
- Automatic background checks are now performed through Sijilat for all non-GCC shareholders.\
- Pre-approval by the Nationality, Passports & Residence Affairs (NPRA) is mandatory for foreign shareholders in Defense, Telecom, Health, and Financial Services sectors.\
(I once had a deal stall for two weeks because a telecom application lacked NPRA pre-clearance—since then, my SOP is to submit all documentation directly to the NPRA window in Seef by 10:00 AM Monday, which cuts wait time in half.)\
What Is Actually Required?\
\
General Commercial Activities — No security clearance; standard identity/passport checks\
Sensitive Sectors (Financial, Defense, Media, Telecommunications) — Clearance by NPRA and sector regulators\
Free Zones — Streamlined, but background checks for non-GCC owners remain\
\
See the full regulatory framework on the official Bahrain government portal for up-to-date sectoral requirements.\

Step-by-Step: Foreign Shareholding Setup in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation., BSC, Foreign Branch, Single-Person Company, Limited Partnership\
   - Compare structure details and requirements based on shareholding goals\
\
Name Reservation and Initial Application\
Use Sijilat online system for digital submission\
Ideal timing: Early weekday mornings (queues are shorter at the Diplomatic Area MOICT office)\
\
Time-saving tip: Prepare 3 alternative names—approval can be picky about “similarity” to existing entities\
\
\
Shareholder Documentation\
\
Passport copy (certified)\
Proof of address (recent utilities bill)\
\
CV or business background for regulated sectors\
\
\
Background/NPRA Screening—(If Applicable)\
\
Foreigners in “restricted” activities: Submit documents directly at NPRA in Seef for fastest processing\
\
Common mistake: Submitting incomplete application—always double-check sector classification\
\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) Approval\
\
Processed through Sijilat; you’ll receive provisional approval pending lease and capital deposit\
\
CR details and required documents\
\
\
Office Lease & Capital Deposit\
\
Must have a physical address; virtual offices allowed in certain free zones—see Bahrain Free Zones\
\
Insider budget tip: Offices in Seef and Diplomatic Area are fastest for commercial inspection—BHD 350-600/month for small offices as of June 2025\
\
\
Final CR & Regulatory License\
\
Within a week, Sijilat notifies you of official CR issuance if all checks clear\
For regulated industries, separate license from sector regulator (CBB, MOH, TRA, etc.)\
\
Personal aside: During Ramadan in 2022, MOICT’s business hours shifted, and early morning Sijilat submissions meant approvals same day—timing really is everything in Bahrain.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Security, Compliance & Setup\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
- Additional security clearance fees (if required in sensitive sectors): BHD 120–250\
- Annual maintenance/renewal: BHD 600–1,000\
See a full breakdown at Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
\
Importantly, many new entrepreneurs underestimate post-formation costs—annual audit, bookkeeping, and LMRA visa fees are the main “hidden” expenses.\
Pro tip: Use the Keylink Accounting and Bookkeeping Service—they saved me 15% on my first renewal with bulk-filing discounts.\
\
Budget-saving Strategies\
\
Choose office locations with easy access for MOICT inspectors — Seef and Diplomatic have faster inspection scheduling than Bahrain Bay\
Group all shareholder/manager document submissions at once, not piecemeal. This avoids costly resubmissions and delays\
Apply for all sectoral licenses at the same time as CR registration to avoid sequential government fees\

Full foreign ownership is allowed for most sectors as of the 2025 update, without the need for Bahraini sponsors—this is a huge advantage over the UAE, where 51% local shareholding is still common outside free zones.\
For details:\
- 100% Foreign Ownership Activities\
- 99% Foreign Ownership Guide\
But, certain regulated industries (e.g., law, recruitment) still require a Bahraini partner or local sponsorship. Head to Local Sponsorship in Bahrain for up-to-date information.\
Practical Comparison: UAE vs. Bahrain\
\
Bahrain: Quicker process, more transparency, fewer local partner requirements\
UAE: More zones, but higher fees; outside free zones, Emirati partner required\
\
Common Mistake\
Not checking sector classification correctly—media and education are sometimes reclassified mid-process. Always confirm with MOICT before starting paperwork.\

2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New This Year?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..\
\
Implementation date: February 1, 2025\
Practical effect:\
Faster for most\
Minor errors lead to automatic flags\
Smoother for applicants with complete, consistent documentation\
\
My rule: Always use the exact spelling and order of your passport name on every document. The Sijilat system is unforgiving.\
\
Compliance & Post-Formation: Staying on the Right Side of the Law\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Yearly audited financial statements\
I recommend Keylink’s Accounting Services for full post-formation compliance—they proactively remind you of all deadlines and provide bundled packages that save time and money.\
Traditional touch: During audit season, it’s common for Bahraini accountants to host you for Arabic coffee—a small nicety that smooths over what can otherwise be a very technical process.\
\
Support & Resources for Foreign Shareholders\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for Bahrain company formation.\
- EDB — Economic Development Board: sector-specific advice\
- Tamkeen — Funding and business support, especially for new SMEs\
- Private Agents — For time-strapped founders, reputable agencies in Diplomatic Area and Seef expedite paperwork (I’ve saved days using Keylink and two others)\
- Local Networking — Attending majlis-style meetings (tea, dates, and quick business pitches) gives an edge, especially during Ramadan or Eid business slowdowns\
\
Tangent: The Power of Bahraini Business Hospitality\
A quick detour—once, a five-minute “coffee” in a Bahrain Bay boardroom turned into a two-hour discussion, culminating in a referral to the head of MOICT’s foreign investor desk. That single connection, made over gahwa and cardamom, shortcut weeks of paperwork for a client in the logistics sector. In Bahrain, networks matter as much as documents.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Can a foreign shareholder own 100% of a Bahrain company?\
Yes, for most sectors—details at 100% foreign ownership guide and sector-specific list. Exceptions: Some professional services and regulated activities.\
2. Do all foreign shareholders need to be present in Bahrain during company setup?\
No, but original documents (passport, power of attorney) must be notarized and submitted. For some sensitive sectors, a brief in-person visit may expedite NPRA clearance.\
3. Which government portal should I use for company registration and tracking?\
All steps are handled via Sijilat. For commercial registration specifics, head to Commercial Registration in Bahrain.\
4. What is the average processing time for foreign shareholder clearance?\
5-10 business days for general sectors; 10-20 business days for regulated sectors, provided all documents are correct and complete.\
5. Where can I find reliable, up-to-date support for post-formation compliance?\
Keylink Accounting & Bookkeeping offers bundled services that cover all your annual filings, VAT, and payroll compliance.\
\
For more on Bahrain’s business climate, regulatory updates, and sector news—see Reuters Business, Forbes Business, Gulf News – Bahrain, and the official Bahrain government site.\
\
Bottom line: In the majority of cases, no intrusive security clearance is required for foreign shareholders outside of restricted sectors—just streamlined identity and background checks. However, the right preparation and networking can turn a bureaucratic process into a smooth, even enjoyable, experience in Bahrain’s unique business culture. And if you ever get caught in a paperwork snag, remember—a well-timed coffee can open more doors than you think.",1,1756021700.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

1myph0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1myph0f/aitah_for_not_tolerating_body_odor/,AITAH for not tolerating body odor.,"I wanna preface this by saying that obviously this doesn’t to apply to someone who struggles to take care of themselves, people with medical conditions that cause them to produce more sweat AND those don’t have access to basic hygiene. 

I work in a coffee shop at a pretty popular place in LA and I KNOW my co workers and I are compensated well enough to suffice for basic hygiene. So it confuses me when some of my co workers come into work smelling like shit. I know it sounds harsh, but I just can’t be around them. Like if the smell is pungent, I can’t hold my reaction. And where I loose sympathy is knowing (specifically at my work place) we have things in place that can prevent them from coming into work smelling bad. 
For example, one of my co workers (let’s call her Maria) comes into work with dirty clothes, dirt apron, dirty pants, no deodorant and a dirty used face mask to “mask” her breath everyday to work and it seriously grosses me out. I barely talk to her because I don’t want to be around her and request to be as far as her as possible. And I don’t wanna hear “what if she can’t afford hygiene products” because she can. She not only gets paid more than me but she can also afford and flaunt entire sets of PopMart figurines which cost at least 200 dollars per set. She has been reported to management and been talked to about her lack of hygiene because it’s a fucking FDA food code violation (look it up) and yet NOTHING. 
But it’s not just at work. If I’m in public and I smell that BO, I won’t hide it on my face. Call it rude I don’t care. It’s more inconsiderate to make others uncomfortable from your stench than it is to be reminded of it. As a matter of fact I think it’d be an extension of an olive branch to remind the person of their foul odor. Yes, it is an embarrassment to the person who does smell but they get so much from it.

Years ago, I stumbled across a visual novel with the Danplan characters + Jay, and when I was younger and a cringy teen, I adored it. Basically, the premise was that we (the MC) are walking somewhere (to where you ask? no fucking clue--probably college) and Stephen literally hits the player with his car. He jumps out to see if we're alive and then contemplates running so he doesn't get caught. We get up and are mad at him for hitting us with a car (obviously), and Stephen offers to drive us to his job, where he works at a coffee shop. We were hesitant to get into a car with the stranger who had previously hit us with his car, but ultimately obliged because free coffee. We get there and finally meet the rest of the gang: Hosuh and Dan (Jay hasn't appeared yet). Dan is the manager and shows us around the coffee shop after Stephen brews us our sorry-for-hitting-you-with-my-car latte as promised. I think its at this point Jay comes in from a smoke break and rudely greets us, so now all the members of the cast are introduced. Dan then starts telling us how the coffee shop is experiencing financial troubles, and he's scared that they might have to shut down, and, in response, we break an expensive thing in the coffee shop (if I remember right, it was a vase). Every single character in the shop looks at us in terror, as supposedly that was the owner's priceless vase. The characters then settle on the player working there for free until they can raise enough money to either save the shop or pay off the vase.

Please someone else tell me they remember this game and it wasn't just a fever dream I made up because I'm going insane trying to find this game online but I remember it so vividly </3",2,1756021361.0,danplan,0,1.0,False

My husband is great and I've been extremely cautious on how I react to situations because my biggest fear is us losing each other during postpartum as I know emotions and tensions are high and divorce rates increase.

My baby is 6 weeks old as of yesterday snd not the easiest baby but also not the hardest. He naps well once he actually falls asleep, sleeps well at night, but feeding is a nightmare and when during his wake windows he's good for about 30 minutes and then starts crying and fights his sleep, he does not let us put him down unless it's his bassinet at night so all naps are contact naps. He doesn't mind the car once it's moving but once we stop it's game over, like full blown purple crying.

Yesterday we decided we needed to get out of the house and that we really want to get him used to the car, I honestly tend to avoid it because his crying is my worst form of torture like I would rather someone pluck my eyelashes out than have to listen to him cry and not be able to help him. But I agreed we have to start doing every day things especially before my husband goes back to work so I can be able to leave the house once I'm alone. We did a grocery pick up (first mistake - choosing curbside) baby was good until it took 10 minutes for the groceries to come out. Husband helped the worker put the groceries in the car and baby started to cry. We then went to get coffees - husband put in a mobile order right as we pulled into the parking lot. I said to go to the drive through so the car stayed moving but he already put the order through as indoor pick up. I know he didn't do this maliciously but he then parked the car and went inside to wait for our coffees, baby immediately was screaming. It took 15 minutes for our coffees so I sat there with my poor baby screaming with sweat basically dripping down his face for 15 minutes while he waited inside - the guilt I feel for not taking the baby out of his seat is so strong but I didn't want to take him out and my husband come out seconds later so I just kept waiting. Once my husband got back in the car I was visibly overwhelmed and angry and said definitely rudely ""next time let's drive around while we wait"" and that prompted him to not speak to me for the rest of the day. Went up to our bedroom and napped for 7 hours, came down stairs made dinner for himself, and then finally took the baby. When I apologized for getting angry at him and tried to explain that I knew he didn't do it maliciously and it wasn't his fault that the coffees took so long I just wish we drove around to keep baby calm because it would've been less stressful for us both he started saying I just don't do anything around the house (he definitely does way more than I do - but I don't not do anything) and that I've been treating him like shit and that my reaction was not warranted today and still went on to not talk to me. I told him it was unfair that he was so mad at me that he went upstairs and willingly left our son for 7 hours, at one point he came down stairs and just walked right past the baby and it hurt my heart for him.

I don't want this to be my life, my parents used to scream at eachother, and his parents did this avoidance thing where they would just go in different rooms and not speak to eachother for days and I don't want that for my son and I tried to explain to my husband we need to work on this and he keeps saying it wouldn't be if I wasn't so rude. I just don't think what I said was even bad, my tone probably, but I just wish he would think more like I do. I thought I was handling this all well but now apparently I don't do enough.

I couldn't vouch for it as somewhere to recommend for anyone on a strict time schedule but it's not a bad place if you're setting your expectations accordingly.

**🇰🇿 Almaty**: In every way, my favourite city in the region. I enjoyed the first month so much I came back for a second end enjoyed it equally. I'll outline why further down. The weather in May felt a little fresher compared to August.

**🇰🇬 Bishkek:** Doesn't really offer anything over Almaty in any regard and comfortably the quietest of the three. Not bad, but not somewhere to prioritise for a working stay.

**🇺🇿 Tashkent**: A strange place. I've worked from 50+ places over the past four years and this is one of the very few regrets I've had. I would urge you to trust my judgement on this one if contemplating a month long stay.

# Why so bullish on Almaty?

For most of the things that I care about when looking at somewhere for a month long stay (which are not unique and which I suspect most other people value) it was the clear leader.

It was somewhere I felt incredibly comfortable and content going about my daily business in a way which was entirely not the case in Tashkent. Bishkek was fine for a short stint but wouldn't have enough to comfortably sustain two months.

There's some slight variance in prices across the three cities but not in any meaningful way that should impact how you plan a trip. If bringing USD/EUR/GBP, they are great value.

# Where Almaty excels:

**Food and drink**: Comfortably the best range of coffee shops, bars and international restaurants. The others are not even close. The ABR group who have seemed to monopolise a lot of the more contemporary outlets have done an exceptional job at bringing top quality international restaurants to the city and you get the impression this has significantly raised the bar for local operators. If you have grown accustomed to the luxuries in life like an avocado toast, or a lightly roasted, anaerobically processed South American V60 coffee, you are in luck.

**International presence**: The best range of international brands. At the risk of sounding like a rampant consumerist, does the presence of Starbucks or H&M have a meaningful impact on my quality of life? No, but they act as barometers of development and contemporary relevance. Would your experience in Tashkent be made better with the opening of an H&M? No, but it's just one of a number of factors at play in the city which contribute to make it feel more culturally detached.

**Accommodation**: Almaty has the best range of Airbnbs with respect to quality and price. There's a real lack of supply on the market in Bishkek, and whilst Tashkent was reasonable, the value doesn't warrant making a trip there.

**Nature access**: Almaty has by far the most accessible countryside, with the mountains right on your doorstep. Most weekends I would venture into the mountains for a hike. With only a 30 minute taxi ride you can be in a mountain ski resort.

**Climate**: The mildest mid-summer weather. Equal temperatures during June felt heavier in Bishkek and Tashkent regularly sees temperatures exceed 40°C. With that being said, with low levels of humidity across the three, I found the summer temperatures bearable in all three, much more so than say Spain or Italy.

**Gyms**: The best selection of modern gyms at reasonable prices.

**Getting around:** The easiest city to get around. Tashkent has a bigger metro, but in terms of getting around on foot, Almaty is comfortably superior. Bishkek is similar to Almaty in this regard, but if anything even more dispersed.

**Social life**: Almaty was the easiest place to date in. I made some positive connections there which I'll look back warmly on.

**Coworking**: A solid coworking space with FiftyFour. With that being said, there were great coworking spaces across all three.

# How to structure a trip?

These are not three equal cities, so I would not do an even month in each. They are also places where you probably want to be in more 'adventure' mode than 'work' mode so I would intentionally carve out time to optimise for that.

I would rarely be so prescriptive in my suggestions for how to approach a trip, but I think given how different the cities, it's worth making a mention.

Make Almaty your base and use it as the core place to work from and your entry and exit point from the region. With the 30 day visa free policy you could add in the other destinations after that period expires and re-enter the country for a further period.

Given the significant cost most people incur getting to Central Asia in both time and money, I'd suggest two months in Almaty. There's enough to warrant it, especially if you want to make the most of the hiking and outdoors.

Treat Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan as conventional holidays as you're not missing out much from working from either Tashkent or Bishkek. You may miss out though if you spend the majority of your time in those destinations working in the cities, which is what I did. I have no regrets but I would've loved to have taken a week out of the Tashkent experience to explore rural Kyrgyzstan.

If connecting flights permit, no harm in stopping by Baku for a weekend either on in the way in or way out. Not a huge miss if not but it can help break up the journey.

# Suggestion

I am using some entirely hypothetical dates here to properly frame it. Don't read too much into the particulars but I'm trying to outline a rough timeline.

**Month 1: Arrive**  
1st May: Fly to Almaty and spend month working from the city  
31st May: Grab a bus to Kyrgyzstan for however long you deem a holiday necessary (I think a week would be perfect for a conventional holiday and mini-tour of the country)

**Logistics**  
If you are happy to pay for an empty Airbnb you could keep your belongings there, or I am sure you could leave them in a coworking space which would be a cheaper option. You probably won't want to be lugging stuff around on buses etc. Did not enjoy my experience of bringing several bags across Kazakh border.

**Month 2: Back to Almaty**  
7th June: Bus back to Almaty for another month

**Exit via Uzbekistan**  
7th July: Fly to Tashkent for however long you deem a holiday necessary  
14th July: Exit the region

If you want to reduce the heat, perhaps move Uzbekistan to the start of an itinerary to avoid the mid-summer highs. There's no harm in doing a week of working in Bishkek or Tashkent if either of them do interest you for a prolonged stay.

# To summarise: should you go to Central Asia?

I would say 100% yes. *But* with a caveat that you are going to get the most out of it if you are interested in hiking and exploring the outdoors and are content to be somewhere a little bit more sedate for a period. If not, you may be underwhelmed.",3,1756019930.0,digitalnomad,1,1.0,False

My husband is great and I've been extremely cautious on how I react to situations because my biggest fear is us losing each other during postpartum as I know emotions and tensions are high and divorce rates increase.

My baby is 6 weeks old as of yesterday snd not the easiest baby but also not the hardest. He naps well once he actually falls asleep, sleeps well at night, but feeding is a nightmare and when during his wake windows he's good for about 30 minutes and then starts crying and fights his sleep, he does not let us put him down unless it's his bassinet at night so all naps are contact naps. He doesn't mind the car once it's moving but once we stop it's game over, like full blown purple crying. 

Yesterday we decided we needed to get out of the house and that we really want to get him used to the car, I honestly tend to avoid it because his crying is my worst form of torture like I would rather someone pluck my eyelashes out than have to listen to him cry and not be able to help him. But I agreed we have to start doing every day things especially before my husband goes back to work so I can be able to leave the house once I'm alone. We did a grocery pick up (first mistake - choosing curbside) baby was good until it took 10 minutes for the groceries to come out. Husband helped the worker put the groceries in the car and baby started to cry. We then went to get coffees - husband put in a mobile order right as we pulled into the parking lot. I said to go to the drive through so the car stayed moving but he already put the order through as indoor pick up. I know he didn't do this maliciously but he then parked the car and went inside to wait for our coffees, baby immediately was screaming. It took 15 minutes for our coffees so I sat there with my poor baby screaming with sweat basically dripping down his face for 15 minutes while he waited inside - the guilt I feel for not taking the baby out of his seat is so strong but I didn't want to take him out and my husband come out seconds later so I just kept waiting. Once my husband got back in the car I was visibly overwhelmed and angry and said definitely rudely ""next time let's drive around while we wait"" and that prompted him to not speak to me for the rest of the day. Went up to our bedroom and napped for 7 hours, came down stairs made dinner for himself, and then finally took the baby. When I apologized for getting angry at him and tried to explain that I knew he didn't do it maliciously and it wasn't his fault that the coffees took so long I just wish we drove around to keep baby calm because it would've been less stressful for us both he started saying I just don't do anything around the house (he definitely does way more than I do - but I don't not do anything) and that I've been treating him like shit and that my reaction was not warranted today and still went on to not talk to me. I told him it was unfair that he was so mad at me that he went upstairs and willingly left our son for 7 hours, at one point he came down stairs and just walked right past the baby and it hurt my heart for him. 

I don't want this to be my life, my parents used to scream at eachother, and his parents did this avoidance thing where they would just go in different rooms and not speak to eachother for days and I don't want that for my son and I tried to explain to my husband we need to work on this and he keeps saying it wouldn't be if I wasn't so rude. I just don't think what I said was even bad, my tone probably, but I just wish he would think more like I do. Okay rant over during my 3am feed with the baby.",1,1756019839.0,newborns,1,0.67,False

Just wanna preface I'm entirely happy to plan dates. If he hasn't suggested a date after a few days or a week, I do, with just a straight ""hey would you like to go on a date?"" 

I've found the majority of the time after I ask that, in fact probably 95% of the time, that date never happens. They're either ""too busy"" to meet me (which always leads to nothing because let's be real: they aren't too busy, just not interested), they say they aren't ready to date or something, they say they'll let me know (which they never do), or they agree to the date, but make me plan everything. Like I suggest coffee or something, and their replies will just be ""idk whatever you wanna do"" ""idk whatever time suits you"" ""idk whatever date suits you."" If I straight say ""hey how about coffee at (this place) at (this time) on (this day)"", it's always they're busy on that day, and they don't offer an alternative. So in that case now I just give up. In the past when I still planned that date through all that bs, I either get stood up or they cancelled it. Obviously those men were never into me much in the first place.

Meanwhile, whenever the guy has asked me out first, or when he's responded to me asking him positively and just wasn't sure when to ask me (aka that 5% of the time), the date always happens. Sometimes the date can still be shit, or it can be great, but the date happens which is my point.

I continuously see men complain online, especially here, that they're sick of planning dates and women should initiate and plan dates. Meanwhile when I do, it hardly ever works out. My female friends have all had a similar experience to me.

I've found that if a man is truly interested in me, he'll ask me out, and have absolutely no problem doing so, unless in the rare cases he was shy and didn't wanna ruin the vibe or something by asking. I'm not gonna stop asking men out for this reason, but I don't bother anymore when I feel like I'm the only one planning everything.

So I just wanna hear from other women on here. How have you gone when being the one to initiate dates? Does it work out for you often or what?",3,1756019800.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Chapter 1

[Bro, after the birth, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like planned. Fair's fair.] Jessica's husband had cheated. His phone revealed the ""drunken mistake"" was a lie. ""Anna's pregnant."" William stated it flatly, like announcing weather. Jessica's teacup froze mid-air. Steam blurred the man's face across from her. ""Mine."" ""Jess, you know I need an heir. The pressure from my parents..."" The day Anna's pregnancy was confirmed, Jessica slept separately for the first time in nine years together, six married. Ninety-nine IVF attempts. Zero children. Anna. One night. Aaron and Michelle threatened suicide to keep the baby. Even William pleaded: ""Give my parents descendants."" Jessica agreed through searing pain. Everything shifted that day. She surrendered her bedroom, her husband, finally her life. When fire engulfed the villa, only Jessica and Anna remained. William rushed in, scooped Anna into his arms. ""William! My legs!"" Jessica begged as flames licked her pinned legs. He paused, holding Anna, avoiding her gaze. ""Anna's pregnant. Get yourself out."" Turning to Anna: ""You're both safe."" He ignored the burning debris crushing Jessica's legs. As consciousness faded, she remembered William standing in downpour five years prior: ""I'll abandon everything for you."" He'd endured 999 rounds of traditional family punishment, nearly severing ties with his parents. Now choosing Anna and the heir over her life. The love was gone. Near death, Jessica thought: If saved, she'd gracefully let go. Tick-tock. Dripping water woke her. ""Jessica, you're finally awake."" Jessica turned to find William's bloodshot eyes fixed on her, his face gaunt with exhaustion. Jessica recalled how he'd stayed by her bedside night after night during past illnesses, and a flicker of warmth stirred within her. ""I'm not..."" ""Jessica..."" He cut her off, pausing as if steeling himself. ""We'll divorce first to satisfy the Moores. Once Anna delivers the baby, we'll remarry."" The words tumbled out like rehearsed lines. ""After divorce, you'll keep living here. The child will be registered under your name—you'll raise him."" Jessica stared incredulously at the man she'd loved for five years. Was this some cruel joke? Expecting her to raise his mistress's child? What did he take her for? William avoided her gaze, murmuring, ""You're the mother I want for my child. As long as he bears your name, you'll always be an Anderson daughter-in-law."" ""Why?"" Her voice scraped out, raspy as coarse sandpaper. ""Anna needs legitimacy. The family has decided."" ""We divorce. I marry Anna."" Jessica watched the man who'd held her heart for eight years. ""And your brother?"" she asked, trembling uncontrollably. ""He agreed. I know this is unfair to you."" William's brow furrowed, genuine guilt finally surfacing. ""Jessica, I'll make it up to you."" Compensation? For eight years of youth? For shattered love? For their broken home? A hysterical laugh bubbled in Jessica's throat. It escaped—a twisted grimace more painful than tears. ""Okay."" Just one word. William froze, unprepared for her surrender. His rehearsed pleas clogged in his throat. After a stunned moment, he produced documents. ""Sign the divorce papers."" Jessica lowered her eyes. His signature already stained the page. Ice spread through her veins. She held the pen suspended. Minutes crawled by until William's pleading gaze shifted to unease, then thinly veiled impatience. ""Jessica, sign it."" Jessica moved at last. Her stiff lips curved slowly upward. A faint, lifeless smile. ""Alright."" Her voice floated, unnervingly calm. As she signed, William's audible relief filled the room. He even offered a conciliatory smile. ""Don't overthink this, Jessica. Focus on healing. My kindness to Anna? Just placating my parents—making them believe I value this child. Once born, I'll bring him to you. We'll..."" A phone rang—Anna's call. With an apologetic glance, William turned away without hesitation. ""Sweetie, just wait for me to carry you if your ankle's twisted."" His voice trailed off as he strode toward the door. When Jessica returned home after a month hospitalized, every trace of her existence had vanished. The living room vase no longer held her hyacinths—roses, Anna's favorite, bloomed instead. The clothes from the master bedroom closet had been moved to the guest room closet. As if possessed, she picked up William's spare phone left on the coffee table. The screen lit up, revealing an unread message. The sender was William's brother, Victor. [Bro, once the baby's born, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like we agreed. So no one loses out.] The last thread of sanity snapped in Jessica's mind. She clutched the phone, knuckles whitened from the grip, blood seeming to freeze in her veins. She recalled William's unusual reactions in bed recently, remembered how Victor kept staring at her, even joking about the hickeys William left. Not a drunken mistake, not a reckless night—but a long-planned swap. A chill crawled down Jessica's spine, nausea churning in her stomach. Stumbling, she fled the mansion.

Chapter 2

After leaving the manor house, Jessica had nowhere to go. This city had once become her home because of a man named William. Now it was no longer home. Without ID, Jessica found a cheap motel and huddled in the cold quilt, sleepless all night. The next day, Michelle called, her tone brooking no argument. ""Jessica, return to the manor. The media is watching. You must play your part."" The call ended abruptly. No inquiries about her recovery—only commands. Since William had nearly severed ties with his parents for her, Jessica had always obeyed Michelle. Penniless, with William holding her ID... Jessica decided to go back. Their wedding photo still sat in the living room, both beaming in the frame. Jessica walked past expressionlessly and turned the frame face down. She began packing. The scented candle he'd personally chosen for her—tossed in the trash. The limited-edition vinyl record he'd gifted—snapped in half. Every expensive suit, tie, and cufflink from his walk-in closet—methodically packed into cold cardboard boxes. Each motion severed the past. The door opened. William entered, frowning at the boxes littering the floor. ""What are you doing?"" ""Making space for you."" Jessica didn't look up, her voice flat. William seemed relieved, thinking she was throwing a tantrum. He stepped closer, tone artificially gentle. ""Jessie, don't be like this. Starting today, Anna will move in with me for easier care."" Jessica froze. She slowly raised her head, meeting his gaze. No guilt on his face—just matter-of-fact announcement. So he wasn't moving out. He was bringing another woman into their home. The last warmth drained from Jessica's heart. She nodded softly. ""Okay."" Just then, a frail voice sounded at the door. ""William? May I come in?"" Anna stood at the threshold in a white maternity dress, slight baby bump visible, wearing a smug smile. Her eyes swept over Jessica like appraising discarded junk. ""Sister, you're here too~ I just wanted to see what's missing in my future home."" Her words stabbed Jessica's heart like a poison-tipped needle. Anna entered the living room, eyes landing on Jessica's favorite wall painting. ""This painting's too gloomy for the baby. William, let's replace it?"" William didn't glance at the artwork, just cooed at Anna: ""Okay, whatever you say."" Anna smiled. She approached Jessica, voice dropping to a whisper only they could hear: ""Jessica, you lost."" Suddenly she gasped dramatically, collapsing sideways toward the coffee table. ""Ah!"" ""Anna!"" William's face paled. He lunged forward, catching her in a steady embrace before she hit the corner. He turned around, his eyes bloodshot, glaring at Jessica. ""Jessica! What did you do to her!"" That roar sliced through Jessica's heart like a blade. She stood frozen, unable to react. She had done nothing. ""I didn't..."" Jessica's voice cracked, dry and hoarse. ""How dare you deny it!"" William's gaze turned icy: ""She's carrying the Anderson heir! If anything happens to her, I'll bury you with her!"" Cradling Anna, he checked her with utmost care, as if holding priceless treasure. While Jessica—was nothing but discarded trash to him. Leaning against William's chest, Anna allowed a faint, unnoticed smile to touch her lips. William scooped her up and strode away without a backward glance. As he passed Jessica, his shoulder slammed hard into hers. Staggering backward, Jessica's arm struck the doorframe with a sickening thud. Sharp pain shot through her. But William's steps never faltered. He carried his treasure away, never looking back. The empty living room held only Jessica now. Slowly, she slid down the wall to the floor. A dark bruise bloomed on her arm, throbbing with heat—yet she couldn't feel it.

Chapter 3

Jessica didn't know how long she'd sat on the floor until her legs went numb. She finally pushed herself up using the wall and limped back to the bedroom that once belonged to them both. Now, only she remained. The next morning, Jessica froze at the top of the stairs, her eyes stung by the scene in the dining room. William was tenderly helping Anna into her seat—a gentleness he'd rarely shown her. His gaze flickered almost imperceptibly when it landed on the bruise marring Jessica's arm. A fleeting shadow of guilt. Yet that guilt evaporated instantly beneath Anna's fragile whimper. ""William,"" Anna leaned against his shoulder, her voice honeyed though her eyes taunted Jessica, ""I've no appetite today. Just some Herbed Root Porridge, please."" William stiffened. Herbed Root Porridge. The first thing Jessica ever cooked for him. In that cramped rented apartment, he'd burned with fever while she kept vigil all night. At dawn, she'd presented him a steaming hot bowl. William's throat moved. He looked at Jessica, hesitation threading his voice before it hardened into command. ""Jessica. Make a bowl."" She watched him, noting the struggle in his eyes before they surrendered to resolve. Suddenly, it all felt absurd. ""Alright."" The single word fell flat, lifeless as stagnant water. Jessica turned to the kitchen. She found the roots, peeled them, diced them, dropped them into the clay pot. Each motion precise yet mechanical, like programmed movements. Bubbles gurgled in the pot, releasing earthy fragrance. Once, William had hugged her from behind, laughing as he praised her skill. Now, the scent choked her. She ladled a portion into a bowl, carried it out, and set it silently before Anna. The porcelain spoon clinked against the rim. ""Careful, it's hot."" William lifted the spoon, blew on it repeatedly, then brought it to Anna's lips. Anna accepted his feeding, eyes blissfully closed. Jessica stood aside, an unwanted prop in their scene. Staying longer would make her vomit. She climbed the stairs, shutting out the loving couple behind her. Night deepened. Jessica had just lain down when the bedroom door slammed open. Two black-suited bodyguards marched in, grabbed her arms without expression. ""What are you doing!"" Jessica struggled as old wounds screamed under their grip. They dragged her downstairs. The living room blazed with light yet felt glacial. William stood center stage, face stormy, clutching a lab report. Anna lay pale on the sofa, a flustered family doctor hovering nearby. ""Speak! What did you put in that porridge!"" William's voice scraped through clenched teeth, laced with lethal frost. The bodyguards shoved Jessica forward. She stumbled, knees hitting the floor. ""I didn't."" She lifted her chin, meeting his frozen glare. ""Nothing."" ""Still lying!"" William slapped the lab report across her face. The edge of the paper scraped her cheek, leaving a faint sting. ""The doctor detected excessive alkaloids in the porridge! Anna had severe abdominal pain and nearly miscarried! And you still say you did nothing?"" Jessica looked at his furious face, and the numb spot in her heart was brutally torn open again. Just then, Aaron and Michelle Anderson rushed over. As soon as Michelle saw the weak Anna on the sofa and Jessica kneeling on the floor, rage instantly surged to her head. She charged forward, raised her hand, and with all her strength, slapped Jessica hard across the face. ""Slap—!"" The crisp sound echoed through the entire living room. Jessica's face was knocked to one side, her ears ringing. ""You poisonous woman! What sin did our Anderson family commit to marry a woman like you who can't bear children and has a wicked heart!"" ""Lock this woman up! Once Anna and the child are safe, we'll settle the score with her!"" Michelle ordered sharply. The bodyguards immediately stepped forward and hauled Jessica up again.

Chapter 4

Jessica was roughly thrown into the basement storage by two bodyguards, her forehead hitting the concrete wall, blood oozing out. The iron door slammed shut behind her with a clang. Jessica knelt on the cold floor, a biting chill piercing her knees. Her cheek stung with a burning pain. She remembered long ago, when they crowded in a small rented room. That year she lost her parents, and the winter was bitterly cold. William wrapped her in his arms, warming her icy hands and feet with his body heat. He once said, ""Jessica, I promise to give you a home, a forever warm home."" Jessica slowly hugged herself. After an unknown time, the iron door opened again. The blinding light made her instinctively squint. William stood at the door, his figure outlined in a hazy silhouette by the light. He walked in, looking down at her. ""Get up."" His voice sounded weary. Jessica didn't move. William swallowed, then crouched down. His tone softened a bit. ""The test results... the hospital made a mistake, the Herbed Root Porridge was fine."" William tried to explain. His gaze swept over Jessica's forehead with bloodstains and swollen face, and William felt a pang in his eyes. Jessica smiled faintly. William would rather she cried or made a scene than stay in this suffocating atmosphere. He turned and walked toward the door, ""Get out. Rest well, we're hosting guests in a few days."" Jessica leaned on the wall and walked out of the basement step by step. The things William sent were piled up in the living room. The latest limited-edition handbags, high-end custom jewelry. Even the keys to a new car. Jessica passed by, her eyes sweeping over those shiny things. Three days later, the Anderson family hosted a charity gala. To give Anna and her unborn child prestige and recognition. Michelle specifically called to warn Jessica, that she must play the role of the generous and virtuous eldest daughter-in-law well. In the banquet hall, Anna wore a custom-made red gown. Holding William's arm, her face flushed with happiness, her belly slightly swollen, which she deliberately pushed out. Jessica stood alone in a corner, wearing a plain white dress. Whispers surrounded her. ""Look, that's her, the one who can't have children."" ""I heard she tried to poison Miss Anna a few days ago, how vicious."" ""Poor William, stuck with such a wife."" Jessica's face was expressionless. The highlight of the gala was the charity auction. The final lot was a sapphire necklace named ""Tears of the Stars"". Jessica's breath caught for a moment. William had promised her that he would win it for her on their third wedding anniversary. The host introduced the necklace's origin. Anna suddenly tugged William's sleeve, pointed at the necklace, and said in a coquettish voice, ""William, it's so beautiful."" William's gaze swept through the crowd. Finally, it didn't linger on Jessica. He picked up the paddle and placed a sky-high bid. The exorbitantly priced necklace fell into William's hands. When William personally put the necklace on Anna, the whole room erupted in applause. Everyone was immersed in their happiness, only Jessica felt nauseated. She turned and fled the noisy place. On the balcony, the cold wind blew, bringing a moment of clarity to her confused mind. Behind her, Anna's voice drifted over faintly. Jessica froze. She slowly turned to face Anna. Anna beamed brightly. ""If you hadn't met William first, you'd never have become Mrs. Anderson."" Jessica stared coldly. ""Want it? I'll give you everything."" ""The title of Mrs. Anderson. This necklace. That man..."" Anna's smile stiffened. Jessica turned away. A deep, magnetic voice cut through the balcony shadows. ""Finished watching the Anderson family drama?"" Jessica halted. A tall figure emerged—Jose. Impeccable black suit. Red wine swirling in his glass. Eyes dark and penetrating. He stopped before Jessica, gaze fixed on her. Yet his words targeted Anna. ""Miss Anna, didn't Mr. Anderson ask you to rest upstairs?"" Anna paled, nodding stiffly before hurrying away. Better avoid the Roberts heir—everyone knew he was borderline psychopathic. ""Seems you still don't see it."" Jose's voice dropped lower. ""You'll let them trample over you while they play happy family?"" Jessica's heart clenched. Jose leaned closer, words dripping with temptation. ""What if I help you?"" ""Help you make them pay back everything they owe you. Double.""

Chapter 5

She slowly turned around and met those deep, unfathomable eyes. ""Who are you?"" Jose chuckled softly and drained the glass of red wine in one gulp. He casually placed the glass on the railing, making a crisp sound. ""Someone who admires you, and... pities you."" He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. In the air, the crisp scent of his cologne mixed with the smell of alcohol invaded Jessica's breath. ""What exactly do you want?"" She asked, her voice trembling. ""I want to help you."" Jose's gaze was intense, ""And help myself."" He looked at Jessica, his eyes filled with a complex, almost obsessive desire. Jessica laughed self-mockingly, never imagining that one day she would become a tool in someone else's hands. Jessica slowly raised her eyes to meet Jose's deep, unfathomable gaze. ""What do you want me to do?"" The corner of Jose's mouth finally curved into a genuine smile. Without another word, he took her hand and led her away from the nauseating banquet hall. The car sped along and finally stopped at a top-floor suite of a private club. Jose took off his suit jacket and tossed it casually onto the sofa. He walked to the bar and poured two glasses of whiskey. He handed one to Jessica. ""Drink it to warm up. Tonight, don't go back."" His voice echoed in the quiet space, carrying an undeniable command. Jose gently wrapped his arms around her from behind. His embrace was warm, carrying an unfamiliar, dangerous aura. Jessica's body instantly stiffened. ""Don't be afraid."" He whispered in her ear, his warm breath brushing against her neck. ""If you want revenge, you have to be crueler than them."" ""William could sleep with another woman for the sake of the child, why can't you?"" His hands began to wander restlessly. Jessica shuddered all over, as if burned, and pushed him away abruptly. ""Don't touch me!"" She retreated to the corner, like a frightened little animal, watching him warily. Jose wasn't angry; he just stood there, watching her calmly. ""Are you still guarding your chastity for him?"" ""Jessica, wake up."" ""In his heart, you're already tainted."" Those words, like the last straw, completely shattered Jessica's defenses. Tears welled up uncontrollably. She crouched down, buried her face in her knees, and let out stifled, painful sobs. The facade of strength she had maintained for so long crumbled at that moment. Jose watched her quietly, not approaching. After who knows how long, the crying gradually subsided. Jessica slowly lifted her tear-streaked face, her eyes filled with desperate madness. She stood up and walked step by step to him. Then, standing on tiptoe, she kissed his lips. He bent down, picked her up in his arms, and carried her to the large bed. No lust, no shame. Only the thrill of revenge. William You punished me with betrayal, so I'll repay you with the same betrayal. Her body was half burning, half ice.

Jessica was seeking a shred of comfort in this unfamiliar embrace, and also using this way to completely sever ties with the past. Jessica bit her lip hard, stifling any sound. Scenes from the past flashed before her eyes. William's love, William's deception, Michelle's insults, Anna's gloating... Time lost meaning. When Jessica opened her eyes, her body ached as if taken apart and put back together. Beside her lay Jose, his face relaxed in sleep. One arm remained possessively draped across her waist, a silent claim. She lay still, gazing blankly at the ceiling. Tears finally slid down silently. The man beside her stirred at her movement. Jose opened his eyes, his gaze intense. He said nothing, only tightened his arm, pulling her closer like a recovered treasure, his hold almost reverent. In the dimness, his low voice came, carrying a hint of roughness. ""Regrets?"" Jessica lay motionless like a porcelain doll. At last. She spoke slowly, ""No regrets."" From this day forward, love had no place in her world. William, I hope you can take it.",1,1756019789.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1myp0uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1myp0uu/is_it_possible_to_change_interests/,Is it possible to change interests?,"I once heard that what you eat most of forms the microbial biome in your gut that works best with it, which then causes you to crave those foods. That with some time of being exposed to other foods you can develop a liking to them and even stop missing other foods you used to eat because of the microbial change. This seems plausible as many people seemingly can train themselves to love things they used to hate as kids such as coffee or onions, or even get accustomed to spices. 

There are also studies that support habit forming and so on. 

My question is, is it possible to change your interests, not just hobbies, not just habits, but your own likes and dislikes and desires a bit like changing the way your tastebuds react to the food you have learned to expose yourself to? ",2,1756019691.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False

[Bro, after the birth, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like planned. Fair's fair.] Jessica's husband had cheated. His phone revealed the ""drunken mistake"" was a lie. ""Anna's pregnant."" William stated it flatly, like announcing weather. Jessica's teacup froze mid-air. Steam blurred the man's face across from her. ""Mine."" ""Jess, you know I need an heir. The pressure from my parents..."" The day Anna's pregnancy was confirmed, Jessica slept separately for the first time in nine years together, six married. Ninety-nine IVF attempts. Zero children. Anna. One night. Aaron and Michelle threatened suicide to keep the baby. Even William pleaded: ""Give my parents descendants."" Jessica agreed through searing pain. Everything shifted that day. She surrendered her bedroom, her husband, finally her life. When fire engulfed the villa, only Jessica and Anna remained. William rushed in, scooped Anna into his arms. ""William! My legs!"" Jessica begged as flames licked her pinned legs. He paused, holding Anna, avoiding her gaze. ""Anna's pregnant. Get yourself out."" Turning to Anna: ""You're both safe."" He ignored the burning debris crushing Jessica's legs. As consciousness faded, she remembered William standing in downpour five years prior: ""I'll abandon everything for you."" He'd endured 999 rounds of traditional family punishment, nearly severing ties with his parents. Now choosing Anna and the heir over her life. The love was gone. Near death, Jessica thought: If saved, she'd gracefully let go. Tick-tock. Dripping water woke her. ""Jessica, you're finally awake."" Jessica turned to find William's bloodshot eyes fixed on her, his face gaunt with exhaustion. Jessica recalled how he'd stayed by her bedside night after night during past illnesses, and a flicker of warmth stirred within her. ""I'm not..."" ""Jessica..."" He cut her off, pausing as if steeling himself. ""We'll divorce first to satisfy the Moores. Once Anna delivers the baby, we'll remarry."" The words tumbled out like rehearsed lines. ""After divorce, you'll keep living here. The child will be registered under your name—you'll raise him."" Jessica stared incredulously at the man she'd loved for five years. Was this some cruel joke? Expecting her to raise his mistress's child? What did he take her for? William avoided her gaze, murmuring, ""You're the mother I want for my child. As long as he bears your name, you'll always be an Anderson daughter-in-law."" ""Why?"" Her voice scraped out, raspy as coarse sandpaper. ""Anna needs legitimacy. The family has decided."" ""We divorce. I marry Anna."" Jessica watched the man who'd held her heart for eight years. ""And your brother?"" she asked, trembling uncontrollably. ""He agreed. I know this is unfair to you."" William's brow furrowed, genuine guilt finally surfacing. ""Jessica, I'll make it up to you."" Compensation? For eight years of youth? For shattered love? For their broken home? A hysterical laugh bubbled in Jessica's throat. It escaped—a twisted grimace more painful than tears. ""Okay."" Just one word. William froze, unprepared for her surrender. His rehearsed pleas clogged in his throat. After a stunned moment, he produced documents. ""Sign the divorce papers."" Jessica lowered her eyes. His signature already stained the page. Ice spread through her veins. She held the pen suspended. Minutes crawled by until William's pleading gaze shifted to unease, then thinly veiled impatience. ""Jessica, sign it."" Jessica moved at last. Her stiff lips curved slowly upward. A faint, lifeless smile. ""Alright."" Her voice floated, unnervingly calm. As she signed, William's audible relief filled the room. He even offered a conciliatory smile. ""Don't overthink this, Jessica. Focus on healing. My kindness to Anna? Just placating my parents—making them believe I value this child. Once born, I'll bring him to you. We'll..."" A phone rang—Anna's call. With an apologetic glance, William turned away without hesitation. ""Sweetie, just wait for me to carry you if your ankle's twisted."" His voice trailed off as he strode toward the door. When Jessica returned home after a month hospitalized, every trace of her existence had vanished. The living room vase no longer held her hyacinths—roses, Anna's favorite, bloomed instead. The clothes from the master bedroom closet had been moved to the guest room closet. As if possessed, she picked up William's spare phone left on the coffee table. The screen lit up, revealing an unread message. The sender was William's brother, Victor. [Bro, once the baby's born, we'll swap Jessica and Anna back like we agreed. So no one loses out.] The last thread of sanity snapped in Jessica's mind. She clutched the phone, knuckles whitened from the grip, blood seeming to freeze in her veins. She recalled William's unusual reactions in bed recently, remembered how Victor kept staring at her, even joking about the hickeys William left. Not a drunken mistake, not a reckless night—but a long-planned swap. A chill crawled down Jessica's spine, nausea churning in her stomach. Stumbling, she fled the mansion.

Chapter 2

After leaving the manor house, Jessica had nowhere to go. This city had once become her home because of a man named William. Now it was no longer home. Without ID, Jessica found a cheap motel and huddled in the cold quilt, sleepless all night. The next day, Michelle called, her tone brooking no argument. ""Jessica, return to the manor. The media is watching. You must play your part."" The call ended abruptly. No inquiries about her recovery—only commands. Since William had nearly severed ties with his parents for her, Jessica had always obeyed Michelle. Penniless, with William holding her ID... Jessica decided to go back. Their wedding photo still sat in the living room, both beaming in the frame. Jessica walked past expressionlessly and turned the frame face down. She began packing. The scented candle he'd personally chosen for her—tossed in the trash. The limited-edition vinyl record he'd gifted—snapped in half. Every expensive suit, tie, and cufflink from his walk-in closet—methodically packed into cold cardboard boxes. Each motion severed the past. The door opened. William entered, frowning at the boxes littering the floor. ""What are you doing?"" ""Making space for you."" Jessica didn't look up, her voice flat. William seemed relieved, thinking she was throwing a tantrum. He stepped closer, tone artificially gentle. ""Jessie, don't be like this. Starting today, Anna will move in with me for easier care."" Jessica froze. She slowly raised her head, meeting his gaze. No guilt on his face—just matter-of-fact announcement. So he wasn't moving out. He was bringing another woman into their home. The last warmth drained from Jessica's heart. She nodded softly. ""Okay."" Just then, a frail voice sounded at the door. ""William? May I come in?"" Anna stood at the threshold in a white maternity dress, slight baby bump visible, wearing a smug smile. Her eyes swept over Jessica like appraising discarded junk. ""Sister, you're here too~ I just wanted to see what's missing in my future home."" Her words stabbed Jessica's heart like a poison-tipped needle. Anna entered the living room, eyes landing on Jessica's favorite wall painting. ""This painting's too gloomy for the baby. William, let's replace it?"" William didn't glance at the artwork, just cooed at Anna: ""Okay, whatever you say."" Anna smiled. She approached Jessica, voice dropping to a whisper only they could hear: ""Jessica, you lost."" Suddenly she gasped dramatically, collapsing sideways toward the coffee table. ""Ah!"" ""Anna!"" William's face paled. He lunged forward, catching her in a steady embrace before she hit the corner. He turned around, his eyes bloodshot, glaring at Jessica. ""Jessica! What did you do to her!"" That roar sliced through Jessica's heart like a blade. She stood frozen, unable to react. She had done nothing. ""I didn't..."" Jessica's voice cracked, dry and hoarse. ""How dare you deny it!"" William's gaze turned icy: ""She's carrying the Anderson heir! If anything happens to her, I'll bury you with her!"" Cradling Anna, he checked her with utmost care, as if holding priceless treasure. While Jessica—was nothing but discarded trash to him. Leaning against William's chest, Anna allowed a faint, unnoticed smile to touch her lips. William scooped her up and strode away without a backward glance. As he passed Jessica, his shoulder slammed hard into hers. Staggering backward, Jessica's arm struck the doorframe with a sickening thud. Sharp pain shot through her. But William's steps never faltered. He carried his treasure away, never looking back. The empty living room held only Jessica now. Slowly, she slid down the wall to the floor. A dark bruise bloomed on her arm, throbbing with heat—yet she couldn't feel it.

Chapter 3

Jessica didn't know how long she'd sat on the floor until her legs went numb. She finally pushed herself up using the wall and limped back to the bedroom that once belonged to them both. Now, only she remained. The next morning, Jessica froze at the top of the stairs, her eyes stung by the scene in the dining room. William was tenderly helping Anna into her seat—a gentleness he'd rarely shown her. His gaze flickered almost imperceptibly when it landed on the bruise marring Jessica's arm. A fleeting shadow of guilt. Yet that guilt evaporated instantly beneath Anna's fragile whimper. ""William,"" Anna leaned against his shoulder, her voice honeyed though her eyes taunted Jessica, ""I've no appetite today. Just some Herbed Root Porridge, please."" William stiffened. Herbed Root Porridge. The first thing Jessica ever cooked for him. In that cramped rented apartment, he'd burned with fever while she kept vigil all night. At dawn, she'd presented him a steaming hot bowl. William's throat moved. He looked at Jessica, hesitation threading his voice before it hardened into command. ""Jessica. Make a bowl."" She watched him, noting the struggle in his eyes before they surrendered to resolve. Suddenly, it all felt absurd. ""Alright."" The single word fell flat, lifeless as stagnant water. Jessica turned to the kitchen. She found the roots, peeled them, diced them, dropped them into the clay pot. Each motion precise yet mechanical, like programmed movements. Bubbles gurgled in the pot, releasing earthy fragrance. Once, William had hugged her from behind, laughing as he praised her skill. Now, the scent choked her. She ladled a portion into a bowl, carried it out, and set it silently before Anna. The porcelain spoon clinked against the rim. ""Careful, it's hot."" William lifted the spoon, blew on it repeatedly, then brought it to Anna's lips. Anna accepted his feeding, eyes blissfully closed. Jessica stood aside, an unwanted prop in their scene. Staying longer would make her vomit. She climbed the stairs, shutting out the loving couple behind her. Night deepened. Jessica had just lain down when the bedroom door slammed open. Two black-suited bodyguards marched in, grabbed her arms without expression. ""What are you doing!"" Jessica struggled as old wounds screamed under their grip. They dragged her downstairs. The living room blazed with light yet felt glacial. William stood center stage, face stormy, clutching a lab report. Anna lay pale on the sofa, a flustered family doctor hovering nearby. ""Speak! What did you put in that porridge!"" William's voice scraped through clenched teeth, laced with lethal frost. The bodyguards shoved Jessica forward. She stumbled, knees hitting the floor. ""I didn't."" She lifted her chin, meeting his frozen glare. ""Nothing."" ""Still lying!"" William slapped the lab report across her face. The edge of the paper scraped her cheek, leaving a faint sting. ""The doctor detected excessive alkaloids in the porridge! Anna had severe abdominal pain and nearly miscarried! And you still say you did nothing?"" Jessica looked at his furious face, and the numb spot in her heart was brutally torn open again. Just then, Aaron and Michelle Anderson rushed over. As soon as Michelle saw the weak Anna on the sofa and Jessica kneeling on the floor, rage instantly surged to her head. She charged forward, raised her hand, and with all her strength, slapped Jessica hard across the face. ""Slap—!"" The crisp sound echoed through the entire living room. Jessica's face was knocked to one side, her ears ringing. ""You poisonous woman! What sin did our Anderson family commit to marry a woman like you who can't bear children and has a wicked heart!"" ""Lock this woman up! Once Anna and the child are safe, we'll settle the score with her!"" Michelle ordered sharply. The bodyguards immediately stepped forward and hauled Jessica up again.

Chapter 4

Jessica was roughly thrown into the basement storage by two bodyguards, her forehead hitting the concrete wall, blood oozing out. The iron door slammed shut behind her with a clang. Jessica knelt on the cold floor, a biting chill piercing her knees. Her cheek stung with a burning pain. She remembered long ago, when they crowded in a small rented room. That year she lost her parents, and the winter was bitterly cold. William wrapped her in his arms, warming her icy hands and feet with his body heat. He once said, ""Jessica, I promise to give you a home, a forever warm home."" Jessica slowly hugged herself. After an unknown time, the iron door opened again. The blinding light made her instinctively squint. William stood at the door, his figure outlined in a hazy silhouette by the light. He walked in, looking down at her. ""Get up."" His voice sounded weary. Jessica didn't move. William swallowed, then crouched down. His tone softened a bit. ""The test results... the hospital made a mistake, the Herbed Root Porridge was fine."" William tried to explain. His gaze swept over Jessica's forehead with bloodstains and swollen face, and William felt a pang in his eyes. Jessica smiled faintly. William would rather she cried or made a scene than stay in this suffocating atmosphere. He turned and walked toward the door, ""Get out. Rest well, we're hosting guests in a few days."" Jessica leaned on the wall and walked out of the basement step by step. The things William sent were piled up in the living room. The latest limited-edition handbags, high-end custom jewelry. Even the keys to a new car. Jessica passed by, her eyes sweeping over those shiny things. Three days later, the Anderson family hosted a charity gala. To give Anna and her unborn child prestige and recognition. Michelle specifically called to warn Jessica, that she must play the role of the generous and virtuous eldest daughter-in-law well. In the banquet hall, Anna wore a custom-made red gown. Holding William's arm, her face flushed with happiness, her belly slightly swollen, which she deliberately pushed out. Jessica stood alone in a corner, wearing a plain white dress. Whispers surrounded her. ""Look, that's her, the one who can't have children."" ""I heard she tried to poison Miss Anna a few days ago, how vicious."" ""Poor William, stuck with such a wife."" Jessica's face was expressionless. The highlight of the gala was the charity auction. The final lot was a sapphire necklace named ""Tears of the Stars"". Jessica's breath caught for a moment. William had promised her that he would win it for her on their third wedding anniversary. The host introduced the necklace's origin. Anna suddenly tugged William's sleeve, pointed at the necklace, and said in a coquettish voice, ""William, it's so beautiful."" William's gaze swept through the crowd. Finally, it didn't linger on Jessica. He picked up the paddle and placed a sky-high bid. The exorbitantly priced necklace fell into William's hands. When William personally put the necklace on Anna, the whole room erupted in applause. Everyone was immersed in their happiness, only Jessica felt nauseated. She turned and fled the noisy place. On the balcony, the cold wind blew, bringing a moment of clarity to her confused mind. Behind her, Anna's voice drifted over faintly. Jessica froze. She slowly turned to face Anna. Anna beamed brightly. ""If you hadn't met William first, you'd never have become Mrs. Anderson."" Jessica stared coldly. ""Want it? I'll give you everything."" ""The title of Mrs. Anderson. This necklace. That man..."" Anna's smile stiffened. Jessica turned away. A deep, magnetic voice cut through the balcony shadows. ""Finished watching the Anderson family drama?"" Jessica halted. A tall figure emerged—Jose. Impeccable black suit. Red wine swirling in his glass. Eyes dark and penetrating. He stopped before Jessica, gaze fixed on her. Yet his words targeted Anna. ""Miss Anna, didn't Mr. Anderson ask you to rest upstairs?"" Anna paled, nodding stiffly before hurrying away. Better avoid the Roberts heir—everyone knew he was borderline psychopathic. ""Seems you still don't see it."" Jose's voice dropped lower. ""You'll let them trample over you while they play happy family?"" Jessica's heart clenched. Jose leaned closer, words dripping with temptation. ""What if I help you?"" ""Help you make them pay back everything they owe you. Double.""

Chapter 5

She slowly turned around and met those deep, unfathomable eyes. ""Who are you?"" Jose chuckled softly and drained the glass of red wine in one gulp. He casually placed the glass on the railing, making a crisp sound. ""Someone who admires you, and... pities you."" He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. In the air, the crisp scent of his cologne mixed with the smell of alcohol invaded Jessica's breath. ""What exactly do you want?"" She asked, her voice trembling. ""I want to help you."" Jose's gaze was intense, ""And help myself."" He looked at Jessica, his eyes filled with a complex, almost obsessive desire. Jessica laughed self-mockingly, never imagining that one day she would become a tool in someone else's hands. Jessica slowly raised her eyes to meet Jose's deep, unfathomable gaze. ""What do you want me to do?"" The corner of Jose's mouth finally curved into a genuine smile. Without another word, he took her hand and led her away from the nauseating banquet hall. The car sped along and finally stopped at a top-floor suite of a private club. Jose took off his suit jacket and tossed it casually onto the sofa. He walked to the bar and poured two glasses of whiskey. He handed one to Jessica. ""Drink it to warm up. Tonight, don't go back."" His voice echoed in the quiet space, carrying an undeniable command. Jose gently wrapped his arms around her from behind. His embrace was warm, carrying an unfamiliar, dangerous aura. Jessica's body instantly stiffened. ""Don't be afraid."" He whispered in her ear, his warm breath brushing against her neck. ""If you want revenge, you have to be crueler than them."" ""William could sleep with another woman for the sake of the child, why can't you?"" His hands began to wander restlessly. Jessica shuddered all over, as if burned, and pushed him away abruptly. ""Don't touch me!"" She retreated to the corner, like a frightened little animal, watching him warily. Jose wasn't angry; he just stood there, watching her calmly. ""Are you still guarding your chastity for him?"" ""Jessica, wake up."" ""In his heart, you're already tainted."" Those words, like the last straw, completely shattered Jessica's defenses. Tears welled up uncontrollably. She crouched down, buried her face in her knees, and let out stifled, painful sobs. The facade of strength she had maintained for so long crumbled at that moment. Jose watched her quietly, not approaching. After who knows how long, the crying gradually subsided. Jessica slowly lifted her tear-streaked face, her eyes filled with desperate madness.

I have never been out of shape or overweight but thats something i never cared for as well. I ate whatever only when i was really hungry and thats still the case. 

I've been suicidal for as long as i can remember. I've never acted upon it n live considerably normal for someone too depressed but the thought of just ending this miserable life never leaves my head. I've been like this for over 10 years now and I do feel like someday, I'll give in to it. But this post is not exactly about that. Its not been 10 minutes since i woke up that im writing this post cuz im going through a mix of emotions n confusions n i need to know if someone could relate or help me understand 'why'

Anyways, about this post. Back home, i could eat whatever i liked, i smoked in peace, i lived without much of a concern for my health. Rn, i have a bad self-concern/blame over every little thing i eat, vape or cigarettes i smoke, drinks i have and it annoys the life out of me whilst being equally suicidal which is something i dont understand. I have a candy, or a good coffee, or anything sweet n my head goes 'Your crossing the WHO advised limit of 25gms /day, you're raising the risk of a diabetes or an attack so hate yourself for having it"". I smoke a cigarette or my vape n i have similar thoughts for every puff i take. Im sorry if it dont sound like much of an issue but im losing my sanity over it. I see people around me having their favourite foods or having their drinks n smokes in peace and i cant even get myself to do any of the same again and there's not much in life i did in peace to even begin with.

Been careless with food, thinking that it will just go on its own, but the lump which i assume as external hemorrhoids have become firm and painful. Bloody pooping also observed and pain after BM. Might have been mixed with an internal one. 

A week ago, I decided to fix myself and commit. Got a more accurate prescription taking Daflon and some ointment (Faktu). Got strict with food - all fiber rich, no coffee, no alcohol, nearly pure fiber for days now. Also did some walking and light exercises for circulation.  Did sitz bath thrice a day no fail. 

Result: some good improvement - bloodless pooping, almost absent pain while pooping, lump is deflating (i can play and deform it a bit as it already soft). 

But there’s a lingering pain when i move like switching positions when I lie down or sit, or when I wake up in the morning after being so stationary? The pain could be sharp. Is it normal? What to do? This is worse than the lump or BM ",2,1756019384.0,hemorrhoid,1,1.0,False

1myowhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/arcadeplay/comments/1myowhm/the_last_quarter_a_short_arcade_legend_fiction/,"The Last Quarter — a short arcade legend (fiction) — read, react, then drop your sequel","They called it the Alley: one long room of neon and buzzing speakers between a closed laundromat and a curry shop that never slept. At three in the morning the Alley belonged to the night-crew — the insomniacs, the delivery drivers, the pair of kids who skateboarded until their parents found them — and to anyone who still believed a single coin could bend time.

I’d come back because I kept telling myself I had one last thing to prove. Not to strangers, not to the scoreboard. To the person who felt smaller each morning in the mirror — quieter, careful, unremarkable. The machine I stood in front of had a sticker that read VOID RUNNER — a pixel-world where tiny ships threaded impossible gaps and ghosts chased you through neon tunnels. For some of us it was practice; for others it was confession.

The clerk, a broad-shouldered woman named Lila, slid a plastic tray with a single quarter to me. “No going soft,” she said, and the fluorescent light made her smile look like a promise.

I fed the coin. The first runs were a memory. Fingers remembered angles I’d forgotten I knew. There’s a particular silence in concentration — the kind that buries the clatter of the Alley and leaves only the hum of the machine and your breath. I missed that silence: the way the world tightened to a single precise motion. Frame by frame, I stitched a thread of rhythm. The machine answered. The numbers climbed.

Halfway through, a kid with a scraped knee stopped to watch. He’d been here all night, eyes wide, mesmerized by the way the ship darted through impossible slits. When I leveled up for the final stage the Alley had leaned in. Phones lifted like tiny constellations. Someone joked about betting coffee. It sounded absurd and lovely.

Then the impossible happened: I saw the opening — a gap no one had ever survived on screen two. The pattern was a breath, a meter, a single flick that had to be perfect. My wrist moved. The world felt like the inside of a watch: gears, click, release. The ship slid through, a whisper of light. The scoreboard blinked. New record.

For a second I was a fist of triumph. Then the kid whispered, “Can I try?” — and that word cracked something open. He had been watching for hours, face raw with wanting. That hunger looked like the same ghost I’d been chasing into machines and late shifts.

I could have told him to wait, to earn it, to come back tomorrow with pocketed quarters and a plan. Instead I stepped back and pushed the joystick to him. “Show me where you get stuck,” I said.

He fumbled at first, nervous fingers making mistakes I’d made a thousand times. I coached a breath at a time — an index finger on the edge of the cabinet, a quiet suggestion: “Hold, then tap. Not too early.” After three tries he found the rhythm and — not perfect, but true — he skated through the same gap and the scoreboard lit up again. Not a new record. Not mine. But his face looked like sunrise.

Later, Lila printed three names on a napkin and taped it to the cabinet: the night’s best runs, but also one word she underlined — stay. “This is the place that keeps people,” she said. “You keep people.”

I left with my name still on the board, and with a new shape in my chest I hadn’t expected: a steady, surprising warmth. Victory had been sweet. The thing I hadn’t expected was how much sweeter it was to hand the joystick over and watch someone else learn.

When I walked past the closed laundromat, the quarter in my pocket felt lighter. It had paid for more than a game.",1,1756019239.0,arcadeplay,0,1.0,False

It starts with a guy and his lover, I can’t exactly remember how the clock is introduced, probably in a dream but it ticks backwards. When he wakes up he comments on how his lover looks younger, like he was in high school I think. As the story progresses every time he falls asleep he sees the clock in this void space, and it ticks backwards. When it does he wake up to find his lover is like 5 years younger to the point where he regresses to age 5. The guy begins to smoke and drink coffee nonstop to avoid falling asleep, until the 5 year old boy asks, I think for a bedtime story. So the main guy tells him about the clock, and the little boy says, “this one?” And he just pulls it from behind his back. The main guy is shocked and somehow returns with the clock in the void space again and finally breaks the clock out of frustration but when he awakens he finds that his lover is now a fetus. I think at the end he just vows to take care of him while crying or something. 

I think the main character had brown hair and his lover had black hair but I’m not too sure. Could be the other way around.

I ducked into the café, shaking off my umbrella, and then I saw her. She came in like she was mad at the rain, hair plastered to her cheeks, coat soaked in spots, and I swear… something about her just stopped me. I don’t know what it was. Maybe the way she looked like she didn’t care that anyone was watching, or maybe it was her little frown that made me want to fix the world for her.

I had my sketchpad out, pretending to draw, but I wasn’t. I couldn’t focus on the lines or shading. I kept stealing glances. She picked a table by the window, opened a notebook, and started writing—or pretending to write—and I tried not to stare. Tried.

The next week she came again. And the week after that. Suddenly, I realized I was looking forward to the sound of the café door, to seeing her hair sticking to her neck, to that tiny smile she’d give herself when she thought no one was looking. I couldn’t let her know I was noticing. That would be weird. Or worse, creepy.

So I did the only thing I could think of: I left her a sketch. Just her, in the rain outside the window, notebook open, hair wet, a small smile forming. Nothing fancy, no signature. Just… hoping she’d notice.

The next day, there it was: a tiny note on her table. *“Who are you?”*

I froze. My heart did that stupid, panicky flip. Should I hide? Run? Smile awkwardly? I just picked up the note with shaky hands and scribbled back the first thing I could think of. And that’s how it started. Notes, sketches, little whispers over coffee cups. Each time she laughed at one of my scribbles, my chest warmed. I noticed everything—how she twirled her pen when she was thinking, the faint hum when she read, the way her eyes lit up when she smiled.

Weeks passed. And then one evening, the sky bruised purple and gold, I realized I couldn’t hold it in anymore. My stomach was twisting like crazy, my hands sweating, but I walked over and said it: *“I’ve been waiting for you to notice me… properly.”*

She looked up at me, eyes bright, and laughed—the kind of laugh that makes your chest feel lighter, like gravity isn’t real. “I think I’ve been noticing you all along,” she said.

We walked out together into the drizzle, hands brushing, and I didn’t pull away. Not once. I felt her fingers linger just a second longer, and something warm and terrible and wonderful spread through me. Love isn’t always fireworks. Sometimes it’s awkward glances, small sketches, silly little notes, laughter over coffee, and finally… saying the words you’ve been holding in your chest for weeks.

That café, that rain, her laugh, the tiny notes and sketches—they were all perfect, messy, real. And maybe that’s what love is: small, quiet, human moments that sneak up on you until you realize… you’ve been waiting for this all along.",1,1756018622.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

You might be surprised to learn that your favorite wake-up drink is not only a burst of energy but also incredibly low in calories.**

But what does that mean for your daily diet and your weight loss goals? If you’re looking to cut calories while still enjoying your daily caffeine fix, understanding the caloric content of black coffee is essential. We’ll dive deep into the numbers, separating fact from fiction, and reveal how this simple beverage could be your best ally in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Keep reading to discover how your daily coffee ritual might be more beneficial than you ever imagined.

# Caloric Content Of Black Coffee

Black coffee is a beloved beverage worldwide. Many enjoy its rich flavor and aroma. But what about its calories? Understanding the caloric content can be crucial for those watching their intake.

Black coffee is often touted for its low-calorie count. It’s a favorite choice for calorie-conscious drinkers. Let’s dive into the details of its caloric content.

# How Many Calories In A Cup?

A standard cup of black coffee has about 2 calories. This makes it an excellent low-calorie drink. It’s ideal for those trying to cut down on calories.

# Why So Low?

Black coffee’s low calories come from its simple ingredients. Water and ground coffee beans contribute little to no calories. There are no added sugars or fats.

# Impact On Your Diet

Black coffee can fit easily into most diets. Its minimal calories allow for greater flexibility. It won’t disrupt your daily caloric goals.

# Comparing With Other Beverages

Many other drinks contain higher calories. For example, sugary sodas or lattes. Black coffee stands out for its simplicity.

# Factors Affecting Calorie Count

Black coffee is widely loved for its bold flavor and simplicity. Many wonder about its calorie count, especially if they’re watching their diet. Though black coffee is low in calories, various factors can influence its precise calorie content. Two important factors are brew strength and serving size.

# Brew Strength

The strength of your coffee brew can affect its calorie count. Stronger brews use more coffee grounds. More grounds might lead to slightly more calories. The coffee bean itself contains minimal calories. However, the brewing process extracts oils and compounds. These can contribute to a small calorie increase. Choosing a lighter brew might be slightly less caloric.

# Serving Size

Serving size plays a crucial role in the calorie count of black coffee. A standard cup is typically 8 ounces. Yet, many mugs are larger, often 12 ounces or more. Larger servings mean more coffee, slightly increasing calorie content. Always check the size of your cup. This ensures you’re aware of any calorie variations.

# Comparing Black Coffee To Other Beverages

Black coffee stands out with its minimal calorie count. A cup typically contains only 2 calories. Compared to sugary sodas or creamy lattes, it’s a low-calorie choice. Perfect for those watching their calorie intake. Enjoy the rich flavor without the guilt.

Imagine waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and you reach for that comforting cup of black coffee. You might not realize it, but you’re savoring one of the lowest-calorie beverages around. In fact, a cup of black coffee contains just about 2 calories. Let’s explore how this compares to other popular beverages you might reach for throughout your day.

I’ve been through serious relationships before, some naging friends, some hindi, but I’m grateful some of my exes even became good friends.. After all that, I decided to take a step back and work on myself muna. Ang dami ko ring natutunan sa phase na yun.

1myoixz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myoixz,28 (M4F) For the ones who like conversations that zig-zag between the ridiculous and the profound,"Okay, here’s the thing. Everyone here starts with height, weight, city, job title. Like we’re ordering ourselves off a menu. So let’s get that out of the way quickly: 28, 5’7, Bangalore, have a dog, have a job in marketing. Done. Now, let me tell you the stuff that actually matters.

A normal Tuesday night for me looks like this: a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle spread across the table, me swearing at one missing corner piece like it owes me rent, and my dog side-eying me because I forgot his snack. At 3AM, I’m celebrating one stubborn piece fitting in like it’s the World Cup final, then wondering why I do this to myself.

Fast-forward to a lazy Sunday morning: strong coffee brewing (so strong it could probably resurrect Gandhi), a half-done crossword on the table, and me trying to decide whether to keep solving or re-read a book I’ve already finished twice. Spoiler: the book usually wins, and I act like I’ve discovered something new even though I know exactly what’s coming.

I’m also that person who occasionally decides, in the middle of work hours, that the piano needs to be played right now. It sounds better in my head than in reality, my neighbors are living proof that patience is a virtue. Between chords, I’m switching languages (Hindi, English, French, Kannada, Marathi) like a malfunctioning Google Translate, forgetting words I thought I knew. Half my Duolingo streaks are basically lies.

And then come the evenings. My favorite kind: the Bangalore monsoon ones. You know the scene, rain hammering against tin roofs, filter coffee that tastes like jet fuel, the smell of wet earth. I’m in some tiny café, in deep conversation. One second we’re joking about how Indians call every uphill walk a “trek,” the next we’re dissecting why Murakami writes women like he’s never actually spoken to one. I live for that kind of rhythm: dumb laughter and sharp honesty back-to-back.

Now, the childfree part. I don’t hate kids. They’re cute, especially when they’re not mine. But I like my sleep, my books, my random late-night board games, my dog on the bed, my sudden weekend trips, and the peace of knowing my bank account isn’t being emptied by formula and school fees. Having kids feels like running a startup where the investors are angry toddlers. I’m more interested in living a life where my time and energy are spent on people I choose, not people society expects me to raise.

Here’s something I value more than anything else: emotional availability. I don’t mean showing up perfectly, but just the ability to show up as yourself; messy, funny, flawed, curious, and hold space for someone else doing the same. I’m not interested in relationships that feel like half-baked ghosting games. If you know how to listen, laugh at yourself, and be honest even when it’s uncomfortable, we’ll get along fine.

Also, unlike half the posts here, I’m not going to make demands about having to work, which city you live in, or how “settled” you are. We’re in our 20s, half of us are thriving, half of us are surviving, and most of us are doing both depending on the day. I’d rather know who you are when you’re tired.

To make this less abstract, I’m attaching ten photos from my life; little snapshots: my dog being her dramatic self, a blurry café evening in the rain, one too many puzzle nights, maybe a bookshelf I’m unreasonably proud of. Because words are nice, but sometimes you need to see the chaos too.

So who should actually bother messaging me?

* If you’ve ever had a 2AM conversation that started with “What if we’re all living in a simulation?” and ended with “Do dogs dream in color?”
* If you judge people who say “I don’t like music” (seriously, what do you even do in silence?)
* If you think memes are a legitimate love language.
* If your idea of a good date is wandering around a bookshop and arguing over which section is superior (fiction, history, or self-help).
* If you understand that “Netflix and chill” in my dictionary often means “Netflix, actual chill, and pausing every 10 minutes to discuss the cinematography.”

I don’t promise cinematic fireworks, or “the one,” or any of that Pinterest-board soulmate stuff. What I can promise: banter that doesn’t run out, conversations that zig-zag between the ridiculous and the profound, honesty that’s sometimes too honest, and a steady supply of unimpressed dog pictures. 

Worst case? You get a new meme recommendation and never talk to me again. Best case? We’re sitting across a rainy café table, laughing so hard the waiter starts questioning our sanity.",19,1756017852.0,ChildfreeIndia,5,0.95,False

This is a story from a while ago, but my ex recently started bringing it up to make me feel bad.

I honestly didn't see the need to sleep with others that year. I felt quite happy with my boyfriend, so much so that we were planning to live together.

I felt good in the relationship, even though he left me feeling pretty unsatisfied in bed because he tired quickly and didn't care about me. But I never held it against him because I loved him and knew he came home from work tired.

Everything started to change when I got a promotion at work and things started going really well for me. I was working fewer hours and earning more. He started to distance himself from me and talk to me very little, and he also started to not want to be intimate with me. I was very worried because I felt we were doing very well, but he started to get uncomfortable when I told him how happy I was in my new position. I tried to talk about it a lot of times but he always says: we are good, why you ask?

The thing is, one day a friend of mine contacted me to meet up. We went to get coffee, and he showed me a conversation with my boyfriend that he was planning to meet up with him behind my back, and that I wouldn't find out because we had broken up, and I was very emotional about it. My friend told him the day and place to show me, and he confirmed it, and he confirmed it to him that ""we had broken up and he felt dissatisfied with me"" in the chat that he show me. I felt like my world was falling apart at any moment. Break up? But in a month, we were moving in together!

My friend knew things weren't that way and played along to show me he was trying to cheat on me. I told him to give me a day to confirm or process it because the truth was, I felt stabbed in the back. That afternoon, I asked him if he had any intentions of sleeping with someone or hang up with someone, and he denied it; he said no, he wasn't going to see anyone this weeks. I asked him if he felt comfortable in our relationship, and he even laughed and said, ""Silly, obviously everything's fine. We're going to live together, start a life together.""

He lied to my face, and I gave him the chance twice to talk things over truthfully asking him if anythingdoesn'tlike in our relationship he cal always talk to me but no, he denided. So I spoke to my friend, and he confirmed that as soon as I left my boyfriend's apartment, he confirmed that they were going to get together to sleep together in that week, and that he didn't just talk to him about the fact that he were over and wanted to sleep with him, but with more people! Behind my back!
So, faced with shame, anger and disappointment, it occurred to me that my friend and I could sleep before they sleep. 

And so we did, but not only that. Even we took photos and truly I had a wonderful time, not only intimately but also talking and sharing even crying, which truly helped calm my troubled mind after what my boyfriend was trying to do.

My friend sent him a message canceling the date because I satisfied him much more than he could ever have. And I sent him the photos with my friend along with a screenshot of the chat where he said we had broken up and he felt dissatisfied. I said, ""Since we had broken up and you felt so bad about me, I take advantage of the opportunity to satisfy me in all the ways you haven't.""

He got angry, he send me scream audios and tried to burn me on social media, but the people he was seducing by saying we had broken up asked him, ""But you said you weren't dating anymore, right? Why are you so mad?""

The truth is, he almost betrayal, but the intention was to do it, It really wrecked me, and I was pretty mad and sad for a while. Despite all the freedom I gave him, he preferred to lie and do things behind my back. Why? Honestly, I don't know. If he had asked me, I would have let him to sleep with him, but the intention was the danger of lying.

Thanks to him trying to burn me on social media and my friend exposing the chats, everyone knew he was trying to cheat on me, and he looked bad in front of everyone, including his family. I gave him the chance to talk more than once, but he didn't. Afterward, he called me a thousand times to apologize and say he missed me in his life. I blocked him and moved into the new house alone. I had a good job, so I could do it on my own, even though he broke my heart.

Maybe I overreacted and should have confronted him with just the screenshots where he lied about our relationship, but I was so furious that I wanted to humiliate him. So, AITA?",0,1756017624.0,AITAH,5,0.4,False

1myo6qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bankingexam/comments/1myo6qh/rc_from_23rd_aug_shift_2/,RC from 23rd Aug Shift 2,"To help its economy **weather** the trade war, China wants its consumers to splash out. The government has plans to subsidise consumer loans, and banks have been permitted to raise borrowing limits for creditworthy customers. But the question of who lends to whom on China’s high street is not straightforward. In the West, retailers extend credit to their customers. In China it is often the other way round.

It works like this. When you get a haircut or eat at a restaurant, the seller encourages you to pay in advance for multiple transactions. You might pay upfront for ten haircuts, or put 1,000 yuan ($140) on a pre-paid card, and the business will, in return, give you extra credit to spend. Western credit culture encourages consumers to “buy now, pay later”. In China, it is “pay now, buy later”.

Such schemes are not unique to China, but they are unusually common. A report last year calculated that over 1.5bn pre-paid cards were issued in 2023, worth almost 740bn yuan. The **firms** lock in future sales and obtain money up front for their business (for a typical issuer, the cards account for over 10% of their revenue). In a reversal of normal vendor financing, the customer is, in effect, lending to the enterprise.

The bonus the firm adds to the customer’s deposit rises with the size of the initial outlay, and can be large. Customers putting down 10,000 yuan can receive an extra 2,000 yuan to spend in the store. If they use the money within a year, that **a̲m̲o̲u̲n̲t̲*****s*** to an annual “interest” rate of 20%, paid in kind.

Loyalty schemes are popular in most countries. Customers might get their tenth coffee or loaf of bread free after paying as they go for the first nine. The pre-payment model is familiar to patrons of gyms and yoga studios. But those payments are usually for a fixed schedule of sessions, not a fixed number of them. China’s pre-paid cards are similar to gift cards. But such cards often go unredeemed. In China, most pre-paid cards do not expire.

The risk is that the business itself might expire, and you lose any unspent portion of your stake. That now seems to be happening a lot. A survey in 2021 by *China Youth Daily*, a newspaper, found that over 80% of respondents had bought into pre-paid schemes, and over 45% of them had been burned when merchants folded. Many bankruptcies are genuine, but now some scammers are setting up pre-paid schemes, too.",4,1756016580.0,bankingexam,2,1.0,False
1myo66h,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1myo66h/how_do_you_navigate_always_looking_for_a_dopamine/,How do you navigate always looking for a dopamine high?,"Only just realized I do this, but it's so true. My day could be going great, there could be something I'm enjoying doing, like grabbing myself a fancy coffee. Perhaps I got a nice compliment from someone, or I was validated at work or had a funny conversation on text with friends. I'm in a good mood. And then all of a sudden my great day starts to feel neutral and mundane, and I start to think of what I can do to make it feeling good again.

I'm logical and I'm aware happiness isn't a continual presence. I also know that a great part of life is mundane, and that's just for everybody. I guess I just want to make peace with it and be okay with that and not have to feel like I need to look for the next dopamine rush.

What do you do to help you with this? Do you have a way to help regulate yourself? Is there a thought process that works for you?",6,1756016521.0,adhdwomen,3,0.88,False

He’s very silly. But he’s also a biter, as long as you’re not too close, he’s quite friendly. All his teeth are sharp, every single one of them. His eyes are dark coffee brown but since he’s always in the dark, it’s hard to tell. He can transform into a bat but he usually only does if he’s getting away from someone or if he’s sleeping.

If you have any questions, please don’t be scared to ask me! Also, the poses aren’t required! They’re just there if anyone needs them, you can make your own poses or find different poses to use. I don’t mind at all!",3,1756016501.0,DrawForMe,6,0.72,False
1myo5ly,https://i.redd.it/kdfh37aiuwkf1.jpeg,Product Effectivity or Chismis?,"I’ve been using SF Trz since February this year (I can say I’m one of the oldies/OGs), May blue app pa noon, less than 50 pa lang kami. at first I was hesitant, kasi nga I tried everything to loose some of my 84kg weight. But I’m like why not? If I was willing to spend thousands sa mga teas, pills, capsules, coffee, juice, pati dahon na ginawang powder, I’m thinking why don’t I give it my one last hope to SF—self inject trz? 

And voila! 1 month after I am less bloated, shed off those water weight and from XXL I trimmed down to XL(not much but it’s a start) so I gave it another vial. And then my next month I was LARGE!!! Imagine Large! Without exercise or those caldef diets or even walking Kahit brisk walk waley. 

Fast forward to today, from 84kgs, now down to 52kgs. My goal weight is 50kgs since I am 5’4. 

With all these hatred on socials and here on Reddit about SF, u gotta ask urself, r u looking for an effective way to loose the weight and re gain ur confidence or ang bet mo ay tropahan na group chat na iba iba ang personality ng mga tao : Merong non chalant lang na mega popcorn sa chismis, Merong mga pabibo na Kahit 1 month pa lang eh ang daming hanash na kesyo onti ang naloose etc, Merong mga mamaru na isang vial isang turok lang agad kahit pa binigyan mo ng Napakalaking (size 25 yong font) na instructions, Merong sumali at ginawang lead generator ang gc at gusto nang agaw ng users at sipatin ang mga OGs offering higher commission, Meron ding kunwari user Pero TMZ or Paparazzi pala ang datingan na nagaabang lang sa gc ng latest scoop na maipopost sa Reddit or tiktok, Meron namang Lola basyang ang peg na Kahit d alam ang buong kwento Pero makakwento eh Akala mo tlga andon sya, Pero ang account nya kakaaadd lsng couple of weeks back.. 

Or pwede ka namang wag ng magjoin ng group chats. Dumirekta ka sa owner, bumili ng product at magbalik alindog ka on ur own. 

So again I will ask you, what do u look for in a supplier? Yong legitimate ang offer, low price and super effective? Or ang hanap mo eh latest chismis lang? 

 Now that I am near my goal weight I’m now road to Barbie na. Road to Victoria’s Secret  model na, glowtaaa, serums, collagen at skin care na. Kasi nga without further explanation, SF TRZ MAKES IT WORTH MY EVERY PENNY. 

So for every girl out there who started like me, I am rooting for you! If you have questions(would like to know the products I tried, how I did it with SF TRZ, what’s my regimen, etc, don’t be hesitant to ask  me. ❤️",3,1756016463.0,SlimfuelPH,0,0.72,False

That money was my light and it's not like I have a lot of money or ever have and I'd love more money to spend on myself I think that would be heaven but no I had to go and fuck it all up. I have a loving family but it's not enough I just sit here in my apartment on YouTube and I don't know what else to do and there's nothing interesting for me to head towards. I have a thyroid problem and I'm just a loser. If anyone wants to message me feel free it would be nice to chat I'm 28f I feel like just a girl I wish I was the light. But I'm just making this post and then I don't know what to do I guess I'll get another coffee but they're so bad for you they have canola oil in the milk I just get almond milk but it has canola oil in it. Fuck. What do I even do to feel good I'm like having a meltdown when will it be Heaven. Someone pls message me it would be nice to talk to someone nice about things. I felt like it was going to be heaven in 2030 or some year hopefully soon so life will change and begin to flow again. I used to enjoy life but now I just hate it far out.

1myo2qs,https://i.redd.it/abg8qv7ntwkf1.jpeg,This device has been a total game changer for me.,"First off, I really don’t like ereaders. No offense to anyone, but I have tried 5 or 6 different ones at this point and I never end up using them. I vastly prefer actual physical books, and I almost get depressed with ereaders. 

But with this Palma, I can stick it in my pocket and do “Micro-Reading” sessions when I’m waiting for a coffee or waiting in my doctors office. The books I have been reading are 1200+ pages and so bringing them with me is not an option unless I have a backpack. And my kindle/kobos were too big to stick in a pocket and I hate just having to carry it. 

I thought I would hate this Palma just as much as the others, but it’s been the opposite. I can add in 1-2 pages at a time and I have been able to basically cut my reading times for books in half. 

I HIGHLY recommend this device to people who prefer paper books, because this just genuinely fills a gap you probably don’t even realize you have. ",56,1756016177.0,Onyx_Boox,3,0.98,False

1myo1zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baptist/comments/1myo1zz/ever_feel_like_lifes_unfair_psalm_73_had_that/,Ever feel like life’s unfair? Psalm 73 had that thought before you did,"So here’s the deal: sometimes the best of us look around and think, “Why does everyone else seem to have it easier? They’re thriving, vibing, moving on with life, while we over here often have to fight anxiety with three cups of coffee and prayer.”

 “Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?”

It’s basically Jeremiah saying, “God, explain Yourself, this makes no sense.”

Or

""Why do You look with favor on those who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they?”

That’s the prophets calling it exactly like it feels: life isn’t fair.

Apparently, I’m not the first one to feel that. David (yes, slingshot David) literally wrote this in Psalm 73:

> “I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked… my feet almost slipped.”

Translation: “God, why are the jerks winning?”

But then he has this perspective shift. He says it didn’t make sense…

> “Until I entered the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end.”

Basically: “Oh right, this world isn’t the whole story.”

And he lands with maybe the rawest mic-drop line in the Bible:

> “Whom do I have in heaven but You? And with You, I desire nothing on earth.
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” (vv. 25–26)

The wicked may win for a moment. But in the long run, God is the only inheritance worth having.

Paul says in Philippians 3:14, ***‘I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.’***

 In other words: don’t tap out, don’t get distracted. Keep running. The prize is bigger than what you see today.",1,1756016107.0,Baptist,0,1.0,False
