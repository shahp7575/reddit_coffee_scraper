The biggest issue I see being a problem is that our breaker box is in the crawl space. The previous owner cut a hatch in the floor of the kitchen under the oven. It doesn't happen often but for example running coffee, microwave and the air fryer blows a circuit. Then I have to move the oven go down the hatch and flip it. It was dug out to where I can stand up in a roughly 6x6 room (sorta). It's a pain in the butt. My question is can I expect a renter to be able to do this or will I be getting a call every time this h happens? Can this type of issue be a requirement to diy for a tenant on a lease?

1j28n9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1j28n9x/people_genuinely_care_i_promise/,People genuinely care. I promise.,"I was asked to staff our visitor center on Saturday since there was a protest scheduled just down the road. The day was surprisingly calm - business as usual and not a single press inquiry. I left at the end of my shift and saw that there were still protesters hours after the scheduled time. 300 people were holding signs, waving at passing vehicles, and respectfully educating folks about threats to public lands and the federal workforce. The demonstrators saw my uniform and loudly cheered as I drove by. In the crowd, I saw the smiling face of one of my terminated employees. I drove around the block until the crowd dispersed since I couldn't associate with the demonstration, but I wanted to stop and see how she was holding up. 

Circling back after running a quick errand, I saw her at a little coffee spot across the street from the protest location. The demonstrators had completely cleared out. The outdoor seating was packed with the usual weekend crowd, but I felt comfortable being there for a few minutes in uniform. I went up to order a coffee and a stranger strolled over, eyeing me up and down. He asked if I worked for my agency, gesturing at my patch. I replied that I did, and in my practiced customer service voice, asked if there was anything I could help with. His response took me by surprise. He thanked me for my service and was adamant about paying for my coffee. I politely declined his offer, telling him several times that I couldn't accept it. He shoved his card to the cashier before I could dig mine out of my bag. I shook the kind stranger's hand, introducing myself and telling him how much the gesture meant to me right now.

My terminated employee walked up during the exchange, her smile soon twisting into teary anguish. Upon seeing her face, the pain of the past month gutted me on the spot. My emotions quickly matched hers as I scooped her into a hug. Through tears, I told her how incredibly sorry I am and how much I miss seeing her around the office. I asked if she would sit with me, just for a minute, and we scouted for a table. At this point, multiple other patrons approached us. I tried to wipe the tears from my cheeks and appear presentable, but struggled to regain composure. Many said they came for the protest, and they're so sorry for what I'm going through. Their demeanor made it clear how much they love our public lands and sympathize with federal employees. I thanked them, but managed to say nothing about the current situation while in uniform. I didn't need to speak for them to see the emotion on my face. I gave countless hugs and absorbed every supportive word. I'm still scared and angry, but most of all, I'm incredibly grateful. This experience was a welcome reminder of why I chose this career.


TLDR: A group of kind strangers sympathized with the current challenges faced by federal employees and provided unexpected comfort in an emotional moment. I am so moved by the genuine compassion from my community and was reminded of my calling to serve the public.",13,1740969926.0,fednews,0,1.0,False

I'm 28
I don't have any special skills
until I was 5 years old, I lived with my grandmother, I only saw my mother from the age of 6, she came and took me to live with her and my father, they were after drug rehabilitation.
There were a lot of quarrels and shouting between them and I often received physical abuse from my father because I didn't obey.

In turn, his father (my grandfather)
hanged himself because of alcoholism.
My father died when I was 14, my mother died when I was 22.
When I was 20, I got tuberculosis and couldn't continue my studies, because I noticed that I couldn't bring myself to do things I didn't like.
I saved up for a dorm room and lived there after my mom's death
I think it could be called depersonalization, because I didn't have the strength or desire to continue living and being alive at all, I just sat at my computer from morning to night, soon I realized that my life was collapsing and I started doing my own thing with a friend's suggestion mental health.
On New Year's 23, I woke up and realized I don't want to be afraid, I can achieve my goals on my own, I'm ready to live, I went to work in delivery, as a courier, they paid well and I enjoyed working.
I worked for my goal a lot
7/0 for 12-13 hours
I lived at work
I moved to another city
with friends, the same girl friend and my friend when I lived with them - they broke
up, we lived together and I realized at some point that I was falling in love with her
Somehow it turned out, it started, we started a relationship, everything was fine, and then in the middle of April I felt a click inside, I just wanted to cry and it was sad.
we were sitting in the bathroom, we had a romantic evening, but the only thing I felt was grief
Soon I began to lose focus, goals, motivation
With the advice of a girl, I went to the doctor and started taking antidepressants, but they did not help.

We broke up, and I went back to my town.
Because I wasn't working, I was cold and apathetic, I took out a loan, a lot of loans
She found out about it and tried to help me, but it was as if I had blacked out and was falling down without any desire for life.
it clicked again, I realized that it was impossible
to live like this, I began to work a lot
came back to her in the city and I showed that I had solved my problems and now I am a different person
She didn't believe me at first, but I was doing things that I hadn't done before, I was doing everything in time, and every life situation only aroused excitement in me.
we started dating, I moved in with her, announced my plans for the near future, that I was saving up for a motorcycle, and investing the money to have a passive income.

I worked like this for several months and it clicked again, I just woke up in the morning and felt inside not a craving, not how my body gets up and goes to work satisfied, I felt a copulation and rejection
I made coffee and spent an hour persuading to go to work, I went and every day I felt more and more this copulation, I know I need to save up for a motorcycle, but I can't get up, something isn't working, I can't see or feel my purpose, and I'm starting to fall again.
the girl said that something was changing, I was not as alive as before and cold, I got up and cried and went to work, I saved up the right amount, bought a motorcycle and drove it to the garage.
And I just lay down, I couldn't get up, I woke up from work and slept for 12-13 hours.
I started sitting at the computer again, the girl said that she knew everything would be the same as last time, that I was very cool at first, and then that it was becoming unbearable to live with me, I was just like a brat
We broke up again
She forced me to go to the doctor,im telling him my story and my feelings and  he diagnosed me with bipolar disorder 2 Like, and now I'm taking latuda
from the first reception, there were very strong side effects in the form of severe akathisia
the doctor advised me to take mendilex and he closed the side effects by 90%
Now I am trying to realize that my behavior is just a disorder
but I do not know what is a normal condition, who I am, what my values
are, and the intense pain of what I am I was so irresponsible about my mental health and that I destroyed my relationship with a beautiful girl twice
I still love her and am attached to her
But in this state I cannot be in a relationship
I am cold, apathetic and not alive

but I have a lot of work ahead of me, working with myself and a psychologist and finding what I really am without depression and mania.
I am not happy at all about the fact that I have fulfilled my childhood dream. 
I bought a 2005 kawasaki zx6r, but I'm ready to sell it right now.

It happened so quickly and incomprehensibly to me that I don't understand what happened.

I hope I can overcome this condition and continue working in order to heal and return to life with a good mood and a desire to live.",1,1740969731.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

Many coffee enthusiasts often wonder, ""Is espresso good for you?"" The answer lies in numerous health benefits associated with this beloved beverage. Espresso, a concentrated form of coffee made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans, is rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the body.

Moreover, espresso contributes to improved mental alertness. Caffeine, the primary active ingredient, can enhance focus, cognition, and even memory retention. Studies suggest that moderate consumption of caffeine, such as that found in espresso, may lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

In moderation, espresso can also boost metabolism. The caffeine content stimulates thermogenesis, which may aid in weight management by increasing calorie burn. Additionally, some research suggests that drinking espresso may lower the risk of certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

- **Heart Health:** Moderate coffee consumption, including espresso, is linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
- **Liver Protection:** Espresso may help support liver health, potentially protecting against conditions like fatty liver disease.
- **Physical Performance:** Caffeine is known to enhance athletic performance by increasing adrenaline levels and improving endurance.

However, it is essential to enjoy espresso in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake can lead to anxiety, sleep disturbances, and digestive issues. Generally, consuming one to two shots of espresso daily can be part of a healthy diet.

In summary, when consumed wisely, espresso can be a flavorful addition to a balanced lifestyle. Its potential health benefits, combined with its rich, robust flavor, make it a popular choice among coffee drinkers. So, the next time you ask yourself, ""Is espresso good for you?"" remember that, with moderation, it can certainly be a delightful and healthful drink.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Monsters and Memories has put out their latest newsletter and boy is it a doosey. Not only have they cut their yearly spend from the past year they have somehow made extreme progress.

Niche Worlds Cult has been filling positions left and right to stick to their potential EA Q1 Release. No word yet if EA will come with a price tag but the way things have been going they most likely will keep it free until they can prove to us as a community that their product is worth buying. Personally I think it is worth it now but they continue to hold their line. However a few of the dev team does stream and do allow subs/bits/donations/coffee tips/ and my favorite reach around.

The best news to take away from all this though is they have announced the first playtest of the year. April 11th-13th. We all have been eager for another big long test since the last one where they unleashed dragons and a few other big names mobs. one of which got trained and AOE‚Äôd a ton of people. We are still investigating who but have a pretty good lead.

As it stands from all the streams that Shawn aka alovongrobot the project is on track and moving ahead on schedule. You can watch all his VODs and others on their YT https://youtube.com/@monstersmemories .

If you aren‚Äôt following the project I highly recommend you do if you are looking for that classic MMO itch with a new generation feel.

I do circus as a hobby alongside my full-time job and go to the gym almost every day. I run my errands on my bike and even ride it to the office. My active lifestyle makes it hard to spend time with my family, but I always try my best to be there for them. I visit my mom regularly and help her with her dog (a 1-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog) by taking him to the park or for a run. I don‚Äôt mind doing this because it‚Äôs family ‚Äì we have to help each other in every way possible.

Unfortunately, I have a debilitating back injury ‚Äì a herniated disc ‚Äì that is so painful it can leave me almost immobile. I‚Äôve been struggling with this injury since my mid-twenties. Despite this, I try to make my life enjoyable by staying active through classes and outings. A few years ago, during an aerial rings class, I aggravated the injury. I had to lie on the floor, unable to move or get up. My instructor called an ambulance while I contacted my mom. I spent the night in the hospital and returned to my mom‚Äôs place the next morning. That evening, my cousin (36, female, but younger at the time) came to visit and was shocked to see my condition. She asked what happened, and I told her about the accident. She seemed worried and asked why I hadn‚Äôt called her for help or at least asked her to visit me in the hospital. I explained that I was in too much pain to even think about calling anyone. I had assumed her mother would have told her about my condition, but she told me that she had only heard I was injured, but she didn‚Äôt realize how severe it was. She thought I had just pulled a muscle. That annoyed me a little. Why would I spend the entire night in the hospital for a muscle strain? I decided not to let my irritation build up. She offered to help, but I was too exhausted to do anything more that day. Plus, my mom was taking care of me while I stayed at her place.

Two days later, I went home and worked from home. The pain was unbearable, and I had to take the rest of the week off. I could barely move and had to crawl around my house. Even going to the bathroom or taking a bath was an ordeal. My mom came by a few times to check on me, and my cousin‚Äôs mom also helped, but my cousin NEVER came to check on me ‚Äì not even once. It really infuriated me because I knew I would have done much more for her if the roles were reversed. I got so upset that one day, still stuck in bed, I called her and yelled at her. I asked why she hadn‚Äôt checked on me since we last spoke. She came up with excuses, saying she was busy, that her house was far away, and that she had a dog to take care of. I understand she didn‚Äôt have a car, but she used her bike to get to work, so how couldn‚Äôt she spare an hour to come help me? I scolded her, telling her that I would‚Äôve been there for her if she had been in my position. I expected so much more from her because I considered her like a sister. We were very close, always together. She even took circus classes with me once, even though she didn‚Äôt enjoy it, and came to the gym with me, even though it was farther from her home. Why is she so willing to be around me when I‚Äôm at my best, but not when I‚Äôm suffering?

After that call, she came to my place, brought me food, and cooked me dinner. Then she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your husband, you can‚Äôt expect me to do all this for you.‚Äù I was livid. How dare she? I yelled at her again, telling her I was crippled, and as a family, she should be there for me! She didn‚Äôt need to be my husband to care for me. She apologized and helped me after that. She came over almost daily, cleaned, and cooked dinner for me. Even on weekends, she would ask what I needed, and even if I told her I was okay, she would clean anyway. She continued helping me even after I started feeling better. I eventually had to stop her and tell her to calm down. I didn‚Äôt expect her to keep cleaning after me now that I was healthy. I was just upset because she lacked empathy during my recovery. We hugged, and everything seemed to be okay after that.

Then karma came knocking. A year or two after my injury, she broke her foot while jogging. She tore a ligament and broke two bones. I felt a bit of satisfaction, though I felt bad about it too. At the time, I was working out and had my phone on vibrate, so I missed her call. She contacted her brother, who took her home. Despite her protests, her mom insisted she didn‚Äôt need to go to the hospital and sent her home. I really think she should have gone, because when I visited her the next day, her foot was swollen to twice its size. Her mom took her to the hospital after she finished working from home, and she got an air cast. For the next three months, she worked from home and called me almost every day to complain about the pain and her inability to move around. I admit I felt a bit smug. After everything I went through, she thought complaining about foot pain was going to make her case. I told her to suck it up and crawl if she had to. I didn‚Äôt visit her often, though. I was still bitter about how she treated me during my recovery. I had to yell at her to get her to care. After a while, she mentioned I wasn‚Äôt visiting as much, and that her brother and even her best friend were more present than I was. She told me I wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù as I said I would be if the roles were reversed. I told her straight up, ‚ÄúI had to yell at you for you to care. Now you expect me to help you after everything you put me through?‚Äù She apologized and told me she still helped me after that, but it still didn‚Äôt change the fact that I had to yell at her to get any help from her.

Now, fast forward to the present. I injured myself again, I had to crawl around because of the flare-up. My cousin‚Äôs apartment had sewer flooding, and she couldn‚Äôt stay there due to the strong odour. She asked if she could come to stay with me, promising to keep me company and help me around the house. I told her she was welcome to come. She brought her dog, which was fine.

The next day, I made her coffee, and she went straight to work on her laptop. I took the day off to recover, but she still had to work, which I respected. She had to take her dog out in the morning and at lunch, which was normal. She noticed my car buried in snow after a snowstorm and asked if I wanted help digging it out. I said it would be great, and she said she‚Äôd do it after she finished working. At lunch, she mentioned ordering smoked meat and offered me some. I told her my brother was coming to bring me food, and she said okay. When the food arrived, I asked her to make peas to eat with the smoked meat, and she did ‚Äì but she didn‚Äôt offer me any. Fine. My brother arrived, and we ate the food he brought. He mentioned that the house smelled like garbage, and I explained that I couldn‚Äôt take out the trash because of my injury. He said he‚Äôd do it. I also told him I couldn‚Äôt dig out my car, and he offered to do that too. Meanwhile, my cousin sat there, eating her smoked meat and not lifting a finger. I was furious. She was in my house, aware of all the things that needed to be done, and not once did she offer help. She did offer to help with the car, but by the time she would‚Äôve done it, I could have gotten a ticket! I appreciated the offer, but there were so many other things that would‚Äôve helped me more.

After she finished working, she folded the sheets and packed up the air mattress, then called her dad to come pick her up. I was livid. She had promised to help, but she did nothing of value! Absolutely nothing.

After she left, I blocked her number and decided to cool down before confronting her. Her mom kept calling to check on me, and she mentioned that my cousin had been trying to reach me. I lied and told her I was fine and would contact her daughter soon. I didn‚Äôt want her to know I was angry with her selfish daughter.

Then on Saturday, my mom and aunt visited. My mom cleaned, and my aunt prepared dinner. There was a knock at the door. I went to open it, but my aunt quickly went ahead and opened it. My cousin walked in, smiling and shivering from the cold. She greeted me like nothing had happened and seemed surprised to see my mom and aunt there. I said nothing, just gave her a cold stare. While she was taking off her coat, she mentioned that she‚Äôd been trying to reach me all week to see if I needed anything. I ignored her and pretended to focus on the food simmering on the stove. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre being well taken care of,‚Äù she joked, laughing. That‚Äôs when I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore. I turned to her and yelled, ‚ÄúWhy are you laughing? Do you think my injury is a joke? I‚Äôm here, crippled and in pain, and you come over and don‚Äôt even offer to help with the house! You didn‚Äôt clean up after yourself, didn‚Äôt take out the trash, and didn‚Äôt even offer to help me with anything else!‚Äù I went on, though I don‚Äôt remember everything I said. I was furious. She just stared at me and started making excuses. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ask for anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúI offered you smoked meat, but you didn‚Äôt want any.‚Äù ‚ÄúI put away the mattress.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had to take care of my dog.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was so preoccupied with the flooding at my apartment‚Ä¶‚Äù I told her off, asking how she could be so oblivious. She‚Äôs an adult, doesn‚Äôt she have the mental capacity to figure out that the house needs cleaning by just looking at the mess? How does she think I feel, with all the clutter and the trash? I told her how entitled and selfish she was, especially after everything I had done for her.

She cried and said I was being unfair and that I should‚Äôve asked for help if I wanted anything done. She said she didn‚Äôt know how I was feeling because I had been so quiet. I was quiet because she should‚Äôve been able to see it herself. I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell her! She should have known better! I would‚Äôve done so much more for her. I was kind enough to let her stay over. Why couldn‚Äôt she show the same level of kindness to me?

I don‚Äôt feel bad. I was right to be angry at her. She‚Äôs being a terrible cousin, and I expected so much more from her. I‚Äôm writing this here because I started feeling a bit uncertain. I know I‚Äôm right, and my family agrees with me. But when I told my friends, they all said I was too harsh. They think I should‚Äôve asked for help instead of expecting her to know what to do. But I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask when she can clearly see everything that needs to be done! So‚Ä¶ was I the a\*hole?",2,1740968409.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,0.75,False

Here‚Äôs my 2 cents‚Ä¶,"This was my first trip to Cartagena and I relied  heavily on this sub. Huge help. For reference I was a solo traveler, 35, male. So in no particular order:

-Dont stay anywhere other than the walled city or the adjacent Getseman√≠. Like WOW. It felt like the entire city was congregated in those 2 places. In particular the heart of getsemani at the plaza (sorry I forget the exact name of the plaza), or in the walled city around the radius of the the clock tower. Just an amazing vibe. Kinda to that point‚Ä¶

-While it‚Äôs always better safe than sorry, dare I say the the safety concerns are overblown. For no other reason than it is wall to wall people and police. Dude no one is going to mess with you. Again I‚Äôm a guy, so maybe I‚Äôm biased but  before arriving i was genuinely anxious after reading this sub. That immediately left when I started walking around. Of course all the typical precautions were followed  (don‚Äôt be flashy, etc). But imo you will never NOT feel safe. Also full disclosure I‚Äôm black. Colombia is more black-centric/welcoming than a lot of places. Probably a full convo in itself

-Vendors- probably the worst vendor situation on the globe. No other way around it. On one of my 5 days I just stayed in partly bc I was tired and maybe a little bc I didnt feel like being  bothered. Yes, you will be bothered. It is a thing, and ‚Äòjust politely say no and they‚Äôll leave you alone‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really do it justice. It‚Äôs bad lol But a key point: at no point did I feel ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô. They are annoying, but harmless imo. Even when they ‚Äòfollow you‚Äô for a few steps trying to sell 

Random list of places:

-Movich hotel or Sofia hotel rooftops- to take a professional looking breathtaking pic w/ a view of the whole city w/ clock tower. Dress up, go during the week and/or early afternoon before the crowds, order a drink or soda, and have one of the very kind (and probably professionally trained at this point-wait staff take a pic for you. Amazing 

-La Muleta- Amazing food, huge portions. Seafood. *literally the only place I went to that was SOMEWHAT isolated (which is still less than a block away from a highly congested area. But it‚Äôs packed inside bc this place has a buzz

-Beiyu- a small breakfast/brunch spot. Mom n pop feel, in getsemani. Great for a digital nomad setup if you need to work. Everywhere in Colombia is cheap, but US $10 for an omelette, banana bread, toast, OJ, and coffee is a great way to start the day. 

-Epoc Cafe- a little more variety for brunch/breakfast. Kinda the same prices but a bit bigger and more  ‚Äòknown‚Äô so may end up being slightly more pricier (relative to Beiyu). Great aesthetic for pics/IG


Where I stayed: Casa Evelyn- in the heart of getsemani, but at the end of the street. It is NOT quiet bc they play drums nearby until 2am. But it is kinda sorta tucked away. And again this is relative, it‚Äôs less than a block from 2 lively streets, and a quick a 1 min walk to the lively plaza I mentioned earlier. If you google ‚ÄòI love getsemani‚Äô it‚Äôs right across from that very IG popular sign. They have  a HUGE surprisingly unused rooftop w/ seating, as well as a balcony w/ your room. (Wherever you stay, a balcony/rooftop is a must imo. So even when you‚Äôre in the room, you can look out and feel the city).

Hookers- not my thing but if it‚Äôs yours, don‚Äôt visit here‚Ä¶.MOVE here. I was tempted many a times ü§£ There really are no words. The best looking women you will ever see, in droves. Literally peering into your soul. I‚Äôve read that they cleaned things up recently but I guess that fell thru bc as of yesterday they are everywhere. Especially the clock tower after 8 ‚Ä¶.again I have no words  

I have already wrote entirely too much but I hope this will help. Cartagena is an amazing unique place ",10,1740967897.0,cartagena,11,1.0,False

Monsters and Memories has put out their latest newsletter and boy is it a doosey. Not only have they cut their yearly spend from the past year they have somehow made extreme progress. 

Niche Worlds Cult has been filling positions left and right to stick to their potential EA Q1 Release. No word yet if EA will come with a price tag but the way things have been going they most likely will keep it free until they can prove to us as a community that their product is worth buying. Personally I think it is worth it now but they continue to hold their line. However a few of the dev team does stream and do allow subs/bits/donations/coffee tips/ and my favorite reach around. 

The best news to take away from all this though is they have announced the first playtest of the year. April 11th-13th. We all have been eager for another big long test since the last one where they unleashed dragons and a few other big names mobs. one of which got trained and AOE‚Äôd a ton of people. We are still investigating who but have a pretty good lead. 

As it stands from all the streams that Shawn aka alovongrobot the project is on track and moving ahead on schedule. You can watch all his VODs and others on their  YT https://youtube.com/@monstersmemories . 

If you aren‚Äôt following the project I highly recommend you do if you are looking for that classic MMO itch with a new generation feel. 

If you want to know more or find out more the transparency from this team is comparable to homemade glass made from lightning on a beach!!!

1j27zax,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j27zax/tips_and_tricks_3_drink_spoilers/,Tips and Tricks :3 *DRINK SPOILERS*,"Hey there!  I wanted to create here a little cheat sheet for all of yall who might be having a few issues making some of the drinks!  First, I'll list the drink, and then say what I personally do.  Hopefully this will help some of yall out there who are having a bit of a doozy.  Granted at the moment, I do not have all the drinks unlocked yet, BUT If I remember too, I'll try to update this list as I unlock all the different drinks. 

How to froth Milk :  Take your pitcher and fill it with milk.  Grab it and bring it up to the froth thing.  I personally bring it up just enough until the top bar starts filling to the yellow, then I bring it up all the way, until the purple bar on the left fills up to the yellow again, and then bring back down.  Boom frothy milk.

Espresso :  Click clear glass.  Fill up your bean grinder to the white lines.   Press the giant button to start the pouring, you only have to press not hold.  Wait for orange line to hover over the green.  Once on green press the button once again to stop pouring!  There ya have it, your basic espresso!

Americano : Copy what you would with the original Espresso, but click on the white mug instead of the clear tiny glass.  Once your espresso is done, bring the cup over to your prep station.  Click on the Hot water, and fill it up to the brim.   Boom Americano.  

Iced Americano : Make an espresso using the small tiny clear glass.   Bring said espresso over to drink station.  Grabbing a tall clear glass, click the ice, and press said glass 2x.  If you have the lines upgrade (Which I highly recommend) you want to click on the cold water, and fill it to the second line from the top.  Take your espresso you made, and add it in.  Boom Iced Americano.

Latte : Copy what you would with the original Espresso, but instead of the clear glass, you instead click on the white mug.  After you fill up the mug, place it off to the side where you prep drinks.  Froth your milk. (Try to follow first how to froth milk explanation)   From there, pour your frothy warm milk into the mug that you have the espresso in, and draw whatever art you want.  Boom you have no successfully made a Latte!

Strawberry/Chocolate/Vanilla Latte :  Copy what you would with the original espresso, but instead of clear glass you instead use the white mug.  After mug is filled, place it off to the side.  Froth your milk from here.   Before adding your milk, you want to tap on the strawberry OR chocolate syrup depending on the order.   With the syrup selected, click on the mug with the espresso in it 4x.   From there you would want to add in your frothy milk, do your latte art, and Boom Strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla Latte is done!

Iced Latte : Start by making a basic espresso.   Once espresso is done, bring it over to your prep are.  Grab a tall clear glass.  Click the ice cube, and press your glass 2x.   This is where I HIGHLY recommend unlocking the lines guide upgrade as soon as you can.   From here, you are going to grab your milk, COLD, no frothing.  With the milk you are going to use those lines, and fill to the 2nd from the top.  Then take your espresso, and pour on top!  Boom Iced Late!  
  
Strawberry/Chocolate/Vanilla Iced Latte : Start by making your espresso!  Once espresso is done, bring it over to your prep area.  You are going to grab a clear glass from here.  You want to click the ice, and then click your clear glass 2x.  From there, grab whichever of the two syrups you need to use, and press that same clear glass 4x.   Grabbing some non frothy milk, you want to fill the milk up to the second from the last line on the glass.   Finally grab that espresso you made at the beginning, and fill it.  There you have it, an Iced Strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla latte.  

  
Pretty In Pink : Start by making an espresso in one of the tiny glasses.   Bring said espresso over to your prep station.  Grab a tall clear glass.  Click the strawberry syrup, and then the tall glass 4x.  Taking your milk next , no frothing, you are going to click the glass and fill it to the second from the top line.  Take the espresso you made and add it in.  This is then where you click on the whipped cream, adding it to your class, and then the fresh strawberries!

Strawberry Fresh : Ignore the coffee, and go straight to your prep area.  Grab a tall clear class.  Click on the ice, and press on said glass 2x. Next click on the strawberry puree, and click the glass 2x.  Next grab the strawberry syrup and click on said glass 4x.  Lastly, click on the Cold water, and fill the glass to the top!

But I don‚Äôt want it to be because of that, I want it to be because I‚Äôm excited to suffer a little to console our Lord.

I know I need breaks, especially as a SAHM, but wanting them makes me feel guilty, I can‚Äôt help it.  Instead of scrolling social media after the baby goes to bed (usually I say the rosary first) I‚Äôm going to start listening to an episode each of the Bible in a Year and the Catechism in a Year, and then prayer journaling.

I recently got a promotion and now take home around ¬£30k a YEAR after tax not exactly rolling in it, but comfortable. Most of my friends earn around ¬£24k a year after tax, so there's a bit of a gap, but nothing crazy.  

I don‚Äôt live a flashy lifestyle, no car, I rent, no kids, and I stick to living within my means. But lately, I‚Äôve noticed a shift. When we go out, friends aren‚Äôt even offering to pay for their own meals. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm outright offering to cover them, just the usual British politeness of saying, *‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll get this,‚Äù* expecting the usual *‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt be silly, let‚Äôs split it‚Äù* but instead, they just let me pay.  
It's not within the ¬£100's just literally ¬£25 extra or ¬£40 on top of my own bill. 


It‚Äôs happened with four different friends (who don‚Äôt even know each other), and on top of that, I‚Äôve had people asking to borrow ¬£10 here and there. I said yes twice, never got the money back, so now I just say no.  

I‚Äôm not stupid I know when people start taking advantage. But surely earning ¬£30k doesn‚Äôt suddenly make me rich?!

I was 30 back then when me and my husband was about 2 months separated and was renting a place of a friend with my minor daughter. My friends invited me to go crown casino for a night just to enjoy. There was 4 of us. 
I remember I didn‚Äôt have much sleep the night before like 2 hours sleep. We arrived around 4pm in our shared room. 5 pm we started drinking moscato I think I had 3 glasses. And then I received a call from overseas that my mentally ill/ Epileptic sister got pregnant so it means my budget for them will get bigger. I was shock but didn‚Äôt process the news emotionally as I want to have fun that night.
And then we went to the casino and they started buying drink. 
I never drink coffee my whole life and they ordered expresso martini. My 3 friends drinks coffee everyday and soon as they start drinking it they stopped as they say it was too strong. I ended up liking it so I drink it all. I guess around 3.5 expresso martini. 
It was around 11 when we all went to bed and I just felt like there was a needle in my chest and started panicking. I can‚Äôt breath. I drank all the water in the fridge and just started crying that I am going to die. All deep thoughts pouring that I am so sorry for my days that I have to leave her early. My friends were crying too because they dont know whats happening to me. I beg and beg for them to call 000 but they were so scared so I have to do it myself.
The operator rang the hotel and they sent the first aid people to calm me down. 
I didn‚Äôt budge at all. I asked my friends to drop me to the hospital and they did. The hospital  Epworth Hospital Emergency Department won‚Äôt let me be admitted because they say I was fine. Oxygen level, blood pressure, pulse are all fine. And to top it all once I got admitted I have to pay $1000 because it‚Äôs a private hospital. 
I didn‚Äôt budge again and they ended up admitting me. 
Doctor came and explained I had a panic attack and I have all these problems and my brain just can‚Äôt process them all. 
He gave me diazepam. 
Didn‚Äôt let me pay and gave me good breakfast. My friends then pick me up and we went home.
From that night I can‚Äôt sleep and thought and was losing my mind. Straight 6 months I thought they will get my daughter becoming I am incapable of taking care of her. 
I hate that night. Now I have a fear that it will happen again. I always want to have a diazepam in the wallet just in case it will happen again.

But my friends and friends have mentioned our drinks was spiked. 

Deep inside I believe my brain is just too weak for alchohols. I don‚Äôt know. I just hate that it happened to me and have this new fear since then. 

Thank you for your insights and have a safe travelling in life xxx

Originally from Germany.I met my husband while I was studying medicine in NL. At the time when we met I was getting over a rough break up, felt lonely and did the stupid thing of getting on a dating app to distract myself. 
I met him, casual dating. I honestly didn‚Äôt even want to see him again after our first date because he seemed very duchy. My friends convinced me to see him again.It was a cold  winter and we hung an out a bunch, he brought me soup when I was sick and was a nice distraction. Sex was phenomenal, kisses rather stiff but I figured I could see past that if everything else was good. I had a total crying meltdown several times where I left his place just because I was still grieving my ex. Told him we probably shouldn‚Äôt see each other anymore but he said jokingly he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave because he knew I would meet someone else and he wanted me. 
Long story short he proposed 2.5 year later,  I decided to try to continue my career  in the States and moved with him. 
He was very active, athletic and I adventurous when we met. We travelled a lot together, but after we moved to the states he separated from the military and worked off base job. Always stressed, depressed , worried about money etc. 
I was trying really hard to get certified, but had to start my whole life over. Get a drivers license, new phone number, was trying to find friends, culture shock‚Ä¶ 
A year later I got pregnant. I really had it set in my head that I wanted to have a baby when I was 30. Tried to be a super hero and do it all. Finish my board exams, be pregnant and a super house wife. Covid happened and kind of threw everything off. 
The summary of my medical career is that I have severe exam anxiety, got zero support from husband (he was pessimistic  and told me that I had 0 chance anyways) in making this work and I failed. Daughter was born and I ended up in bad post partum depression. No own family around(still in Germany), his parents not interested in helping. I was left for 12 hours or more a day with a colicy newborn. Husband would sleep in another room so that he could actually sleep and not hear the baby cry. I dared one time to ask him for help at 3am after not sleeping all night, again.  He ‚Äúhelped‚Äù for an hour or so and then gave babygirl back to me and told me to never wake him up again because he will be tired at work now. I should note that he is a dentist not a surgeon and I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. I think that time after my daughter was born  broke me and my relationship with him. I almost left him, we tried to make it work did couples therapy and he told me if I would leave him he would take my daughter away. 
Therapy helped somewhat and selfishly enough I wanted to have a sibling for my daughter. Got pregnant and had baby two without expecting any help. I tried to make it a better experience for myself. My son was an angel and we bonded so quickly. My husband fell into a deep depression. He wasn‚Äôt used to taking care of my daughter and had to help out more. 
Two years later:  My kids are total mama kids. They like dad about 20% of the time. He does some laundry and loves to clean the kitchen up. EVERYTHing else is on me and other moms will know what that means. Our relationship feels non existent. I feel like he is a roommate. I can count on two hands how many times we have had sex in the past 6 years (I never talk about this because it‚Äôs embarrassing) I have tried everything from my part to make it a more regular thing after talks he doesn‚Äôt want to have, but he is so awkward and even when I told him ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs have sex now‚Äù he either did not want to or it wasn‚Äôt pleasant. 
Our communication is awful. We usually talk about the day to day events and that‚Äôs it: my grandmother just died and he said ‚ÄúI am so sorry‚Äù in a text and gave me one hug when he got home. That was the talk about that. 
He has zero empathy and is giving me hard time about using two coffee mugs a day because the dishwasher is too full. It just seems rediculous. Any time I want to carve out some time for myself he gets resentful and basically tells me no. Today I wanted to go to the gym while he was home for 2-3 hours from his reserve drill (where he doesn‚Äôt do much) and he told me ‚Äúwell you cant leave long I could get a call any moment to come back in‚Äù (total BS it has never happened). 
I feel like in a mini prison. I have these kids that I love more than anything else but can never do anything fun without hearing all kinds of awful or sarcastic comments afterwards 
I am tired, depressed and wondering what I could have done differently. I know that I am not perfect, nobody is. I go through by down phases too but I would like to have someone near me who builds me up during those times. I feel like I have turned in to a terrible partner  because I am giving the same treatment back to him that I am receiving. It doesn‚Äôt seem healthy and I hate for my kids to see their parents relationship like this. I don‚Äôt know if I should leave. It‚Äôs scary. I have a job in research and only make $60.000/year. We have two dogs and a cat. It would break my heart to leave them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. It would be easier for me if he would cheat on me or be violent. It wouldn‚Äôt take me a second to leave him. It‚Äôs hard when it‚Äôs more of the emotional strain. 
Any advice ? Is this saveable or even worth trying. I don‚Äôt have any family support only see them once or twice a year. My mom is an alcoholic and a mess. ",2,1740967341.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

9 months ago I met Clara (not her name).  We were both at the end of divorcing abusive partners and leaving unhealthy marriages.  I have a rough background with alcoholism and have been clean for almost 10 years.  My drinking certainly helped ruin my marriage and I've since gotten help and kept a tight grip on my life by staying sober and working on myself. She has Borderline Personality disorder and as she was working through her issues with a therapist,  when her husband told her that he wasn't attracted any longer and dumped her.
 
We met as we were both separated and found we were good friends. In time, I felt like I found someone truly special. She didn't judge me for my past and we have a really good experience being sweet to each other and learning our rhythms.

For the first 3 months we would talk a lot and get coffee, and generally didn't want to ruin being friends with a ONS. After those 3 months she told me she was in love with me. For the first time in my life, I was really head over heels about someone.  Her quirks and personality made her so radiant to me, and the way we supported each other and laughed together made my heart feel so full.  Recently, I had her keys and would walk her dogs, cook for her when she was sick or tired, and we started thinking of a future for us.

This week, she made my heart jump when she told me she was thinking about getting a place together when our leases were up after this summer.  We'd have been together for almost a year when making that choice, and it felt right.

Here are some relevant details before the events of the other night:
-One of the only times I saw her Borderline issues arise was early on when I changed a song on Spotify using her phone.  She was LIVID that I touched her locked phone to change a song that was accidentally stuck on repeat. She mentioned it a few times for two weeks after it happened.

-I had an awkward rebound post-divorce that ended horribly and with me being ghosted for not being available enough.  This person would turn out to be a friend of my recent ex and it was something we talked through pretty easily.

-Her job is one where it would end her career if anything inappropriate of her were ever leaked.

-I was told to not save temporary pictures she had sent, and I never did.  I respected that boundary.

-As a ""joke"" she screenshotted one of my temporary pictures to her phone and joked about showing her friend.  I wasn't happy about it but let it go.

-If I ever asked to look through her phone, she'd laugh at me.

-I got a new phone last week and am currently moving notes/reminders/work info between the two and haven't had time to finish moving everything over and have kept the old phone around as a backup this week.

Last night we spent the evening together, I read to her and was telling her how beautiful I found her. I mentioned that I made use of replaying her temporary picture the earlier night and she took that to mean that I screenshotted one of her pictures.  She asked for my new phone, promptly opened my media, private folder, and trash.  She found NO pictures of her. I didn't like that she was looking through my files like I would betray her trust.

She then demanded to see my old phone.  The old phone had pictures of my old life, and I hadn't even been ready to open my old private folder and see or delete pictures of my ex-wife, or a couple of pictures sent to me from the unfortunate re-bound who was her friend.  I didn't want her to see that, or any of the porn I had saved while before and during my divorce.

I asked her if she'd do the same for me and she admitted she wouldn't, and that it was a double standard.  I was too ashamed that she'd see old pictures, or pics/videos I took for her but wasn't confident enough to send.

We made dinner, I helped her clean her home, I took her to the store and picked up her dogs, and then she flipped a switch and decided I had copied her pictures.  I didn't want her to see my old private folder, but kind of wish I did.  I miss her so much but felt so shocked that she responded  by throwing me out of her home.  She gave me back most of the little things I had left there and threw me out.  She called me an hour after and talked for a minute before deciding she shouldn't have called and blocked my number, and socials.

I'm devastated and not sure if I should have just let her steamroll me, or if she'll ever want to see me again.  I just hate this is how this ends.  This is how we end after falling in love and getting along in such a deep way.  Is that what we owe those we love?  

Letting them get away with behavior they would never condone? Is it really my fault the relationship is over?  I appreciate all input.

Edit 1 -> She's been in treatment for 2 years and generally does very well most days.  This is the worst flip out I have had with her. She does not currently meet a BPD diagnosis. But she did before therapy/ meds.",1,1740967246.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

That being said I won't do anything with blood death or rape. What I do enjoy is sweaty sticky sloppy sex. If we arn't out of breath and I'm not covered in something did we even have sex? I do love giving sloppy head cum where ever you like. Tie me up and give me a good spank. I recently been playing around with wax play on my own. And anal is an option.

1. Gas Prices Are Going Up‚ÄîAnd It‚Äôs Not Just ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs Fault‚Äù Anymore

If you thought $4 gas was bad, buckle up. Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian oil (yeah, the stuff that actually keeps gas prices in check), which means you‚Äôre already paying 9‚Äì15 cents more per gallon‚Äîand some experts predict that could jump by 25‚Äì40 cents. That means filling up your car is gonna cost you an extra $500‚Äì$800 a year.

And let‚Äôs be real: This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúenergy independence.‚Äù Canada is our biggest oil supplier, and cutting them off just makes things worse for us.

2. Your Water Is Looking More Like a Science Experiment

Trump‚Äôs rolling back Clean Water Act protections, meaning factories and oil companies can dump more toxins into rivers and lakes. If you live near industrial sites, good luck‚Äîbecause filtering that out of your tap water isn‚Äôt cheap. Lead, mercury, and arsenic? Not exactly what you want in your morning coffee.

3. More Pollution, More Asthma, More Doctor Bills

Rolling back air pollution regulations means more smog, more lung disease, and‚Äîoh yeah‚Äîhigher healthcare costs. The American Lung Association is already warning that these rollbacks could lead to thousands more premature deaths per year.

So if you like paying more for inhalers, hospital visits, and insurance premiums, congrats! But for the rest of us? Not great. Plus, cutting healthcare funding means fewer people will be able to afford treatment when pollution makes them sick, leading to even worse health outcomes.

4. Food Prices? Also Getting Screwed

With climate protections being gutted, we‚Äôre looking at more droughts, more crop failures, and higher grocery prices. Oh, and those pesticide bans getting lifted? Enjoy extra chemicals on your produce.

So What‚Äôs the Endgame Here?

It‚Äôs simple: Trump‚Äôs policies aren‚Äôt helping working Americans. They‚Äôre helping oil execs and corporations make more money‚Äîwhile we deal with the fallout.

You don‚Äôt have to be a tree-hugger to care about not paying $6 for gas, not drinking toxic water, and not dying from pollution-related illness. This affects everyone, regardless of party.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: Cutting healthcare funding means we‚Äôre all left footing the bill for preventable illnesses. This is about more than politics‚Äîthis is about survival.

Just took a power nap and now sipping the hot coffee, having a little break before I get to work.

I thought, why not write a quick review meanwhile, of these edgy little black beans which I acquired recently.

I already have the Airpods Pro 2 for outside use and the Senny MTW4 for indoor listening along with some cans. I was needing a multipoint solution to pair with my phone and Windows laptop while working. Can't use the Airpods for that and the Senny is a bit bulky. So when I saw these pups at my carrier's store at a discount, I thought I could give them a go. This Pro line is supposed to be known for its mic quality anyway.

They come in a rather large and stylish box, from which another stylish box slides off (the upper one in the picture) and begets the actual content.

https://preview.redd.it/t9s43i4qedme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d58beaf6597258657faa4b6360922cca9a7bcdc

The box is kinda plasticky with a very thin soft layer, but it feels like it'll quickly accumulate finger oil.

https://preview.redd.it/gauqs7mufdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a5b9203cabdfcee70b196ec8f3ec4e8dbc7e055

They also include foam heads along with silicone heads, which is a nice touch.

https://preview.redd.it/ffjkbhizfdme1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aeb12b5a0dc7133246d224d1e5163bfcc3f512c6

The box is a little chubby compared to the Airpods. I don't know why they had to stick that info label right at the face of the box, but it is what it is. Designwise there's the infamous gold trim (also on the headphones themselves) which I don't like. It also looks like they went with minimal branding, imitating Apple, but the overall look of the box is very Alibaba.

https://preview.redd.it/29k88wb2gdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4f2e75ba8420f1977cb46f050ff8e75c0577e20

The rather large Huawei branding at the back does look out of place too.

https://preview.redd.it/6uqr8jeigdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca6fc169c5d1f63311bb98cdd023e6a7161de07a

Here's another angle with the Senny added.

https://preview.redd.it/1kmmxwglgdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31c0c3052b2b5a59d4335e3f90dab9457d155e8c

The box has a speaker now, going the Apple way, and you can use Huawei's (AI Life) app to ping the box.

One nice thing is a nitpick which seemingly gets ignored by so many makers:

https://preview.redd.it/23pmuivsndme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=918ef14c80f8430405ecb7ff3ba28536c20098f8

They sit correctly oriented in the box, with the stems outwards and ports inwards. I mean you take out the bud and directly put it into your ear. No twisting and twirling.

The buds are styled in their own angular, unique way. Not much of a minimal branding here.

https://preview.redd.it/zcwo1shtgdme1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=47dae481c4586703dbc25f365c6c4e202b17cc54

Shapewise they're bulbous, meatier than the Airpods Pro 2. When you put them on they completely fill and sit inside the concha. Makes for a comfortable fit and they don't penetrate into the earhole much.

https://preview.redd.it/sy7xwoo0hdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e1afb01d39138ad722dd54f1e93ae5656297e4e

https://preview.redd.it/r9enrt88hdme1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac41ec11f8291b8bedeb6fc338867adcca8bb72f

So coming to the actual use,

**Fit** is quite nice, I'd say it reminds me of my Jabra 85T's which also filled my ears' concha area and didn't cause any pressure in the earholes. I immediately swapped the silicone tips with the foam tips (which aren't that spongy by the way, they're a bit harder) which helped with the fit further. I used the M tips and they securely sit on my ears, and they don't seem prone to falling of when I speak or chew. **9/10**

But the angular design is kind of an eyesore, they stick out and they don't look nice. I wouldn't go around with them in my ears. It helps that I only got them to use during work. **6/10**

There is **no vacuum effect** when you put them on, thankfully. But there is modest occlusion when you turn on NC. The real downer is the transparency mode which seems to be 1.5 generations behind the best. I mean it's good, the world around you sounds somewhat transparent with some occlusion, as long as you don't speak, you can forget that you have the buds on. But as soon as you start speaking, occlusion shoots up heavily. One upside is there's no hiss in transparency. **8/10**

**Noise cancelling** is not up to par with the latest, it feels like one generation behind. I don't use NC that much so not a downer for me. **7.5/10**

They have **pinch and slide controls** just like the Airpods, but the execution feels a bit janky. You need to pinch the pinchy area harder than on the Airpods and the angular stem cuts into your fingers; not a good feeling. The headphones are a bit slow to react to pinches. They also react with a slow and drawn-out female voice prompt when you change a setting (i.e. '*Awaaaareneees*'), which is reminiscent of very cheap bluetooth earbuds. Quick and sleek sound cues would feel a lot more premium if we nitpicked here. Apart from this, when you try to adjust a bud's fit it's somehow likely that you trigger a pinch or slide control, or maybe I don't have the muscle memory for these buds yet. **8/10**

**Connectivity** is strong, no breakoffs. Although I didn't try them in busy areas. When you take the buds out of the case and they connect, they play a little sound cue, but no indication whatsoever when they connect to a second device. Neither when you change the second device (to another previously paired device) by pulling the connection. They're quick to connect to devices once you open the box lid, but they don't always automatically connect to the second device that they're multipointed to; weird and unreliable. **7.5/10**

**Multipoint** works nicely. The buds don't act as a media controller. Meaning, if you need to switch devices, you first need to pause the media on your first device, then start playing the media on your second device. Switches are rapid, no waiting inbetween. And of course, whatever you're doing, if your phone gets a call the buds immediately switch to your phone. To me one of the nicer executions of multipoint. Maybe add some audio cues when you switch devices? **9/10**

**Mic quality** is kind of a disappointment. I don't know if I got a potato unit but all the sound-recording I've done on the iPhone sounds blocky, low definition, like they've been made with a very cheap product. With frequent sound breaks too; it's like there's something clogging the mics. To make matters worse, the buds fail to input any meaningful sound to my laptop (which is incidentally a Huawei itself) when used as a sound input device. In that case I get almost no sound but that glitchy, retro-modem-connection feedback sounds. Something is very wrong here. Might ask for a replacement. But I remember previous Buds Pro series being marketed with high mic-performance claims and turning out to be heavy underperformers. Maybe we suffer the same fate here. **2/10**

**Sound quality** is so Airpods. It's very clear that they went for the Airpods sound tuning and to a large degree they succeeded. Airy sound, nice separation, deep and defined bass down to very low volume levels. If you did a blind test you could easily be fooled to thinking that you're listening to Airpods Pro 2. This is with their ""Default"" sound profile on the Huawei app. You can get granular frequency control in the app. **9/10**

So to wrap up, the TL:DR is Huwei got the sound quality about right, but underperforms at just about anything else. It is a sorry sight given this is the 4th iteration of the product. It seems like this is Huawei's way of saying ""look we make our own bluetooth headphones too, and they're not half bad!"".

Where I live they sell about 25% cheaper than the Airpods Pro 2 and 20% cheaper than the MTW4. I don't think they deserve that price. I got them about 50% cheaper than the APP2 and I don't even think they deserve that price either. Overall a reluctant **7/10**.

1j27f2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateTechnology/comments/1j27f2v/what_ive_learned_after_years_of_doing_online/,What I‚Äôve learned after years of doing online marketing for Realtors,"Hey everyone, I recently joined Reddit and figured I would start providing value to the communities I care about from the start.

I‚Äôve been in the Real Estate Online Marketing space for a couple of years now. And have successfully built a marketing agency that helps Real Estate Agents and Team Owners secure leads, nurture these leads and ultimately close more deals.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for my clients. (Mind you I‚Äôm located in what most consider to be the most competitive market for Realtors)

1. Google Ads PPC (pay per lead): yes, these work. The reason why they work is because you are able to target specific things people are searching for. It‚Äôs not like Meta Ads where you target a topic or interest. Here you target the exact search. So if you want show up for ‚Äúcoastal homes in X‚Äù you can do that.

Cost: you can see some results with as little as $500/ month on ad spent

PROS: 
- hyper specific targeting.
- meet your leads where they are at, instead of shooting darts in the dark with meta ads
- access unique leads 

CONS:
- will produce a ton of ‚Äúduds‚Äù (leads with fake info, just browsing or will never reply to you) this comes with the territory
- can get pricey if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing
- complex to set up, you need a pro to do it right

2. Google LSA (local service ad): these are awesome. Instead of paying per click you pay per lead. 

PROS:
- higher quality lead
- lower sales cycle

CONS:
- requires Google My Business Verification which for some is tough to get
- can be pricey depending on where you are at

Cost: commonly between $20-$60 per lead

3. Follow Up: ‚ÄúMoney is in the Follow Up‚Äù building a system for messaging leads with quality messages for a long time will make you money. Straight up. BUT PLEASE do not use templated drip campaigns that are sterile. It‚Äôs a slap to the face for your lead. You‚Äôre trying to help them figure out what could be their biggest life decision. A simple ‚Äújust checking in, are you ready to buy/sell?‚Äù Won‚Äôt cut it.

Do use technology to make your life easier. I suggest either having a CRM to track everything for you or investing in software that does it for you.

PROS:

- as close as you can get to guaranteed income
- referral opportunities

CONS

- it‚Äôs a ton of work
- misleading solutions: most auto follow up/ nurturing systems hurt you more than benefit you as they use stale, generic messaging that annoy leads

4. Reputation Management + Google My Business: Create a system to request reviews and get as many as you need in your area to surpass your biggest competitor. 
Reply to every review as fast as you can and update your profile frequently with new photos. You can use listing photos or better yet ‚Äújust sold‚Äù photos.

PROS: 

- it‚Äôs FREE
- biggest ROI out of any other activity by FAR
- secure steady stream of high quality leads

CONS

- slow to get traction as getting reviews takes time
- constant upkeep

5. BONUS: (not online) OPEN HOUSES

I work with the biggest names in California. They all say ‚Äúif I was a new agent starting out I would hold every Open House I could get my hands on and the follow up with all leads constantly with care‚Äù

That‚Äôs it!

Now here‚Äôs a quick list of things that don‚Äôt work as well:

1. SEO. Top 15 searches are dominated by Zillow, Redfin, etc. Trying to 1 up them is too costly. Spend your marketing dollars elsewhere.

2. ‚ÄúWhat to do in XYZ Town this weekend‚Äù these don‚Äôt work anymore. Back in boomer days it did but now everyone is offering their Chat GPT calendar of events and it‚Äôs become too saturated.

3. First homebuyers downloadable guide. Don‚Äôt be lazy, offer an actual sit down consult with potential homebuyers. Get them a coffee while you‚Äôre at it, they‚Äôll love you.

That‚Äôs all I can think of right now. 

Let‚Äôs open the discussion, do you have any questions about any of these? Have you used them in the past and if so did they work? Need help understanding any of these?

Let me know in the comments, this is my first post of many. I‚Äôm always looking at giving back to the community!

1j27ew9,https://www.reddit.com/r/drawthingsapp/comments/1j27ew9/what_is_version_history_and_what_are_these_icons/,"What is ""Version History"" and what are these icons? And feature request: delete with keyboard.","I've been using Draw Things for a while and never touched these buttons under ""Version History,"" until now. Might ""Version History"" be a mislabelling? Because under that is the gallery; all images generated in that ""project."" They might not be ""versions,"" they can be totally different prompts with different models. The only concept of ""version"" I see here is that it shows as separate images the progress of inpainting, with each different strokes creating a new entry (a new image in the list). So if your inpainting takes 20 strokes you'll have 20 more images in the list.

At first, I though the timer with counter-clock-wise arrow was an ""undo"". But it's just a tab. An undo however would be great to undo brush strokes in inpainting (and that button inside the inpainting part of the screen). Not sure what the other icons are. The line connector (no idea what that would represent) hides some images, and the coffee cup seems to hide empty images. 

I love the software, it's fantastic for Mac, but wish it followed standard UI conventions. In this case, maybe tooltips on mouse-over for screen elements that aren't labelled (no text) and aren't intuitive. 

A recommendation related to the gallery below this, is to be able to delete images using the delete key on our keyboard, like in every software, and to be able to multi-select from this list. Having to alternate-click to show a delete option is lengthy. We can multiple-select from the edits list (accessible by clicking the 4-square icon), but the delete keys here also don't work, you must alternate-click to show options. And you can't see the images larger.

1j27e8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1j27e8x/34_m4f_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,34 [M4F] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",2,1740966009.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1j27b8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeWeekly/comments/1j27b8p/the_vampire_cult_murders/,The Vampire Cult Murders,"*A group of teenagers followed a young man dressed in black as he wove his way through the trees on a path all of them knew by heart. Eventually, they made it to a dilapidated building in the middle of the woods, covered in graffiti, with broken-out windows. This was their lair, where the teens could drink one another‚Äôs blood in the firelight, all under the boy's watchful gaze. His name was Roderick ‚ÄúRod‚Äù Ferrell. They were his Vampire Clan. He called himself Vesago, a 500-year-old vampire. After tonight, he would be a killer.*



Rod Ferrell‚Äôs cult of blood drinkers included Howard Anderson, Dana Cooper, Charity Keesee, and Heather Wendorf. The group was known in Murray, Kentucky, as troublemakers and outsiders, misfits. The five members found acceptance in Rod‚Äôs vampire fantasy and embraced the culture. Heather would later recount that while she didn‚Äôt think any of them took the vampirism seriously, it was:



¬†*Something to have, something special in your life you felt secret about.*¬†



While all of them adored Ferrell, Heather stole his heart. She told him about how her home life was ‚Äúhell‚Äù and how she felt trapped by her parents. Some reports state she told him her father hurt her, and that stirred something in Ferrell‚Äîsomething with roots deep in his past and his own abuse.

His mother, Sondra Gibson, brought him into the world when she was sixteen. She‚Äôd only been married to his father for three weeks before they split, and she moved back in with her parents. An emotionally damaged teenager, now suddenly a mother, doesn‚Äôt always make the best decisions, but she doted on her son. The only man in her life.

It was Sondra who first exposed Rod to her fascination with vampires. They would watch Dracula movies together, and she later got him involved with *Vampire: The Masquerade*, which would become a big part of his delusions. (*Vampire: The Masquerade* is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Dungeons and Dragons.)¬†¬†

Some believe that her love went beyond what a mother should have for her child. Rod stated that as he grew older, he developed a complex relationship with his mother, a love-hate dynamic. Some reports state he confided that his grandfather molested him, and many suspect the abuse wasn‚Äôt just by the old man. They cite letters written by Sondra, 34 at the time, to a 14-year-old boy.



*I longed to be near you, for your embrace . . . to become a vampire, a part of the family, immortal and truly yours forever. I only hope that one day you will once again return to Murray. You will then come for me and cross me over. And I will be your bride for eternity and you my sire.*



Rod would travel with the rest of his gang from Kentucky to Eustis, Florida, on November 25th, 1996, to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù Heather from her parents. That rescue ended with both her father, Richard Wendorf, and her mother, Ruth, dead. Ferrell and Anderson beat them to death with a crowbar and danced over their bodies. Rod beat in Richard‚Äôs skull over a dozen times while he slept on the couch. He then bludgeoned Ruth when she entered the living room from the kitchen.

According to Ferrell, he didn‚Äôt truly know what made him kill Richard, but he had no intention of killing Ruth until she surprised him and tossed scalding coffee on him. Howard Anderson tells a different story. He tried to calm the frenzied Ferrell before the bloodshed started. No matter which is true, that night ended with the two boys fleeing the house, covered in blood, in the Wendorf‚Äôs car.

They picked up the girls, including Heather, and drove to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. They were halfway there before Jennifer Wendorf, Heather‚Äôs sister, came home to find the bodies. The investigators were faced with one the most brutal home invasions Florida had ever seen.

Heather had run away before the attack to meet up with Ferrell and the others, only to find out that the car they had planned to use had broken down. So when the cult came up with the idea to steal her parent‚Äôs car, Heather struck up a deal with Rod. She would go back and unlock the home so he could steal the keys, but only if he would ‚Äúcross her over‚Äù. An act that involved her drinking his blood. They sealed the blood pact in a graveyard. When police came and arrested them in Baton Rouge, after Charity Keesee had called her mother for money and gave away their location, Heather claimed she had no idea her parents were dead.

After the teens were arrested on November 28th, the case became a sideshow attraction. Rod Ferrell would tell the press it was a rival vampire gang that had framed them for the killings. A video would be found of Rod weeping and laughing after the murders while in Louisiana. Police would release they found a letter from Heather Wendorf that she had left for her parents on the night she ran away that read ‚ÄúI love you both so much‚Äù. The case became so highly publicized that jury selection was an issue.

Bonds began to break as the noose grew tighter around all their necks. Keesee told police that she had been horrified when Rod arrived in the stolen car, covered in blood. Anderson, his partner in the murders, confided to his mother and a cellmate that he had tried to stop Rod, who had just ‚Äúgone crazy.‚Äù Even Heather, Ferrell‚Äôs Juliet, bowed off the stage.

She proclaimed her innocence and ignorance of the murders immediately. In letters to her sister, she placed full blame on Rod. A grand jury found Heather blameless in her parent‚Äôs slaying, and she even gave a deposition to the trial team.

How did Rod plan to defend himself now that his vampire cult members had turned against him? When the police ruled out his story of another rival vampire gang doing a frame job, he told his attorneys that he suffered from blackout spells. He would lose awareness for hours and couldn‚Äôt remember anything that happened during that time. His mother came forward to cast doubt on Heather‚Äôs innocence, stating that Heather had been talking about wanting her parents dead for a long time.

His defense attorneys did their best to put forth what defense they could. They claimed Ferrell had been high on drugs and booze the night of the killings. Also, he wasn‚Äôt in his right mind, presenting a diagnosis of several personality disorders and Asperger syndrome. While there is no correlation between Asperger syndrome and heightened aggression or tendency towards violent acts, what his lawyers may have been trying to draw from is the *Rage Cycle* of autism.

The Rage Cycle deals with the lack of internalizing anger after the autistic child becomes aggitated due to sensory overload or high stress. It begins with the *rumbling* phase, characterized by threats or repetitive behaviors. Then the meltdown, a lashing out that can be directed towards others. Followed by the recovery phase, where the child often shows conflicting feelings about their actions or can‚Äôt remember them. This plays into the blackout Rod claimed he experienced when he killed the Wendorfs.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

The evidence, however, was just too much to contend with. Boot prints in the Wendorf‚Äôs blood were matched to Ferrell's shoes. Then there was the confession. Ferrell had confessed after he was arrested. His defense had been trying to keep it out of court, but when the judge ruled that the jury would be allowed to hear it, they knew they had lost. Rod‚Äôs own words were damning.



*‚Ä¶By that time, you know, it was pretty obvious, I had blood on me and a crowbar in my hand, I was fixing to say, yeah, I want to have coffee with you, son of a bitching smartass, but anyway then that‚Äôs when she lunged at me, cause I was actually going to let her live, but after she lunged at me I just took the bottom of the crowbar, and kept stabbing it through her skull and whenever she fell down I just continually beat her until I saw her brains falling on the floor, cause that pissed me off‚Ä¶*



Rod pled guilty and told the court that no one else was involved, that Anderson was just there and didn‚Äôt even touch the Wendorofs. Upon hearing his plea, records recount that his mother shouted, ‚ÄúWe Live Forever!‚Äù At seventeen, he was sentenced to death, making him the youngest inmate on death row at the time. A record he would hold until 2000, when his sentence was commuted to life in prison without the chance of parole.

The judge showed little mercy on Howard Anderson, whatever his actual role in the killings was. Anderson also pled guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without parole. The two girls admitted their guilt as well. Dana Cooper was sentenced to seventeen and a half years; Charity Keesee was given ten and a half years.

But what happened to Heather Wendorf? Was she just another victim of Vasago‚Äôs mesmerizing delusions, or was she the one who pointed the loaded gun that was Rod at her parents and pulled the trigger? Since the convictions, she has changed her name and started a new life.

Dana Cooper also stated that Heather had no idea of Rod‚Äôs plan. Cooper mirrors Anderson‚Äôs account of the night of the killings, that Rod had been worked up and talked about murdering Richard and Ruth before they had even left to steal the car.

The Vampire Cult Murders, as they came to be called, have fascinated the world over. Rod and his vampires become the subject of everything from films to books, such as *The Embrace* by Aphrodite Jones. They even inspired the Legendary Shack Shakers to write [Blood On The Bluegrass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu6OGU0WlCA), a dark folk song inspired by the murders.

I'm trying to fix a KitchenAid coffee grinder - it's solid as heck and I've managed to pin down the problem just to the motor, the rest of the mechanical and electrical innards are fine.

The grinder is a KitchenAid 5KCG100BER0 - I've found there's a range of 5KCG100's, this is the UK 230/240V model.

The motor's a [Johnson Electric DC971(2)LG](https://www.johnsonelectric.com/pub/media/image/tmp/metric-imperial/DC971_2_LG_014_metric.pdf), which as far as I can tell is discontinued.

The motor takes 230V DC, has a rated speed of 8261rpm, and has a 2-stage planetary gearbox on the front end between it and the burrs. Both stages have teeth ring=60, planet=22, sun=16, so 8261*(16/(76))^2 = 366rpm on the burrs.

I can make and 3D print adapters if needed, but I've no idea what on this motor is standard and I could find a drop-in replacement for, and what's specific to this. Domain knowledge appreciated.

The motor also has a different setup to the one in the Johnson doc - the white pieces (the brush housings?) are flush not proud of the motor case.

Can anyone recommend a way to source a compatible motor/motor+gearbox? Failing that, any idea how to source an appropriate full drivetrain if I replace the gearbox and/or power electronics?

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

I'm trying to fix a KitchenAid coffee grinder - it's solid as heck and I've managed to pin down the problem just to the motor, the rest of the mechanical and electrical innards are fine.

The grinder is a KitchenAid 5KCG100BER0 - I've found there's a range of 5KCG100's, this is the UK 230/240V model.

The motor's a [Johnson Electric DC971(2)LG](https://www.johnsonelectric.com/pub/media/image/tmp/metric-imperial/DC971_2_LG_014_metric.pdf), which as far as I can tell is discontinued.

The motor takes 230V DC, has a rated speed of 8261rpm, and has a 2-stage planetary gearbox on the front end between it and the burrs. Both stages have teeth ring=60, planet=22, sun=16, so 8261*(16/(76))^2 = 366rpm on the burrs.

I can make and 3D print adapters if needed, but I've no idea what on this motor is standard and I could find a drop-in replacement for, and what's specific to this. Domain knowledge appreciated.

The motor also has a different setup to the one in the Johnson doc - the white pieces (the brush housings?) are flush not proud of the motor case.

Can anyone recommend a way to source a compatible motor/motor+gearbox? Failing that, any idea how to source an appropriate full drivetrain if I replace the gearbox and/or power electronics?

1j2751x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j2751x/aitah_for_getting_coffee_with_an_ex/,AITAH for getting coffee with an ex,"Hi everyone - so I broke up with my ex after a one month relationship in September. It was very quick, no physical stuff involved, just would hang out everyday and chat for hours. Around week 2 she started being EXTREMELY toxic. Like she accused me of lying, she said I was trying to get with her friends, called me a womanizer, complained to my school dean about me ruining her experience all in the span of 3 weeks. I thought I really liked this girl, so I gave her grace, but the school situation was the final straw for me as she literally was ruining my career and professional life at that point. 

I didn't even need much time to move on from the relationship, she was heartbroken but I was so checked out by all the nonsense that within a week I was over it and didn't even care. We still saw each other in school but I would literally walk or hide when I saw her and then resume walking once she passed.

I met another girl at school and she's a sweetheart, and we began dating end of November. Yes I know quick move on but also quick relationship and as I said the way she did me dirty at the end of it was absurdly wrong and it icked me out extremely hard. This girl is everything my ex wasn't - kind, supportive, caring, and loving. My ex found out and texted this girl to break up with me, to which my girlfriend responsed ""I'll break up with him as my boyfriend and make him my husband"". I was like ok queen pop off.

Fast forward, I hadn't talked to my ex in 4 months, and then she hit me up for coffee last week. Nothing romantic, just wanted to catch up and talk about school. I took the coffee and she started her usual shit all over again, and in 15 mins I left the coffee shop literally livid thinking she had changed but seeing that she had not one bit. My girlfriend and my mom are both mad at me for entertaining that idea and taking the coffee. My girlfriend justifiably so felt like I might be trying to get back with her but I reassured her there is no way in sanity that I would. I am perfectly happy with her right now.

I am speaking as someone who has been involved in urban sketchers for years, gone to official symposiums, helps run a group, and has taken official workshops. I once took a work shop with the founder of the movement, and later one that he himself taught. 

I see posts on this sub asking about what is an actual urban sketch, and if their sketch is one. I saw one today.

The official organization operates under a manifesto on their website. To summarize, the intent is that you draw on location, in an urban environment, and share your drawing with others. ""Sharing the world, one sketch at a time.""

If you post here, you are sharing. 

If you are drawing something that was made by humans, I would call that urban. 

I'll note there is no rule that the sketch be good.

It is not simply a drawing club, though. The purpose is to make drawings that show other people what it's like where you are. How it feels to be there. What makes it what it is. And put it where others can see it. By using drawing rather than photography, you can really express things, and focus on what you think matters most.

There are accounts run by the official organization. If you follow them, you will see sketches from all over by people of varying skill levels. You will see their world. And if you participate, people will see yours. It is a very cool thing to breathe that in. To see people in places you mostly see on the news drawing people drinking coffee instead. Playing games you haven't heard of. Seeing that those things are distinct.

All done in the most peaceful way. With a sketch.

In addition, by participating you may well start to see the place around you differently, often through the words of others commenting. ""I didn't realize that place..."" 

You don't have to do any of that. Just drawing is a great thing. But I encourage you to try. It will enrich your life in ways you might not suspect. And your art might enrich the lives of others. All of your sketches enrich mine.

Don't worry if people are impressed by your skill. Don't apologize for it's lack. Show your world. It is magical and beautiful. The more you do this, the more you will see that and the better you will get at showing it.

So sketch in freedom and with determination. Show us your world with honesty and care. That's what this is all about.

1j26yv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/1j26yv1/so_you_want_to_protest/,So you want to protest...,"In a way, the past couple days have been exactly what we needed, as a country. ""Conspiracy theorists"" have been saying it for decades: America has never been a democracy. Human rights have never been for everyone. Slavery was never abolished (the 13th amendment has a very blatant ""loophole""). We've been hearing it a lot over the last month: ""I'm ashamed to be American."" ""I don't know what to do."" Over the past month, more and more people have realized that we are in an untenable situation.

But many then get upset when people DO stand up and act. I'll let MLK do the talking for me:

>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice \[...\]

On reddit, people will say something much shorter: ""Scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds"". A white liberal man once told me that my actions give the movement a bad look. I asked him what actions would be a good look. ""Your chants are too radical."" I handed him the list of chants and asked him which ones made him uncomfortable. He realized my point eventually: that protest makes people uncomfortable. Someone disrupting the status quo makes people uncomfortable. The man had come up to me to silence me, and when he realized that's what he was trying to do, he couldn't stop apologizing. But an apology isn't necessary--your action is necessary. He came to the next protest, which is all we need. If you don't disrupt the status quo, your ""resistance"" has failed. You must make people upset. You are upset, and you need to disrupt their daily lives in order for them to also realize it is time to take a stand.

That all being said, solidarity isn't just a buzzword. All humans deserve basic rights and dignity. If you do not believe that, then just stop reading. If you are jeering over the plight of minorities, saying ""they deserve it"", then stop reading. The largest Palestinian American community in the country did not have enough anti-Kamala votes to make any significant dent in their own county. Over half of white women voted for Trump. whereas over half of Latinos overall voted for Kamala. Minorities did not do this, and dogwhistling to blame them just means you are trying to absolve yourself of any guilt.

So what does taking a stand look like? The easiest thing you can do is look up primary sources, learn history/facts, and spread it amongst your networks. You can look up which companies support problematic things, and try to organize natural boycotts. (Some locally owned businesses, for example, may have donated to causes you are not fond of, and you can potentially pressure them into issuing an apology or the like).

CALL YOUR OFFICIALS. Write them letters. If you can, organize meetings with them. Many of them do not know facts, or do not realize their constituents care.

Next, go to your own town's city council meetings. They're open to the public. You will see who's actually running your town and what they do with your taxes (spoiler alert: there's a lot of corruption). Some rich person will give a lot of money to a local trustee candidate, then can call in a favor to get a bid on a soccer field, for example.

Okay, we found some corruption. Now, join your local DSA. You may not agree with all of DSA politics, but here's the problem: establishment Democrats are not going to help. You can check out [opensecrets.org](http://opensecrets.org), for example, to see that the same entities pay off both sides. One local millionaire was asked who he donated to. He said, he donated the exact same amount to both candidates. It did not matter to him which one won--both of them would owe him a favor that he could cash in at any time. The same happens in local politics that happens at the state level and the national level. DSA can help you find candidates to support that are NOT paid off--or help you become the candidate that is not paid off.

Alright, that's not enough, or electoral politics are not for you. What's next? Organize a protest! I've been loving the 50501 movement, as they've been picking very visible days of action that many are seeing. Now that you're connected with a DSA, you'll have a lot of like-minded individuals to show up to your protest. I won't get into the technicalities of how to organize one, especially because it can be varied (noise restrictions, for example). Create a signal chat, or even a discord or a slack for your growing crew. Get someone good with Canva to make you pretty fliers--very important. Organize an ""art build"" (get together with some coffee to make large, visible signs). Get stacks of free stickers from the post office to write your messages on to spread.

""But it's not safe!"" It is perfectly safe. There are very strict boundaries on what is legal and what is illegal (if you go out into the road, that is illegal). Get yourself a megaphone, look up a list of chants, and then practice/strengthen your lungs in the living room until your family threatens to break your new toy. Bonus points if you only start calling someone on it from the other side of the house when they go to the bathroom. We are fighting against doom and gloom, yes, but you have to find some humor, something to laugh at, or you'll never be able to get out of bed. If you start getting threats or anything of the sort, have your phone on hand to take a video. Especially from cops. If you break no laws, they may not arrest you. And if they do, you have a very nice lawsuit waiting for them. Or if you get a clown trying to run into your crew with a bicycle, just ask him why he's having a bad day, very calmly (no megaphone). He will get huffy and pedal away while cursing at you--no real threat. You have safety in your crew. Go get ice cream afterwards. We keep each other safe. Law enforcement exists to protect capital, not people.

If you don't like a bill that a senator is proposing, and the emails/calls aren't working, find out where they're going to be for a public event and then go with your signs, go with your questions, flood their town halls.

Be creative. Don't sit on reddit or facebook and hand-wring.

Do you think they should?,"I have a 27 year old daughter who often comes to my house with her dog, 120 Pyrennes mix. She likes to stay so she can use my home to visit friends and colleagues as I live near a major city where she used to live and often comes and goes to catch up, etc. When she leaves to visit friends, I watch her dog. When she has stayed as an extended crash pad for local work, I had to find a dog walker cuz her boy has actually pulled me down in the past. (She paid after I screened). Still, he makes a fair bit of mess and sheds extensively. He has damaged furniture, laptop in the past, but has grown out of it.   
  
I will also cook a meal or two, make sure there's coffee, buy things I know she'll eat, or that she likes. I often get her meal preferences before she comes and make that specific thing(s). We had one of those, mom, can you watch the dog while I go see some friends visits this weekend. She came and hung out with me the first evening after dinner (she cleaned up partially with me then) and then was gone for the next two days; sleeping in my furnished basement all three nights. 

Here's my question. Is it toxic/manipulative/a dick move (all things she's said tonight) to ask her to do a fair share of cleaning up after herself when she's here? I think this is something she should do in addition to pitching in with the cleaning up after meals and or cooking because we're family. I see this as reciprocity because we want to have a loving, fair relationship. She sees it as using her for free labor. I have always done this visiting anyone, but especially family. Hosting can be tiring and I guess I think family should know that.  
  
She states that if I don't want the food, then I should not cook it; or if I don't feel like cleaning it up then I should not cook. On this visit she said I was a ""scorekeeper"" because I expected her to help before leaving. I replied back that treating shared family meals as a transaction was exactly that, scorekeeping. She was initially going to stay in today to watch her dog and mine, while I went to a group dinner I told her about before she came. At the last minute, she changed her mind and wanted to go see a friend.   
  
She also did not help clean up after breakfast and-- as I had to make a cake for my dinner (she did help), the kitchen backed up quickly. She lost track of time I guess and became rushed to visit her friend and got snippy with me when she raced out saying again: If I didn't want the cake I shouldn't have made it. I had already washed and put away the dishes from earlier meal before breakfast. The sink was full of breakfast dishes at cake making time. I told her I didn't think it was fair for her to leave the kitchen mess to me and that I would be late to my event.   
  
At this point she got very, very angry; this anger has happened more than once. When this happens she will storm off and say things like FAFO, if you want me here then you can't be a bitch, manipulative, toxic. She knows I was abused as a kid because I went into therapy when she was born and stayed there through high school. By all accounts of her friends, herself and my therapist-her childhood was mostly stable (I can answer questions if you're wondering). Not perfect, but she knows she was loved despite my limitations and I learned to explain to her that my shtuff was not hers and she was not responsible for me. I have apologized when I hurt her throughout her life, but she generally has not done the same after these name calling attacks/when I tell her I feel hurt/upset/whatever.   
  
Today she even said, ""I don't know what kind of effed up incest thing this is that makes you think this is okay to ask me to clean up. It's not my house. I would never ask you to clean up at my house."" She's only really had a house long enough for me to visit twice and each time I have made meals and yes, cleaned up, stripped my bed before leaving, etc. On my first visit, I cared for her dog, her boyfriend's dog and my dog while they went to a work party. 

Am I off my nut here or what? The vicious remarks are painful and when this happens, I end up feeling hurt and used. What thoughts do you all have? ",19,1740964647.0,GenXWomen,33,0.92,False

(Without Caffeine),"I‚Äôve recently moved to a place where there are no bathrooms available during my runs, so I really need to empty my bowels completely beforehand. The problem is, I have to run around 5:30 AM because of heat and traffic, and that‚Äôs too early for my body to naturally get going.

I‚Äôve seen people recommend coffee, but I prefer to avoid caffeine. Right now, I drink a tall glass of warm water before heading out, but I don‚Äôt really feel the urge until 5 minutes into my run‚Äîtoo late.

This issue has been adding a lot of anxiety and making me feel scared of my runs lately. I keep worrying about needing to go in the middle of my route with no options. Also, what do you do if you have to go multiple times during a run?

1j26wz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j26wz0/my_best_friend_27f_wants_to_demote_me_28f_from/,My best friend (27f) wants to demote me (28f) from MOH to honorary bridesmaid,"So my (f28) best friend, I‚Äôll call her Bella (27f) is getting married in November. We‚Äôve know each other since we were 15. She recently got engaged and I am so excited for her. I met almost all of my friends either before I got close enough to be a bridesmaid, one friend who didn‚Äôt have a bridal party, or after a friend got married. So this is my first time being in a bridal party. She appointed me matron of honor, and she was one of two of my maid of honors.

We had an argument about the bridesmaid dress, because the cut was going to be constricting on all the bridesmaids (non stretch satin). I was unfair, because I said the wedding process was making her a bit mean and not herself. So I apologized and said I would size up and get it altered, saying I was stressed about it standing at the alter by her, since I have POTS. I got diagnosed about two years ago, but it‚Äôs been getting more consistent with flare ups the past few months. She knows this. I let her know recently in grocery stores, I can‚Äôt stand longer than 5-10 minutes in the checkout because my heart rate gets to 158+. She said her cousin that‚Äôs a maid of honor could probably do everything herself (bridal shower, bachelorette) and would be fine with it, but she was thinking me and her other maid of honor and other cousin and Hannah could have input and help as we were able, saying it didn‚Äôt need to be a stressful thing for you. I have no problem helping with parties, just standing during the ceremony so I don‚Äôt get lightheaded.

She said: ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs those two options for you to be seated right before the procession starts or with a groomsmen and sit in a row. We can think about it, don‚Äôt need to decide today. Either way I‚Äôm gonna need to get one of the other girls to switch the dress they are ordering. But it is understandable why you don‚Äôt think you can stand. You can still get ready with everyone and be in bridesmaid pictures.‚Äù

I was confused about her talking about my place with standing, and sounded like I might not be a part of the bridal party in other events. I want to help plan her bachelorette and bridal party, etc. so I asked what she meant, and she said:

‚ÄúJust not standing, I might would list you as an honorary bridesmaid. You‚Äôd need to come to the rehearsal and would get ready with us and be in the pictures. I just need to know that you‚Äôre for sure gonna stick to that plan cuz I‚Äôm very tired and don‚Äôt have the energy to switch it once we get it reset. There‚Äôs been a lot on my mind and I haven‚Äôt been well. And I wanna give the coordinator the right information the first time.‚Äù

So I said wait, so I‚Äôm not a matron of honor if I can‚Äôt stand? We‚Äôve been best friends for thirteen years, and the idea of being removed from the bridal party for my POTS sounded, well, wild.

She said: ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know what it will be appropriate to list you as and I don‚Äôt wanna decide today because it‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôve been having to think through. If it says matron of honor but you sit down people will probably wonder why. But if it says honorary bridesmaid and you are sitting they won‚Äôt question it. Behind the scenes you‚Äôd be the same.‚Äù 

I said I‚Äôd be there and seated in a row like she wanted, and she said great, you can help Sarah (maid of honor) with ideas about the party.

So, she‚Äôd want my input and help with the parties, doing my MOH duties, but everyone would think I‚Äôm an honorary bridesmaid. Because she thinks it would look strange for me to be seated instead of standing? She the says:

‚ÄúBut you also want to have the title but not do the day of tasks. You‚Äôve indicated you‚Äôre not up to doing the party work or standing there. ((I never said that)) I wanted you to have input because I know you enjoy it and you know what I like. I don‚Äôt need this extra stress, there‚Äôs lots of things going on with the wedding and I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt want to decide today. As much as I love you there‚Äôs more to the wedding than just this and I‚Äôve already switched things around to make you happy. ((Since I‚Äôm sitting, she needs to rearrange the girls blue and champagne colored dress order)) I think being upset about the title is unreasonable at this point when you want to help with the party but don‚Äôt want to do the wedding day tasks. ((Again, never said I wasn‚Äôt okay with that!!))

I said I absolutely want to help with wedding day tasks! Yeah, it is a title, but the titles come with expectations, and it felt a bit wrong to be some hidden matron of honor because of standing issues. The last message she sent me was this:

‚ÄúIt just seems like you should be thankful I‚Äôm willing to rework things for you rather than asking me about a title in the program when you‚Äôre not even going to be doing the typical job that goes with the title that day. When I‚Äôve said I can‚Äôt do any more today. I didn‚Äôt ask you to do the work for the party either, I said I‚Äôd tell Sarah to take your input.‚Äù

I then received a message from her mother telling me Bella just wants me as an honorary bridesmaid if I‚Äôm going to have to sit in the congregation, not as a MOH.

I feel so defeated. Yes, it‚Äôs a title. But it‚Äôs also feels ever so slightly ableist to demote me for literally being unable to stand when I made it clear I was 100% ready to help plan her bridal shower and bachelorette party, get whatever coffee she needed that‚Äôd morning, help with makeup, etc. All because ‚Äúpeople would wonder why the matron of honor is sitting.‚Äù

It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even deserve the title of matron of honor and demoted to HONORARY bridesmaid after being her best friend for thirteen years. Thank y‚Äôall.",4,1740964535.0,relationship_advice,17,0.7,False
1j26w6w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j26w6w,I present to you my beloved Bonnie Babe,"Hello, I could really use some help capturing my house hens calm demeanor. About 3 years ago in spring my family and I were at our local feed store picking up scratch for our flock of egg laying hens. The big box store had recently received a HUGE shipment of chicks for sale. My young son and I noticed one chick on the ground being pulled and stomped on my the mass amounts of healthy energetic chicks. We called a clerk over and brought the limp / bloody chick to her attention. She pick it up (i noticed it perking up and peeping) and started to walk away. My son asked where she was taking it... the girl said ""to the back"" oh, okay... wait ... NO ! i know what THAT means ! So i asked 
""Would you sell it "" she replied ""no one would buy it this way"" instantly i replied ""i will"" in my mind, i thought i was giving it one hour, one day, one chance. 
I bought that lil chick home. Put her under and heat lamp patched up her foot and hand fed her till she was feathered out and gorgeous. She became my house hen lol we had coffee together and enjoyed many movies on the couch. 
I did give her many chances to go outside and become a ""chicken"" with the rest she would flip out pure panic at the sight of another chicken. For a full 2 years Bonnie was my shadow INSIDE the house. late last summer i bought a six pack of chicks and Bonnie didn't mind. The chicks were in the house house when small and under a heat lamp, Bonnie would go sit with them and bask. When they feathered out... she would go visit with them and scratch the ground. Eventually it became a regular routine. Fast forward: a few months ago, the chicken feed got wet. The yeasty smelling feed was giving for them to eat. A few days later i woke up to 6 dead hens. One was my Bonnie Babe. I was devastated. In all my 43 years of being around chickens i had never experienced anything like this. Iv beaten myself up over poor choices. And miss my girl everyday. Iv been looking for a way to capture her calm nature in some way. Iv seen etsy artists that take pictures and paint pets in Victorian era style and think it's adorable. Any style you prefer would be greatly appreciated. I miss her so much Id like to memorize her on my wall. Thank you for your time and consideration ",1,1740964463.0,drawme,2,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1j26qe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j26qe3/full_honest_review/,Full Honest Review,"My credentials: a million hours on Good Pizza Great Pizza, been looking forward to Good Coffee Great Coffee for months now, Day 80+ on a number of other Papa's games. 

Here are all my issues with this game! 

1. Lack of story

It started off very creative with these judges and contests, where people come in to evaluate your skills. The story falls off quick and you're left with just monotonous days of pouring the same two latte flavors for hours. It is also so difficult to get to the next plotline in the story, and all the creativity just disappears. Your story missions end up being ""earn 40 bucks a day for 5 days,"" and ""get to level 8"" when I'm literally level 6. They expect you to grind for so long just to get to the next plotpoint, and to be honest, without a good story line and quests, the game is VERY monotonous. 

2. Level Progression

The level progression is absurdly slow, and the XP inflation is completely nuts. It takes genuinely forever to level up, and you can't access the next story line without leveling up! The daily missions help in the beginning, but they become utterly useless after level 6. When I was level 5 and I claimed my daily mission for 600 XP, it rapidly filled up nearly half of my level bar. Then when I was level 7 and claimed a daily mission, it actually didn't make a single dent. How does the game expect us to grind out the same, boring days for hours and get nothing out of it? It is so defeating to play day after day and only receive 100 xp per day. Please increase the amount of XP we get, or lower the amount it takes to progress!!

3. Horrible Upgrade System

You have the option to upgrade your coffee machine in the game. However, it doesn't tell you the buffs that each level up gives you, nor how much does it cost for the later levels. If I'm a level 1 coffee machine, I have no idea how much it costs to continue leveling up! You only find out when you're right about to buy the level. Please tell us the prices of each level up clearly! Also tell us what is changing! It is impossible to compare which coffee machine and which upgrades are the best, causing a lot of players to waste their money on absolute trash. 

4. More upgrade ideas 

There are only 4 upgrades and 1 of them is completely useless. The measuring cup upgrade doesnt absolutely nothing, doesn't help you measure at all (it just draws some measuring lines on your cup and it is hard to pour it exactly to the measurement). It costs $200 in game and is a complete waste of money. 

Also please add more upgrades! Why are there only 4? There are so many more ideas, where's the creativity? Auto steam, auto grind, auto pour espresso, etc. There are so many ideas, why have the developers slacked off so much when making this game? 

5. Lack of Dialogue

I'd say this is more nitpicky than anything, but please add some new dialogue. The characters recycle the same 5 lines, and the lines don't make sense half the time.

Never been a great sleeper, 

as far as I remember I've never enjoyed sleeping,
It's a waste of time to me, usually I get 5-7 hours of sleep and rarely feels fatigue over a normal day

Usually means I go to bed really late regardless of whenever I need to be up 

I'm also really prone to stress, both my genes' and my environment's fault

I do have some occurrence of insomnia, I'd say 10 times a year I can't sleep for more than 2-3 hours even if I'm trying.

That's it for my context.

Huge and happy events are going on in my life right now, I truly feel fulfilled and I've probably spent the best year of my life yet (25M btw) 
Don't feel depressed at all.
Work is a bit stressful but yet I'm easily stressed so it might always be the case. 

Now theses 3-4 last days I haven't feel sleepy at all, and that got me spending more than 40hours sleepless, and oh boy was it annoying 

Friday night, since I skipped the previous night due to insomnia, I tried to get in bed earlier then usual (around 11:30) and couldn't get anywhere close to sleeping 

The weird thing is I did not feel tired at all during theses 40h, finally got a few 5-6 hours of really light sleep to this Saturday where I had a party planned that ended around 5am and guess what, unable to feel fatigued again even after dancing all night ( took no alcohol, no drugs, no meds, no late coffee, I mostly drink water ) even though I had 6 hours of sleep in the last 3 days at best 

And now here I am, working tomorrow, it's 2am and I feel like I could run a marathon 

Actually no, because I do feel weak physically, even though I can find the sleepyness that usually goes with it



Does anyone connects with that ? 

Nb: 

Tried reading, I'm just bored not tired, just forced myself to read for the last 2 hours, didn't help

ASMR sometimes works but after a really long time

Tried CBD oil last time it happened, not sure it did anything
 
Breathing exercises helps with the stress but still not tired

1j26oib,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j26oib/wibta_for_refusing_to_let_my_fianc√©_take_our_cat/,WIBTA for refusing to let my fianc√© take our cat when we move?,"My fianc√© (28M) and I (26F) have been together for five years, living together for the last 2.5. Our relationship has become an emotional dead zone‚Äîwe haven‚Äôt been affectionate or intimate in a long time, and our home is a complete disaster because, honestly, we just weren‚Äôt ready to be on our own. We‚Äôve both been struggling with our mental health, so we‚Äôve decided to move back in with our parents, live separately for a while, and work on ourselves while still staying together.

We have two cats: Mocha (2F) and Coffee Bean (1.5M). Coffee Bean is bonded to me, while Mocha is attached to my fianc√©. Mocha was my first-ever pet because every animal I had growing up technically belonged to my mom. Mocha was also my fianc√©‚Äôs first pet since his parents were allergic. We both love her deeply, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable letting him take her when we move.

Here‚Äôs why:

1. His mom‚Äôs house is hoarder-level bad. When his late mother (father is trans and became mother) was diagnosed withdementia, his mom had to take care of her and the house has fallen into complete disarray. She hasn't been able to get it back on track since her passing. He goes over daily to clean, but according to him, the place is knee-deep in garbage, rotting food, spiders, and cockroaches. Not only does he not think he can get it done by the end of the month th when our 30 day notice is up and needs me to hold on to her while he finishes his room, but she wont be able to roam the house freely and will be trapped in his room. I cannot in good conscience send Mocha into that environment.


2. He gets overwhelmed by Mocha wanting attention. When she wants to play or cuddle at a time he isn‚Äôt in the mood, he gets frustrated, yells at her, and brings her to me with her toy. She‚Äôll run back to him because she loves him, but instead of engaging, he just gets more frustrated. When she begs for food, he goes into meltdown mode instead of just handling it like I do. He has to lock her out of the gaming room to eat sometimes.



Meanwhile, I don‚Äôt have this issue with the cats. If they beg, I give them a tiny treat, and they move on. When Coffee Bean gets pushy, I play with him for five minutes, and then he chills. I call him my ""naughty snuggle buggle"" while throwing his favorite toy, and once he‚Äôs gotten his energy out, I can go back to whatever I was doing.

The complication:

Technically, both cats are legally mine. Their Banfield memberships and microchips are in my name. I don‚Äôt want to hurt my fianc√©, and I know he loves Mocha, but I genuinely don‚Äôt think she will be safe or happy at his mom‚Äôs house. When I brought this up, he got upset, and we had a fight.

Would I be the asshole if I refused to let him take Mocha?",170,1740963802.0,AmItheAsshole,55,0.95,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred.

There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

1j26h7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1j26h7h/financial_dpoa_and_aps_questions/,Financial DPoA and APS questions.,"I recently moved in with my mother, about 15 months ago, after my brother had passed away from an overdose. My mother has dementia and, unbeknownst to me, my brother had had an open APS case when he lived here that got him in some trouble. APS tried to press charges on him, but my mother refused, but apparently when my mother was having my brother handle all the finances he was also withdrawing a lot of her money for his habit. However, this was before my mother had any of her rights taken away. She still had the right to give him his own debit card, and when I went to her once with my concerns, because my brother had asked me to go to the ATM and take out $400 For him because he was busy, the card he gave me with his name on it I knew it was from my mother‚Äòs account. And I knew what he was spending the money on so I went to my mother and was like hey just a heads up PJ asked me to do this. I didn‚Äôt do it, but I believe he‚Äôs using your money to fund his Nefarious lifestyle and she outright told me not to get involved. My brother took very good care of her and as long as her bills were paid and her needs were met she didn‚Äôt care what he did with the rest of the money.
At this point, my brother was also being paid to be my mother‚Äòs caretaker. My mother is a disabled veteran. The VA has a contract with Easter Seals where if you live with a disabled veteran, you can get paid for taking care of them because they save money on not having to hire people to come in and help. Well, eventually, my brother ended up catching some federal drug charges and Easter Seals fired him. 
During this time before my brother lost his position at Easter Seals Easter Seals had been sending in another person. My mother knew and paying them to do three days a week three hours a day coming in and caring for her. This woman is somebody my mother hadn‚Äôt talked to in 30 years until my stepfather passed away. As soon as my stepfather passed away, this woman hooked onto her like a leech . She also put herself as my mother‚Äòs next of kin after my brother at the VA and at Easter seal so when everything went south with my brother they asked her to be my mother‚Äôs medical power of attorney because she was supposedly my mother‚Äòs next of kin. This all happened in 2020 to 2021. I had gone upstate for most of Covid so I didn‚Äôt realize how bad things had got and because of my brother state I did not come and visit my mother a lot because him and I would argue about me, wanting him to go in the treatment. And once it got loud, my mother would ask me to leave, and it always ended up being traumatic and not worth it. 
Cut to my brother passing away from an overdose in October 2023. This was when I found out that this old acquaintance who had slithered her way back into my mother‚Äòs life and managed to profit off of it, was given authority over all of my mothers medical decisions. When my brother passed away. She wanted immediately to put my mother into a nursing home. My mother also had another caretaker who came at night. By who is absolutely amazing. Absolutely amazing. This is somebody who is an Easter seals employee and Easter seals assigned her to my mother so she is not somebody that my mother ever knew in the past. She only knows my mother because she is her caretaker. She‚Äôs been her caretaker since 2021 and she is great. I‚Äôm gonna call her Molly. Molly is the nighttime caretaker seven days a week. Ursula is what I‚Äôm gonna refer to the other caretaker as she comes three times a week in the morning.
Once my brother passed away, and I realized that I was going to have to really step up to be there for my mother I started having long conversations with Molly because she was the one who handled everything. When my brother passed away she was the one who managed to finally get a hold of me after two days not the woman who‚Äôs known my family for 40 years, that woman didn‚Äôt do anything. It was Molly, who was trying to notify anybody in my family to come help she had handled everything with communicating with the funeral home while she waited to get in touch with somebody from the family and seeing how much she did to make sure all the ducks were in a row when my brother passed away as well as also care for my mother well Ursula did nothing, Ursula I didn‚Äôt even know was paid to be my mom‚Äòs caretaker. In the 80s and 90s Ursula, my mother used to hang out playing cards at the kitchen table all the time. so Ursula coming up here three mornings a week and playing cards with my mother. I thought they were just doing what they used to do. I had no clue Ursula was paid to be here because she never did any work. She only played cards with my mother that was it. Molly had told me that Ursula had been trying for years to get my mother put in a nursing home and that the VA would not put my mother into a nursing home as long as she did not wanna go and that she was safe at her home. Even with my brother here in the state he was in they left her here.
When Molly told me that now that my brother was not in the home, Ursula was for sure going to be able to convince the VA to put my mother in a home which my mother was begging us not to let happen, I decided to move in to make sure she could not put my mother into a home. Ursula tried to threaten me and tell me that I couldn‚Äôt live here Nobody was allowed to move in with my mother, blah blah blah. I clearly didn‚Äôt listen to her and moved in. She has no right to tell my mother who can and can‚Äôt live in our house. And my mother did not want to be alone here she told me that plenty of times. There are times where I would leave at night a couple of weeks after my brother died and she would cry and beg me not to leave her here alone at night, but I was in a living situation where I had to go home. I was managing a woman‚Äôs house and I had to be there to make sure everybody was home for curfew.
Fast-forward I‚Äôve lived with my mother for 15 months Ursula has done everything she can over the past 15 months to try to get my mother put into a home. When I told Ursula look if you‚Äôre still willing to not sign over medical POA, then you‚Äôre leaving me no choice but to apply for guardianship. Because you clearly want to medically take my mother in a direction she doesn‚Äôt want to go and I promised my mother, I would fight tooth and nail to make sure she didn‚Äôt end up in a home. I don‚Äôt wanna fight you Ursula. I‚Äôve been here for 13 months cause this was two months ago. You know my intentions with my mother are nothing but to provide her with the best care possible. The fact that you haven‚Äôt signed over medical POA by now just shows me that your gatekeeping to do whatever your own agenda is. And I‚Äôm worried about your agenda and I promised my mother. I would never let your agenda come to fruition so if you‚Äôre still going to refuse to Make me medical POA, I‚Äôm gonna have to petition the state for guardianship. I told her that on a Tuesday. The following Monday morning, she showed up for work an hour early, so at 8:30 in the morning when I was still asleep, she got my mother, dressed by whispering, took my mother out of the house I saw on camera she was telling her that they were going out for a little while wouldn‚Äôt tell her where I woke up at 9:20 10 minutes before Ursula was supposed to be here for her shift, came downstairs and my mother was gone, so I immediately checked the cameras and saw that Ursula had taken my mother out of the house that morning, so I started calling and texting Ursula. She wouldn‚Äôt respond to me until noon. She answered the phone and said I‚Äôm trying to help your mother in the bathroom. I can‚Äôt talk right now and she hung up on me and then she sent me a text message saying my mother was now in a nursing home and that I could talk to Easter Seals about it. I talked to Easter Seals and they said they had nothing to do with it. This was all on her POA we had nothing to do with us. this is in our call.
My mother is now been there for a month both myself and Molly have gone to visit her multiple times. Molly reached out to Ursula and was like what are you doing? Karen is doing terrible. She has aged 20 years in three weeks. She doesn‚Äôt know who people are she‚Äôs never not known who me or her daughter were she clearly is confused. She scared she asks me not to leave her. She wants to go home sometimes she thinks she‚Äôs home and she can‚Äôt find her cats. She‚Äôs upset. She needs to go home now. All Ursula will say is that she can‚Äôt bring her home because there‚Äôs an open APS case against me.
Which is true. As soon as Ursula found out, I had financial DPA over my mother. She called APS and said that my mothers finances were being abused. APS then came over and because they had dealt with my brother in the past they immediately saw me as a threat to my mother. Before the woman even met with me, she sent me an email in which she referred to me as the perpetrator and my mother is the victim and I emailed her back and I was like those are some pretty accusatory words to use considering you don‚Äôt know me and you haven‚Äôt looked into this case at all. I am not a perp abusing my mother‚Äôs account. When I took over my mother‚Äòs account in June 20 24 she had $12,000 in the bank When this woman started questioning me in December my mother had $18,000 in the bank not to mention, I am consolidated quite a few of her bills I‚Äôd put everything on auto pay. I had made sure that there was a safe vehicle for the home so that I could get my mother to every place she needed to be as well as handle all of her shopping, I bought my mother new clothes for the first time in like 10 years, especially considering she weighed 98 pounds when I moved in here and she weighs 130 now. Because I cook my mom dinner every night my brother didn‚Äôt. And Molly would come over at night and she would bring my mother leftovers from her own casseroles for my mother to have for dinner and then for lunch the next day so when Molly went grocery shopping for my mom, she really only bought Breakfast yogurt for my mother, coffee, cat food, cat litter, paper towels, toilet paper, and stuff like that she did not buy much food because Molly brought all the food for my mother‚Äôs daily meals over from her house. She did have a few snacks that she would get from my mother like my mother really liked peanut butter sandwiches so they were always loaves of bread and jars of peanut butter here and Hotdogs and hotdog buns and eggs because with the eggs she could make either egg salad with the bread and the eggs or she could make French toast, so those were the big staples that Molly would buy when she would handle the grocery shopping when I moved in. I started doing full grocery shops for my mother, however Every time I went grocery shopping for my mother, I would also buy things for myself and I would keep two separate receipts, so that, if anybody were to ever question me about me, potentially taking advantage of living with my mother, I had proof that I paid all my own things. A year before, when my brother lived here, she paid for everything for him. I paid for all my own groceries I paid for my own gas. My mother had been paying for a storage unit for my brother for a couple of years I took over that payment because I didn‚Äôt think it was fair that she should have to pay that for him, but I also wasn‚Äôt ready to empty it out. It has a lot of my brother‚Äôs personal things in there. I‚Äôm not ready to get rid of them so I took over the payment. My mother also paid $270 a month to Verizon for her and my brother‚Äôs phone bill bills. I canceled the Verizon account. My mother‚Äòs phone was already unlocked so I switched her to mint mobile and because she was home and on the wireless 95% of the time I was able to get her just the 5 GB plan which is only $180 a year so I paid Less than one month of her original phone bill and it covered her phone for the entire year. However, a PS still came over and brow beat me about every single item on my mothers statement. She wanted me to show her every single Amazon purchase I had made for my mother. I bought my mother Maybe a dozen outfits I had bought her a new mattress and a new bedframe that was adjustable because the VA told me she needed a new bed. They said her bed is too high. She needs a footstool to get up on it and we‚Äôre not comfortable with her climbing up on that stool without unsteady. She is on her feet. She needs a lower bed. I asked them if they could assist with a hospital bed or something and they said no absolutely not. You really don‚Äôt want a hospital bed until She‚Äôs that end of life care because they‚Äôre so uncomfortable and blah blah blah so I got her a twin size mattress and an adjustable frame as if it were a hospital bed and then I also got one of those air pads to prevent bed sores. And the APS lady was really upset about this. She was like what right do you have to make these big purchases for your mother well first of all I talked to my mother before I made any purchase and make sure she was OK with it. I don‚Äôt want her to go from a queen size bed down to a twin size bed without talking to her about it. Second of all I have financial DPoA that‚Äôs what gives me the right. My mother signed me over the right to make these decisions for her.

OK flash to now my mother has been in this nursing home for five weeks. They let me go and take her out and one night they let me keep her out for the night. I asked if I could take her on an overnight they said yes however, Ursula found out and immediately Told them that nobody was allowed to let my mother leave the premises except for her from now on, and I had to bring her back immediately. When they called me that morning, I was supposed to have her back by 2 PM when they called me at like 7:45 in the morning saying I had to bring her back I said you know what we‚Äôre gonna go to the probate court. I‚Äôve already filed for a petition for guardianship. I‚Äôm gonna go now And petition them for emergency guardianship. I‚Äôm gonna file an ex parte.
I was denied. My mother and I have a guardianship hearing coming up on the 17th. Also, this APS case is still open against me even though, again, my mother‚Äôs account has been increasing by an average of $1000 a month all of her bills are paid. Nothing is in default. Nothing Has been shut off. There‚Äôs been no late payments, all of her bills are paid. Her money is accumulating, monthly or increasing monthly and the money that I am spending is on my mother. However, given how badly this APS lady browbeat me in the past about things like groceries I don‚Äôt want to have to talk to her again now that I have paid for a lawyer with my mother‚Äòs money to try to get her out of this nursing home and had to withdraw some money to purchase a new house vehicle to be able to drive the hour to go see my mother and back multiple times a week safely. 
When I hit up the APS lady and said hey look we talked months ago I showed you all my mother‚Äòs bills are paid. I answered all of your questions. I showed you all the receipts you wanted. My mother is now in a nursing home and they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs because of this open APS case I need help. I need to get her home as soon as possible. Can you close this case please? My mother needs to come home and she responded with the fact that she needed receipts if I was honestly Helping my mother, I needed to show her receipts.

Can I show her receipts for things like a lawyer for my mother and a car that I now need to be able to transport things. My mother needs consistently multiple times a week an hour away? I could‚Äôve kept the Hooptie going for another few months if it was just around city driving but it has a really bad transmission leak. It has 240,000 miles and I knew that, come May when the inspection sticker was up, I was not gonna be able to get it re-inspected. I knew that I knew we were gonna need a new vehicle for the house so I withdrew $3000 to purchase a very very very appliable vehicle to be able to get to and from my mother because now she‚Äôs an hour away.
I would like to just respond to this woman from APS and say look I have financial power of attorney over my mother. I have the right to make the decisions to buy her what she needs. You can clearly see her bills are paid. She has money in the bank, what seems to be the issue? Do I need to provide APS with every single receipt considering I am the financial power of attorney? Or can I just say hey I had the authority to make these purchases and I‚Äôve already given you receipts. You know there‚Äôs no abuse going on here what‚Äôs going on?

I used voice to text to type this out because I knew it was gonna be really long. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all over the place and I apologize. I‚Äôm worried about the APS Lady.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1740963160.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

Exmo from Brazil here. Today I caught myself wondering what the church does to avoid the cultural faux-pas of declining a cup of coffee in Brazil. For exemple: when the missionaries were visiting me, they would always be received in the front door first by my mom with cake, cheese bread, cookies aaaand‚Ä¶ coffee. My mother never did it for a bad reason, it‚Äôs just a cultural thing where we live. You offer your visits a lot of food and coffee. And it‚Äôs a faux-pas to refuse. After I explained to her that they didn‚Äôt drink coffee, she started offering them juice, but I always felt she was never interested in the church mainly because it started off with this coffee issue (and I mean it. She didn‚Äôt want to read the Book of Mormon and only really agreed to attend a couple sacramental meetings - that‚Äôs how we say in english? - with me. Smart woman). Before you ask, for me it was easy: I was sick in the hospital for months when I first talked to the missionaries and coffee and wasn‚Äôt really my priority then.

After I left the church recently, I was talking to a coworker that commented that a coworker of ours was a mormon and it was the weirdest thing how she didn‚Äôt drink coffee ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no excuse to don‚Äôt drink it! She‚Äôs so weird‚Äù Even little kids drink it here. I mean you‚Äôd start a conversation as the weird kid in the bunch. ",5,1740963096.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False
