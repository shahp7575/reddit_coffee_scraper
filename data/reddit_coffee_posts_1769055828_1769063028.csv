￼​First time using the machine. Pump is so quiet, love it, no rattling etc. Heat up takes time as I am used to single boiler Classika PID what heats up quickly. Hard to tell when the brew temperature is fine, waited 30min and then made coffee, espresso still seemed a bit cool as I am used to PID 91 degrees (celsius) espresso.

Also heard a little hizzing soud coming from now and then, is it normal? I hear that the heating element does go on and off by sound and steam pressure (from 1.25 to 1.5 bars, is it normal that it goes a bit down and back up)?

Is there valve on top that releases some excess pressure etc.? Coclusion, is it normal for HX machine that the heating element does go on and off, I hear it when it starts boiling, then it stops and then back again after short time. Steam pressure also drops a bit, 1.25 when heating element is off and then back to 1,5bar when it is on again.",1,1769062704.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We work at the same retail store and we have the same work hours (7am-4pm). She clocks in at work about 20ish minutes before me and every single day without fail, has made me coffee. But I have a problem with it. Every time I drink it, it leaves me with a weird aftertaste. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it kinda tastes like almonds. And before anyone says it’s the coffee machine or something, it isn’t. I know that because I made coffee from the same machine from the break room where she always makes my coffee before to test it, and it tastes like regular coffee without the almond aftertaste. I trust my best friend completely. We’ve been close friends since high school. She has never done anything that would cause me to raise an eyebrow. What do I do?

For some reason many people who see me laughs, trolls, sneers, stares, or intimidates. Why do they do this? For example many people will try to get my attention like baiting me, they laugh about it and when I ignore them they mock me by saying something snarky like: ""Oh he doesn't like me!"" just laughing at me. One time a kid recognized me and decided to do this really creepy stare at me almost like he looked like he wanted to do something to me.

One incident involved a group of boys pointing at me in awe, laughing, giggling they exclaimed: ""Look out its the main character!"" what ever the fuck that means. I was just walking down the corner with coffee in my hand. What is so special about that? I was pushed on the way to class one time. The whole class started laughing at me when I forgot something I told them to shut up, and then a group of girls behind my back said ""I look like a killer."" One very horrifying incident is where I was in the park. Two teens were laughing at me as usual. I ignored them. One boy screamed loudly to the girl ""Don't hit me!""

I’ve been deep-diving into the forecast for 2026, and honestly? I am living for the direction we’re heading. It feels like we are finally graduating from the hyper-specific micro-trends (RIP quiet luxury and cottagecore dominance) into a new era I’m calling 'Ethereal Tech.' 

We’re seeing a massive shift where futuristic materials meet everyday wearability. It’s not just about looking good anymore; it’s about wearing clothes that feel alive, adaptable, and utterly distinct. Think *Blade Runner* vibes but softened up for your morning coffee run. The focus is shifting from 'who are you wearing?' to 'how does this make you feel/act?'

Here are three actionable ways to get ahead of the curve now:

1.  **Invest in 'Liquid' Finishes:** Say goodbye to matte basics. Start incorporating fabrics with a sheen or a metallic tint. We’re talking liquid chrome bomber jackets or iridescent accessories that catch the light. It’s going to be huge.
2.  **Embrace Modular & Transformable Pieces:** 2026 is about utility that looks cool. Look for items that can change shape—detachable sleeves on blazers, reversible coats, or trousers with zip-off hems. It’s the ultimate answer to sustainable fashion.
3.  **Sculptural Silhouettes are Back:** Ditch the skin-tight fit. The new power move is volume. Think puffer sleeves, exaggerated collars, and shoes that look like architectural sculptures. Balance is key here—keep the volume on top and slim on the bottom (or vice versa).

I’m personally eyeing a metallic windbreaker for the spring transition.

Chapter 1

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

The original outlet opened in 2002 and has now returned as Starbucks Reserve Plaza Indonesia, relocated to the mall’s basement level due to tenant reconfiguration. The updated store is about 311 sqm, seats around 101 guests, and features design elements inspired by Sumatra and Indonesian coffee origins.

It’s positioned as a symbolic “mother store” rather than a standard rollout location.

Hi there! I want to redesign my shared room.

It is below ground, so the window is high and doesn't let much light in.

The door on the bottom left represents double closet doors.

On the long wall on the left, there is a 6"" ledge about 2ft off the ground, so if something is pushed against the wall, there is a gap after 2ft

I am looking at getting a king-sized bed and different TV stand, and 2 person desk.

Our TV is 75"" on a 2x4 kalax

The couch is L-shaped but not as large as the mockup

The coffee table is rectangular and fits within the L of the couch

I’m 5’11, fair-complexioned, and currently at a point where I’m not looking for a ""forever"" commitment, but I’m definitely missing that spark of connection. I’m looking for something casual, but with a lot of heart.
I love a good deep dive. Whether it’s about life, weird theories, or just how our days went, I want to actually know you.
I’m big on romance and cuddles. If we’re hanging out, I want it to feel warm and comfortable.
I love random meetups. Whether it’s a last-minute coffee, a walk, or just grabbing food because we’re both bored, I’m down.
A bit about me: I’m easygoing, a good listener, and I value chemistry above everything else. I believe the best ""casual"" relationships are the ones where you actually enjoy each other's company as much as the physical side.
If you’re looking for someone to relax with. You want the perks of romance and intimacy without the heavy ""where is this going?"" talk right away. You’re down for a slow burn and see where things lead.

1qjmqd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/1qjmqd5/revshare_ui_artist_needed_for_cozy_lifesim/,[RevShare] UI Artist needed for cozy life-sim cooking game,"Hi everyone!

My name is Margaux I live in Japan and I'm the designer and creator of Galaxy Chef, a solo life-sim cooking game set in a solarpunk sci-fi world.

In Galaxy Chef, players live their lives in a small community managing the local restaurant. The core feature of the game is a data-driven in-depth cooking system which allows the player to substitute any ingredient in any recipe.

I was inspired by games like Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Sandrock, Overcooked and Coffee Talk to just name a few.

[Feel free to check out our pitch document here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYPP60CRqlUNQEaORK7brK1jwyTZwTcx/view?usp=sharing) (it's outdates but will give a decent idea of our direction)

Currently there are two of us working full-time on the project, myself (game design generalist) and Arkadi (programer). I've hired 2 part-time 2D artists to help with concepts.

I've been working on the design document for over a year and we are putting together a vertical slice (aiming for late-February or early-March) to look into getting investors/editors to help us fund this game so everyone on the team can live from this project.

What you’ll do:

* Design game UI: menus, HUDs, icons, buttons, panels, etc.
* Create inventory, cooking, and progression screens
* Help define a cohesive UI style that matches the game’s art direction
* Work closely with designers, programmers, and artists
* Iterate based on playtests and feedback
* Prep UI assets for engine implementation (Unreal)

What we’re looking for:

* A solid portfolio with game UI or interactive UI work
* Strong visual design skills (layout, color, type, icons)
* Experience making UI for games or interactive projects
* Ability to balance style with clarity and usability
* Comfortable collaborating and iterating
* Familiar with tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, etc.

I don't have a lot of budget and would prefer revshare (% TBD) or retroactive pay. If you'd rather do contract work, please send me your rate.

The team is diverse. It is comprised of myself from France (designer, project lead), Arkadi (co-founder and programer) from Russia, an environment artist from Brazil and a character concept artist from Malaysia.

If that sounds exciting to you, please reach out!

Please send:  
\- A link to your LinkedIn or resume  
\- A link to your portfolio  
\- A short introduction and why the project interests you

If you sound like AI, I will ignore you. We do not use AI so I'm expecting the same of you.

1qjmlhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qjmlhy/baseline_recipe/,Baseline recipe,"Is there such thing as a baseline recipe for pourover to dial a coffee and guidelines on variables to change to achieve a different outcome? 

For example, in the word of espresso, the baseline recipe to dial grind size is: 1:2 ratio over 30 seconds extraction and once you get there you adjust:

 \- too sour => increase yield

 \- too bitter => decrease yield

Once balanced, fine tune with temperature and experiment with pressure profiles for achieving different results. 

Here is what I have for pourover using a V69 so far:

 \- 1:15 ratio

 \- 3x dry dose of water to bloom for 45 seconds

This is as far as I go, here are my questions:

 \- When to adjust bloom time? How?

 \- How many pours after bloom? 1, 2, 3?

 \- How to pour?

Rate: slow or fast;

Height: close to the bed or high

Spiral: how wide? Stay close to the center or medium, or as wide as where the water reaches?

  \- other?

In my mind, once you achieve consistency with that basic recipe; then you can adjust things to achieve different results. But if you do… what do you change first, why? What  is the expected outcome? What do you change after? What is the difference between dialing and calling experimenting?

If your weight is stuck for less than 3 weeks, it's not officially a plateau. Observe for a couple more weeks.

If you're still on 2.5mg dose, it's still a loading dose. Majority of the people in the trials don't lose weight at 2.5mg.

If your supplier did not test their on-hand product and only provides ""manuf COA"", there's a possibility that your vial is degraded or bunk. [Read more here](https://peptideguidesph.github.io/coa/#the-risks-of-not-getting-own-coa)

If you feel less appetite and less cravings, **please do your part and eat less.**

If you are not exercising, adding a little bit of movement can help boost your metabolism.

If you are not counting your calories, start now. You need to track your calories to make sure you are eating less. Do not underestimate calorie-rich food like coffee drinks, palabok, mayonnaise.

**What can you do?**

* Review your lifestyle. Add movement and start calorie tracking
* Increase your dose. There is nothing wrong increasing your dose. That's what the inventor of tirzepatide, designed for. It's safe, it's studied. Don't be scared to increase your dose.
* No need to add cagrilintide unless you are taking 15mg weekly.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 2nd, 2137*

For a brief moment after I woke up, I wondered if I was in Larzo’s apartment again. Both fortunately and unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.

At least the couch I was on was somehow more comfortable than Larzo’s. Acetli had excellent taste. The cushions seemed to envelop me in the coziest way possible without me sinking in. It had to be something unique to Venlil furniture.

I sat up and stretched, pushing off a blanket and noting a head-shaped dent in a pillow. Those weren’t there when I’d fallen asleep. I didn’t even remember falling asleep.

“You’re finally awake,” Acetli called out. She was in the kitchen.

“What time is it?” I asked, uneager to repeat past mistakes.

“Don’t worry,” she said, “we still have half a claw before we need to leave. I’m paying for your bus fare this time before any *issues* can arise.”

“I don’t suppose I can argue against that?”

“Nope.”

I checked my satchel. Nothing within had changed, of course, but it gave my paws something to do. I knew I didn’t belong here, in more ways than one, but the less I thought about that, the better.

“Feel free to shower,” Acetli suggested in a friendly tone, before her ears wilted. “N-Not that you smell in any particular way! I just thought I’d, uh, offer… A completely, totally, judgement-free offer.”

I thought of a few different responses (most involving a quip about my superior sense of smell), but I truthfully didn’t have it in me to refuse. “Thank you.”

The shampoo she had carried a unique scent. It was familiar enough to make me think of my home planet, while being very distinctly its own. Like an odd mix between silver flowers and esprans, and less earthy. It made me feel… comfortable.

The blow dryer, as advertised, took a while to warm up. Once it was warm, however, the hot air felt like the most blissful sort of sunshine. It was quite possibly the best thing to happen to me since getting hired.

I emerged, feeling pretty great aside from a gnawing hunger. Acetli was sitting at the kitchen bar, watching a video on her pad. I heard vague things about “transformers” and “Gaussian modifiers” but didn’t really understand it.

Her ears perked up once I entered and she paused her video. “Feeling better?”

“Very,” I said, making the understatement of the century. “Although I am curious about how you choose your shampoo.”

She looked offended. “I pick whatever smells good.”

I couldn’t tell if she was joking or not. “Oh. That makes sense.”

My grudging roommate went into the kitchen and produced a bowl filled to the brim with what I assumed was the soup I missed out on by falling asleep. She slid it onto the kitchen bar. “I’m sure you’re hungry. I warmed it up while you were showering.”

I took a seat, figuring there wasn’t much point in arguing against it with her. The soup, to Acetli’s credit, looked amazing. I took a timid bite. With perhaps the exception of Perzel’s warm strayu, it was the best thing I’d eaten in a very long time.

She took a seat next to me, and cocked a questioning ear.

“It’s edible,” I offered.

“Ha-ha,” she sarcastically said, bouncing her head. “It’s better than a granola bar, I know that much.”

“Thank you.” I took another, fuller bite. “And you only half-answered my first question, how long did I sleep?”

“Almost two whole claws. You were *out of it*. Do Yotul usually sleep that long?”

“Not usually.” I took several more bites. “So… since I’m still here, I take it I didn’t bite you in my sleep?”

“Fortunately not,” she laughed. I took a few more bites while she made herself busy by tapping at her pad. After another moment, she pointed her ears towards me. “Okay, I was thinking… Now that we’re here, and neither of us are tired or hungry, can we start over?”

I didn’t see the point, but thought I’d entertain her. “Sure.”

She sighed with relief. “Good. I want to apologize for assuming you were a cleaner, earlier. I just sort of… led myself into believing that. I’m sure you understand why.”

I ignored her last point with practiced ease, and wiggled my ears. “I’ve heard worse. And I’d make a pretty good cleaner anyways. I have plenty of experience cleaning up messes in the lab.”

She didn’t seem amused. “What do you mean, you’ve heard worse?”

I made a mental note to choose my words more carefully around Acetli. I chewed on a bite before I spoke. “It’s probably exactly what you’re thinking.”

“…People like the bus driver?”

“More or less.” I shrugged my ears.

She folded her arms, appearing upset. A minute passed.

“So this was a one time thing, right?” I asked in between bites. “I truly do appreciate what you’ve done, but I’d feel bad if I accepted any more from you. Nor do I even need it, really.”

Acetli straightened her posture. “Where were you sleeping between now and when you were evicted?”

“It was a finely decorated public establishment populated with many faces familiar to me.”

She took my bent truth and unbent it. “But not a bed.”

I groaned internally, having forgotten I’d told her that last paw. “Beds are overrated.”

She scoffed. “Yeah, that only confirms my decision. You’re not going anywhere until I have proof you have your own place.”

“I feel like you’re taking away a very critical part of my personal autonomy.”

She considered that for a moment. “Even if I *am*—which I would never do—it’s for your own good. And I hope this next part can make it through your stubborn ears: it’s not a burden to me at all.”

I considered that, barely. For all the terrible things the universe had put me through and how pathetically useless I was at doing anything about it, at least I wasn't a burden to this righteous Venlil. So I had that going for me.

I reached into the bowl again, but my utensil hit the bottom with a disappointing *clink*. I got out of my seat, rinsed out my bowl, and found a spot in the dishwasher for it.

“Is it too much to ask why exactly you’re so intent on refusing my help?” Acetli asked.

“No, I think that’d be a pretty reasonable thing to ask,” I answered. She sighed, frustrated. But before she could respond, I pointed out an interesting thing I’d noticed in her apartment. “You have a suspiciously Dossur-sized rectangle of tape on your wall.”

“What?”

“It’s covering up a hole, right? I only bring it up because my old landlord had a problem with Dossur living in his walls.”

“…What?”

I shrugged my ears. “I don’t know. I wish I had more time to ask him about it.”

She seemed troubled by the possibility, then shook herself. “It's from when I needed to repair Stocine’s outlet. There’s no Dossur living in my walls. Are you going to answer my question?”

“It’s because I don’t need your help. Respectfully.”

“Don’t need it? Or don’t *want* it?”

“Why not both?”

“Stars, Celso, could you open up just a *little* bit? You’ve slept in my home and eaten my food, I feel like I’m due at least a little more than this.”

“Open up…” I repeated. I walked over to my satchel, making my paws busy. “Um, okay. I just have a hard time with people who think the highest position I can achieve in a research facility is *cleaner*. It’s nothing personal, I promise.”

“How is that *not* personal?” she said, aghast. “And I thought we were starting over! I apologized!”

“This is starting over,” I answered sincerely. “I’m treating you like I would anyone else. Just like you would let anyone else stay in your home… right?”

“I really doubt that.”

“Remember the bus driver?”

“What— I’m *nothing like* that guy!”

She was so close but so far, as so many people always were. I shrugged my ears in response and took inventory of my satchel.

“I didn’t think you were a cleaner because of what planet you came from. It was because—and only because—you were staying late and ‘cleaning up’ the leftovers that Doctor Scheele brought that one time.”

“I thought rule number one of your home was no lying.”

Her ears drooped. “Fine. There was a little, *tiny* part of my assumption that came from the otherwise completely inconsequential fact that you’re an uplift. There. Are you happy you made me say that?”

“About the same. Although I appreciate that you attempted to spare my feelings.”

Her tail flicked with indignation. “And I guess it’s *also* too much to ask for you to afford me the same luxury.”

My ears wilted. I opened my mouth to apologize, but she silenced me before I could even get a word out.

“We have to leave for the bus shortly. There are snacks in the kitchen if you care to look.” She got up from her seat, and shot me a final ear gesture. “You’re not making this easy on either of us.”

She disappeared. With a rightfully self-deprecating sigh, I rested my face in my paws.

I didn’t deserve any of this. Worse still, I couldn’t bring myself to even pretend that I did, despite how much I *needed to*. I was rested and fed because of Acetli’s (admittedly strange form of) kindness. I was split between wanting to oppose her for forcing all of this on me and… appreciating her for forcing all of this on me. I wondered if this is what Receor had in mind when she offered me help.

Everything was so wrong in so many ways, I actually found it kind of amusing.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 2nd, 2137*

My back hurt when I woke up. It was far from the first time it’d happened, but it still made a miserable routine. Outside of physical pain, I felt great. Bemlin was a pretty good drinking buddy.

I had helped clean Bemlin’s apartment of all the confetti once I was done picking it from his spines. Then we drank and ate some more and called it a night. A weird, sunset-night that made me question if I’d actually just celebrated New Years.

I grabbed a container of leftover cookies and walked with Bemlin, who nabbed two of them. We arrived at the facility early. There must’ve been something going on, as there were about 900% more Venlil in the lobby area than the usual two receptionists. What wasn’t unusual was how they all stopped talking and tilted their ears to me as soon as I was in sight.

I recognized a few of them. Rosim was there, along with Hastum and a few others that had attended my first presentation a week ago. There was even that guy that asked me for a strand of my hair.

The spotted Venlil approached me and Bemlin. Hastum was close behind Rosim, his frosted black ears twitching nervously.

“Good morning,” Bemlin said.

“…Morning. Sure,” Rosim awkwardly replied. The others in the lobby seemed to resume the conversations, apparently satisfied that I’d sink my teeth into Rosim first and leave the rest to escape.

“Would you like any food?” Hastum offered. “The starberries are delightfully fresh.”

I glanced over. The purpose of the gathering indeed seemed to be food, of which there was an assortment of weird alien… things. I almost recognized a few fruits. Or maybe vegetables; it was hard to tell (and taxonomically classify, for that matter).

“We will not require any, though the offer is appreciated,” Bemlin answered. “We have cookies. They are delightful and are made with both love and principles of chemistry.”

Rosim’s ear twitched.

“Scheele,” Hastum said rather directly, “I’d like to follow up on our last conversation. You said you would contact someone you believe would help us incorporate humans into the study. How is that faring?”

“What?” I blurted. I didn’t really remember when we talked last. “Oh… Not at all, sorry. I think I had part of an email drafted but I got distracted. But it’s not a huge deal, she’ll actually be here in person in a few days. You can ask her directly then.”

Their expressions wilted. Rosim said, “Oh… right. There are more humans due to arrive, aren’t there?”

Bemlin waved a claw. “Within a few paws. They will perhaps give you another outlet for research queries.”

I cocked an eyebrow at Bemlin, but as usual, I couldn’t gleam anything. He almost sounded… slightly miffed? But I had no idea why. I was probably imagining it.

Rosim’s ears nervously bounced between me and the Gojid. “Y-Yes, uh, perhaps. Uh, Scheele, may I ask you a question?”

“Sure. I’ve got time for one or two.”

“Well, uh, it was about human genome datasets. I mean no offense by this, but they appear extremely lacking.”

I frowned, not understanding. “…Okay? What’s the question?”

“What Rosim is saying,” Hastum blurted, “is that there are no datasets that contain a suitable number of genomes for our purposes.”

I found that incredibly hard to believe. “Can you be more specific? I’m almost positive there’s something you can use.”

“Where do I begin? Aside from the fact that there’s nearly no sets that contain half a billion genomes, the ones that we were able to locate apparently only represent specific, regional subsets of the human species. It’s incredibly confusing and unnecessary.”

While my mouth hung open, unknowing where *I* should begin, Rosim quietly added, “And we would appreciate it immensely if you could point us to the commonly used, *acceptably large*, dataset representative of the whole human race.”

Their ears eagerly remained fixated on me while I stumbled for a response. “Um. Well. To start, I can understand why it would seem confusing, but it’s definitely not *unnecessary*. Briefly, different populations on Earth can be vulnerable to different diseases, so it’s important that one group of closely related genomes isn’t getting more attention and therefore causing us to draw conclusions that don’t apply to everyone.”

“Then what? Should we be expected to run analysis for all these different sets as though they were different species?” Hastum said.

I winced at his choice of words. “No. Those datasets exist for various purposes and are *not* meant to— Look, you could probably use any of them and be fine for your purposes. But what do you mean, ‘acceptably large’?”

“*Any of them?*” Hastum said, dumbfounded. “Why do they exist if we aren’t meant to use them?”

“They weren’t made with a galaxy-spanning scandal in mind. It’d be pretty standard for any respectable genomic study to include at least a few different regions to source their genomes from, either for finding exceptions to a trend or whatever else.”

“How diverse can the human species possibly be to warrant such minutiae?”

Bemlin spoke up, “Enough such that it was meaningfully included in their research. I believe it has to do with humanity’s unaided rise to interstellar capability.”

“Do you all not have something similar?” I asked. “What if you wanted to, say, compare Venlil originating from nightward versus dayward? Or something with other species and planets?”

Hastum replied, “There’d hardly be anything interesting in *genomic* data. Transcriptomic and proteomic, perhaps, but why would anyone look at DNA that’s only largely affected by inheritance?”

“A hundred different reasons. Genetic drift. Gene flow. The bottleneck effect is probably high up there.”

The Venlil exchanged glances like I was speaking gibberish. “The bottleneck effect?”

“Do you not—” I stammered, too befuddled to truly consider an answer to the old Venlil’s question. “I feel like I’d have to read a textbook on Venlilian population genetics or something to truly understand this… *culture clash* or whatever’s happening. I don’t know. But regardless, you could pick probably any human genome dataset and it’d work great for your purposes.”

“Uh, well,” Rosim began, “putting all that aside, the datasets are not *large* enough to use in our study. None that we’ve found, at least.”

I shook my head. “Could you really not find one? How big could you possibly need?”

“We searched quite extensively!” he quickly explained. “Hastum especially searched everything he could. But, uh…”

“You humans are hiding data from us,” the old Venlil flatly said. “I have no idea what the purpose of that ‘firewall’ is, but I have little doubt it’s the cause of our chagrin.”

At that absurd accusation, I finally came to the conclusion that I needed at least two full cups of coffee in order to deal with what was quickly becoming an interrogation.

“That is an interesting assumption to say the least,” Bemlin calmly stated.

Hastum’s ears lowered. Before he could spew whatever he was thinking, I quickly said, “Tell you what, I’ll take some time and find the biggest dataset that *I* can find. I’ll make a note and have it to you by the end of today. Er, *this paw*.” I took out my pad and jotted down a note to prove my point.

“T-Thank you, Doctor Scheele,” Rosim sputtered, ears darting around nervously. I noticed that conversations were hushed and many more ears were directed at us than before. “I— We know how busy you likely are with your research. We appreciate you taking the time to assist.”

“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “Bemlin and I should probably be getting to work, then.”

Hastum regarded me. “Very well. Good paw to you.”

The room got notably louder as Bemlin and I left for the elevator.

“What was that about?” I asked as the door slid shut. “If anything?”

“What do you mean?” Bemlin asked.

“They seemed… passionate about things.”

“They have dedicated their careers to research. I believe they ought to be passionate.” Bemlin looked at me with analytical eyes. “Although, I might say that Hastum seemed quite quick to target you as the source of his issues.”

I was reminded of Bemlin and Rosim’s exchange, early in the conversation. “Did you and Rosim talk?” I asked him, stepping out of the elevator.

“Yes.”

“…Well? What about?”

He waved a bored, or possibly annoyed claw. “He pulled me aside and we spoke about my research. He had many questions regarding the ‘predator I worked with’ and why I believed in the work we are undertaking.”

I frowned beneath my mask. His tone always made it hard to say for sure how he felt, but I could guess. “Was it… not a good conversation?”

“It was as pleasant as it could be. He reminds me of someone I used to work with. Now, we ought to get to work.”

My frown only deepened. I rarely pried when Bemlin gave a vague answer like that, but his response could’ve carried a hundred different implications, or none at all.

I gave my cookies a spot in the work room and ran through the conversation in my head a few times while I made coffee. I could probably excuse the two Venlil’s restlessness as common research woes, but it still felt… off, somehow. It probably didn’t help that they’d probably tried to email me. Plus I’d blown off connecting them to another researcher.

And I still wasn’t sure what they meant by getting a “large enough” human genome database.

I didn’t have much time to ponder it, though. A Venlil with one white arm walked inside the work room, unpredictably followed by a Yotul.

I’m a 25-year-old woman planning a trip to PR and would love some local insight. I’ll be arriving this Friday, escaping a snowstorm in NYC.

My goal is to experience the island as a local rather than a tourist, so I’d really appreciate recommendations from people who live there or know the city well.

I’m looking for advice on:

\-Safe areas to stay and spend time, especially for a woman traveling solo

\-How safe it is to explore on my own, walking around during the day and evenings

\-Best bars and nightlife where it’s easy to meet people (locals and travelers)

\-Good areas for walking, coffee, food, and everyday life

\-Remote-work friendly spots with reliable Wi-Fi during weekdays

I love reggaeton and would love to experience good music, energy, and authentic spots rather than overly touristy places.

I’m also planning day trips to Culebra and Fajardo, but I won’t be renting a car, so any tips on getting around, ferries, tours, or Ubers would be really appreciated.

Normally, and for the last two years it's been pretty mild. Most of my symptoms were type 2, pustles etc that I treated with topical meds. Rarely did I experience the ""internal"" flushing, when my face gets hot and red from within. I could never identify certain triggers either tbh, I could eat spicy food, drink coffee for example with no issues that I could link to inflammation. Well for over a week now, and out of nowhere I've been dealing with constant internal flushing in my face. It's incredibly frustrating and uncomfortable. I'm guessing there is something going on in my body and it's just freaking out but I have no idea why. The only thing that has changed is I took a short break from my glp-1 back around November, and had to start over at a much lower dose. That was so long ago though. I don't know how to approach this at all, since it was never a huge issue for me. Thanks!",3,1769060055.0,Rosacea,0,1.0,False
1qjm43o,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1qjm43o/low_tyramine_diet_working/,Low Tyramine diet working,"I started a low tyramine diet. My Doctor advised me to try staying away from certain trigger foods which led me to try a Low tyramine diet. It's working. I get maybe 2 migraines a month now. less severe. They respond better to my meds. Taking ubrelvy. I feel so much better. Different in a good way. I was getting several a week. 

What is a low tyramine diet? Basically I don't eat food high in tyramine. There are lists online. It's mainly old food. Yep, old food. Gotta eat fresh or fresh frozen.

No left overs. Nothing left sitting out at room temperature too long. No over ripe bananas. Nothing aged: salami, cheese, yogurt, etc. No wine. Nothing fermented. No coffee, tea or chocolate. The list is long. I now immediately freeze any food I cook that I don't eat right away. So far canned food has been ok. I look for frozen meat at the store, especially frozen turkey because it is less than half the price of ground beef.

To add a layer of confusion, the Internet claims it can take up to 22 hours for tyramine to give a migraine. I loosely track what I eat and the migraines. It can be hard to tell if a food or beverage was the specific trigger with a 22 hour span to look at. I also suspect hormones part of the time.

I used to have a pain/tension on the back right side of my skull at the base all the time. It's gone. Comes back when I get a migraine.

Tyramine triggered migraines can be genetic. My mom had migraines. Her dad had migraines. It's possible my DNA just does not allow my body to handle tyramine well. Potentially not enough MAO in my system. I'm going to check with my doctor if it can be tested. I would like to know.",5,1769060034.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

Then I had a mindset shift:
I stopped thinking like a candidate — and started thinking like a hiring manager.

From that point on, I had one clear goal in every interview: Go beyond their expectations.

Here are the 2 tips that actually made a difference for me 👇

1. The moment you get an interview — connect with alumni

This is hands down the fastest way to understand a company in a short amount of time.

Don’t jump straight into “Can we do a coffee chat?” Instead:
- Ask about their interview process
- Ask what they personally like most about the company
- Be genuine — sincerity is OP in networking

2. Show you’ve done your homework during the interview

Not just technically — culturally and strategically.

What worked for me:
- Be proactive during small talk (don’t just wait for questions
- Make it obvious you prepared specifically for this company
- Before the interview, prepare 1–2 stories that clearly connect:
	•	company culture
	•	business direction
	•	your personality & past experience

This helps HR/HM feel like you’re already “one of them.”

1qjlw54,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridayNightFunkinMod/comments/1qjlw54/mitolyn_reviews_2026_tried_for_365_days_my_honest/,MITOLYN Reviews 2026 (Tried for 365 Days) My Honest Review!,"For years, I’d been searching for *something*—anything—that could give me real, lasting energy without the inevitable crash. I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s **official website**, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1769059358.0,FridayNightFunkinMod,0,1.0,False

Logging helped, but it took a while to find what worked.

Even then, it felt like trying to debug a black box. Cause and effect, etc... Especially being undiagnosed neurodivergent.

I’m a software engineer - so I built a small biological simulation engine.

Rather than logging “coffee → energized,” the model represents caffeine pharmacokinetics (absorption, clearance, adenosine antagonism) and propagates those effects into sleep pressure, circadian load, and next-day energy.

Similar simplified models exist for food intake, exercise, sleep timing, temperature exposure, supplements, prescriptions, stress. Everything runs forward in time and produces internal state estimates (energy, sleep pressure, motivation/dopamine proxy, autonomic load, and like 30 other biomarkers/signals.)

I’m trying to evaluate whether the simulations are directionally correct when compared against other peoples experiences and data.

I’m hoping to find a few analytically minded users (especially Oura / Whoop / Levels users) who are willing to sanity-check assumptions and point out where the model breaks or has gaps.

1qjltfy,https://i.redd.it/41qptvt05ueg1.jpeg,The hunt for Spice,"Jabooty Crocker—born Jeremiah ""Jabo"" Crocker in a sleepy Midwestern suburb—was once just another mild-mannered actuary crunching numbers in a beige cubicle, dreaming of excitement beyond spreadsheets and 401(k) projections. That all changed in his mid-30s during a solo trip to Miami for a ""self-improvement"" conference that was really just an excuse to escape his routine life of khakis and Lean Cuisine.

There, under the neon glow of South Beach, he had an epiphany: life needed spice. And in his mind, nothing embodied that fiery, vibrant energy more than Latinas—the curves, the confidence, the rhythm in every step, the way they seemed to command attention without even trying. He coined his personal mantra: ""Spice up your life, or die bland."" He even got a tiny tattoo of a chili pepper on his ankle (hidden under socks, of course).

But Jabooty didn't stop at admiration. Obsession took root fast. He started curating ""inspiration boards"" (what he called them; the rest of the world would call them creepy collages) of Instagram models, telenovela stars, and random women he spotted at the local taqueria. He learned broken Spanglish phrases from Duolingo streaks that lasted exactly 47 days before he rage-quit over irregular verbs. He bought a fedora (tan, naturally) because he thought it made him look ""worldly."" He practiced dramatic poses in his bedroom mirror—arms wide, head thrown back, lips pursed in what he imagined was seductive intensity—to prepare for the moment fate would deliver his ""spicy soulmate.""

The stalking phase kicked in when rejection hit. First it was polite DMs: ""Hola hermosa, your energy is fuego 🔥 Would love to discuss life over cafecito?"" Blocked. Then came the alt accounts: ""Just a fan of your vibe, no pressure!"" Still blocked. He couldn't fathom ""no"" as final—it was clearly a test of his persistence, right? He showed up at the same coffee shop every Tuesday at 2:17 PM (he'd calculated her schedule from geotags), pretending it was coincidence. He'd linger too long at the gym, offering unsolicited ""tips"" on form while staring a little too hard. When women changed gyms, unfollowed, or straight-up moved apartments, he'd sigh dramatically and mutter, ""Another one who doesn't get it yet.""

His lore grew in dark corners of niche forums and old group chats where people shared ""cursed dating stories."" They called him Jabooty because of his infamous fixation on ""that perfect jabooty"" (old-school slang for a legendary backside), and Crocker because—like Betty—he seemed wholesome on the surface but was baking something deeply unhinged underneath.

Key chapters in the Jabooty saga:

The Great Miami Migration of '19 — He quit his job, sold his condo, and relocated to Phoenix (close enough to the border vibes, he claimed) to ""start fresh."" The dramatic photo you shared? That's from his ""new era"" photoshoot in an abandoned warehouse he found on Craigslist—captioned ""Embracing the spice within 🌶️✨ No more playing small.""

The Taqueria Takedown — A legendary incident where he tried to ""serenade"" a group of friends with a poorly translated reggaeton verse outside their favorite spot. Ended with salsa dumped on his jacket and a lifetime ban.

The Eternal Pursuit — To this day, he maintains burner profiles, lurks in Latin dance classes (never actually dancing, just ""observing""), and keeps a running Google Doc titled ""Spice Levels: Potential Connections."" He still can't take no for an answer—every rejection is reframed as ""she's just not ready for this level of passion yet.""

Jabooty Crocker isn't a villain in a true-crime podcast (yet). He's the tragicomic cautionary tale of a man who mistook exoticism for connection, persistence for romance, and delusion for destiny. Somewhere out there, he's probably practicing his pose again, waiting for the one who'll finally say yes to his brand of chaos.

**The problem I had:** Spent 6 months trying to research testosterone optimization after my doctor dismissed my symptoms as ""normal range."" Every expert contradicts the next - one says coffee boosts T, another says it destroys it. Same with supplements, training, everything. I wasted $3k on random supplements and still had no clarity.

**What I built:** An AI that resolves contradictory health research and gives clear verdicts instead of ""it depends.""

Built on [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) using Claude API. Basically:

* User asks question (e.g., ""does zinc actually work?"")
* AI synthesizes research, shows both sides of contradictions
* Gives evidence-based verdict with specific action plan
* Plain English, no jargon

**Try it:** [https://trymarble.lovable.app/](https://trymarble.lovable.app/)

**Honest feedback wanted:**

1. Is the ""contradiction resolver"" angle clear, or does it just feel like ChatGPT?
2. Does the answer format actually help, or is it overwhelming?
3. Would you pay $14/month for unlimited questions + personalized protocols, or is this just a nice-to-have?
4. Any technical feedback? (First time using Lovable + Claude API)

**Current issues I know about:**

* Only works well for testosterone-related questions (training, supplements, lifestyle)
* Answer quality varies depending on how question is phrased
* Mobile formatting needs work

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely trying to figure out if this solves a real problem or if I'm just solving my own problem.

Thanks for any feedback! 🙏

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**The Office White Elephant Gift Exchange Should Not be Mandatory**

**Originally posted to r/pettyrevenge**

**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/s/8C0c0CpGFz)  **Dec 17, 2025**

I **hate** “white elephant” office gift exchanges.

Every year, our team joins/competes with two other groups on our floor. Participation isn't mandatory, but there's a distinct message of ""everyone is expected to be a part of this team-building exercise"".

The combined group is large enough so anyone can add a gift anonymously. For the past few years, I have been secretly sabotaging the exchange in the hopes we’ll switch to “Secret Santa” so I can opt out.

My petty revenge: every year, I contribute a “nice” gift obviously from me, along with one or two anonymously-given “bad” gifts. Every year I get a little bolder and go a little farther. Here's what I’ve contributed for the past few years:

2021: I put a potato inside an iPhone box and shrink-wrapped it. 

2022: A Bible from a used bookstore, a toy American flag, and a red MAGA hat I found in a parking lot. The next day HR sent an office-wide email about politics in the workplace.

2023: Toy handcuffs, a cheap eye mask, and a cat toy I modified to look like a riding crop. The next day HR sent another office-wide email.

2024: A bottle of Robitussin, a bottle of Night Train, and a copy of the National Enquirer.

Our white elephant exchange is next week. I’m thinking about giving a carton of cigarettes and a set of fake eyelashes.

Edited to add:

*> Will you come back and update us? I want to hear what you choose, and what the reaction is*

Yes. I wasn't expecting this to be so popular! I'm glad to know I'm not alone in my hatred for team-building exercises and white elephant exchanges, especially when they're not mandatory but you can't decline to participate. I've found my people! Thank you.

The Office White Elephant Gift Exchange Should Not be Mandatory: Update

You all wanted to know what happened, so here it is.

[First, some background.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ppchdh/the_office_white_elephant_gift_exchange_should/) Every year, my company has a ""white elephant"" gift exchange. Participation isn't mandatory, but the message is clear: the exchange is a team-building exercise and everyone is expected to participate.

Well, I **hate** office gift exchanges and mandatory team-building exercises. For the past several years I’ve been quietly sabotaging the gift exchange with “bad” gifts. To deflect suspicion, I always give a “nice” gift. This year, I gave a $25 gift certificate to the local coffee house.

My roommate and I have been calling the project “Santa, or Satan?” For my “bad” gift, I found a used DVD at a thrift store and I immediately knew what I had to do. I then went to a market and got the other part of the gift. I wrapped up everything, and slipped my gifts into the pile a few hours before the party.

The gift exchange was boring and unremarkable: a cookbook, a stainless-steel travel mug, and a lot of gift cards. Then someone opened another “bad” gift: a coffee mug with our competitor’s logo on it! The competitor’s mug got a lot of laughs and I was a little jealous I hadn’t thought of it. But then someone opened the “bad” gift I submitted for Holiday Party 2025: 

A DVD of *Babe* and a jar of pickled pigs’ feet.

Reactions were mixed. Many people laughed, others were disgusted. Surprisingly, HR did not send any emails, so I congratulated myself on a job well done until next year.

Our office lacks a sink, making cleanup difficult. People don't want to deal with wet filters or grounds. This mess led everyone back to the Keurig. We tried Chemex, batching in Takeya pitchers, and bottled coffee, then we had a Brezi unit. The cleanup is simple: swap the bag, rinse the container weekly. 



In a shared, under-equipped space, the coffee that gets made consistently beats the coffee that tastes better but requires effort. This is also why instant packets are kept. Similarly, complex tea sets gave way to easy-to-rinse infuser mugs, and a thermos is used more than the electric kettle.

Eventually after my resistance to marriage (now also because of the hitting and verbal abuse) she decided we shouldn’t be sleeping together. We are both Christian’s who have had sexual relationships in the past but now suddenly she’s got Christian values. So we stopped having sex and the relationship got even more distant and chaotic.

As your self-improvement expert, I want to talk about the stage that terrifies almost everyone: the **Undefined Phase**.

This isn't just feeling 'a little lost.' This is when the framework of your life—your routine, your identity, your career path, or even your core relationships—has dissolved. You’ve let go of the old definition, but the new one is nowhere in sight. You’re floating in a vast, empty canvas, and the pressure to paint the entire masterpiece *right now* is paralyzing.

We often fall into the trap of thinking we need to define the 'Big Things' first (Purpose, 5-Year Plan, Soulmate). But when everything is undefined, aiming for macro definitions results in inaction.

**The Practical Shift: Define Your Now, Not Your Future.**

To move forward, we don't need a grand blueprint; we need a single, non-negotiable point of contact—a **Tiny Anchor**.

A Tiny Anchor is the smallest possible definition you intentionally set for yourself today. It’s a definition that creates immediate structure in the chaos, allowing you to build the next definition on top of it. It doesn’t have to solve your problems, it just has to exist.

**Examples of Tiny Anchors:**

*   **Defining your start:** “I will define the first 30 minutes of my day by sitting outside with my coffee, no phone.”
*   **Defining your space:** “I will define this one desk drawer by clearing it entirely.”
*   **Defining a small limit:** “I will define my evening by turning off work email notifications at 6 PM sharp.”

These seemingly insignificant acts re-establish your sense of agency. You are defining *something*, and that definition pushes back against the shapelessness of the 'undefined.'

**My Question for the Community:**

If you have navigated a major transition (a career shift, moving cities, recovery, loss) and felt completely 'undefined,' what was the very first, smallest, most ridiculous **Tiny Anchor** you grabbed onto that gave you the necessary structure to build the next step? 

Let’s inspire each other with the power of micro-definition!",1,1769058057.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

The way I explain it to people without chronic pain is that if pain were on levels from 1 to 10, normal people are at most at a 2 or 3 from day to day where people with CP are at more like a 6. Like imagine stepping on a Lego or hitting your funny bone, that's a very brief but excruciating 8. It's like if you pulled a muscle and so there's pain and discomfort if you move it, but pretty much daily. Some days I am higher on the scale, rare blessed days I'm more a 4 or by some miracle lower.

Overall I am active and operate well. I do own canes but I only use them on days when I'm 7 or above. Such a day came this past Sunday.

On top of my full time job, I have a part time. Due to being physically and legally disabled, I had all the paperwork already filed with my job in case I ever need accommodations. I have a handicap marker on my license plate and the placard on my rear view mirror and the works.

I was recently moved to a location closer to my home. I love my new team. My boss Amy is really great. My colleague Casey and I get along okay but were the same position as assistant coordinators to Amy. The reason I was moved to that location was that it expanded and they needed more hands so they added me.

Casey has wanted a promotion for a long time and everyone knows it. I was pretty open that I don't. Lol any promotion from my position would be a full-time and...I already have a full-time job. I do *this* job to pad my savings and because I frankly like the job. Being busy also helps with my anxiety.

I mean Casey works hard but she also likes to talk over me or rush to take charge of something before I can when I clearly was getting to it. She then announces it. ""Oh I handled that for you, OP. Don't worry!"" And at first I was annoyed but over time I was like alright then, but you didn't have to. I talked to Amy about this. I want to pull my weight but it can be challenging and redundant when Casey is racing to beat me to it. The point was for us to split tasks evenly. Amy said she would talk to her and I don't know what came of that but things didn't really change much so I just accepted it.

So when I came in Monday with my cane, everyone had questions. I emailed Amy Sunday night so she knew but I tend to be private so what I told everyone else was that I have a condition and sometimes I need a cane but not always.

Amy accommodated me. She assigned me tasks that required little to no movement. I was very grateful and got everything done pretty early so I called over the radio if there was anything else I could do. Casey said no she's got it so I just handled admin stuff that's usually on the backburner. Literally replied with ""okay I'll tackle the admin list then"" and Casey said no she's got it but Amy followed that with a thank you to me and confirmation that this would be helpful.

I still needed my cane yesterday (Tuesday) and it was similar. I completed most of the admin to-dos and Amy was so relieved to have it done. She thanked me for coming in and doing all that instead of calling out. Casey made a comment that she could've helped but I said that's okay and thanked her for handling the more physical tasks.

We ended up walking to the parking lot together and she asked which car was mine so I pointed at it. Then she said ""so I know you're not disabled, by the way."" And I asked what she meant. She just repeated herself and said ""so no cane tomorrow, okay? I won't tell. Just no cane tomorrow.""

👀.

I stood there like *what the fuck*? But I was meeting my best friend and just left to make it on time. I met my BFF Joy at the bar and we had a wonderful time. I brought my cane but tbh I didn't always use it. For example, I didn't use it to walk from my table to the bar to request another drink or when I got up to hug Joy goodbye.

Today, when I woke up, my pain was higher than my normal so I took my cane along. I texted Amy that I have my cane but doing okay in small bursts so put me in Coach lol I was having a good time at my main job and didn't give Casey a thought.

I arrive at my part time job and Casey saw my cane and went red. I mean like the way I looked when the Eagles lost to the 49ers lol just SUPER MAD. I greeted everyone and she ignored me completely. We got our assignments and she snidely said to me ""Well can you handle that with your cane and all?"" In a tone that even made Amy turn to look at her like WTF. I said I can manage and thanked her for her concern and we went about our work. Once again she raced to beat me to things and saying over the radio ""don't strain yourself, OP, I did x-task or got y-done""

I was so confused until about an hour ago when we finished work she again walked with me to the parking lot but this time showed me a video. It was me. It was me at the bar last night with Joy. I was just like...um why do you have a video of me - that's weird. She says it's proof. I asked of what? And she said it's proof I'm not disabled as I acted so ""wounded all day at work"" but suddenly don't need my cane at a bar.

What???? I wanted to explain that that's just not how CP works. Like yes I can stand up to hug my friend or get up and walk 3 strides to order a new drink but I can't, for example, lean over and organize a bottom drawer without a chair to sit in. I wanted to explain the CP is just an umbrella and under it are a myriad of experiences and abilities and that honestly, if she had left my tasks alone, I'd have done them. She didn't give me the chance and said ""no cane tomorrow. I'm serious. Or I'm going to Chad"" (Chad is Amy's boss).

I said ""About what?"" But she was already walking away from me and just got in her car.

It's just weird. And oddly Chad would know this is bs because his boyfriend has CP too. I'm not so much worried about being ""found out"" or anything but it's just weird and I'm literally typing an email to Amy CCing Chad about this weird behavior because it's just odd. Am I crazy to want to preemptively explain this? I am anxious ans paranoid in general so I don't want to overreact or make things worse.

Edit: I sent the email and also thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy for feeling weirded out.

Also I will be simply blocking anyone who is saying this is fake. I don't have time for your bs to be frank.

I also texted Amy and Chad.

Edit 2: JESUS CHRYSLER DRIVING CHRIST that's a lot of notifications...

I'll edit to try to reply all here because there isn't enough coffee in the world...

It's morning and I'm still about at a 7 and it's cold today so even if I didn't want to bring my cane, I would have to. I texted ahead so Amy can start thinking about tasks today.

For some common themes I've noticed, yeah my pain scale Lego idea wasn't on scale. Stepping on a Lego was the funniest thing I could think of that hurts so I wanted to paint a picture. I wasn't making a clinical pain chart lol feel free to use your own theatre of the mind scenarios to help people without chronic pain have an idea of what it's like.

Also I don't understand the vague ""don't use the term CP"" comments sorry. In this post it means chronic pain. It's within that context 🤷‍♀️ sorry but I just don't get the issue here or of its upsetting...? Idk

Amy and Chad have both responded so we will see how today goes. Anyway this was my first break in my FT job so I have to get back to it.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Time for a chat with your supervisor and / or HR. Make sure you bring the receipts.

> **OOP:** The problem is that I don't have any other than what others have seen about her taking over my tasks. We were alone both times she confronted me in the parking lot and she showed me the video on her phone.

**Commenter 2:** This is actually insane behavior because what? Did we not learn about invisible disabilities? Or people who only need a wheelchair/cane sometimes and are ambitory users? This is actually insane work, who says that to someone? Especially when you’ve got the documentation to prove it. NOR OP. I hope you make a fool out of them because this is actually insane. I don’t know much about legal stuff but this seems like enough to take to HR if you have one. Seriously what is Casey on?

> **OOP:** Thank you I was really worried that my past trauma was causing me to blow this out of proportion so I was on the fence about it like maybe I'm just out of touch here.

**Commenter 3:** What the fuck!? NoR - you're *underreacting*

Info: how old are you both?? And what's the job?

> **OOP:** I'm 34 and she's 29.
> 
> The job is real specific but it has to do with the public school system. We have a lot to do with kids who struggle with specific subjects and help them in a way a tutor would but more fun if that makes sense.

**Commenter 4:** NOR - if anything you're underreacting to your coworker creating a hostile work environment. Does your workplace have an HR department?

> **OOP:** Not really HR issues are run through Chad's boss who is also basically the 2nd in command of the entire org

**Commenter 5:** She followed you to a bar to film you like a stalker. Let that sink in.

You need to go to Amy and Chad not to preemptively explain your situation but bc a coworker is so obsessed with your personal medical details she is stalking you, threatening to jeopardize your job and demanding you don’t use a mobility aid that you have proper documentation for (I.e. legal handicap placard). NOR.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FX46xyezf): **January 15, 2026 (next day)**

**AIO? My coworker took video of me outside of work to ""prove"" I'm not disabled - Update (Thursday)**

I was asked a lot to [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/vxAhYkRJHQ) when I got off work so here it is. 😬 Today was… weirdly quiet, which almost made it worse. Not sure what everyone knows but they at least know somethings up.

I wasn’t even in the same area as Casey during check-in and I have no clue when she actually arrived. I usuallysee her as our shifts are the same hours. Turns out she’d been assigned to the back office doing other tasks (hours reduced), while I was put at the admin booth at the entrance handling paperwork and spreadsheets (they definitely took advantage of because I’m good at it 🤣). So we didn’t cross paths at all at first.

I actually turned ona voice recorder app as soon as I got to work, just in case. I also added a shortcut on my phone so I can start recording quickly if I need to just in case. I didnt wanna be caught off-guardlike before. I did feel a little silly doing it, but I’d rather feel silly than unprepared, you know?

I didn’t see Casey until near the end of the shift, and even then it was barely a glimpse. She looked up, saw me, and immediately turned away. Like full on avoidance. It made my stomach drop. I just turned away and minded my business. Amy was very reassuring but also vague at first. I didn't like that and I think my face said so and she said she doesn't like all the red tape and such either but to be patient because they need to go through all the right channels and steps.

Amy let me go home early, but she told me to log my full hours anyway and made it clear she and Chad are actively talking about this and taking it seriously and I am almost certain she and he had been texting the whole shift. She also walked me to my car and said that will continue for now until everything is resolved.

About an hour after my shift ended, I got an email from her (Chad CC'd) saying that tomorrow (Friday), Casey will be assigned to admin duty in the back office unless something changes before the shift, and that we should not be interacting at all. It's a long weekend so I figure all the behind the scenes stuff will be happening then.

I also found out that Casey already “presented her evidence” That includes the video she showed me before and another video from yesterday (Wednesday). Apparently she filmed me at a local winery during Wine Wednesday (there’s a clip of me getting up to grab a bottle a few steps away, and later another clip of me standing up and doing a small little celebratory dance after a tabletop game win).

That’s the part that really messed with my head because hold on when did she start recording me? For how long?

I mean I could maybe believe coincidence once, like, okay lightning struck and its weird. Same town, same general area, blah blah blah. But twice, 2 different days??? Two different places?? That’s when it stopped feeling like my paranoia getting the best of me and started feeling… unsettling. I’m honestly starting to wonder if this is something that might need police involvement, as some comments suggested, and I hate that my brain even went there but I mean what other options are there right now??

I’m typing this from a bar right now, but not the same one as before thank god. It is still local to the school (teachers come here a lot) and it’s Thirsty Thursday, so there’s a bigger happy hour discount if you show your school ID. Joy is with me, and a couple other friends are on their way. Joy had been here during my shift in case I needed any backup fast.

That said, my head is absolutely on a swivel. So is Joy’s. I don’t feel relaxed the way I normally would. I keep scanning the room without meaning to and when people get too close to me or stand in any way facing me I look up to see if it's her. It's fucking weird.

I’m still trying to process all of this, and honestly I’m confused more than anything...I keep going back and forth between “maybe this is nothing” and “this doesn’t feel normal”

Right now I’m just documenting everything and doing what HR tells me to do, but I don’t like how small and watched this situation is starting to feel and I hate that I'm recording every moment I can in case she pops up.

If nothing else, I’m safe tonight and will be staying at Joy's...I’m not alone and work has made sure we’re separated for now. I guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings. So unless something crazy happens o won't be updating until this is resolved.

Wish me luck 🙏.

**Edit:** I just replied to a follow-up email answering some recurring questions HR asked... 

My answers al ended up centered around:

I have never directly or indirectly invited Casey out anywhere. We are not friends outside of work and have never socialized one-on-one.

I was also asked whether I feel safe at work. Right now, yes, because management has taken steps to separate us and has been present and supportive. I've yet to be alone at all at work. I’m continuing to follow their guidance and document everything as instructed.

I’ll update if anything materially changes, but for now I’m letting HR handle it outside making a non-emergency police report in the morning.

**Top Comment**

**Commenter:** She sounds more unhinged than originally thought based on the fact she’s filmed you multiple times. And refusing to understand that disabilities are on a spectrum. Especially with chronic pain. It doesn’t mean you’re incapacitated all the time or all tasks are equally difficult.

Keep us updated on what comes down the line as far as disciplinary actions by HR for her!

1qjla6y,https://i.redd.it/b7ymog690ueg1.jpeg,10 Things Visitors Should NOT Do in Their First Month in Korea 🇰🇷 (Learn From Our Mistake),"Hey Unravel community 👋
If you’ve just arrived in South Korea or you’re planning to visit soon your first month can feel exciting, confusing, and honestly overwhelming.

Korea is amazing, but it also has unspoken rules that most tourists and new visitors learn the hard way. So here’s a friendly list of 10 things you should avoid doing in your first month to save yourself embarrassment, stress, and money.

1. Don’t assume English will always work
In tourist areas, yes. Everywhere else? Not really.
Learn basic Korean phrases like:
Hello (안녕하세요)
Thank you (감사합니다)
Excuse me (실례합니다)
Even small effort = big respect.

2. Don’t speak loudly in public transport Subways and buses are quiet zones.Talking loudly, laughing on calls, or playing videos without earphones = instant side-eye 👀

Pro tip: Koreans will notice… but won’t say anything.

3. Don’t stand on the left side of escalators
In Seoul:
Stand on the right
Walk on the left
This one mistake alone can annoy 20 people in 10 seconds.

4. Don’t expect trash bins everywhere Public trash bins are rare. Carry a small bag with you especially for coffee cups and food wrappers.Yes, it’s annoying. Yes, everyone does it.

5. Don’t wear shoes inside homes
This includes:
Korean homes
Some guesthouses
Traditional restaurants
Always look near the entrance shoes off is the default.

6. Don’t overuse taxis at first
Taxis are convenient but expensive long-term.
Learn how to use:
Subway lines
Bus numbers
Naver Maps / Kakao Maps
Korea’s public transport is one of the best in the world—use it.

7. Don’t ignore recycling rules
Korea takes trash seriously:
Food waste
Plastic
Paper
General waste
Mixing them can get you warnings or fines (yes, even as a foreigner).

8. Don’t assume Korean food is “just spicy”
There’s more than spice:
Fermented flavors
Raw seafood
Strong soups
Start slow. Your stomach will thank you.

9. Don’t film people without permissionStreet content is tempting, but:Filming strangers closely
Recording shop staff Pointing cameras at people
This can make others uncomfortable and even cause trouble.

10. Don’t compare Korea constantly to your home country
“This wouldn’t happen in my country”
“This is weird compared to home”
Everyone thinks it but saying it out loud closes doors.Observe first. Understand later.

Final Thought ❤️
Your first month in Korea is about adjusting, not mastering.Make mistakes. Learn slowly. Be respectful. Korea opens up beautifully when you do.

If you’re new here, welcome 🇰🇷
And if you’ve been here longer what would you add to this list?

My first manual pour. Decent enough.  
  
The bed was flat at end.  
But my pour in spiral shape sucks, i am not getting good control, I plan to practice without paper and coffee to improve my pour.

But for a self taught padawan who saw on youtube and tried this: not bad man, not bad at all.

There's a profound satisfaction in the ritual of preparing coffee. It begins with the promise held within a whole bean, the rich aroma that hints at what’s to come, and culminates in that first, perfect sip. But the journey from coffee bean to expertly ground coffee powder is where the magic truly unfolds, and it’s a journey Intelligentsia Coffee has perfected.

You might think all coffee powder is created equal. Yet, the difference between a good cup and an extraordinary one lies in the very source of the bean and how it’s treated. At Intelligentsia, we are pioneers of **Direct Trade**, building foundational, multi-year relationships with our farmers. This means we pay significantly above Fair Trade prices, ensuring you receive beans of unparalleled quality, cultivated with care and ethical integrity. We don't just source; we cultivate partnerships, all to bring you the most vibrant and flavorful coffee possible.

Furthermore, the concept of ""freshness"" in coffee is paramount. We roast our coffee **Roast-to-Order**. This isn’t just a detail; it's our commitment to you. Your coffee is never sitting on a shelf; it’s roasted specifically for your order and shipped immediately. This guarantees that when you grind your beans or receive our expertly ground coffee powder, you're experiencing coffee at its absolute peak.

Why does this matter for your daily cup?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Coffee powder, when ground just before brewing, preserves its volatile aromatics. Our Roast-to-Order model ensures this freshness is locked in from our roastery to your grinder.
*   **Exceptional Flavor Clarity:** Direct Trade allows us meticulous control over bean selection, resulting in distinct flavor profiles – from the bold, syrupy body of our legendary **Black Cat Espresso** to the bright, nuanced notes in our single origins.
*   **Ethical Sourcing:** Your enjoyment directly supports the farmers who grow these exceptional beans, fostering sustainable practices and community development.

Foods consumed; red meat, butter, A2 heavy cream, shelled seafood. Plain electrolytes and cod liver oil. The only thing I've changed in my diet, other than dropping coffee; trying to add more fat to my meals, and occasionally adding shelled seafood.

**Benefits I expected from quitting caffeine;**

1. More consistent energy.
2. Better waking cycles and rest.
3. Less joint pain.
4. Un-stalled weight loss.
5. Less dependence on electrolytes.
6. Skin improvements.

**Actual benefits I've obtained from quitting caffeine;**

1. A calmer mind; less easy to bother, far less racing thoughts.
2. TMI, but >!less bathroom trips!< overall which is nice.

**And now... the downsides;**

1. Energy levels have not improved (I've had to take a nap and a micro-nap these past 2 days).
2. Waking cycle has not improved at all. Rest is about the same.
3. Joint pain is about the same.
4. Weight has stayed the same.
5. Electrolyte balance still requires the same amount of electrolyte supplementation.
6. My skin has actually gotten worse, though this might partially be caused by recent cold medicine (I currently have a cold).

I also read that caffeine can make histamine intolerance worse, which is one reason why I think I should stay off it.

Anyhow, I'm not sure if I have to just give this caffeine-free thing another month or not... especially since my husband says he's worried for me, as he said when we had a short argument over it earlier. He seems irritated that I quit (he didn't want me to quit in the first place), and thinks it's unhealthy for me to remain caffeine-free. He says it's been messing with my mood (I'm not seeing it). He also misses us having 1 more thing to do and enjoy together.

I’m building in public and wanted to share an idea I’m currently validating.

I’m working on a mobile budgeting app where the AI runs fully offline on the device.

The core principles are intentionally simple:

	•	📱 Mobile-first

	•	🧠 AI runs locally (on-device)

	•	❌ No bank sync

	•	❌ No cloud storage

	•	❌ No signup / account

	•	🔒 Data never leaves the phone

Instead of complex dashboards, the app focuses on:

	•	Natural input like: “Coffee $15”

	•	A small, clean dashboard for daily/monthly overview

	•	An optional end-of-day review to confirm or add transactions

The tradeoff is less automation, but more trust, control, and privacy.

Right now, I’ve built a landing page and some UI prototypes and I’m trying to answer a few questions before going further:

	•	Does an offline-first AI approach make sense on mobile?

	•	Is “no signup + no cloud” a real advantage, or a limitation?

	•	Would you personally use something like this?

Not selling anything — genuinely looking for feedback while I build this out in public.

How it gnaws away at the precious thread of trust that binds two souls together. I remember well when a close friend revealed he had cheated on his partner. The look in his eyes was a cacophony of guilt, fear and sorrow. It was in that moment that the catastrophic consequence of infidelity sunk in.

With that revelation, I thought deeply about the way society often romanticizes the idea of forbidden affairs. A brief fling, a passionate connection, sounds alluring in the words of a paperback romance. But does fiction truly mirror reality? When that elicit liaison leaves hearts shattered and lives irreparably damaged?

One evening, I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, a guilt-ridden friend confessing his mistakes. The hurt he caused, the trust broken, the betrayal that his partner faced, turned out to be a heavy burden. He wept, and that tear-stricken face held a profound lesson on the dire impact of infidelity.

My (31M) girlfriend (29F) struggles with anxiety since I know her. We are currently on our first year of relationship. I love her very much, I love spending time with her and we get along so well. I live 40 minutes away, but usually stay on the weekends and some days of the week in her apartment.

However how well we get along, every month there are some days where she gets in a depressed mood, usually ends up crying and blaming her anxiety. In those days, communication with her is difficult, and cheering her up impossible. Many times I end up feeling hurt because she won’t talk to me.

She has some unresolved issues with her parents, especially with her father, and also about her job as a teacher(she studied in a music conservatory and also English) She feels stuck in a job that does not pay well and is really stressful.

I am going on a trip to Europe for one month this February with my family(parents and brothers) This was a trip that we have been planing for some years to do. Both my parents have suffered cancer (my mom kidney and my dad lung) so this trip was a project that kept them with motivation to go through that, specially for my father as his cancer is way more complicated(had his fourth surgery a month ago).

The trip to Europe triggers my girlfriend anxiety to the roof. I was in her apartment today, and the topic of the trip was mentioned when we were having lunch. After lunch she went to the bedroom, I assumed to take a nap. I kept working on the living room (I work remote) After some hours of work and her not appearing I go to the bedroom to find her crying sitting in a chair looking outside through the window (she lives in a 2nd floor)

I try to cheer her up, I take her to walk my dog with me and to get a coffee and cake. She seems to cheer up a bit but when returning to the apartment she breaks again. She fears about the relationship through the duration of the trip, how and at what time we are going to communicate, etc, etc. Nothing I do or say can cheer her up or make her see some positive. She says me that she can’t see nothing positive, and sees all dark. I ended up going to my apartment.

She goes to therapy every two weeks, but I don’t see that something gets better. I feel sad and also a bit angry as, I don’t know, but I would like her to feel happy that I can travel with my family.

Are there some tips about what I can do to lighten this up? I do go to therapy too and will try to address this with my therapist but I would like to get some opinions from real experiences.

Facing investors for the first time, it feels like a brand new chapter of my life.

Fifteen years ago, I used the Spider framework to write communication protocol automation scripts. Back then, I already imagined a future of full automation—sipping coffee while scripts generated themselves, tests ran automatically, bugs were reported, development tools made fixes on their own, and everything deployed seamlessly. But that dream felt distant at the time.

Ten years ago, when I started using Appium and Selenium for mobile and web automation, I wondered whether fully automated script generation and execution could ever become real. The frameworks and technical capabilities back then weren’t enough, so I focused on improving my own framework and building automation platforms.

Five years ago, I began using image recognition to achieve fully automated page load testing. That increased testing efficiency by over 10x and expanded test coverage across more scenarios. The related technology was patented and later shared at the Alibaba Cloud Technology Conference. It felt like smart testing was becoming viable in some scenarios, with more image recognition and deep learning frameworks entering the field.

Two years ago, I took on a project to improve testing efficiency with large language models. I started exploring academic solutions, applied for computing resources for training, and after repeated attempts, finally achieved a working LLM agent. We delivered results in case generation, automated script creation, data construction, and report generation. It felt like end-to-end LLM implementation was truly within reach. Around that time, DeepSeek was also launched—the era of LLM agents had arrived.

Six months ago, after careful consideration, I left a world-class global product company to pursue my goal of helping the industry improve efficiency. I wanted to contribute to the practical adoption of LLM agents in testing. The future felt challenging, but the foundation was there—it was time to execute and deliver.

Just one week ago, the GenAgent brand was officially born. We hope to use large language models to help people work more efficiently, and to make our own contribution to the industry.

GenAgent，yes, an AI-driven vibe testing platform built to eliminate UI automation scripting and turns natural language into executed tests across the web & mobile (Android/iOS), and manages the entire lifecycle, from device connection to reporting—without a single script. 

Hey, fellows, if there’s a AI tool like GenAgent, a Full-Stack Support and Full OS Support-(Case → UI → API → Report )-Closed-Loop System. I believe that you will be excitedly eager to try.

Bakit, maaga? Para may build up yung connection lol. Para din hindi awkward if ever manunuod na tayo, we can have dinner or coffee before or after ng movie. Kaya maaga para maging comfortable din, to see if we'll vibe.

Di ko to libre. KKB tayo.

About me: 5'1, okay na yung itsura (confident naman ako), working. The rest ng gusto mong malaman pag usapan nalang natin sguro?

About you? Matangkad sana lol. Basta walang asawa or jowa kasi hello, cinema date to. Ayoko mag trending sa fb, awa nalang.",5,1769055886.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

It has put a LOT of things in perspective and explains why my life has been so hard. Also makes sense why I used to drink so much coffee and then later starting using marijuana daily - I've been self-medicating to help with the focus and ESPECIALLY executive function. I can't tell you how many times I've popped an edible to help me do the dishes. But of course, took just long enough to get a diagnosis for me to get addicted to weed. Not the worst thing to be addicted to, but the problem is I can't start stimulants until I pass a drug test. 

Been sober 10 days now and it's been hard. I have an appointment in 3 weeks, but I'm not sure if I'm getting drug tested that day, and not sure I'll even pass it. I'm planning to be sober 30 days but I learned (too late) it can sometimes take even longer for heavy users. I also can't drink coffee or caffeine anymore due to my stomach issues (which the weed helps with). I didn't realize I was self-medicating the whole time, but in retrospect I always used to cram for tests and projects by pounding back a ton of coffee. Probably why I have GERD now honestly.

I tried to post this to an ADHD specific community but they wouldn't allow mentions of drug use which is very frustrating. I was originally going to post in a sobriety community, but honestly the cravings and mood swings haven't been too bad. It's mostly that I can't get myself to DO anything unless it's completely necessary. My psychiatrist said she wants to make sure the weed isn't making me lazy, but if anything I feel lazier than ever and it's totally crushing. I've been on a low dose of clonodine but I'm nearly out and she won't refill it, probably so I can wean off to start stimulants. All I know is I'm going to have to completely raw dog this ADHD for a few weeks for the first time since I was like 15 and started drinking coffee, and I've already been struggling just to function.

Can anyone relate to this experience, and do you have any advice or motivation for getting through the next few weeks?",1,1769055870.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
