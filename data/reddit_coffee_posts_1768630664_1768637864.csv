1qf7oag,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1qf7oag/creatista_plus_coffee_volumes/,Creatista Plus coffee volumes,"On the Creatista Plus machine there are presets for Espresso, Lungo, Flat White etc.

Each of these has its own configurable ""coffee volume"" (amount of water) which can be set via a little coffee cup icon.

The icon is the same size for each preset, but would I be correct in thinking that setting the coffee volume / icon to ""full"" on Espresso delivers less coffee than setting the coffee volume / icon to full on the Lungo preset?  

i.e; each preset delivers a different maximum amount of water and the coffee volume icon works to that?  50ml max on Espresso, 100ml max on Lungo or whatever it may be.

1qf7o9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1qf7o9n/if_i_can_do_it_then_so_can_you/,If I can do it then so can you,"I smoked for 22 years, about 25-30 a day. I used to smoke regulsr cigarettea but for the past 5 years or so I smoked iqos, which is a lot more similar to a vape than cigarettes in how accessible they are (no 'real' burning smoke like a cigarette, no smell sticking to clothes, can often smoke it indoors so super accessible). I've been 1.5 months smoke/nicotine free.

Before I quit, the longest I had gone without smoking was 8 hours on a plane and by the time I got off the plane I was a mess. I couldn't imagine ever being a non smoker.

I read the Allen Carr book and set my quit date. I made sure it wasn't during the time of anything super stressful (the project from hell was due at work on December 1st so my quit date was on the Saturday following it).

I never imagined I could watch TV and have coffee without yearning for a heet stick. Suprisingly, by the second cup on Day 1 of quitting I was just..doing it. I had cravings at other times but my hands and mouth didn't feel super empty the entire day like I expected.

Allen Carr was the reason I quit, and I go back to certain parts of his book (and audiobook on spotify) if I have a difficult day, but there are 2 things he said that I ignored:

""You'll barely notice the withdrawal pangs"" - you will, and they feel like they'll last forever, but eventually they get shorter and shorter and in less time than you'd expect. 

He also said you shouldn't substitute with chewing gum or carrot sticks or whatever. I ignored that and I chewed like mad on chewing gum or carrot sticks and it genuinely helped with the craving. When I didn't have those things on hand I immediately got up and moved and that calmed the craving down. 

It's great not being a smoker. After the initial fog and withdrawal pangs (first week or 2) my focus got so much better at work because I wasn't always desperate to smoke. I don't need to worry if my stupid iqos is charged or if I have enough heets. I've already saved a nice amount of money. I don't feel like a slave to nicotine which has given me confidence. I have so much more time  because I'm not using every opportunity to smoke. My skin looks so much better. 

If someone like me, who thought about smoking basically 95% of the day, can do it then so can you 💪💪💪

* Monopoly is banned from their house. Reid and Hotch both cheat at Monopoly, but neither would ever admit it. They both don't know that the other is cheating either and in the end it turns into a game of who gets caught cheating first. They are also super competitive and it always ends in yelling, so JJ banned them from playing it. Reid does start teaching Jack to count cards in secret, so when all three of them play anything from Uno to poker Jack starts cheating and is very good at it and Hotch doesn't notice for months. In the end, Hotch can't be mad about it when he spots Jack and Reid hanging out one afternoon over a deck of cards and Spencer teaching Jack all his tricks. 
* Elle taught Spencer how to speak Spanish more fluently than he already knows. Whenever Reid is upset with Hotch for a petty reason, such as Hotch not letting him have his 18th million cup of coffee that day, he starts speaking to Hotch in Spanish and makes Hotch work to understand why he's upset. It's usually easy for Hotch to figure out because Reid's not genuinely upset.
* Reid sleeps like the dead when he's cuddling with Hotch. Hotch initially freaks out at the fact this man, who barely sleeps, is dead to the world but then it's sweet because Hotch realises that Reid feels safe with him. Hotch never fully relaxes when sleeping with Reid, wanting to be ready in case something ever happens. The team learn quickly that if the two are sleeping together on the Jet, you don't try to wake up either of them or get too near. Morgan goes to wake up Reid one time and Hotch snaps awake, gun in hand and levelled at Derek's head. The team learn to observe from a distance. 
* When Reid gets too anxious Hotch holds him, in like a bear hug. It's grounding because of the constant pressure. 
* Reid figures out quickly that if they are arguing, he'll always get his way if he kisses Hotch in the middle of their argument. It always flusters Hotch long enough for Reid to work his way around the issue and get his way. 
* Reid feels that he doesn't need instructions to put together IKEA furniture because how hard can it be, also he has enough PhDs that he can figure it out. Hotch has to read every line of instruction before he even considers putting together the furniture. 
* When Reid's mother is in a good frame of mind she adores Hotch but when it's the wrong day, Hotch terrifies her. She'll scream about him being a spy and how he's using Reid to learn their secrets and watch her. It devastates Reid every time. 
* During sex, if Reid gets overwhelmed he'll start rambling about any random fact he's been thinking about that day but doesn't realise that he's doing it. Hotch has surprisingly learnt a lot from these sessions.  ",0,1768637431.0,criminalminds,0,0.5,False

Honestly, I’m posting this because I’m fed up with how some places here treat locals the moment they see a white face.

So, we go to order and there’s this group of foreigners (looked Russian) standing about 4-5 feet from the cashier. They weren't even in a proper line, just hovering. When I went to look at the menu, one of them goes ""excuse me, we are in the line."" I stayed respectful and let them go ahead, but for the next few minutes (not few actually they were camping at there LOL), they just stood there talking and talking without actually ordering anything.

Since they were wasting time, we looked at the wall menu and asked the staff for a pasta. The guy says, ""Sir, it’ll take 15 minutes."" We said that’s fine, we can enjoy the view. Then he gets weirdly desperate and says, ""Sir, I don't think even 15 mins is enough, can you just order something else?"" and points me to a limited menu near the cashier.

As I leaned in to see what the cashier was pointing at, one of those foreigners tries to call me out again saying they are in line. At this point, I lost it. I straight up told them, ""Then please just order and give others priority, because you guys are wasting everyone’s time standing here and blocking the cashier."" I was a bit rude because I was done with their attitude. They couldn't even speak proper English and just looked at me like I was the crazy one.

So here’s the kicker,

The cashier ended up placing our original order (the pastas and coffees) anyway. We went to sit down, and within 5 minutes, the waiters served us the pasta!

So, they basically lied to our faces saying the food would take forever or wasn't available, just because they wanted to prioritize those foreigners assuming they’d spend big. The irony? That whole group of 5-6 people sat there forever and only ordered two frappes. We ended up spending 3x more than that entire group combined.

Java Lounge is usually my goto spot in Colombo for work, but this experience was a massive letdown. It’s pathetic to see our people worshiping these toxic tourists who act like royalty but contribute nothing.",7,1768636870.0,srilanka,3,1.0,False

I already use Apollo/Artemis to stream to my phone with a controller over 5ghz wifi and it works beautifully, so I have at least some idea of what I'm getting into.

I want this setup to be something that:
- Will support up to 4 controllers for multiplayer couch gaming
- Can decode 1440p60hz with reasonably low latency. 4k120 is nice, but realistically I'd be happy with that
- I can also install a Jellyfin client on
- I can use to watch YouTube and other streaming services, with an adblocker (probably just in a Firefox browser with ublock origin, whether streamed or running natively I don't care)

With all this in mind I'm currently thinking of getting a mini-PC with a wireless keyboard and mouse on the coffee table for navigation and 4x 2.4ghz wireless controllers (probably gamesir nova lite?) for gaming. This PC will have a wired ethernet connection, as does the host PC.

I can get a refurbished mini dell optiplex with an i5-7500 for around $200 AUD. Not a powerhouse but as far as I can tell it should be capable of decoding reasonably well (and maybe running simple 2d games natively as a bonus). It'd probably be running Linux Bazzite or another simple distro. My biggest concerns are support for 4 controllers, and making sure the client pc will have good enough decode speeds for what I want.

So could those of you who already have this kind of setup please tell me - will this work for my intended requirements, and is it the best way to achieve it? And if not, what do I need to change to get there?",1,1768636395.0,MoonlightStreaming,0,1.0,False

[Best Lifetime Free Credit Cards with Lounge Access in India](https://preview.redd.it/my3opfm17vdg1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=586f2e5587e1e21763c1acd19f1333429e109848)

Airports can be a mess. Long lines, overpriced snacks, nowhere to sit — it’s enough to make anyone dread the wait before a flight. But honestly, it doesn’t have to be that way.

Pick the right credit card, and suddenly you’re skipping the chaos. You get to relax in a lounge, away from the crowd, and you don’t have to shell out extra for it. In India, more and more people are catching on to these lifetime free credit cards that offer [airport lounge access](https://nayedeals.medium.com/why-are-you-still-paying-for-airport-comfort-the-rise-of-lifetime-free-lounge-cards-5127c0d98327). It’s a simple move, but it turns waiting around into something you might actually look forward to.

# Why You Really Want a Lounge Access Card

Let’s be honest — having a lounge access card isn’t just a nice little travel bonus. It completely changes how you move through airports. Sure, the free coffee is nice, but that’s just the start.

You get to skip the chaos in the main terminal. Instead, you sink into a comfy chair, find a quiet spot to work or just zone out, and actually relax before your flight. Forget shelling out ₹400 for a sad airport sandwich. These cards hook you up with real meals, unlimited snacks, and drinks — hot or cold, all on the house.

Need to charge your phone and get some work done? Lounges have fast Wi-Fi and plenty of power outlets, so you don’t have to fight for a plug. Got a long layover? Some lounges even have showers, so you can freshen up and feel human again before you board.

A lot of these cards go further, too. Built-in travel insurance covers you for flight delays, lost bags, and even accidental death. It’s that extra peace of mind every traveler wants.

And the best part? You don’t even have to pay for these perks. The cards I’m about to list have no joining or annual fees. Zero. You get the VIP treatment just by having the right card in your wallet.

# Top 4 Lifetime Free Lounge Access Cards for Indian Travelers

These are the best cards out there right now if you want all those benefits without ever worrying about an annual fee.

# 1. [IndusInd Legend Credit Card **—** Best for Premium Perks](https://deals.nayedeals.com/induscc)

This one’s a standout. The IndusInd Legend is a premium card that’s usually available as “Lifetime Free” (just double-check the offer before you apply). It’s built for people who want style and comfort when they travel.

You get 24/7 concierge help — so if you need to book a flight, grab a hotel room, or snag a dinner reservation, you’ve got someone to call. It also often comes with a [**free Priority Pass membership**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/induscc), which means access to a massive network of airport lounges all over the world. (Heads up: International lounge visits might still have a fee, so check the details.)

And of course, you get complimentary domestic lounge visits — usually one per quarter. It’s an easy way to make your airport time a whole lot better.

# 2. [Kiwi Credit Card-Best for UPI Users](https://deals.nayedeals.com/kiwicc)

If you live your life online, the Kiwi Credit Card fits right in. It runs on the RuPay network, so you can [**use it for UPI payments**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/kiwicc) without any hassle.

Kiwi is a “Scan and Pay” card. Every time you pay with UPI, you rack up reward points — Kiwi calls these “Kiwis” — which are basically cashback you can send straight to your bank account.

Lounge perks get a fun twist too. With Kiwi’s “Neon” program, hitting certain UPI spend targets unlocks free lounge visits. Your everyday spending suddenly feels like a ticket to a little luxury at the airport.

# 3. [Federal Scapia Credit Card-Best for International Travel](https://deals.nayedeals.com/federalcc)

**Scapia’s** exploded in popularity among travel lovers. The idea? Travel as much as you want, without paying extra.

[**Zero Forex Fees**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/federalcc): That’s right — no 3.5% markup on international spending like most cards. Every time you swipe abroad, you save big.

**Unlimited Domestic Lounge Access**: As long as you spent at least ₹5,000 last cycle, you walk into any domestic lounge, as often as you want. Not many cards offer that.

**Easy Bookings**: Use your reward coins on the Scapia app to book flights and hotels instantly. Simple, fast, and no fuss.

# 4. [IDFC FIRST Credit Card (Select / Wealth-Best All-Rounder Card](https://deals.nayedeals.com/idfccc)

**IDFC FIRST** Bank keeps it straightforward. Their cards are [**Lifetime Free**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/idfccc) — no hidden clauses, no tricky terms.

**Travel Insurance**: The Select and Wealth cards come loaded with safety nets, like broad travel insurance, air accident cover, and personal accident protection.



**Roadside Assistance**: Here’s something rare — free roadside help if your car breaks down. Perfect if you’re the sort who loves road trips.

**No Annual Fee Headaches**: Since the card is already free, you never have to stress about hitting a spending threshold to avoid fees.

**Lounge Access**: Depending on which card you pick, you get 2 to 4 complimentary domestic lounge visits every quarter.

# Types of Airport Lounge Access Credit Cards

**Unlimited airport lounge access**: With these cards, you can walk into domestic or international lounges as often as you want. No caps, just swipe and relax.

**Domestic lounge access**: These cards get you into select lounges within the country. So if you travel around India a lot, you’ll find this handy.

**International lounge access**: Only headed abroad? These ones cover you for select international lounges, but not the domestic ones.

**Limited lounge access**: Here, you get a set number of free lounge visits — maybe two per quarter, or eight per year. Use them wisely, because once they’re gone, that’s it until the next period.

**Lounge access after hitting a spending target**: Some cards unlock free lounge visits, but only if you spend a certain amount in a quarter or a year. Hit the target, then you can kick back in the lounge. Miss it, and you miss out.

# Things to Think About Before Picking a Lounge Access Credit Card

Picking the right credit card for lounge access isn’t just about the shiny perks. Here’s what really matters:

First, check how many free lounge visits you get. Some top-tier cards let you walk into lounges as often as you want. Others put a cap on visits — maybe a few times a year, or just once every quarter. It’s a big difference if you travel a lot.

Next, look at the lounge network. How many lounges can you actually access? Are they just in India, or do you get international options too? No point in a card that covers only two lounges at airports you never visit.

Don’t forget the fees. Some of these cards charge a hefty annual fee. Ask yourself if the benefits really line up with the cost, especially if you’re not always on the move.

Extra perks matter too. Think about things like free guest passes, priority check-in, or complimentary meals. Sometimes these little bonuses make all the difference.

A lot of cards now tie free lounge visits to your spending. So, you might need to hit a certain spend each quarter or year before the free visits kick in.

Guest access is another big one. Can you bring a friend in for free, or do they have to pay? If you usually travel with someone, this could tip the scales.

Last but not least, insurance. Some cards throw in travel insurance, accident cover, or even protection for damaged goods. It’s one of those things you hope you’ll never need, but it’s great to have just in case.

In the end, it’s all about matching the card’s perks to how you actually travel. Take a closer look before you jump in.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Let’s clear up some of the most common things people want to know about free lounge access.

**1. What are the best credit cards for lounge access in India, according to Reddit?**  
If you look through Reddit threads, you’ll notice two names come up over and over: [**Federal Scapia**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/federalcc) and [**IDFC FIRST Wealth**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/idfccc). People love these because they’re truly lifetime free, and the apps are straightforward. No sneaky hidden fees like you’ll see with some other banks.

**2. Is there a credit card in India that gives lounge access with no annual fee?**  
Absolutely. Cards like [**IndusInd Legend**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/induscc), [**Kiwi**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/kiwicc), [**Scapia**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/federalcc), and [**IDFC** ](https://deals.nayedeals.com/idfccc)all offer lounge access without an annual fee. You get the perks of premium airport lounges, and you don’t have to worry about paying a subscription every year.

**3. Can I get a zero annual fee credit card with international lounge access?**  
Most free cards only cover domestic lounges, but there are a couple of exceptions. [**IDFC FIRST Wealth**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/idfccc) and [**Federal Scapia**](https://deals.nayedeals.com/federalcc) stand out here.

Banks are shifting toward making you spend a certain amount to unlock lounge access. Right now, finding a lifetime free card with lounge access and no spending requirement is tough. Most cards want you to swipe at least ₹5,000 in the previous month to get the benefit. Still, it’s way cheaper than paying for a lounge visit out of pocket.

**5. How do I check if my credit card has airport lounge access?**  
The fastest way is to check your bank’s app or log in to the DreamFolks portal. When you get to the lounge, swipe your card at reception — there’s usually a tiny validation fee (around ₹2), but it gets refunded later. That’s how they confirm you’re eligible.

1qf79k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/growthguide/comments/1qf79k8/the_chatgpt_memory_update_changes_everything_for/,The ChatGPT memory update changes everything for repetitive business tasks.,"OpenAI's memory feature is being framed as a ""personalization"" toy, but I think most people are missing its real business utility.

After testing it for 2 weeks with our operations, here are the practical, time-saving applications we found:

*1. Meeting Note Synthesis* (5 minutes → 30 seconds)  
  
• Teach it: ""I want all meeting summaries in bullet points with clear action items, owners, and deadlines.""  
• Now every time: ""Summarize this transcript"" → perfectly formatted, consistent output

*2. Content Brief Generation* (The hidden goldmine)

• Teach it: ""Our content pillars are X, Y, Z. Our audience cares about A, B, C. We always include case studies and data.""  
• Now: ""Brief for article about SaaS pricing"" → gets your exact structure, tone, requirements instantly

*3. Code Review Patterns*

• Teach it: ""Our security requirements: no API keys in frontend, always validate user input, use these specific error handling patterns.""  
• Now: ""Review this component"" → catches YOUR specific issues, not just generic ones

The key insight: Memory isn't about making ChatGPT ""remember you like coffee."" It's about encoding your business workflows, standards, and preferences so you stop repeating yourself.

*Practical setup guide:*

1. Create a ""Business Rules"" document with your most repeated instructions
2. Paste it to ChatGPT with: ""Remember these as my core business rules.""
3. Test with 3-5 real tasks from last week
4. Refine based on what it ""forgets.

Warning: The feature works best for consistent processes, not creative work. Don't expect it to ""remember your brand voice"" perfectly yet.

Who's actually using memory for work (not just personal)? What specific business workflows have you encoded? Anyone found clever applications I'm missing? What are the limitations you've hit?",1,1768636100.0,growthguide,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been working out for a few years and tried a lot of fitness apps.

Some are good for workouts but bad for nutrition.

Others are good for food tracking but weak for workouts.

And many charge way too much 💸

So I decided to build my own app that does everything I actually need.

After many late nights and lots of coffee ☕ I finally released it on the Play Store.

The app is called Light Weight 💪

Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basheerrjoub.lightweight

Workout features 🏋️‍♂️

Log sets, reps, and weights

Large exercise library with clear instructions

Pre-built workout programs

Progress tracking so you can see your gains 📈

Food tracking 🍽️

Calorie and macro tracking

AI food scanner, just point your camera at food and log it 📷🤖

Save meals so you don’t re-enter the same food every day

Other features 💧

It was an evening(day before yesterday), 
My mom, dad, sis, and myself were having coffee.
I was simultaneously texting my friend (let us say his name is 'X'). 

My mom was sitting next to me and told my dad, ""Doesn't it feel like <my name> is very close with X?"" To which dad said, ""Oh the guy who's tall and wearing glasses? Yeah, <my name> is indeed very close with him"".

Then my mom called my sis to ask her opinion
To which my younger sis said, ""X has a gf right?"" 
To which my mom said, ""yeah, that's <my name> right"" 
To which my sis said, ""yeahh""

So in my last post I talked about how my mom and dad are abusive and what happened on Jan 2nd. I was 32 weeks pregnant and now I’m 35 yay. I took a lot of advice from people on this side of Reddit. I went very low contact (although everyone wanted me to go NC). I have seen my mom twice since the incident. Nothing crazy, just coffee or her picking me up from the car dealership (oil change). 

I guess whats bothering me is my mom keeps bringing my dad up. “He’s doing better” and “you both are so similar”. She keeps bringing it up because I told her I won’t step foot in their house and i won’t talk to him till he apologizes. My mom basically broke down tonight and kept saying “ he was only defending me” and “you guys just need to sit down and talk it out”.  Thing is I’m not sorry. I don’t want to talk it out. He came at me at 8 months pregnant. And he expects me to apologize? Apparently he told my mom he’d goto family therapy but my husband HAS to be there? As if he is going to embarrass me or start drama with him. I go see my therapist in a few days but I’m just baffled because my mom tried to use every guilt trip. “We’re 2/3 through our life” “I went no contact with my dad and I regret it” “make sure you’re making the right decision “… my response every time was “he needs to be held accountable for his actions and needs to apologize, I’m not holding a gun to his head. If he doesn’t want to apologize and ruin his relationship with me then so be it”. My mom hated that I kept saying that.

My mom genuinely just wants me to sweep what happened under the rug and kept saying “our family had been fractured for two years”… me and my husband have been together for 3 years. I know this is leading to them blaming him for our “fracture” but they don’t realize it’s beeen like this for awhile. My mom kept saying “let go of the past” and it’s like??? NO you mentally and physically abused me as a child and I let that go. But what I’m not going to do is forgive how they treated me pregnant. All my mom had to say was “we weren’t perfect parents but we did our best.” And it sucks and it may be true but.. maybe their best wasn’t good enough. They didnt protect me. And I had to dig myself out of the depression and anger that they put in me. Now that I’m not as angry and can control my emotions (for the most part) it’s like they don’t like who I am. They don’t like that I pick my husband and my son over them. 

Family therapy? I’ve been to regular therapy but honestly if my dad only wants to go for one session is it even worth it? 

Sorry for the word vomit I’m just over this. And it’s like setting boundaries with them is like pulling teeth. ",2,1768635908.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

The whole setup was elaborate, involving water basins and multiple products and tools spread across a tray. She sat there for over an hour while other patrons worked around this impromptu salon taking up several tables.

The technician mentioned traveling to clients with the portable chair setup to save them travel time to salons. She'd invested in the equipment through beauty supply distributors, including finding a lighter weight chair model on Alibaba specifically designed for mobile services. The convenience for clients comes at the cost of public space and other people's comfort.

We've decided that convenience means bringing salon services everywhere regardless of appropriateness or impact on shared spaces. Her pedicure turned the cafe into her personal spa without considering that other people came there for coffee and quiet work. The chair and equipment enabled this colonization of public space. Maybe mobile services are innovative business models or maybe they're just entitled intrusion into places not meant for extended beauty treatments.

I’m a 26F and I’ve been talking to a 36M for a little over two months. I genuinely enjoy spending time with him, and we share very similar perspectives on life. However, I can’t shake the feeling that he isn’t putting much effort into courting me.

Our first date was a coffee date at a food court, which I didn’t mind at all. I actually prefer starting simple. He paid for my coffee, I thanked him, and afterward he told me he really liked me. I felt the same.

For our second date, we planned to go to an arcade at the mall, but when we arrived, we found out it was closed. I assumed he’d suggest another activity or place, but instead, he gave up on the plan and led us back to the food court, where we sat and talked for hours.

The third time we met, he suggested I come over to his place, where his family also lives and asks to chill. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that yet, so we agreed to meet at a central location with local food, shops, and things to do. Once again, he didn’t ask if I wanted anything not even water and we ended up sitting in the food court area just talking.

At one point, we also happened to be in the same different city purely by coincidence (this trip was planned before we even met). During my time there, he never offered to meet up or see me, which stood out to me.

Fast forward to recently: he asked me to meet him at a restaurant. While we were eating, he told me that meeting me was the highlight of his year, said some other nice stuffs and that he didn’t want to lose me to someone else and then directly asked, “Will you be my girlfriend?”

I was caught off guard. As much as I imagined I’d be happy to hear that from him one day, I didn’t feel an immediate or confident “yes.” I told him I needed some time to think about it when he pressed if I’m saying yes.

Another reason I feel unsure is that while our conversations are fun and playful, they haven’t gone very deep. He doesn’t really ask intentional questions about me or about relationships such as expectations in a relationship and so on. I was the one initiating serious conversations about expectations and the future, and eventually I stopped because I noticed he wasn’t matching that energy.

Because of all this, I don’t feel like we’re at the stage where moving into a serious, committed relationship makes sense.

Texting is also an issue. Sometimes it feels very dry. For example, I’ll ask how he slept, and he’ll reply, “Good, how about you?” I’ll then share more details about my day, and his response will be something like, “Okay cool… have a great day.” Yet on the phone, he’s a completely different person we talk a lot and connect more. I asked him if he’s not much of a texter, but he said he’s both a text and call type of guy.

I’m not expecting grand gestures or perfection, and I’m doing well for myself independently. Still, I can’t tell if I’m overthinking things or if he’s genuinely giving low effort. That’s where I’m stuck",1,1768635805.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

# The Coffee Bean, Perfected: Elevate Your Daily Brew

That first cup of coffee—it’s more than just a jolt of energy; it’s a ritual. It’s the fragrant steam rising from your favorite mug, the satisfying grind, and the moment the rich, complex flavors awaken your senses. But the journey to that perfect cup begins long before the brew. It begins with the coffee bean itself.

At Intelligentsia, we believe that exceptional coffee beans are the foundation of an extraordinary coffee experience. This isn't just about sourcing any beans; it's about a commitment to unparalleled quality and ethical practices. Our **Direct Trade** program, a pioneering initiative we've championed for years, means we build deep, lasting relationships with coffee farmers. We pay significantly above market rates for the highest quality beans, ensuring farmers are rewarded for their dedication and expertise. This direct connection allows us unparalleled insight and control, from seed to roast.

What truly sets Intelligentsia apart is our dedication to freshness. We don't stockpile green coffee; we roast it **Roast-to-Order**, precisely when you place your order. This means your coffee is never sitting on a shelf. It’s roasted and shipped within hours, ensuring that when it arrives at your door, it’s at its absolute peak of flavor. This freshness is the secret to unlocking the nuanced profiles of our coffees, from the legendary syrupy body and notes of dark chocolate and stone fruit in our **Black Cat Espresso** to the vibrant, distinct flavors of our single-origin offerings.

Why settle for ordinary when you can experience the best? With Intelligentsia, you're choosing:

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Coffee roasted for \*you\* and shipped immediately.
*   **Ethical & Direct Sourcing:** Exceptional quality backed by direct farmer relationships.

The big one is pretty much what IEMs I should buy next. I'm not entirely sure what tuning I like still, but I can say for certain that I like punchy bass and stuff that has good imaging/separation well and can do vocals decently. I listen to a lot of different genres, namely rock, metal, some video game OSTs(Metal Gear Rising, DOOM, and Stellar Blade, just to name a few), and *tons* of EDM(lots of house, DnB, trance, jersey club, hardstyle, etc., etc.). So far I own:

* KZ Castor Pros (Improved Bass)
* Tin HiFi T3+
* GK Kunten

While I feel like it'd be best to just buy a ton of budget options to try a variety of tunings before I spend the big bucks, spending on just a singular IEM is also just fine. My budget is $100($150 being the absolute limit most likely), and I've considered the following options:

* Truthear Hexa or Pure(Yes, I know the Hexa is a neutral/bright IEM, and I said I liked stuff with punchy bass, but I'm curious as to how a neutral-tuned IEM sounds like, and I heard the technicals of the Hexas are quite good.)
* Truthear Gate(Neutral-sounding for a budget price, though I'm worried about the massive spike at the top end)
* Simgot EW300 x HBB(Heard this has more bass compared to the normal EW300 since it's by HBB)
* Artti T10(Though I'm kind of worried about the top end (Treble? Airiness? I still don't know how to use all these terms...) being a bit too much)
* Aful Explorer
* KZ Vader and its variations(Pro, HiRes, Balanced, etc.)
* KZ Duonic

I think that's a pretty extensive list thus far, and I'm also open to any suggestions that happen to come my way. With that done... I guess we move onto the next subject(Yes, this is a long post, sorry..), DACs. I don't think I need any more eartips thus far since I already have KBear 07, KBear Coffee Clear/ Whizzer SS20, Dunu S&S, Penon Orange, and Sonic HE, but I'm also open to tip suggestions if any suggested IEMs come with aftermarket tips that improve them a lot compared to stock tips/tips that I don't own. Same goes with cables, but cables I'm kind of iffy about because they seem expensive...(Well, everything about this hobby is expensive ;-;)

Anyway, DACs. I have two Apple dongles and a JM6 Pro, but recently my interest was piqued at ""thumb drive style"" DACs(Is that even the right term?). They're usually a lot more expensive compared to dongle DACs, but I was wondering if there are any benefits to using them over a regular dongle DAC. I tend to take my IEMs whenever I go out so dongles are really handy and can bend out of my pocket. If I were to buy a thumb drive DAC, how does one even secure it to a phone, and how does one manage the resulting wired connections so they don't get tangled/kinked in a pocket? 

Anyway, that's about it for all the questions I have. For anyone who stumbles upon this and takes some of their time answering my newbie questions, thanks a ton.",1,1768635193.0,iems,1,1.0,False

As I plan to make the next move I am thinking about things like what would I wear, which shoes, etc. I've thought about how I want any potential dates to start with coffee to make sure we both vibe before the next move to something physical and I would want us to be clear about what we want and expect. 

Which brings me to wondering how to stay physically 238048. We wouldn't come back to my place and I wouldn't go to his so I guess we would go to a hotel room. What are things to know or look out for to keep myself from physical harm? 

DH and I have agreed to share our locations and intended time we expect to be home. He has shared his dates' names and phone numbers.

New year means putting myself out there and exploring what life has to offer. I recently realized that what I want it is consistency. I want something genuine, getting to know each other’s favorite food, interests, and even everyday struggles. I want to get to know someone deeply and start off from there. 

For some context: 

•I’m 23, 5’3, and a morena

•Grad from the green school

•Living in QC 

•Working in corpo (to which I need a life outside of)

•A big foodie

•Likes sleeping in and spending quality time

•A yapper who always has something to say (😅)

Preferences:

•Hopefully around 23-28 years old

•From QC also or somewhere nearby (so we can grab food or coffee after a long day)

•Down to go on trips or just try out new spots

•Someone consistent and looking for something serious

If any of these resonates with you, hmu 😌",0,1768635101.0,PhR4Dating,1,0.5,False
1qf6yo9,https://i.redd.it/vbw1su514vdg1.jpeg,"Clos de los Siete, Red Blend, Mendoza 2006","A fun little gem tonight!

I’ve had this wine before, from recent vintages, and have been pretty underwhelmed. I remember thinking, “it’s just wine”🤷‍♀️ Not too much going on.

This one is a different story. A blend of 45% Malbec, 35% Merlot, 10% each of Syrah and Cab Sauv. On the nose, it’s got ripe black fruits, even as it moves into its second decade. Toasty oak. There’s also a big whiff of smoke, like burnt coffee or pepper.

The palate is super fruity up front - plum and blackberry vibes. In the finish, though, it really starts throwing hands. SUPER spicy, like someone ground coarse black pepper straight into this shit, and still with that smoky flavor. Surprisingly astringent tannins in the finish contrasted by a black licorice note. After over 6 hours in an open bottle, the wine is just now becoming smooth.

A nice little Argentinian wine for me tonight! Not mind blowing, but plus points for having personality and being spicy, just like the Argentinian *people* I know personally. This wine was clearly made in a more ambitious style back in the day, and it may have many years left still.",3,1768635045.0,wine,1,1.0,False

1qf6xjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1qf6xjn/a_onebreath_meditation/,A One-Breath Meditation,"Breathe.

Deeper.

Fill your lungs, then use your stomach, your diaphragm to purposefully continue filling your body with as much air as it can hold.

Take a moment to realize how much extra air you can inhale beyond your usual, weaker breaths.

As you slowly exhale, allow your body to relax. Once you feel you have exhaled enough, keep going. Use your diaphragm once more to purposefully press the air out of your lungs.

Hold still a moment, completely empty, and understand how much air you usually hold onto.

Slowly relax again and begin to breathe slowly, calmly, but deeply. You may feel light-headed for a moment. Let your breathing return to normal.

We are capable of so much more than we think. Our limits are hardly ever reached. To reach them takes thought, intention, desire, and calm strength.

Once a day, take 1 breath. You can do that. I know you can. All the way in, all the way out.

The physical benefits are actually pretty extreme, but the most important is what I think of as an aerial massage. You are stretching muscles and organs in a way that promotes circulation, strength, and relaxation all at once.

The psychological benefits are intense. Like counting to 10, one deep breath takes you out of your situation and reminds you of the basics. How important is your stressor? Does feeling anxious and rushed help or hinder you in completing your tasks?

I’m not telling you to exercise 30 minutes, buy a fancy machine or new sneakers, figure out a schedule or diet or sport. I’m saying take one breath everyday that is just for you.

Maybe while your coffee is reheating in the microwave. Maybe right after you brush your teeth. Maybe in line at the grocery store. It doesn’t take time or equipment or anything. It’s that simple, really.

Just breathe, once, and remember your potential.",4,1768634936.0,Meditation,0,1.0,False
1qf6x4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1qf6x4b/ran_into_her_tonight/,Ran into her tonight.,"TL;DR - The last time I talked to her, she said she was finishing up a book. One year later, I ran into her while ""finishing up"" mine.

The last time I saw her was over a year ago, where, after a few months of shallow interaction (the kind that penetrates to the depths of one's soul), I found myself on the receiving end of an intense feeling in the chest, accompanied by an urge to ""write a book"" that somehow she would play a central role in. In a way, she did.

I did not know how to pitch something like this to her. Lucky for me, I didn't have to. Because in our last conversation, she fortuitously mentioned in passing that *she* was writing a book, and that it was ""almost finished."" I don't even know what her book is called or where to find it, given that she ghosted me soon after and uses a pseudonym. Maybe she is still ""almost finished.""

Needless to say (as being one with the attention span of a doomscrolling pugilist), writing a book was not on my bucket list. I was going to school for something much more practical, but life events redirected me towards ""writing a book"" as though I were being called to write a new entry for the Bible.

Though I had been told to write a novel since the age I assumed there were new stories to tell, I thought authorship to be a literary lottery ticket where winners take all and losers serve overpriced coffee to people with real jobs, deep pockets, and no taste. Waiter is only *a* letter away from writer, after all. Nonetheless, I begrudgingly wrote on.

Long story slightly shorter, after a few months of asking the universe *why* she would ghost me and a few months of answering myself, I finally wrote the ending to my own book last night. Though by no stretch finished, and by no means published, at long last, I decided on the most congruent ending in line with the theme of the book. You could say that it is most \[un\]satisfactorily, ""almost finished.""

1qf6sg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/embarrass/comments/1qf6sg4/a_window_really_is_a_window/,A window really is a window,"I was allowed to work from home for much of this past summer. I used the dining room table for my work station and opened the blinds to let in  the morning sunshine.



Being a home nudist, I inspected the window from the sidewalk to ensure that pane appeared dark from the outside.  I began working blissfully wearing  nary a stitch and soon got the feel of the neighborhood. There were early dog walkers at seven o'clock and retired seniors strolling the block at eight. Around ten o'clock the work from crowd stretched their legs on a short break then again at noon.



An attractive looking Asian woman often happened along around the quarter past eight mark on the clock. I only mention her ethnicity because I looked for her in the local grocery store after this incident, unsure whether to offer a friendly greeting or hide from a possibly embarrassing confrontation.



The woman would stop on the sidewalk outside my window and marvel at my front garden. I took this as a compliment as I was quite proud of the ornamental trees and flowering shrubs bordering an array of flowers which offered blooms throughout the season. I had put quite an effort into creating and maintaining this superb curbside appeal which, if I may say so, was superior to my neighbors' efforts.



One bright and shiny morning I was refilling my coffee cup in the kitchen and saw the woman again standing on the sidewalk in complete awe of my garden. I was pondering the idea of pushing myself out of my prison of shyness, don some clothing and and go outside to talk with the woman. I had myself almost convinced to do just that but when setting my coffee cup down on the dining room table a pained expression crossed the woman's face.



Standing there, I watched the woman chortle with a hand on her abdomin as if caught in a severe bowl cramp. What a humorous coincidence, I thought, that the woman would suffer a gas attack on my front sidewalk blocks away from her own toilet.



Then, standing completely naked at the dining room table,  a horrifying thought passed through my mind. Fearfully, I slowly raised my hand and waved at the woman. She waved back! My knees suddenly buckled and I clenched the back of my chair with both hands to stay upright. The woman's hand rose from her stomach to cover her mouth in a look of embarrassed astonishment. For several seconds we stared at each other while a slight breeze fluttered the red leaves of a Japaneses maple and birds twittered merrily from the boulevard oak. 



The woman's face flushed red and she walked away in the hurried gait of a guilty person. I sat down heavily in my chair, ass cheeks smacking noisily on the solid wood seat and  pain resonating through the two orbs in my scrotum. 



The woman did not return the next morning nor any morning since that fretful encounter. After a week of watching for her I began shutting down my work station at eight o'clock and walking the neighborhood in search of her. I did not find her. I looked for her in the local grocery store, the pharmacy, the liquor store and every car window flashing past. 



I assumed she was embarrassed at having been caught looking at me yet was is I who should feel the shame. The woman was twice my age yet she resided in my daytime thoughts and nighttime dreams. How I wanted to meet her face to face yet terrified to do so.",1,1768634422.0,embarrass,0,1.0,False

At the moment I read on a Kindle with a backlight, and I’m very happy with it. It’s jailbroken and I use KOReader, which works perfectly for me.

That said, I’m currently trying to push my digital minimalism a bit further. For the past few days, I’ve blocked social media during the day until 8 PM. Yesterday was my first full day without Instagram at all, only one hour of Reddit after 8 PM.

In theory, I could imagine always having the X4 in my pocket and using it during very short waiting moments instead of pulling out my smartphone. For example: standing at the coffee machine at work, waiting for my food, waiting for a pizza, things like that. Really short moments. Not all the time, of course, but maybe most of the time.

1qf6rsn,https://i.redd.it/bmq9fj802vdg1.jpeg,Jessi and Demi swung together.,"I haven’t seen anyone else talk about this. But I have a theory that Jessi and Demi were swinging together. It might sound like a reach but I’ve watched the show several times and it makes so much sense. Here’s my reasoning: 

I first suspected this after watching S2 that Demi and Jessi likely swung together (or their Mormon version of swinging anyway) and that’s what made their friendship get messy. They were inseparable until things went left. Jen alluded to Jessi and Jordan being swingers during the confrontation at the coffee shop in S2. She ends the conversation saying something like “and if you guys are asking me to swing with you, the answer is no”. And Jessi’s shock in response didn’t seem genuine. Obviously this didn’t come from nowhere. Taylor and Miranda were at the heart of the swinging scandal, not Jessi. So why would Jen say this? She must have heard it from someone else in the group that Jessi and Jordan swing. 

Also in S2, they got a confession for Sinner Sunday that Bret slept with someone in the group while Demi was away. Was it Jessi? Even if Jessi was away with Demi at the villa, was it confirmed that they flew out together at the same time? Demi sounded so assured that this never happened when it came up with the girls, but when Demi and Bret were at the bakery store she didn’t seem so confident. They forgot they were still mic’d when they left the store and it was clear that there was truth to Bret sleeping with someone else. 

If it wasn’t Jessi, was it Jordan??? Brett and Jordan were literal butt buddies in the earlier seasons, especially S2. The way Jordan screamed at Chase when he “shoved” Demi was strange. I don’t think it was because it was his house or because it was his friend’s wife, I think they were also veryyyy close like Demi and Jessi. 

Also, Jessi is so insecure she will do anything to feel validated or loved. Jessi was probably open to swinging because of how insecure she was and Jordan probably pressured her so they could make their marriage work. And she probably gave in just to make him happy but then when they swung with Brett and Demi, Jordan was maybe more excited about it than Jessi cared for. And it probably triggered a massive insecurity. Because as people keep pointing out, Jessi keeps getting plastic surgery and looks more like Demi each time. 

And why did they both go after Marciano? It was some weird middle school jealous competition over a guy. Jessi said in her therapy session she wanted to be validated that she was good enough like Demi was by Marciano. Not a coincidence. And why was Brett so invested in the drama between Demi and Jessi to drive by her house like a fucking weirdo?

They were superrrr close and then it suddenly gets really weird between them. It went from love to hate so fast. Something happened off camera that no one has explained for the massive shift between them. 

Also, Demi is always sooo vocal about how she could never be with a woman. Especially during the break the taboo sex party. She kept commenting how she could neverrrrr. We all know it’s always those people that are just projecting their internalized homophobia. 

Idk there are even more things I can think of if I go back and watch but my partner and I both think it makes total sense. What do you guys think? ",50,1768634363.0,SecretsOfMormonWives,9,0.88,False

I didn't collect every single thing... I've been more of a ""pick and choose"" type collector - basically, the things that particularly struck my fancy I bought.

In 1999 Dark Horse released their first Hellboy metal lunchbox. They later released a second Hellboy lunchbox, and then a Hellboy and the BPRD lunchbox, but I never got around to acquiring those.

In 2000 Graphitti Designs released a BPRD logo t-shirt. That was a no-brainer ""must have.""

In the summer of 2002 Dark Horse released four Hellboy t-shirts... I bought 3 of them - Hellboy Icons, Hellboy with Fire, and a BPRD left chest logo.

At the end of 2002 Dark Horse released a BPRD coffee mug. I've never liked coffee, so I've just used it as a spare change cup.

In 2003 Dark Horse Deluxe released a set of BPRD stationery - 8 letter sheets, 6 envelopes, and a set of stickers.

In 2004 Dark Horse Deluxe released two versions of a Hellboy Talking Board (aka Ouija board) - I have the deluxe, limited edition hardwood boxed version, #308/500.

In 2007 Dark Horse Deluxe released a sculpted Lobster Johnson magnet, based on his appearance in the *Hellboy: Blood and Iron* animated film. I've always wanted to give him a better paint job, but I've just never gotten around to it.

In 2008 Dark Horse Deluxe released a Lobster Johnson logo t-shirt.

In 2010 the Mignolas released an [artofmikemignola.com](http://artofmikemignola.com) Skeleton Head t-shirt. And in 2011 they released a Skeleton Head button set. The BPRD button was from Dark Horse, but I don't remember where or when I acquired that one.

Also in 2011, Fez-o-rama released their first limited edition Mignola Fez. They went on to release a Hellboy Fez, a 20th Anniversary Hellboy Fez, and a BPRD Fez. I didn't get any of those, since I didn't keep up with their social media, and missed out.

Completing The Stranger took me more than a month, which I usually used to complete in 20 days. I don't wanna lose interest in reading, but I'm losing it, I guess. I'm feeling more and more anxious nowadays. Like, I'm missing out on something. I'm missing out on life. I'm really a melancholic person. I bring sadness with me wherever I go. I guess I am hated by people because of this. I feel like I'm losing my patience, like I have zero patience. I can't focus on things. I can't even watch YouTube videos, can't read, can't crochet.

""Can we talk?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling like a leaf in the wind. I nodded, stepping inside the familiar house. Now hers alone, the other man long gone, vanished like a bad dream, I had heard through Emma's casual mentions. The air smelled of her perfume, a scent that hit me like a punch, stirring ghosts. She poured coffee with hands shaking so badly the liquid sloshed, steam curling up like unspoken words. We sat at the kitchen table, the same one where we had shared so many meals.  

As I stared into the dark brew, the steam blurring my vision, memories crashed over me like waves on the Oregon coast. It all flooded back, the cracked sidewalk in front of our old Victorian house in Des Moines, Iowa, the kind with peeling white paint and a wraparound porch where we had spent countless summer evenings. The late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lawn, turning the grass a golden hue that mocked the emptiness gnawing at my chest. My truck idling in the driveway, packed to the brim with boxes of clothes, books, and the few mementos I could not bear to leave behind. A faded photo of us on our wedding day. Emma's first drawing of our family as stick figures holding hands. I gripped the keys so hard the metal bit into my palm, drawing a thin line of blood I barely noticed. The pain was nothing compared to the void inside, a hollow ache that had settled in my bones since Leah's confession.  

That house had been my sanctuary, the fulfillment of a dream I had carried since I was a kid bouncing between foster homes in the flatlands of Nebraska. Orphaned at five after a car crash that stole my parents in a screech of metal and shattered glass, I had grown up craving family like a starving man craves bread. No holidays with relatives, no bedtime stories from a mom who smelled of lavender, no dad teaching me to throw a baseball under the vast Midwest sky. Just a string of temporary roofs, cold foster parents who meant well but never stayed, and the constant whisper of loneliness that followed me like a shadow. I had vowed to build something real, something unbreakable, a family that would fill the gaps in my soul. And for a while, with Leah and Emma, I thought I had. But as I stared at the house one last time, it felt like a cruel illusion, crumbling before my eyes.  

I glanced up at the bedroom window on the second floor, where the curtains fluttered gently in the breeze. How many nights had I lain there with Leah in my arms, her breath warm against my neck, whispering about our future while the crickets sang outside? The kitchen light was on. I could almost smell the apple pie she would bake on Sundays, the cinnamon wafting through the air as Emma giggled and smeared flour on her cheeks, her tiny hands reaching up to help. The swing set in the backyard creaked faintly, a ghost of laughter echoing in my mind. Emma's squeals as I pushed her higher and higher, her pigtails flying, Leah watching from the porch with that soft smile that made my heart flip, her eyes shining with a love I believed was eternal.  

But it was all tainted, poisoned by betrayal. Leah had chosen someone else, a colleague from her new job, and she wanted out. The divorce papers were signed, custody arranged. Shared, but with her as primary since I was the one leaving. For Emma's sake, I had said through gritted teeth. For her happiness, I had convinced myself, even as my world imploded. Revenge? No, that was not love. Love was letting go, even if it tore you apart from the inside, leaving you raw and bleeding. I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand, the tears hot and unbidden, blurring the house into a watery mirage. One last look, and I climbed into the truck, the engine rumbling like a reluctant farewell. As I pulled out onto the quiet street, the house shrinking in the rearview mirror, the memories flooded in like a Midwest storm. Unstoppable. Drenching. Each one a fresh wound.  

It started in college, at Iowa State, where the campus sprawled under endless blue skies. I was twenty-one, studying business administration on a scholarship that barely covered ramen noodles and late-night cramming sessions in the dim library lights. Leah was in my economics class, with her auburn hair tied back in a ponytail and eyes like the clear blue skies over the cornfields. She sat two rows ahead, always scribbling notes with a furrowed brow, her focus so intense it drew me in. One day, after a brutal midterm that left me questioning everything, I mustered the courage to approach her in the library, my heart hammering like a drum. ""Hey, uh, want to study together? I could use a partner who actually understands supply curves."" My voice cracked, betraying my nerves, but she laughed. A sound like wind chimes on a breezy day. And said yes, her smile lighting up the room.  

Our first date was at a little diner off campus, the kind with vinyl booths cracked from years of use and bottomless coffee that tasted like burnt ambition. We talked for hours, the world outside fading away. Her about growing up in a big, noisy family in rural Illinois, surrounded by siblings and holiday chaos that I could only imagine. Me about my foster days, skirting the edges of the loneliness without diving too deep, afraid it would scare her off. She ordered pancakes at midnight, drowning them in syrup, and I watched her lick the stickiness from her fingers, my heart pounding with a mix of awe and desire. ""You're different,"" she said, her foot brushing mine under the table, sending sparks up my leg. ""Real. Not like the others."" We walked back to her dorm under a canopy of stars, the crisp autumn air nipping at our cheeks, leaves crunching underfoot. When I kissed her goodnight, soft and tentative, it felt like coming home for the first time in my life, a warmth spreading through the cold places inside me.  

Dating blurred into something deeper, more vital than air. Weekends driving through the rolling hills of the Midwest, the wind whipping through open windows as we sang along to the radio. Picnics by the Des Moines River with sandwiches she would pack. Ham and cheese, always with extra mustard for me, because she remembered the little things. We would hike in the state parks, her hand in mine, warm and steady, laughing as we splashed through shallow streams, the water cold against our skin. She met my few friends from foster care reunions, awkward gatherings where I felt like an outsider, but she made them laugh, drawing me in with her ease. I met her boisterous family, feeling enveloped in their warmth like a blanket on a winter night, their hugs and stories filling a void I had not realized was so vast. Proposals were not grand in our world, no fireworks or orchestras. I got down on one knee in our tiny apartment after graduation, a simple gold band I had saved for months to buy, working extra shifts at a warehouse. ""Leah, you're my family now,"" I said, voice thick with emotion, tears pricking my eyes. She cried, nodding furiously, and we married in a small church in her hometown, surrounded by wildflowers blooming in the fields and the hum of cicadas in the heat. Her white dress flowed like a dream, simple lace hugging her curves, and as we exchanged vows, my voice trembling, I thought, this is it. I have made it. The orphan boy had found his forever home.  

Life after marriage was bliss in the mundane, the everyday miracles that built our world. We moved to Des Moines for my entry-level job at a logistics firm, her teaching elementary school with a passion that lit her up. Our first home was a cramped rental, walls thin enough to hear the neighbors' arguments, but we made it ours. Painting them a soft yellow that reminded us of sunflowers in summer, hanging photos of our adventures on every surface. Mornings, I would wake to her humming in the kitchen, brewing coffee that smelled like comfort and promise, her sleepy smile greeting me as I wrapped my arms around her waist. Evenings, we would collapse on the couch after long days, her feet in my lap as we watched old movies, my fingers tracing lazy circles on her ankle, the flicker of the screen illuminating her face. Intimacy was tender, passionate, a dance of bodies and souls. Her skin soft under my touch, her gasps in the dark, whispers of love that echoed in my heart long after.  

Then came the day she told me she was pregnant, a moment etched in my soul like a scar of joy. It was a rainy Tuesday, the kind where the sky weeps endlessly. I came home soaked from a downpour, shaking water from my coat like a drowned dog. She was on the couch, curled up with a blanket, holding a plastic stick, her eyes wide and sparkling with unshed tears. ""We're having a baby,"" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the patter of rain on the windows. I dropped to my knees right there, the carpet rough under me, pulling her into my arms as sobs of happiness shook me. Tears mingled with rain on my face as I kissed her belly, imagining the tiny life inside, a heartbeat joining ours. ""Our family,"" I murmured, the word tasting like victory after all those lonely years, a balm on old wounds.  

Emma arrived on a snowy February night, the world blanketed in white silence broken only by her cries piercing the hospital room like a siren of joy. I held her first, her wrinkled face peering up at me through half-closed eyes, tiny fingers wrapping around mine with surprising strength. Something in my chest unlocked then, a fierce, protective love I had never known, flooding me with a warmth that chased away the shadows of my past. Life shifted into a beautiful chaos that I cherished. Midnight feedings where I would rock her in the glider, the wooden arms creaking softly, Leah's head on my shoulder as we whispered about her future. Lazy Sundays building forts in the living room, pillows and blankets tumbling as Emma's laughter filled the air like music. I would come home from work to find them baking cookies, flour dusting their noses and the counter, Emma's chubby hands patting dough. I would sweep them both into a hug, inhaling the scent of vanilla and home, my heart so full it ached. Barbecues in the backyard with neighbors, the grill smoke curling up as Emma toddled after fireflies, her delighted squeals piercing the twilight. Holidays where we would decorate a tree, ornaments glinting in the lights as we sang carols off-key, Emma clapping along. I was happy. Deeply, profoundly, in a way that healed the boy who had once cried himself to sleep in strange beds. Watching my dream unfold in the heart of the Midwest, where life moved slow and steady like the Mississippi, I felt complete.  

But cracks appeared when Emma turned five, insidious and slow like frost creeping across a window. Leah had stayed home those early years, her days filled with playdates and story times, but she itched for more, a restlessness I saw in her distant gazes. ""I love being a mom,"" she said one evening over dinner, poking at her lasagna with her fork, her eyes not meeting mine. ""But I miss teaching. I need something for me, Eric. Something outside these walls."" I nodded, swallowing my unease, the orphan heart in me whispering fears of abandonment, of being left behind again. But I pushed it down, forcing a smile. ""Of course,"" I said, squeezing her hand across the table, her skin cool. ""We'll make it work. I want you happy.""  

And we did, at first, patchwork adjustments that held for a while. She landed a job at a local school, her eyes lighting up as she prepped lesson plans late into the night, papers scattered across the kitchen table. I adjusted my own schedule. Dropping Emma at daycare in the mornings, her backpack slung over her shoulder, her wave goodbye tugging at my heart. Handling dinners alone. Burnt grilled cheese the first few times, smoke filling the kitchen as I cursed under my breath, but I learned, experimenting with recipes to surprise them. Laundry piled up in baskets, but I would fold it late at night, the rhythmic motion soothing my growing anxiety. Weekends became sacred, precious islands in the week. Family outings to the zoo in Omaha, Emma's eyes wide at the lions, or apple picking in the orchards, her sticky hands clutching ours as juice dripped down her chin. I adapted because I loved her, because family meant sacrifice, meant holding on even when it hurt.  

Yet, she grew distant, a slow fade that chipped away at us. Evenings, she would come home exhausted, collapsing on the couch with her phone in hand, scrolling through messages instead of cuddling up to me, her body language a barrier. Conversations turned clipped, shallow. ""How was your day?"" I would ask, hopeful, only to be met with ""Fine,"" her tone flat. Intimacy faded like a dying ember. Nights I would reach for her in the dark, my hand on her hip, only to feel her tense and turn away, mumbling about tiredness. I felt her slipping, like sand through desperate fingers, grains of our life escaping. ""What's wrong?"" I would ask, heart pounding in the quiet of our bedroom, the silence heavy. ""Nothing,"" she would snap, then soften with a sigh. ""Just tired, Eric. Work is a lot."" I tried harder, desperation fueling me. Surprise dates to our old diner, flowers from the market wilting on the counter, notes left in her lunch. But the gap widened, a chasm I could not bridge. Anxiety started to get the better of me.  

Then, the bombshell exploded, shattering everything. It was a humid July evening, the air thick and sticky, fireflies dancing outside like mocking stars as Emma played in the yard, her laughter a cruel contrast to the storm brewing inside. Leah sat me down in the living room, her hands wringing a napkin to shreds, fibers falling like snow, her face pale as if she'd seen a ghost. ""I've met someone,"" she said, voice barely above a whisper, her eyes fixed on the floor, unable to meet mine. ""At work. I... I want a divorce."" The words hung in the air like a death sentence, and the room spun violently, colors blurring into a nauseating swirl. My chest constricted, a vise squeezing the air from my lungs, breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps that burned my throat like acid. ""What?"" I choked out, standing abruptly, the coffee table wobbling under my hand as my legs threatened to give way. Tears burned my eyes, hot and relentless, spilling over as images assaulted me. Her with him, laughing in secret corners, touching in ways that were supposed to be ours alone, her body entwined with a stranger's while I sat at home waiting, oblivious, loving. ""How long?"" I demanded, voice cracking like brittle ice underfoot, my hands trembling as I gripped the back of a chair to stay upright. ""Months,"" she admitted, finally looking up, her own eyes glistening but resolute, no trace of the woman who once promised forever. Betrayal knifed through me, hot and sharp, twisting deep in my gut, a physical agony that doubled me over, making me gasp as if I'd been punched. I paced the room, fists clenched so tight my nails drew blood, palms slick and stinging, wanting to scream until my throat bled, to shatter the windows with my bare hands, to fall to my knees and beg her to take it back, to say it was a nightmare we could wake from. But Emma's laughter filtered in from outside, innocent and pure, a reminder of what mattered most, piercing my heart like glass shards. I collapsed into a chair, sobs wracking my body, shoulders heaving as waves of grief crashed over me, drowning me in despair so profound it felt like dying from the inside out. ""Why?"" I whispered, the word a broken plea torn from my raw throat, tasting of salt and utter devastation, my world fracturing into irreparable pieces around me. She cried too, tears streaming down her cheeks, but her resolve held like an unyielding wall between us, sealing my fate. That night, I slept on the couch, or tried to, the fabric scratching my skin like accusations, my mind a whirlwind of shattered dreams, each memory now a shard cutting deeper, replaying her words like a loop of torture, my body curled in fetal position, silent screams echoing in my chest until dawn broke, indifferent and cruel.  

The divorce dragged on, a torturous blur of lawyers' offices smelling of stale coffee and regret, papers slicing like razors through what remained of my heart, each signature a fresh laceration. I signed, numb and hollow, for Emma's sake. For hers, though it killed me. ""Be happy,"" I said at the end, voice hollow as an empty well, as she took Emma's hand. But Emma, my little girl who adored me with a fierceness that mirrored my own, clung to my leg, her tiny face crumpling in confusion and pain. ""Daddy, don't go!"" she wailed, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks, her sobs piercing my soul like shards of glass, each one a fresh agony that made my knees buckle. I knelt on the porch, hugging her tight, her small body shaking against mine, her tears soaking my shirt as she buried her face in my neck, her little fists clutching my collar as if she could hold me there forever. ""I'll visit, Bug. I promise. Daddy loves you more than the stars,"" I whispered, my voice breaking, tears mingling with hers as I inhaled her scent, baby shampoo and innocence, one last time, my heart splintering with every breath. But as I pried her fingers away, gentle but firm, her cries escalated into heartbroken howls that echoed in my ears like a dagger twisting deeper, leaving me gasping, vision blurred, as I stumbled to the truck, the world tilting, every step away from her feeling like tearing my own flesh.  

In the truck heading to the airport, those memories replayed like a cruel film reel, looping endlessly. I boarded the plane to Portland, Oregon. Across the country, far from the Midwest's endless fields that now felt like graves of my past. The flight was turbulent, mirroring my soul's storm, and when I landed, the misty rain felt like tears from the sky, cold and unrelenting.  

My new apartment overlooked the Pacific, waves crashing relentlessly against the rocks below, their roar a constant reminder of the turmoil inside. I landed a job at a logistics company, managing shipments. Numbers and routes to distract from the ache that gnawed at my core. But the depression crept in like fog off the ocean, thick and suffocating, wrapping around me until I could barely breathe. Mornings, I dragged myself from bed, the sheets twisted like my thoughts, forcing down dry toast that stuck in my throat, coffee bitter and scalding. At work, I stared at screens until my eyes burned, fingers tapping keys mechanically, colleagues' voices fading into white noise. Evenings, I wandered the waterfront, rain soaking my jacket, the salt spray stinging my face as I watched couples stroll hand in hand, their laughter a knife twist. I stopped eating properly, picking at microwave meals that grew cold on the counter, my reflection in the window showing hollow cheeks and shadowed eyes, a ghost staring back. Sleep came in fits, jolted by dreams where Leah's face morphed into accusation, Emma's cries echoing until I woke gasping, sweat-soaked, clutching the pillow like a lifeline. The loneliness amplified every echo of my foster past, empty holidays spent alone, staring at the ceiling as rain pattered, the apartment's silence pressing like a weight.  

One stormy night, six months in, the darkness swallowed me whole. Rain hammered the windows like fists, wind howling through the cracks. I paced the living room, bottle of whiskey in hand, the amber liquid sloshing as I gulped it down, fire burning my throat but not touching the cold inside. Pills rattled in my pocket, white and innocuous, promising peace. I stumbled out into the gale, coat flapping like broken wings, toward the cliff's edge. Waves thrashed below, foam white and furious, calling me. ""It's over,"" I muttered, voice lost in the roar, stepping closer, toes curling over the wet rock. Tears mixed with rain, blurring the drop, my body trembling as I fumbled the bottle open. Pills spilled into my palm, cold and final. I swallowed them one by one, choking on bitterness, the world tilting as lightning split the sky. Memories surged. Emma's giggle, Leah's touch. They pushed me nearer the edge. But a shout pierced the chaos: ""Hey! Stop! Don't do it!"" A jogger in a slicker, face shadowed, lunged forward, his hand clamping my arm like iron. He yanked me back, my knees buckling into mud, vomit surging as the poison rebelled. I collapsed against him, sobs tearing free, rain pounding us both as sirens wailed closer, lights flashing red and blue through the downpour. In the hospital, IVs dripping into my veins, he sat by the bed, his grip steady. ""You got people who need you,"" he murmured, eyes kind in the sterile light. Shame flooded me then, hot and unrelenting, a new scar amid the old.

From that night, the climb began, step by agonizing step. Therapy started in a cramped office with faded posters, the therapist's chair creaking as I sank into the couch, words halting at first. ""I lost... everything,"" I stammered, fists clenching the armrests, tears spilling as I recounted the betrayal, the cliff. She nodded, pen scratching notes, her voice soft: ""Let's unpack that."" Sessions blurred. I paced the room, voice rising in anger at Leah's memory, then crumbling into sobs over Emma's photo on my phone. Runs became my escape, lacing up sneakers at dawn, feet hitting pavement as fog lifted from the bay, breath puffing in rhythm, muscles burning until exhaustion drowned the pain. One mile turned to five, sweat soaking my shirt, the endorphin rush a fleeting high that chased shadows. I joined a support group in a drafty hall, folding chairs in a circle, steam from coffee cups rising as men shared. ""She left me for my best friend,"" one grunted, fists tight, eyes red-rimmed. I nodded, my turn coming: ""Mine too... at work."" Nods rippled, a shared silence binding us, their claps on my back after like anchors. Volunteering at the foster shelter pulled me further. I sat with kids at rickety tables, guiding pencils over math problems, their frustrated sighs turning to grins at right answers. A boy with my old haunted eyes handed me a drawing, stick figures in a house, and I choked back tears, ruffling his hair. ""Looks like home,"" I whispered.

Years layered like seasons. Promotions at work. I sat in meetings, pointing at charts, voice steady as I delegated, the buzz of success filling empty spaces. Runs evolved to marathons, crossing finish lines with crowds cheering, medal heavy around my neck, legs jelly but spirit lifted. Friends emerged from the group, barbecues in backyards where burgers sizzled, laughter bubbling over beer, their stories weaving into mine. Dating flickered. A coffee with a colleague, her smile warm but fading when I pulled back, heart guarded. A walk with another, hands brushing but no spark to bridge the scar. Dreams still haunted, Leah's laugh jolting me awake, but less often, the pillow dry more nights than not. Journaling filled the gaps, pen flying across pages by lamplight, words spilling like blood from wounds closing slow. Ten years passed in this rebuild, the Midwest a distant echo until the call: ""Regional director, Des Moines branch."" Excitement warred with dread, packing boxes again, driving through plains where corn whispered secrets, each mile stirring dust on old graves. The town unchanged, diners with clinking plates, river murmuring under bridges. New house stark, work consuming: inspections in hard hats, dust clouding air, decisions snapping like commands. Emma at fifteen, lanky and bright, visits thawing from awkward silences over cones, drips on chins, tentative laughs, to cheers at her games, my throat raw from yells, her hugs fierce.

And now, here we were, the flashbacks dissolving like mist, leaving me in the kitchen light, coffee cooling between us. Tears welled in Leah's eyes as she looked at me, her face pale and drawn with exhaustion. She clutched the mug like a lifeline, knuckles white, tears spilling over. Her lower lip trembled violently, and she bit down hard on it, teeth sinking in to stifle the sob building in her throat, a thin trickle of blood welling up from the pressure, metallic taste flooding her mouth as she fought to hold back the flood.

""Eric,"" she said, her voice cracking, breath shaky, the words escaping in a raw whisper laced with agony. ""I... I made a mistake. A huge one.""

She paused, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand, her lip trembling more, another bite to clamp down the rising wail, blood smearing slightly on her chin, the pain a sharp anchor against the emotional torrent threatening to consume her. ""He wasn't you. Not even close. It was... exciting, at first. Stupid thrill. But then? Empty. Just so damn empty.""

Her fingers tightened on the mug until her nails dug into her palms, tears dripping onto the table in heavy splats, her body shuddering with suppressed cries, chest heaving as if each breath was a battle. ""I see it now, what I threw away. Our life. The love we had. Our family. It haunts me, Eric. Every single day. I wake up and... and it's there, the regret. Eating at me, tearing me apart from the inside.""

She reached across, her hand hovering, desperate, fingers quivering before dropping back, her face contorting in anguish, another fierce bite on her lip, blood now freely trickling, mixing with tears as they streamed down her cheeks, her eyes red-rimmed and pleading, raw with years of self-inflicted torment. ""Please. Can we try again? I love you. I never stopped. Not once. Emma needs us, together. And I... I need you. God, it hurts without you, like a knife twisting every moment, every breath.""

Her words sliced through me, raw and unrelenting, stirring up the old ache like a storm ripping open scars. My chest tightened, breath catching, tears blurring my vision as I shook my head, pulling my hand away.

""Leah... don't. Don't do this to me now."" My voice broke, thick with the pain surging back. ""I can't... I don't know if I can handle it.""

I buried my face in my hands for a moment, shoulders tense, fighting the wave. ""It took everything to get through this. To heal. To just... survive without you. Waking up every day, not wanting to end it all.""

The cliff memory hit hard, the rain, the pills, and I shuddered, voice dropping low. ""My heart's still broken. Pieces everywhere. I barely glued them back.""

""I'm scared, Leah. Terrified. If it happens again, the betrayal, the loss, it'd kill me. Flat out.""

Tears tracked down my face, unchecked, my words coming out ragged. ""I'm sorry. I need time. I love you, always have. Love our kid more than anything. Loved that life we had, the one you... you ended.""

""But the hurt? Back then, it nearly destroyed me. And now? This is ripping it all open again. Scars I thought were gone.""

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, standing on unsteady legs. ""I can't. Not yet. Maybe someday. Or... or never.""
She folded in on herself then, face in her hands, quiet cries escalating into guttural sobs that shook her frame violently, her bitten lip bleeding steadily now, the metallic tang a futile dam against the overwhelming grief, the sound echoing years of my own buried torment, raw and visceral in the quiet kitchen. I turned, walking out into the night, the Midwest stars cold overhead, indifferent as ever. The pain bloomed fresh, a reopened wound pulsing with every step, but deep beneath it, something fragile flickered. Hope? Fear? Forgiveness? I couldn't tell. Only that my shattered dream lingered in the pieces, whispering of what was lost, and what might never mend.",1,1768633444.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1qf6elx,https://i.redd.it/kzfn0og8yudg1.jpeg,"My first buy & first review here - Dior Sauvage, Afnan Supremacy CE..","Hey guys! I (M27) have been a member of this sub for months and it has turned my info a fraghead! So finally I ordered these decants from Imran—

1. Dior Sauvage EDT (Fresh, Citrusy 🍋‍🟩) — 9/10
My first designer and.. yeah now I get the hype. The opening is clean & strong without being overwhelming. The combination of Citrus & Levender feels premium! The smell feels familiar cause so many brands copy it – but when you smell the OG you understand the difference. I used Wild Stone's Code Iridium and it smelled 90% similar to this only it gave a synthetic feeling. This is why in drydown it didn't give me a unique feeling, great perfume nevertheless. Yeah if you wanna buy the cheapest body perfume that is closest to Sauvage, go for Code Iridium. Lasted about 4 hours on my skin, way less than I expected.

2. Lattafa Fakhar (Fresh, Soft 🩵) — 8/10
Clone of YSL Y they say.. Fresh, clean, office-safe and surprisingly good in the drydown. Apple + lime freshness with a noticeable ginger hit that adds a fresh spicy touch. Also the base note of Cedar is what I loved! Opening felt a bit familiar (similar DNA exists everywhere), but the drydown has depth and feels much better than cheap freshies or deos. Not dark or ""wow"" but clean & sophisticated. Surprisingly lasted more than 12 hours on my shirt! 

3. Armaf CDNIM PP (Overhyped 🤐) — 6/10
I’m sorry but I'm being honest. The opening is very harsh and synthetic — straight-up lemon cleaner / phenyl vibes. Drydown feels average. I didn't expect Armaf's perfume to be so cheap. That opening is a deal breaker for me cause there are far better fragrances that don't smell this cheap. Overhyped IMO.

4. Lattafa Asad (Dark, Masculine 🔥) — 9.5/10
A little backstory on this – So I was gifted this by my uncle, it was a deodrant variant (from USA) and back then I wasn't into fragrances much, It didn't have that appeal but it grew on me heavily! And so I ordered a 2ml version (just wanted to check the genuinity of the seller) and it is same as the deo. Only difference is in the opening, the perfume has a stronger & spicier opening, a bit synthetic for a minute but once it dries down... WOW! The combination of Black pepper, Tobacco & pineapple is sexy & then coffee + vanilla kicks in. Projection is great! Very strong if you spray 4-5 sprays. Winner by personal taste 🏆. Lasted about 8 hours on my skin. If you like dark, strong, manly scents – this is it.

5. Afnan Supremacy Collector's Edition (Sweet & Sexy ❤️‍🔥) — 9.5/10
First reaction after spraying - ""WOW!""
Sweet opening that feels smooth & premium, not harsh or synthetic. This is one of those scents you keep going back to smell again and again. What I'm really impressed is how premium and well balanced it feels. The fruity notes do not scream & overwhelm, they float in air confidently. The drydown is equally impressing, it has this smoky, musky feeling, very classy. I tested Sauvage & this side by side and It really gave Sauvage a tough competition! It lasted more than 10 hours which is great too. Great stuff, definitely in my top 5 signature scents along with Asad.

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too 🪝-up-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk, i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk, tell me about your passions, not just your day

not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. I'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. If you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

im a very direct person because I value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because I'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk. It's never to be uncomfortable, but always to be clear.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.

1qf65sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qf65sy/the_psychology_of_getting_dangerously_motivated/,The Psychology of Getting DANGEROUSLY Motivated (Science-Backed Tactics That Actually Work),"You know what's wild? I spent months researching peak performance, combing through neuroscience papers, interviewing high achievers, and reading every dopamine-related study I could find. And I discovered something that completely changed how I approach motivation. Most people are chasing it wrong. They're waiting to ""feel motivated"" before taking action. That's backwards. That's why you're stuck.

Here's what actually works, backed by science and real world results.

**1. Your brain runs on dopamine hits, not vague dreams**

Stop setting fuzzy goals like ""get fit"" or ""be successful."" Your brain literally cannot compute that. [Dr. Andrew Huberman's](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) research on dopamine shows your nervous system needs concrete milestones to trigger motivation circuits. Instead of ""I want to lose weight,"" say ""I'm doing 20 pushups today at 7am."" The specificity creates a neural pathway your brain can actually follow.

I tested this myself. Changed ""read more"" to ""read 10 pages before coffee."" Suddenly my brain knew exactly what to chase. The clarity itself became addictive.

**2. Motion creates emotion, not the other way around**

This comes straight from Mel Robbins' work and honestly it sounds too simple to work but it does. You don't wait to feel like going to the gym. You count backwards from 5 and physically move your body before your brain can talk you out of it. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO.

Your feelings follow your actions, not vice versa. I know it sounds like some motivational poster bullshit but there's actual science here. The prefrontal cortex takes 5 seconds to kill a good impulse. So you have to move faster than your own excuses.

**3. Stop romanticizing struggle**

Nobody talks about this but constantly consuming motivational content actually makes you LESS motivated. It gives you a dopamine hit without doing anything. Your brain thinks it accomplished something just by watching that 15 minute YouTube video about discipline.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (genuinely the most practical book on behavior change I've ever read, won multiple awards and sold over 15 million copies for a reason, this will make you question everything about how you approach goals). He calls it ""motion vs action."" Motion is planning, researching, strategizing. Action is actually doing the thing.

Cut the self help content by 80% and redirect that time into literally any form of action. Even shitty imperfect action beats perfect planning every single time.

**4. Your environment is secretly destroying your willpower**

You cannot discipline your way out of a bad environment. Period. If there are cookies on your counter you will eat them eventually. If your phone is on your nightstand you will scroll before bed. If your gym bag isn't packed you will skip the workout.

Make the good behavior the path of least resistance. I started using an app called Ash that literally coaches you through restructuring your environment for better habits. It's like having a behavioral psychologist in your pocket. The AI asks you questions about your space and routines then gives you specific changes to make. Insanely good for identifying the invisible friction points killing your motivation.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom podcasts around your specific goals. Type in something like ""build discipline"" or ""overcome procrastination"" and it generates an adaptive learning plan tailored to you, with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples and context.

The voice customization is ridiculously good, there's this smoky, sarcastic tone that somehow makes neuroscience digestible at 6am. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask questions to your virtual coach Freedia, which beats rewinding a regular podcast five times trying to catch one concept. For anyone serious about understanding the psychology behind behavior change instead of just collecting motivational quotes, it's been a solid tool for turning insights into actual practice.

**5. Stack tiny wins until momentum becomes inevitable**

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford proves that motivation follows action, not the other way around. Start absurdly small. Want to meditate? Do 3 breaths. Want to write? Do 1 sentence. Want to exercise? Do 1 pushup.

Sounds ridiculous but here's why it works, your brain doesn't distinguish between small wins and big wins in terms of dopamine release. A win is a win. So you game the system by racking up easy victories until the momentum carries you forward naturally.

I use Finch for this, it's a habit building app with a little bird that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds childish but the visual progress is weirdly powerful. You can set micro habits like ""drink water"" or ""5 minute walk"" and watching that bird evolve creates a feedback loop your brain craves.

**6. Boredom is the secret weapon nobody uses**

Every peak performer I researched had the same trait, they could tolerate boredom better than average people. They didn't need constant stimulation or variety or fun. They could show up and do the boring work day after day without needing it to be exciting.

Cal Newport covers this in Deep Work. The ability to do focused, undistracted work is becoming rare which makes it incredibly valuable. But you can't develop that ability if you're constantly feeding your brain dopamine hits through social media, notifications, and entertainment.

Try this, sit with boredom for 10 minutes without reaching for your phone. Just sit there. It will be uncomfortable as hell at first. That discomfort is your brain rewiring itself to tolerate the mundane effort that actually builds things.

**7. Identity beats willpower every single time**

This is straight from Atomic Habits but it's so important I'm repeating it. Don't say ""I want to run a marathon."" Say ""I am a runner."" The identity shift changes everything. You're not trying to motivate yourself to do something foreign. You're just acting according to who you already are.

When I stopped saying ""I should write"" and started saying ""I am a writer,"" I wrote every day for 6 months straight. The behavior became non negotiable because it was tied to my self concept, not my fleeting motivation levels.

Listen, motivation is not some mystical force that visits you randomly. It's a predictable chemical response you can engineer through specific actions. The people who seem naturally motivated aren't special, they just understand the mechanics better.

Stop waiting for inspiration. Stop consuming endless content about getting started. Your brain is wired to keep you comfortable and safe which means it will always find reasons to delay.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't filled with motivation. It's filled with action. Imperfect, unglamorous, boring action repeated until it becomes automatic.

Short Story by Eric McAlistair  

""Can we talk?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling like a leaf in the wind. I nodded, stepping inside the familiar house. Now hers alone, the other man long gone, vanished like a bad dream, I had heard through Emma's casual mentions. The air smelled of her perfume, a scent that hit me like a punch, stirring ghosts. She poured coffee with hands shaking so badly the liquid sloshed, steam curling up like unspoken words. We sat at the kitchen table, the same one where we had shared so many meals.  

As I stared into the dark brew, the steam blurring my vision, memories crashed over me like waves on the Oregon coast. It all flooded back, the cracked sidewalk in front of our old Victorian house in Des Moines, Iowa, the kind with peeling white paint and a wraparound porch where we had spent countless summer evenings. The late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lawn, turning the grass a golden hue that mocked the emptiness gnawing at my chest. My truck idling in the driveway, packed to the brim with boxes of clothes, books, and the few mementos I could not bear to leave behind. A faded photo of us on our wedding day. Emma's first drawing of our family as stick figures holding hands. I gripped the keys so hard the metal bit into my palm, drawing a thin line of blood I barely noticed. The pain was nothing compared to the void inside, a hollow ache that had settled in my bones since Leah's confession.  

That house had been my sanctuary, the fulfillment of a dream I had carried since I was a kid bouncing between foster homes in the flatlands of Nebraska. Orphaned at five after a car crash that stole my parents in a screech of metal and shattered glass, I had grown up craving family like a starving man craves bread. No holidays with relatives, no bedtime stories from a mom who smelled of lavender, no dad teaching me to throw a baseball under the vast Midwest sky. Just a string of temporary roofs, cold foster parents who meant well but never stayed, and the constant whisper of loneliness that followed me like a shadow. I had vowed to build something real, something unbreakable, a family that would fill the gaps in my soul. And for a while, with Leah and Emma, I thought I had. But as I stared at the house one last time, it felt like a cruel illusion, crumbling before my eyes.  

I glanced up at the bedroom window on the second floor, where the curtains fluttered gently in the breeze. How many nights had I lain there with Leah in my arms, her breath warm against my neck, whispering about our future while the crickets sang outside? The kitchen light was on. I could almost smell the apple pie she would bake on Sundays, the cinnamon wafting through the air as Emma giggled and smeared flour on her cheeks, her tiny hands reaching up to help. The swing set in the backyard creaked faintly, a ghost of laughter echoing in my mind. Emma's squeals as I pushed her higher and higher, her pigtails flying, Leah watching from the porch with that soft smile that made my heart flip, her eyes shining with a love I believed was eternal.  

But it was all tainted, poisoned by betrayal. Leah had chosen someone else, a colleague from her new job, and she wanted out. The divorce papers were signed, custody arranged. Shared, but with her as primary since I was the one leaving. For Emma's sake, I had said through gritted teeth. For her happiness, I had convinced myself, even as my world imploded. Revenge? No, that was not love. Love was letting go, even if it tore you apart from the inside, leaving you raw and bleeding. I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand, the tears hot and unbidden, blurring the house into a watery mirage. One last look, and I climbed into the truck, the engine rumbling like a reluctant farewell. As I pulled out onto the quiet street, the house shrinking in the rearview mirror, the memories flooded in like a Midwest storm. Unstoppable. Drenching. Each one a fresh wound.  

It started in college, at Iowa State, where the campus sprawled under endless blue skies. I was twenty-one, studying business administration on a scholarship that barely covered ramen noodles and late-night cramming sessions in the dim library lights. Leah was in my economics class, with her auburn hair tied back in a ponytail and eyes like the clear blue skies over the cornfields. She sat two rows ahead, always scribbling notes with a furrowed brow, her focus so intense it drew me in. One day, after a brutal midterm that left me questioning everything, I mustered the courage to approach her in the library, my heart hammering like a drum. ""Hey, uh, want to study together? I could use a partner who actually understands supply curves."" My voice cracked, betraying my nerves, but she laughed. A sound like wind chimes on a breezy day. And said yes, her smile lighting up the room.  

Our first date was at a little diner off campus, the kind with vinyl booths cracked from years of use and bottomless coffee that tasted like burnt ambition. We talked for hours, the world outside fading away. Her about growing up in a big, noisy family in rural Illinois, surrounded by siblings and holiday chaos that I could only imagine. Me about my foster days, skirting the edges of the loneliness without diving too deep, afraid it would scare her off. She ordered pancakes at midnight, drowning them in syrup, and I watched her lick the stickiness from her fingers, my heart pounding with a mix of awe and desire. ""You're different,"" she said, her foot brushing mine under the table, sending sparks up my leg. ""Real. Not like the others."" We walked back to her dorm under a canopy of stars, the crisp autumn air nipping at our cheeks, leaves crunching underfoot. When I kissed her goodnight, soft and tentative, it felt like coming home for the first time in my life, a warmth spreading through the cold places inside me.  

Dating blurred into something deeper, more vital than air. Weekends driving through the rolling hills of the Midwest, the wind whipping through open windows as we sang along to the radio. Picnics by the Des Moines River with sandwiches she would pack. Ham and cheese, always with extra mustard for me, because she remembered the little things. We would hike in the state parks, her hand in mine, warm and steady, laughing as we splashed through shallow streams, the water cold against our skin. She met my few friends from foster care reunions, awkward gatherings where I felt like an outsider, but she made them laugh, drawing me in with her ease. I met her boisterous family, feeling enveloped in their warmth like a blanket on a winter night, their hugs and stories filling a void I had not realized was so vast. Proposals were not grand in our world, no fireworks or orchestras. I got down on one knee in our tiny apartment after graduation, a simple gold band I had saved for months to buy, working extra shifts at a warehouse. ""Leah, you're my family now,"" I said, voice thick with emotion, tears pricking my eyes. She cried, nodding furiously, and we married in a small church in her hometown, surrounded by wildflowers blooming in the fields and the hum of cicadas in the heat. Her white dress flowed like a dream, simple lace hugging her curves, and as we exchanged vows, my voice trembling, I thought, this is it. I have made it. The orphan boy had found his forever home.  

Life after marriage was bliss in the mundane, the everyday miracles that built our world. We moved to Des Moines for my entry-level job at a logistics firm, her teaching elementary school with a passion that lit her up. Our first home was a cramped rental, walls thin enough to hear the neighbors' arguments, but we made it ours. Painting them a soft yellow that reminded us of sunflowers in summer, hanging photos of our adventures on every surface. Mornings, I would wake to her humming in the kitchen, brewing coffee that smelled like comfort and promise, her sleepy smile greeting me as I wrapped my arms around her waist. Evenings, we would collapse on the couch after long days, her feet in my lap as we watched old movies, my fingers tracing lazy circles on her ankle, the flicker of the screen illuminating her face. Intimacy was tender, passionate, a dance of bodies and souls. Her skin soft under my touch, her gasps in the dark, whispers of love that echoed in my heart long after.  

Then came the day she told me she was pregnant, a moment etched in my soul like a scar of joy. It was a rainy Tuesday, the kind where the sky weeps endlessly. I came home soaked from a downpour, shaking water from my coat like a drowned dog. She was on the couch, curled up with a blanket, holding a plastic stick, her eyes wide and sparkling with unshed tears. ""We're having a baby,"" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the patter of rain on the windows. I dropped to my knees right there, the carpet rough under me, pulling her into my arms as sobs of happiness shook me. Tears mingled with rain on my face as I kissed her belly, imagining the tiny life inside, a heartbeat joining ours. ""Our family,"" I murmured, the word tasting like victory after all those lonely years, a balm on old wounds.  

Emma arrived on a snowy February night, the world blanketed in white silence broken only by her cries piercing the hospital room like a siren of joy. I held her first, her wrinkled face peering up at me through half-closed eyes, tiny fingers wrapping around mine with surprising strength. Something in my chest unlocked then, a fierce, protective love I had never known, flooding me with a warmth that chased away the shadows of my past. Life shifted into a beautiful chaos that I cherished. Midnight feedings where I would rock her in the glider, the wooden arms creaking softly, Leah's head on my shoulder as we whispered about her future. Lazy Sundays building forts in the living room, pillows and blankets tumbling as Emma's laughter filled the air like music. I would come home from work to find them baking cookies, flour dusting their noses and the counter, Emma's chubby hands patting dough. I would sweep them both into a hug, inhaling the scent of vanilla and home, my heart so full it ached. Barbecues in the backyard with neighbors, the grill smoke curling up as Emma toddled after fireflies, her delighted squeals piercing the twilight. Holidays where we would decorate a tree, ornaments glinting in the lights as we sang carols off-key, Emma clapping along. I was happy. Deeply, profoundly, in a way that healed the boy who had once cried himself to sleep in strange beds. Watching my dream unfold in the heart of the Midwest, where life moved slow and steady like the Mississippi, I felt complete.  

But cracks appeared when Emma turned five, insidious and slow like frost creeping across a window. Leah had stayed home those early years, her days filled with playdates and story times, but she itched for more, a restlessness I saw in her distant gazes. ""I love being a mom,"" she said one evening over dinner, poking at her lasagna with her fork, her eyes not meeting mine. ""But I miss teaching. I need something for me, Eric. Something outside these walls."" I nodded, swallowing my unease, the orphan heart in me whispering fears of abandonment, of being left behind again. But I pushed it down, forcing a smile. ""Of course,"" I said, squeezing her hand across the table, her skin cool. ""We'll make it work. I want you happy.""  

And we did, at first, patchwork adjustments that held for a while. She landed a job at a local school, her eyes lighting up as she prepped lesson plans late into the night, papers scattered across the kitchen table. I adjusted my own schedule. Dropping Emma at daycare in the mornings, her backpack slung over her shoulder, her wave goodbye tugging at my heart. Handling dinners alone. Burnt grilled cheese the first few times, smoke filling the kitchen as I cursed under my breath, but I learned, experimenting with recipes to surprise them. Laundry piled up in baskets, but I would fold it late at night, the rhythmic motion soothing my growing anxiety. Weekends became sacred, precious islands in the week. Family outings to the zoo in Omaha, Emma's eyes wide at the lions, or apple picking in the orchards, her sticky hands clutching ours as juice dripped down her chin. I adapted because I loved her, because family meant sacrifice, meant holding on even when it hurt.  

Yet, she grew distant, a slow fade that chipped away at us. Evenings, she would come home exhausted, collapsing on the couch with her phone in hand, scrolling through messages instead of cuddling up to me, her body language a barrier. Conversations turned clipped, shallow. ""How was your day?"" I would ask, hopeful, only to be met with ""Fine,"" her tone flat. Intimacy faded like a dying ember. Nights I would reach for her in the dark, my hand on her hip, only to feel her tense and turn away, mumbling about tiredness. I felt her slipping, like sand through desperate fingers, grains of our life escaping. ""What's wrong?"" I would ask, heart pounding in the quiet of our bedroom, the silence heavy. ""Nothing,"" she would snap, then soften with a sigh. ""Just tired, Eric. Work is a lot."" I tried harder, desperation fueling me. Surprise dates to our old diner, flowers from the market wilting on the counter, notes left in her lunch. But the gap widened, a chasm I could not bridge. Anxiety started to get the better of me.  

Then, the bombshell exploded, shattering everything. It was a humid July evening, the air thick and sticky, fireflies dancing outside like mocking stars as Emma played in the yard, her laughter a cruel contrast to the storm brewing inside. Leah sat me down in the living room, her hands wringing a napkin to shreds, fibers falling like snow, her face pale as if she'd seen a ghost. ""I've met someone,"" she said, voice barely above a whisper, her eyes fixed on the floor, unable to meet mine. ""At work. I... I want a divorce."" The words hung in the air like a death sentence, and the room spun violently, colors blurring into a nauseating swirl. My chest constricted, a vise squeezing the air from my lungs, breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps that burned my throat like acid. ""What?"" I choked out, standing abruptly, the coffee table wobbling under my hand as my legs threatened to give way. Tears burned my eyes, hot and relentless, spilling over as images assaulted me. Her with him, laughing in secret corners, touching in ways that were supposed to be ours alone, her body entwined with a stranger's while I sat at home waiting, oblivious, loving. ""How long?"" I demanded, voice cracking like brittle ice underfoot, my hands trembling as I gripped the back of a chair to stay upright. ""Months,"" she admitted, finally looking up, her own eyes glistening but resolute, no trace of the woman who once promised forever. Betrayal knifed through me, hot and sharp, twisting deep in my gut, a physical agony that doubled me over, making me gasp as if I'd been punched. I paced the room, fists clenched so tight my nails drew blood, palms slick and stinging, wanting to scream until my throat bled, to shatter the windows with my bare hands, to fall to my knees and beg her to take it back, to say it was a nightmare we could wake from. But Emma's laughter filtered in from outside, innocent and pure, a reminder of what mattered most, piercing my heart like glass shards. I collapsed into a chair, sobs wracking my body, shoulders heaving as waves of grief crashed over me, drowning me in despair so profound it felt like dying from the inside out. ""Why?"" I whispered, the word a broken plea torn from my raw throat, tasting of salt and utter devastation, my world fracturing into irreparable pieces around me. She cried too, tears streaming down her cheeks, but her resolve held like an unyielding wall between us, sealing my fate. That night, I slept on the couch, or tried to, the fabric scratching my skin like accusations, my mind a whirlwind of shattered dreams, each memory now a shard cutting deeper, replaying her words like a loop of torture, my body curled in fetal position, silent screams echoing in my chest until dawn broke, indifferent and cruel.  

The divorce dragged on, a torturous blur of lawyers' offices smelling of stale coffee and regret, papers slicing like razors through what remained of my heart, each signature a fresh laceration. I signed, numb and hollow, for Emma's sake. For hers, though it killed me. ""Be happy,"" I said at the end, voice hollow as an empty well, as she took Emma's hand. But Emma, my little girl who adored me with a fierceness that mirrored my own, clung to my leg, her tiny face crumpling in confusion and pain. ""Daddy, don't go!"" she wailed, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks, her sobs piercing my soul like shards of glass, each one a fresh agony that made my knees buckle. I knelt on the porch, hugging her tight, her small body shaking against mine, her tears soaking my shirt as she buried her face in my neck, her little fists clutching my collar as if she could hold me there forever. ""I'll visit, Bug. I promise. Daddy loves you more than the stars,"" I whispered, my voice breaking, tears mingling with hers as I inhaled her scent, baby shampoo and innocence, one last time, my heart splintering with every breath. But as I pried her fingers away, gentle but firm, her cries escalated into heartbroken howls that echoed in my ears like a dagger twisting deeper, leaving me gasping, vision blurred, as I stumbled to the truck, the world tilting, every step away from her feeling like tearing my own flesh.  

In the truck heading to the airport, those memories replayed like a cruel film reel, looping endlessly. I boarded the plane to Portland, Oregon. Across the country, far from the Midwest's endless fields that now felt like graves of my past. The flight was turbulent, mirroring my soul's storm, and when I landed, the misty rain felt like tears from the sky, cold and unrelenting.  

My new apartment overlooked the Pacific, waves crashing relentlessly against the rocks below, their roar a constant reminder of the turmoil inside. I landed a job at a logistics company, managing shipments. Numbers and routes to distract from the ache that gnawed at my core. But the depression crept in like fog off the ocean, thick and suffocating, wrapping around me until I could barely breathe. Mornings, I dragged myself from bed, the sheets twisted like my thoughts, forcing down dry toast that stuck in my throat, coffee bitter and scalding. At work, I stared at screens until my eyes burned, fingers tapping keys mechanically, colleagues' voices fading into white noise. Evenings, I wandered the waterfront, rain soaking my jacket, the salt spray stinging my face as I watched couples stroll hand in hand, their laughter a knife twist. I stopped eating properly, picking at microwave meals that grew cold on the counter, my reflection in the window showing hollow cheeks and shadowed eyes, a ghost staring back. Sleep came in fits, jolted by dreams where Leah's face morphed into accusation, Emma's cries echoing until I woke gasping, sweat-soaked, clutching the pillow like a lifeline. The loneliness amplified every echo of my foster past, empty holidays spent alone, staring at the ceiling as rain pattered, the apartment's silence pressing like a weight.  

One stormy night, six months in, the darkness swallowed me whole. Rain hammered the windows like fists, wind howling through the cracks. I paced the living room, bottle of whiskey in hand, the amber liquid sloshing as I gulped it down, fire burning my throat but not touching the cold inside. Pills rattled in my pocket, white and innocuous, promising peace. I stumbled out into the gale, coat flapping like broken wings, toward the cliff's edge. Waves thrashed below, foam white and furious, calling me. ""It's over,"" I muttered, voice lost in the roar, stepping closer, toes curling over the wet rock. Tears mixed with rain, blurring the drop, my body trembling as I fumbled the bottle open. Pills spilled into my palm, cold and final. I swallowed them one by one, choking on bitterness, the world tilting as lightning split the sky. Memories surged. Emma's giggle, Leah's touch. They pushed me nearer the edge. But a shout pierced the chaos: ""Hey! Stop! Don't do it!"" A jogger in a slicker, face shadowed, lunged forward, his hand clamping my arm like iron. He yanked me back, my knees buckling into mud, vomit surging as the poison rebelled. I collapsed against him, sobs tearing free, rain pounding us both as sirens wailed closer, lights flashing red and blue through the downpour. In the hospital, IVs dripping into my veins, he sat by the bed, his grip steady. ""You got people who need you,"" he murmured, eyes kind in the sterile light. Shame flooded me then, hot and unrelenting, a new scar amid the old.

From that night, the climb began, step by agonizing step. Therapy started in a cramped office with faded posters, the therapist's chair creaking as I sank into the couch, words halting at first. ""I lost... everything,"" I stammered, fists clenching the armrests, tears spilling as I recounted the betrayal, the cliff. She nodded, pen scratching notes, her voice soft: ""Let's unpack that."" Sessions blurred. I paced the room, voice rising in anger at Leah's memory, then crumbling into sobs over Emma's photo on my phone. Runs became my escape, lacing up sneakers at dawn, feet hitting pavement as fog lifted from the bay, breath puffing in rhythm, muscles burning until exhaustion drowned the pain. One mile turned to five, sweat soaking my shirt, the endorphin rush a fleeting high that chased shadows. I joined a support group in a drafty hall, folding chairs in a circle, steam from coffee cups rising as men shared. ""She left me for my best friend,"" one grunted, fists tight, eyes red-rimmed. I nodded, my turn coming: ""Mine too... at work."" Nods rippled, a shared silence binding us, their claps on my back after like anchors. Volunteering at the foster shelter pulled me further. I sat with kids at rickety tables, guiding pencils over math problems, their frustrated sighs turning to grins at right answers. A boy with my old haunted eyes handed me a drawing, stick figures in a house, and I choked back tears, ruffling his hair. ""Looks like home,"" I whispered.

Years layered like seasons. Promotions at work. I sat in meetings, pointing at charts, voice steady as I delegated, the buzz of success filling empty spaces. Runs evolved to marathons, crossing finish lines with crowds cheering, medal heavy around my neck, legs jelly but spirit lifted. Friends emerged from the group, barbecues in backyards where burgers sizzled, laughter bubbling over beer, their stories weaving into mine. Dating flickered. A coffee with a colleague, her smile warm but fading when I pulled back, heart guarded. A walk with another, hands brushing but no spark to bridge the scar. Dreams still haunted, Leah's laugh jolting me awake, but less often, the pillow dry more nights than not. Journaling filled the gaps, pen flying across pages by lamplight, words spilling like blood from wounds closing slow. Ten years passed in this rebuild, the Midwest a distant echo until the call: ""Regional director, Des Moines branch."" Excitement warred with dread, packing boxes again, driving through plains where corn whispered secrets, each mile stirring dust on old graves. The town unchanged, diners with clinking plates, river murmuring under bridges. New house stark, work consuming: inspections in hard hats, dust clouding air, decisions snapping like commands. Emma at fifteen, lanky and bright, visits thawing from awkward silences over cones, drips on chins, tentative laughs, to cheers at her games, my throat raw from yells, her hugs fierce.

And now, here we were, the flashbacks dissolving like mist, leaving me in the kitchen light, coffee cooling between us. Tears welled in Leah's eyes as she looked at me, her face pale and drawn with exhaustion. She clutched the mug like a lifeline, knuckles white, tears spilling over. Her lower lip trembled violently, and she bit down hard on it, teeth sinking in to stifle the sob building in her throat, a thin trickle of blood welling up from the pressure, metallic taste flooding her mouth as she fought to hold back the flood.

""Eric,"" she said, her voice cracking, breath shaky, the words escaping in a raw whisper laced with agony. ""I... I made a mistake. A huge one.""

She paused, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand, her lip trembling more, another bite to clamp down the rising wail, blood smearing slightly on her chin, the pain a sharp anchor against the emotional torrent threatening to consume her. ""He wasn't you. Not even close. It was... exciting, at first. Stupid thrill. But then? Empty. Just so damn empty.""

Her fingers tightened on the mug until her nails dug into her palms, tears dripping onto the table in heavy splats, her body shuddering with suppressed cries, chest heaving as if each breath was a battle. ""I see it now, what I threw away. Our life. The love we had. Our family. It haunts me, Eric. Every single day. I wake up and... and it's there, the regret. Eating at me, tearing me apart from the inside.""

She reached across, her hand hovering, desperate, fingers quivering before dropping back, her face contorting in anguish, another fierce bite on her lip, blood now freely trickling, mixing with tears as they streamed down her cheeks, her eyes red-rimmed and pleading, raw with years of self-inflicted torment. ""Please. Can we try again? I love you. I never stopped. Not once. Emma needs us, together. And I... I need you. God, it hurts without you, like a knife twisting every moment, every breath.""

Her words sliced through me, raw and unrelenting, stirring up the old ache like a storm ripping open scars. My chest tightened, breath catching, tears blurring my vision as I shook my head, pulling my hand away.

""Leah... don't. Don't do this to me now."" My voice broke, thick with the pain surging back. ""I can't... I don't know if I can handle it.""

I buried my face in my hands for a moment, shoulders tense, fighting the wave. ""It took everything to get through this. To heal. To just... survive without you. Waking up every day, not wanting to end it all.""

The cliff memory hit hard, the rain, the pills, and I shuddered, voice dropping low. ""My heart's still broken. Pieces everywhere. I barely glued them back.""

""I'm scared, Leah. Terrified. If it happens again, the betrayal, the loss, it'd kill me. Flat out.""

Tears tracked down my face, unchecked, my words coming out ragged. ""I'm sorry. I need time. I love you, always have. Love our kid more than anything. Loved that life we had, the one you... you ended.""

""But the hurt? Back then, it nearly destroyed me. And now? This is ripping it all open again. Scars I thought were gone.""

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, standing on unsteady legs. ""I can't. Not yet. Maybe someday. Or... or never.""

She folded in on herself then, face in her hands, quiet cries escalating into guttural sobs that shook her frame violently, her bitten lip bleeding steadily now, the metallic tang a futile dam against the overwhelming grief, the sound echoing years of my own buried torment, raw and visceral in the quiet kitchen. I turned, walking out into the night, the Midwest stars cold overhead, indifferent as ever. The pain bloomed fresh, a reopened wound pulsing with every step, but deep beneath it, something fragile flickered. Hope? Fear? Forgiveness? I couldn't tell. Only that my shattered dream lingered in the pieces, whispering of what was lost, and what might never mend.",1,1768631599.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I am an adult. My mother is a very controlling and opinionated person. She feels very strongly about what I should do with my life on morally neutral subjects. A few examples include: what kind of car I should buy, what apartment floor I should live on, how much coffee I should drink, and how far I should drive for work.

Since childhood, she has told me that if I disobey her, I am also disobeying god, because god both a) chose her as my mother, and b) explicitly made it a sin for one to dishonor their mother.

She becomes significantly upset when I disobey her direction, which I believe is morally relevant because knowingly causing her emotional distress does in fact feel like a form of “dishonoring.” I have always felt it was unfair to allow my mom such a high degree of control over my life. However, I could never defeat her logic from a purely biblical/ theological perspective. What do you all think?",1,1768631371.0,AskAChristian,3,1.0,False

To the bluff. The perception, avoidance and pain. Without so, I wouldn’t know who I am. I’m afraid of my own potential. My own solidity. My independence. My power. I feel like I sacrifice my own growth, happiness and potential to avoid being the center of attention. So I carefully select an individual to use as a leverage so I can avoid being responsible for a job that needs my full attention. I wish I knew what it felt like without being a pathetic loser. It’s not even about the other party. It’s about the exciting new timeline. A timeline that wastes my times. Takes the focus off me. Drains my energy. It’s a silent killer. A thief in the night, I make coffee for. Who am I? Really? When I’m not playing a character? When i don’t waste my hard earned money on substances just so I can reminisce and relive the short moment i was the center of (their) attention…

Why is my self esteem so low that it finds comfort in suffering. My nervous system is severely damaged from isolation. I am painfully self aware that I am … til this day… dragging heavy baggage through the sand. i 100% know that I love myself. But contradict myself in every way possible to line it up with my actions, plans or future goals. I think it comes down to this deep sense of shame. As if I cannot be the main character in my own story. As if I am not deserving of that great title and honor. Morally I am long past the age of consent. Back then I asked and was told NO. I must’ve listened the first time and given up without a fight. I hate feeling like I’m chasing something. It’s draining. So fucking tiring. Dehydrating.

Bailey was \*always\* having a bad day, and constantly complaining. Most of the time it was over tiny things, but there was always something wrong, and her attitude was chronically miserable.

One night when she was still new, she was working the drive thru window, distributing samples of instant coffee. Bailey felt the samples tasted bad and started to add creamer to the sample cups. She then handed these out \*without telling the customers there was dairy in the sample.\*

I was alarmed, because this is health hazard, and against policy for safety reasons, so I mentioned to her that she wasn't supposed to alter the samples, but if she did, she needed to let customers know what it is she's giving them to drink. She got testy with me and blew me off.

Normally, I would let the chips fall, but I know some people can have bad allergic reactions to dairy or sugar, so when Bailey refused to listen, I went to the supervisor. He stopped it, saying exactly what I had said, and we moved on.

Later that evening, she blew up and yelled at me to never talk to her again about anything that isn't work. I was shocked, but I bit my tongue and walked away, as I'm not into drama.

After that, Bailey started self-destruct. She slacked on the job and then played the victim when she got in trouble. She picked fights with other baristas, and talked shit about us to the customers. Eventually she started to bully others and even fabricate complaints about whichever barista was on her shit list at the time. This all escalated into a screaming match with our manager in the middle of the café. Of course, she was fired.

In the weeks after she was let go, she crashed her car (her fault), blew up her relationship, and got hired and fired from two jobs in two months. 

We were all shocked to see her spiral this badly, even though it did sort of feel like a self-fulfilling prophecy, since she was such a miserable negative person all the time. But the timing definitely indicates I was the final straw to her self-restraint, and I wonder sometimes if I made the wrong decision by saying anything.

Chapter 1 

On Christmas Eve, my stepmother threw my backpack out door. 

“Get out of here! Go live with your grandma!” 

I was eight and all t could do was looking at dad, nervously 

Ne just kept his head down, puffing on his cigarette. 

And just like that, I was kicked out of my own home. 

As I dragged my old suitcase downstairs, I heard my stepmother laugh to her son: 

“It’s all yours now, baby.” 

My hand clenched the handle until it hurt. 

Twenty years later, all three of them showed up at my company, BEGGING ME. 

I stared at them. Smiled. 

Threw me out at eight? Now I HOLD YOUR PATE! 

It was 2003, the summer I turned eight, when Dad got remaried. 

Her name was Caroline, and she had a six year old son named Jackson. 

At the wedding, she wore a white dress and spent the whole ime smiling at everyone, touching Dad’s arm, making sure people saw how perfect everything looked. 

When she got to me, she crouched down, ran her hand through my hair, and said, “You can call me Mom now, 

sweetheart.” 

So I did. “Mom.” 

She nodded, then turned right back to Jackson and pulled high close. 

I didn’t think much of it at the time. 

I figured maybe this was just what having a real family felt ke. 

My real mom died when I was two-Grandma said the pregnancy destroyed her body and she never recovered.

Chapter 1 

After that, it was just Grandma raising me while Dad worked double shifts trying to keep us afloat. 

So when Caroline came into our lives, I thought maybe we’d finally have what other kids had. 

A real mom. A real home. 

Turns out I was wrong. 

Three days after the wedding, Caroline took down the family photo in the living room and put up a new one. 

Dad, her, and Jackson, all smiling together. 

I wasn’t in it. 

“Why aren’t I in the picture?” I asked Dad. 

“We’ll take a new one soon. You’ll be in that one.” 

That never happened. 

But other things did start happening. 

Jackson’s toys multiplied fast-action figures, race cars, building blocks spreading into every corner of the house. 

Mine got stuffed into the storage closet because they were “uhking the place look messy.” 

Every night, Caroline cooked whatever Jackson wanted. 

Pot roast. Fried chicken. Mac and cheese loaded with butter, 

What about me? 

“Oh, you eat everything. You’re not fussy.” 

I couldn’t put it into words back then, but I knew something was off. 

Jackson got seconds while I barely got firsts. 

He could stay up watching TV while I had to be in bed by eight. 

When Jackson spilled juice all over the couch, Caroline laughed it off. When I accidentally dropped a glass, I stood facing the wall for two hours. 

I tried asking Dad about it once. 

“You’re older,” he said. “You need to act like it.” 

Chapter 1 

Older. 

I was eight years old. 

A few months later, Jackson started first grade. 

That’s when Caroline decided he needed the perfect study environment-quiet, bright, no distractions. 

Which, of course, meant my room. 

Mine had south-facing windows that let in tons of natural light and was tucked away from the street. Jackson’s room faced the main road, where cars honked and engines revved at all hours. 

One afternoon, Caroline didn’t even ask. She just told me. 

“Jackson’s taking your room. You’re switching with him.” 

I froze. 

That room had been mine my whole life. My mom’s photo was still taped to the wall. 

“No,” I said. “That’s my room.” 

Her expression turned ice cold. 

“Excuse me? You don’t talk to me like that.” 

I looked at Dad, silently begging him to say something. 

He wouldn’t even look at me. Just stared at the floor and mumbled, “Do what she says.” 

That night, I packed up my things and moved into Jackson’s old room. 

It was barely big enough for a bed and a desk, and the window had this gap that wouldn’t close all the way. I already knew winter was going to suck. 

I carefully peeled my mom’s photo off the wall and brought it with me. It was the only piece of her I had left. 

I thought that was it. But Caroline wasn’t done. 

About a month later, she found me doing homework at the kitchen table. 

“So, I’ve been thinking,” she started, leaning against the counter. “This house only has three bedrooms, right? Your dad and I have ours, Jackson has his… There’s just not enough room for everyone.” 

I looked up at her.

“What are you saying?” 

“Well,” she said, softening her voice in that fake way, “your grandma lives alone. She could probably use the company. And honestly, you’d have more space there. It’d be better for everyone.” 

It took me a second to understand what she was actually saying. 

“You want me to leave?” 

“Not leave,” she said quickly, waving her hand like I was overreacting. “Just stay with your grandma for a while. You can still visit. Birthdays, holidays, whenever.” 

I turned toward the living room, where Dad was sitting on the couch. 

“Dad?” 

He kept his eyes on the TV. 

“Dad, please.” 

His jaw clenched. For a second, I thought he might actually say something. But then he just shook his head slightly. 

“Your mother’s right.” 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. 

I lay there listening to the cars passing by outside, the sound of my life falling apart one piece at a time. 

The next afternoon, I came home from school to find a new lock on my door. 

Caroline was standing in the hallway, dangling the key from her finger. 

“All packed,” she said, nodding toward a small pink suitcase by the stairs. “Your grandma’s picking you up soon.” 

I stared at the suitcase. It used to be my mom’s. Now everything I owned was crammed inside it. 

Dad was in the kitchen, holding his coffee mug with both hands, eyes locked on the floor. 

“Dad.” 

He didn’t move. 

“Dad.” My voice cracked. “Do you even want me here?” 

He finally looked up, and for half a second, something crossed his face. Guilt, regret. 

But mostly, he just looked exhausted.

“Grandma will take good care of you,” he said, barely above a whisper. “I’ll send money every month.” 

I didn’t cry. I wouldn’t give them that. 

I just stood there in the middle of the living room. 

Eight years in this house, and suddenly it felt like I didn’t belong here. 

Caroline leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, a small smile tugging at her lips. 

Jackson peeked out from my old room, holding my little beat lamp-the one with the nightlight my mom gave me. 

“Mom, can I keep this? It’s awesome!” 

“Sure, honey.” 

I wanted to march over there and take it back. 

But I didn’t. 

Because somewhere deep down, I already knew-I didn’t get to keep anything anymore. 

Grandma was waiting outside. 

When she saw me coming down the steps with that suitcase, her whole face just fell apart. 

She didn’t say anything at first. Just pulled me into her arms and held on tight. 

“Let’s go, baby,” she whispered. “Let’s go home.” 

I nodded against her shoulder. 

We walked to her car together, and I didn’t look back. But I heard it-the sound of the front door closing behind me.

I stared at the suitcase. It used to be my mom’s. Now everything I owned was crammed inside it. 

Dad was in the kitchen, holding his coffee mug with both hands, eyes locked on the floor. 

“Dad.” 

He didn’t move. 

“Dad.” My voice cracked. “Do you even want me here?” 

He finally looked up, and for half a second, something crossed his face. Guilt, regret. 

But mostly, he just looked exhausted.

“Grandma will take good care of you,” he said, barely above a whisper. “I’ll send money every month.” 

I didn’t cry. I wouldn’t give them that. 

I just stood there in the middle of the living room. 

Eight years in this house, and suddenly it felt like I didn’t belong here. 

Caroline leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, a small smile tugging at her lips. 

Jackson peeked out from my old room, holding my little beat lamp-the one with the nightlight my mom gave me. 

“Mom, can I keep this? It’s awesome!” 

“Sure, honey.” 

I wanted to march over there and take it back. 

But I didn’t. 

Because somewhere deep down, I already knew-I didn’t get to keep anything anymore. 

Grandma was waiting outside. 

When she saw me coming down the steps with that suitcase, her whole face just fell apart. 

She didn’t say anything at first. Just pulled me into her arms and held on tight. 

“Let’s go, baby,” she whispered. “Let’s go home.” 

I nodded against her shoulder. 

We walked to her car together, and I didn’t look back. But I heard it-the sound of the front door closing behind me.

I had a baby about two months ago. One morning I was half asleep making coffee and thought it would be funny to squirt a little breastmilk into my boyfriends cup. I told him after he drank it expecting him to be grossed out. Instead he said it was actually really good and asked if I could do it again.

So it became a thing. Every morning he wants his coffee with a splash of breastmilk. He calls it his special latte. At first it was hilarious and honestly kind of cute in a delirious new parent way. We were both running on no sleep and it gave us something to laugh about.

But now Im starting to feel weird about it. Im exclusively breastfeeding and some days my supply barely keeps up with the baby. I dont really have extra to spare for his morning coffee. Every bit counts right now especially during growth spurts.

I havent told him to stop yet but Im thinking about it. I know hes gonna be dramatic about it. Hes already joked about how he cant go back to regular creamer after this. I can already picture the sad faces and the sighing.

I feel  bad because its become this silly little ritual between us during a really hard time. And hes not being pushy about it or anything. But also I feel like maybe its kind of weird that hes this attached to it. And the baby literally needs it more than his taste buds do.

I dont want to make it into a whole thing but I also dont want to keep doing something that feels like its taking away from the baby just so his coffee tastes better.

Happy to share that I am a thalassemia minor which obviously tanks my energy levels throughout the day. My hematology appointment is a bit far ahead in the future (March) but I would like to get my energy levels up without having coffee (makes me super anxious) any tips??",1,1768630871.0,thalassemia,2,1.0,False

I'd been working more than usual due to a deadline recently, so now that its finished I wanted to do something fun with my kids. I have not sent my 4yo to daycare and I've taken the them (20mo and 4yo) to a ""salt-therapy place for kids"" its supposedly good for respiratory and dermatological problems (even if thats bogus, it was a genuinely fun thing to do on a bad-weather day). The place has the ""beach"" where kids can play in salt like a huge sandbox, lots of fun. And then a large café area where you can buy food and drinks and its adjacent to a play area (parents can drink coffee watching kids play, real nice).

Well, when we were done with the ""beach"" time and they went to play and i got us some food and drinks. There is one of those ball-pits and my toddler has never been to one, so this was her first time and she was excited! There was only one other mom and her son in the entire area at this time, very unusual. I bought sandwiches for the kids and for a bit we all sat by the table but it was not supposed to be a serious ""sit down to lunch"" moment since it was clear that they would be too excited and my younger got really worked up about the ballpit. I decided to just let them play and wait with the rest of the food for later.  (No I wouldn't let them bring food or dirty hands into the play area).

I had not even noticed that the other mom had gotten her son a soup in the meantime. The second they went back to play the other mother went to rant to me how her 2,5yo will not sit and eat when my kids are playing! How ""cant your kids sit for 5 more minutes?"" I was stunned. She went on to tell me ""he had been eating soup, so that was super important"" to her and that he hates soup and how my kids just ruined it. I just stared at her. 

The whole place was empty. There were many tables further away from the play area.  Even with no view of the play area. She chose to sit next to the play area! She ended up sitting on the bench of the play area and spoonfeeding the soup to her kid in the ballpit. 

AITAH? Should I have kept my kids at the table foe them to finish eating? Was there some unwritten etiquette? ",0,1768630827.0,Mommit,5,0.25,False
