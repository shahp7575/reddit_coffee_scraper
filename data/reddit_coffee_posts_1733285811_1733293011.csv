Or any outside the box solutions?,"I drink as much water as I can remember or stand each day. Which is roughly 80-100 oz. Yet I’m still perpetually dehydrated. I’ve tried adding salt and liquid IV and I’m at a loss on what to do.

I have headaches, dizziness, dry skin/lips, and constipation because of it. It all started when I moved up to five and couldn’t keep food down for several days, and now I’m constantly behind the eight ball. Most of the time I feel “too full” to drink more water. I dont drink coffee or other beverages either. 

Any ideas?  ",1,1733292904.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False

1h69ai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumTEKKEN/comments/1h69ai0/why_we_need_lei_and_why_we_need_to_nerf_the_cheese/,Why we need Lei and why we need to nerf the cheese,"Why Lei Wulong Deserves to Be DLC ASAP (And Why Tekken Needs to Get Its Priorities Straight)


Alright, Namco. We need to talk. The state of Tekken 8 is getting out of hand, and it’s time someone spoke up about the glaring issue: the fact that Lei Wulong is still sitting on the sidelines while every patch notes announcement continues to cater to a specific crowd (cough teenage girl mains cough) and ignores the REAL fans.

Here’s why Lei deserves his spot in the DLC roster yesterday, why some characters (looking at you, Eddy, King, and Heihachi) need to be nerfed, and why our hard-working heroes (Law and Feng) need some much-needed love.

Why Lei Wulong Is the Missing Piece of Tekken 8

Let’s be real: Lei Wulong isn’t just a character. He’s a LEGEND.

Uniqueness: Nobody else plays like Lei. He’s got multiple stances, each with its own set of mind-games, counters, and unpredictability. His drunken master stance? Iconic. His animal stances? Hilarious and effective. Playing Lei isn’t just a fight—it’s an art form.

Representation: With so many cookie-cutter designs popping up (hi, generic newcomers), Tekken needs more OG flair. Lei’s based on Jackie Chan, a legend in martial arts cinema. He brings a flavor that NO other character replicates.

Fun Factor: Lei isn’t easy to master, but that’s the POINT. His skill ceiling is sky-high, and every victory feels earned. He’s the perfect fit for players who want depth, style, and some laughs along the way.

Legacy: He’s been around since Tekken 2. Dropping Lei now feels like forgetting where this franchise came from. Fans want Lei, and it’s about time Namco listens.

The Teenage Girl Problem

Can we address the elephant in the room? Tekken NEVER misses a chance to add a teenage girl character with suspiciously… questionable appeal. Whether it’s Lucky Chloe, coffee girl, or Lidia, we KNOW why these characters are in the game (hint: it’s not for gameplay innovation).

Instead of focusing on meaningful characters with depth (cough Lei cough), we’re getting more outfits and animations designed for thirsty fans. Namco, you’re better than this. Where’s the respect for martial arts and storytelling?

Nerf These Menaces to Society

1. Eddy Gordo:
If you’ve ever lost to someone mashing random buttons with Eddy, you know the pain. His capoeira feels more like a cheat code than a fighting style. His evasiveness is ridiculous, and he can punish you even when you’re playing perfectly. Enough is enough.

2. King:
I get it, King’s a grappler, but do we REALLY need to suffer through 45-second throw combos every match? Breaking throws is a guessing game, and King mains act like they’re playing chess while the rest of us are stuck with Connect 4. Tone it down, Namco.

3. Heihachi:
The man’s been killed off in the story TWICE, yet he keeps coming back more overpowered than ever. His Electric Wind God Fist (EWGF) makes neutral feel pointless, and his damage output is straight-up unfair. Why does he have DLC-level power for free?

Buff the Hard-Working Heroes

1. Law:
Law has been putting in WORK since Tekken 1, and yet, he still gets overshadowed by flashier, cheesier characters. His combos require skill, his pokes need precision, and his flips are too easily punished. Give him better frames, safer moves, and some love for his Dragon Charge.

2. Feng:
Feng is all about mind-games and reads, which means every win with him feels earned. So why does he feel underpowered compared to these broken characters with autopilot movesets? Buff his damage, improve his stance transitions, and give him a fighting chance.

Conclusion

Namco, we love Tekken, but it’s time to start listening to your community. Lei Wulong isn’t just a character we want; he’s a character we NEED. Stop prioritizing pandering with teenage girl mains and start focusing on meaningful additions to the roster. While you’re at it, nerf Eddy, King, and Heihachi into the ground and give Law and Feng the buffs they deserve.

This isn’t just a rant—it’s a cry for justice. Who’s with me?

(And before you say it, no, I didn’t lose to an Eddy, King, or Heihachi main today. Totally unrelated.)

As far as the lump is concerned, I notice it when I put my deodorant on when my skin is pulled taught. sometimes I can grab the small lump if I try hard enough. There is a sharp nerve pain associated with touch on the small lump/node. I went in for an ultrasound today and they found nothing.

1h69a62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1h69a62/why_so_mean/,Why so mean?,"I (31F) am in a relationship with (31M) and we have been together for 9ish months. We’ve known and been involved with each other for about 6 years. In the beginning it was more of a FWB situation on and off, we would both communicate if there was another interest/partner and not be involved with each other during that time. One previous short lived relationship 4 years ago that crumbled when he experienced a very big loss. Mainly though, we’ve been best friends and support systems all along, with the exception of the times we took a step backwards when either of us had someone else in the picture. This go around with him has been very different, a much more mature and healthy relationship. 

However, lately he’s been generally been more angry, closed off, and irritable. Towards me though, it seems like he is frequently snapping at me for the smallest of things. I’ve been going through a lot personally, the word pre-cancer was thrown around, surgery to remove that, biopsies and testing, a lot of work stress, basically losing my job without actually being officially terminated. Basically a giant cluster of what the hell is happening. Well the snapping at me has seemed to only worsen over time. Once was bc I was freshly discharged from the hospital after surgery and asked him to stop and get coffee. I think I irritated him bc I was talking more quietly but it’s unclear. Another time was because I didn’t know what/where to eat. Tonight his best friend (I’m also close with him) was having a hard time and I was cracking jokes trying to cheer him up. I told my boyfriend about my jokes etc and he snapped at me and said “ yeah, I really don’t think you’re helping.” So I replied “ I’m trying and that’s all I can do.” To which he snapped back “yeah well maybe try harder next time.” Mind you, his friend hadn’t even told him anything was wrong yet, only me. 

So my question is, why is he suddenly acting so mean and snappy towards me? What makes a man get like that? Especially knowing everything I’m going through. I will also note that I am a lot more sensitive at the current moment bc my life has been so up in the air and it’s just been a lot to process.",0,1733291948.0,AskMenOver30,5,0.33,False

We met in the States, spent every day together for 3 months, then I moved back to my country, I am Asian. We’re LDR from 1 year and  4 months then he moved to my country to be with me. We are happy to finally be together so I wanted our adventure to start. On the 6th day of his arrival I booked a day hike and are joined with group of people and other groups. It’s a big crowd. I’m in a cloud during the hike, he’s very sweet and I can see how every women in our group envied me. After the tour we are waiting for our lunch, there was this girl around 18F, we met her at the pick up point before the hike. I was hugging my bf’s arm while I rest my head on his shoulder, when she passed us my bf shrugged me  and elbowed me to moved and he sat separating away from me while he waits for her glanced. She didn’t and I was shocked watching it all and sadly I am not the only one noticed it. 3 of our group side eyeing each other and I can feel the sudden animosity. I felt embarrassed because the girl passed 3 times and he continued to watch for her glances, while I sit awkwardly next to him. In summary we had a fight the next day because I couldn’t keep it inside. We made it and up and I tried to convince myself that it was nothing. 

The following month, we went on another hiking but it’s a 2 days hike. We are also joined by other people. The 2 days hike was amazing met and got closer to this 2 girls both in their early 20’s. On the last day, I was talking to one of the girl, 23F. I decided to add her on IG and since I am already holding her phone I said let me add my BF too on her IG. We continued with our life, a week or two later my bf told me that he messaged her to ask where she’s buying her protein powder because she posted that she’s bulking up at the gym. She replied and told him where. He told me that he DM her days after the chat and I waited for him to ask me where is this place she’s recommending but he never did. He never leave the house without me since he’s new here so I know he never went there himself. Another week passed and we are going on another hike and out of nowhere he asked me if the lady he dm’d will be joining us on the tour. I got mad and told him that first, we spent 24 hours together everyday and he never once told me he’s chatting with her until days after. And she’s a good woman because after replying to him she said to send her regards to me. I guess that closes door for my bf. When I confronted him he said, its not his fault because she’s the one added him on IG, so I told him she didn’t I did because despite of one happened last time I still trusted him. We made out again and move on with our lives. 

On our 3rd month together, the building where we live has a new receptionist.  She around 23 years old, I can see that she has a crush on him. And she’s always smiling and extra flirty with him. I let it because she’s young and it’s a crush no big deal. 2 weeks past and I already know that he’s flirting with her with and he even told me how much she has a crush on him and as well as another young girl at a convenience store. I was cool with it because it’s just a crush. Until, we came down together and from the moment we walked in and their eyes locked and her smile was so sweet and dreamy while my boyfriend gave her a flirty look, they continued to locked eyes for around a 20 meters walk. I was watching them and the other two employees with her. I was embarrassed and pissed how the other staffs cheering for them. If they are Romeo and Juliet then who am in the picture. When we passed them already I told him, not to encourage her unless he wanted to break up and ask her out. He got mad and there’s nothing wrong with what they are doing. We had an argument and coming back I spoke to the girl, ask what’s her name? And told her my bf had a crush on you and he wanted to ask you out? He gave me the WTF look and pulled me. Before I left I told the girl he’s coming back down to ask for your number. Everything exploded when we got him, he said what I did was rude. I told what they are doing is not only rude but disrespectful. We had a fight about it. 

The argument always about that it is normal on Americans to flirt even if you’re in a relationship. He is sad that he doesn’t have friends in my country so he needs friends. I told him there are too many men in the building who tried to talk to him but he’s ignoring all of them. He said he is not good making male friends and it is more easy for him to hang out with girls. So, I told him make friends with women our age and not attractive women below 23 years old. He said there’s nothing wrong if he hanged out and drink coffee with them it’s normal in America. I am not American, I am born and raised in Asia and lived half of adulthood in the Middle East. 

Is he right and every thing he is doing is normal in America and I was just too jealous?  ",1,1733291446.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

1h694i0,https://i.redd.it/jbagpwh4tr4e1.jpeg,How can motion design help products with complex features?,"
1. ""Explaining complex products: AKA the ‘How do I put IKEA furniture together?’ problem.""
Let’s face it—some products are like IKEA manuals. You stare at them, scratch your head, and wonder if you need a PhD to figure it out. But here comes motion design, swooping in like a superhero. It says, ""Step aside, confusion. I’ve got this."" With slick animations, it breaks down even the most complex product into bite-sized, brain-friendly visuals. Suddenly, a feature that sounded like tech-jargon gibberish becomes crystal clear.


---

2. ""If a picture is worth 1,000 words, motion design is worth a million.""
Words are great, but you know what’s better? Watching a feature in action. Take a gadget with 10 different modes. You could list them in a brochure—or you could show a 15-second animation of each mode solving real-world problems. It’s not just about explaining; it’s about showing. And showing? That’s where motion design shines.


---

3. ""Because no one reads the manual anyway.""
Raise your hand if you’ve ever actually read a product manual. Exactly. People don’t want to read how your AI-driven toothbrush adjusts to your brushing style. They want to see it. Motion design turns “press this button and rotate” into “watch this thing do its magic.” It’s like a cheat code for instant understanding.


---

4. ""Turning ‘Huh?’ into ‘Aha!’ moments.""
Here’s the magic of motion design: it takes complexity and makes it digestible. That smart home system with 47 features? Motion design can zoom in, highlight key functionalities, and show how it all connects. It’s like taking someone from “Wait, what does this do?” to “I need this in my life” in 10 seconds flat.


---

5. ""The silent explainer that works 24/7.""
Think about it: motion design doesn’t need coffee breaks. It doesn’t get tired. It’s always ready to explain your product, no matter where or when. It’s your best salesperson, available 24/7, working across websites, social media, and ads. And the best part? It never forgets its lines.


---

6. ""Motion design: the Rosetta Stone for features.""
Complex features are like a different language—one that customers don’t always understand. Motion design? It’s the translator. It takes your technical jargon, sprinkles in a bit of storytelling, and voila—your audience gets it. And when they get it, they’re far more likely to buy it.


---

7. ""In a world of complexity, simplicity wins.""
Here’s the punchline: motion design doesn’t just make your product look good; it makes it make sense. And in a world where customers are bombarded with choices, clarity is your competitive edge. So, the next time you’re faced with a product that’s tough to explain, just remember: if it can move, it can make sense.


---

Complex features don’t have to stay complex. Motion design: the unsung hero of product clarity.

A shared office space is more than just a set of desks and meeting rooms. They are the center of collaboration. Creativity and Community A key factor that sets successful coworking spaces apart is their ability to foster informal interaction.[ Unstructured ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5370866393992555102/5772684562998297814#)conversations and impromptu meetings often lead to meaningful connections, new ideas, and increased productivity. Here are some strategies for creating opportunities for informal interaction in shared office spaces

https://preview.redd.it/6ihiorrrrr4e1.jpg?width=830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25f8a10687a8d63d7e482ee1cc3b190c439714b0

**1. Design an open and inviting space.** Open spaces such as lounges, kitchen areas and coffee corners naturally encourage people to come together and talk. Provide comfortable seating, warm lighting and attractive décor. These spaces can easily serve as the heart of an office where members connect.

**2. Organize regular social activities** Casual events like game nights, snacks, and happy hours can bring members together in a relaxed atmosphere. These activities help break down barriers and build stronger interpersonal relationships between co-workers.

**3. Integration of shared facilities** Include shared resources, such as a coffee maker, snack bar, or ping pong table. When people gather in these areas It will create opportunities for casual conversation. that can spark new ideas or collaborations

**4. Create cross-industry** collaboration spaces Provide a dedicated space for brainstorming or skill-sharing sessions where members of different industries They can be interactive. For example, a bulletin board to post ideas or skills can encourage others to connect and collaborate informally.

**5. Facilitate member identification.** Provide opportunities to introduce new members during orientation or through the community newsletter. Knowing each other a little makes it easier to start a conversation.

**6. Promote flexibility** in seating arrangements Allow members to choose where they work each day. Instead of being assigned to a regular desk This increases your chances of fostering an organic conversation by sitting next to someone new.

**7. Use technology to fill the gaps.** For hybrid shared office space Use communication tools to connect local and remote members. A virtual coffee break or online meetup can mimic the informal interactions of a physical space.

**8. Design of activity-focused areas** Include space for specific activities, such as yoga, book clubs, or creative workshops. These spaces promote participation and interaction between members who share common interests.

**9. Celebrate community milestones.** Acknowledge achievements, birthdays, or anniversaries within the shared space community. Organizing a mini-festival for these events helps foster a sense of belonging and gives members a reason to socialize.

# Conclusion

Finally, continue to engage with your community to understand what they want from your shared space experience. Refinement of your initiatives based on feedback ensures your efforts resonate with members. Informal interactions not only enhance the collaborative experience; But it also promotes thriving communities. By designing common areas and planning activities strategically. You can create a lively environment where ideas come together. Prosper and relationships flourish.",1,1733290967.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False

Over the years, I’ve learned that some of the most beautiful conversations happen when we let go of the filters, the facades, and the fear of judgment. That’s why I created The Honest Nest—a space where we embrace real talk, raw emotions, and the messy, magical journey of life.

Through my podcast What Makeup Can’t Hide and this vlog, I’ll be diving into topics we all wrestle with but don’t always share out loud—things like procrastination, fear, healing, and finding joy in the chaos. No perfection here, just authenticity. It’s a space to laugh, cry, vent, and grow together.

My first episode is all about procrastination and how fear of judgment often keeps us from being transparent, especially in this hyper-curated world of social media. If you’ve ever felt stuck in your head or unsure how to take the first step, this one’s for you.

So grab your coffee, your tea, or whatever gets you comfy, and let’s build this nest together. Here’s to honest conversations and creating a community where we’re seen, heard, and supported.

Are you ready? Let’s fly.

Help?,"As a long standing tradesman, mostly in plumbing(never got ticket as I was a dumb kid who married young and plumbing companies weren't paying for school as readily back then), I knew I hated the skilled trades. Not for lack of work ethic as I frequently found myself bumping up the ladder faster than those who were farther along their apprenticeship. Not for lack of skill, as mentioned in the previous sentence I was obviously doing things right but also I'm just built to be a tradesman.

No, I hate the trades because no matter what I've tried, I get bored to tears of the environment, and irritated at the cutting of corners to do everything to save a buck. I'd like to point out I've had ADHD my whole life so the first reason for hatred is likely related to that. 

I'll save the complicated story of my career change but long story short, dabbled in computer stuff for a long time on my own accord, found out about certifications being a portal to potentially grabbing an IT job. By the time I was prepped to take CompTIA A+, the tech bubble had popped and you know what followed.

Anyhow, I realized that at my age, it is so unlikely to get a job, I felt hopeless. I can't even land a help desk job, and I get why. I'm not complaining, not the worlds fault I'm always behind. While I have been doing this test prep and studying and taking in information, I've done a few different jobs that allowed me more headspace and time for learning like working at a coffee roaster and installing signs. 

So here I am, not sure if I'm being a quitter or a realist, but it's apparent I need to give this up and do what I'm evidently meant to. Be a trades jockey and accept that I've missed my window or that I don't have the chops for the IT world. Guess it's back to it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere in your backyard, nothing beats the charm of a propane gas fire pit. These versatile features blend seamlessly into your outdoor space while providing warmth, ambiance, and a gathering point for friends and family. Whether you are hosting a weekend barbecue or simply enjoying a quiet evening under the stars, propane gas fire pits are an excellent addition that offers numerous benefits.

### Easy to Use

One of the standout features of propane gas fire pits is their ease of use. Unlike wood-burning fire pits that require chopping, stacking, and lighting, propane models start with the simple push of a button. You won’t have to deal with messy ashes or smoke, allowing you to focus on enjoying your time outside. This convenience makes it easy for anyone to enjoy a fire without the hassle.

### Immediate Warmth

In cooler weather, the instant heat from a propane gas fire pit can make all the difference. You can adjust the flame height with simple controls, making it perfect for chilly evenings. The immediate warmth encourages longer outdoor gatherings. Imagine lounging with friends as the sun sets, all while staying comfortably warm! This quality enhances the overall experience of your backyard gatherings.

### Variety of Designs

Propane gas fire pits are available in a variety of styles, shapes, and finishes. Whether you prefer a contemporary look or something more traditional, there is an option that will match your backyard decor perfectly. From sleek, portable models to elaborate built-in installations, you can customize your outdoor space to reflect your personal taste. Here are some common design types you might consider:

- Tabletop Fire Pits: Perfect for small spaces, they double as a coffee table.
- Freestanding Fire Pits: These provide great heat output and mobility.
- Built-in Fire Pits: These offer a high-end aesthetic and can be integrated into outdoor kitchens.

### Safe and Controlled Environment

Safety is paramount when enjoying outdoor fires. Propane gas fire pits are significantly safer than wood-burning pits. They produce less smoke and are less likely to spark or pop, making them ideal for families with children or pets. Additionally, you can control the size of the flames, minimizing the risk of fire hazards. Many models come equipped with safety features such as automatic shut-off valves, providing extra peace of mind.

### Low Maintenance

Another major advantage of propane gas fire pits is their low-maintenance nature. You won’t have to worry about purchasing firewood or cleaning out ash regularly. Simply ensuring your propane tank is full and cleaning the glass or steel surfaces occasionally is all that's needed. This means more time enjoying your fire pit and less time on upkeep!

### Environmentally Friendly

For those concerned about their ecological footprint, propane gas fire pits are a much cleaner option compared to traditional wood-burning ones. Since they produce fewer emissions, they are a more environmentally friendly choice. Propane is also a clean-burning fuel, meaning you’ll enjoy the benefits of a fire without the strong odors or excessive smoke associated with burning wood.

Safety Tips for Enjoying Propane Gas Fire Pits Outdoor Effectively
------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a cozy outdoor atmosphere, nothing beats a propane gas fire pit. They provide warmth, ambiance, and a central gathering point for family and friends. However, safety should always come first. Here are essential tips to ensure you enjoy your propane gas fire pit safely and effectively.

### Choose a Secure Location

Before setting up your fire pit, it's crucial to choose the right spot. Here are some guidelines:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-gas-fire-pits-outdoor  
  
- **Distance from Structures:** Place your fire pit at least 10 feet away from any structures, including your home, nearby sheds, or trees.
- **Stable Ground:** Ensure that the ground is even and stable. This will prevent tipping and accidental spills of fuel or fire.
- **Clear the Area:** Remove dry leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials from the vicinity to avoid unintentional fires.

### Check Your Equipment

Regular maintenance of your propane gas fire pit is vital for safe use. Follow these checks:

- **Inspect Hoses:** Look for cracks or wear on propane hoses. Replace any damaged hoses immediately.
- **Check Connections:** Ensure all connections are tight and secure. Any leaks can be hazardous.
- **Perform a Soap Test:** To check for gas leaks, mix a little soap with water and apply it to the connections. If you see bubbles forming, this indicates a leak that needs immediate attention.

### Enjoy Responsibly

Using your propane gas fire pit thoughtfully contributes to a safe experience:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-gas-fire-pits-outdoor  
  
- **Supervise Children and Pets:** Always keep an eye on kids and furry friends when the fire is lit. Set rules about how close they can come to the fire.
- **Use Appropriate Fuel:** Only use propane intended for outdoor use. Never use lighter fluid or other accelerators to start the fire.
- **Know the Weather:** Avoid using your fire pit during windy conditions, as this can spread flames and embers uncontrollably.

### Practice Fire Safety

Having fire safety tools nearby can provide peace of mind:

- **Fire Extinguisher:** Always keep a fire extinguisher rated for propane fires nearby for emergencies.
- **Sand or Water:** Keep a bucket of sand or water close to the fire pit to put out small flare-ups immediately.
- **First Aid Kit:** Having a first aid kit on hand can be beneficial in case of minor injuries.

### Extinguishing the Fire

When it's time to put out the fire, do it properly:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-gas-fire-pits-outdoor  
  
- **Turn Off the Gas:** Always turn off the propane tank first before extinguishing the flames.
- **Allow to Cool:** Let the fire pit cool before attempting to touch or clean it. This will prevent burns.
- **Store Propane Safely:** Store your propane tank in an upright position, away from heat sources and out of direct sunlight.

### Following Local Regulations

Make sure you are familiar with local laws regarding the use of fire pits. Some areas may have specific regulations about outdoor fires:

- **Fire Bans:** Be aware of any fire bans or restrictions in your area, especially during summer or drought seasons.
- **Permits:** Check if you need a permit to use a fire pit in your outdoor space.

By following these safety tips, you can create lasting memories around your propane gas fire pit while ensuring the safety of everyone present. Enjoy the warmth, savor the moments, and keep safety at the forefront of your outdoor gatherings.

### Conclusion

Propane gas fire pits outdoor not only enhance your backyard ambiance but also provide a cozy gathering place for friends and family. These versatile fire features offer the warmth and enjoyment of a traditional fire without the hassle of buying firewood or dealing with ash cleanup. You can easily control the flame and temperature, making them perfect for any occasion, whether it's a summer night or a chilly autumn evening.

1h68shh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h68shh/i_28m_fell_in_love_with_my_roommate_30f_got/,"I (28m) fell in love with my roommate (30f), got jealous at a Friendsgiving, confessed my feelings, got rejected, and still have hope","
I (28m) moved in with my roommate, Ashley (30f), three years ago when I moved back home. She was living in an old roommate’s house when he offered me a room at his place. Since then, we moved into another place in the city when he got serious with his girlfriend.

From the moment we started living together at the first place, we hit it off. Even though she had a boyfriend, we could talk for hours. We were into the same shows, shared meals—it was perfect. When they broke up, nothing changed; we were still great roommates, and I was there for her. She wasn’t part of my friend group until I moved there, even though she had already been living with my old roommate for over a year. In fact, they didn’t really get to know her very well. I made sure they saw just how awesome she was, and now she’s in all our group chats and comes to all the holiday parties. During this time at the first place, I dated multiple women, but none of those relationships led anywhere.

When we moved into the city together with her cat, we made a home together. Shortly after we moved in, I brought up the idea of us dating. She shot it down, which I immediately respected. I promised never to bring it up again because, no matter what, I wanted her in my life in any capacity—which I truly meant. She was a great friend, and I didn’t want to lose her over a hint of a feeling.

Ashley and I do everything together: we grocery shop, go to the laundromat, have lunch/dinner/drinks/walks/coffee—you name it. By all appearances, we’re a couple. Even when she started seeing a guy after we moved into the new place, I respected it until it fizzled into nothing.

Months passed, and we continued to enjoy our home together—no fights, just quiet peacefulness. I could literally live here and enjoy this forever. But then I started thinking about Ashley differently. I started to get feelings for her but I thought I could just let them pass. This happened about a year and a half after moving into the new place, and coincidentally, about a week after I started taking Accutane, which is known to cause depression and mood swings.

Ashley and I were invited to her Friendsgiving last Saturday. Her friends are notorious socialites who invite vague acquaintances, which I actually love and respect. However, with my medically induced depression, I considered canceling because I felt weird about introducing myself as Ashley’s roommate. I ended up going because I enjoy spending time with Ashley and her friends. Secretly, I thought, Maybe if I seem like her boyfriend, she’ll see me in that light. Delusional.

It ended up being a great time—until the very end. I could see the looks on people’s faces as they realized we were just roommates, but I could tell they thought we’d be good together. Ashley even talked about how good of a roommate I was and how we met, as if I were her boyfriend.

Then, at the tail end of the party, John walked in.

He’s handsome, a physician assistant, and super confident. I guess no one knew him because the host was introducing everyone. When the host introduced me as Ashley’s roommate, I heard him repeat, “her roommate,” and I just knew. My intuition has always been right about these things.

I tactfully made my way to Ashley and told her I was tired. We started saying our goodbyes. While I was caught in a conversation with someone, I saw John approach Ashley and start chatting her up—confident and interested. She reciprocated. Then, as we gave our final goodbyes, I watched her write down her number and hand it to him.

Here’s the thing: I don’t want to like her. I want her to be happy. I’ve seen her with other men, and we’re not even in a relationship. But in that moment, I felt what I imagine cheating or being cuckolded feels like. It was as if everyone in the room could sense how I felt—completely stripped of my masculinity.

The worst part is, I don’t think I would have felt this way if it weren’t for the Accutane-induced depression.

I couldn’t get it off my mind. The next morning, I had to talk to her about it—but I couldn’t talk about it; I cried about it. I ruined any chance of being with her because I essentially told her I knew she didn’t like me that way, and I didn’t want to ruin what we had, but that our roommate arrangement wasn’t working out. We agreed to still be friends but recognized that we likely needed some distance. That’s been working out, but I’m still depressed.

We’ve had a conversation since and she’s even said things like “she wishes she liked me in that way but she can’t make herself”which I understand. I would never want her to make herself. I have checked in with her to make sure she still feels comfortable and asked her if she needs space. I have also made sure to spend time away to give her space even if she doesn’t ask for it. The thing is, I know she enjoys hanging out with me and I know that me spending time away from her actually hurts her feelings.

This has led me to my biggest realization and that’s that we have been getting everything emotionally we needed from a relationship, so we weren’t seeking it from anyone else. That was hurting our chances of finding love. Because of this, I decided to start apartment hunting and found a place across the street. It’s perfect because I work around the corner.

It’s also perfect because, truthfully, a part of me hopes she’ll realize she loves me once I move out. If I’m close by, it might make it easier for her to realize it. Of course, I’ll let her do laundry at my in-unit washer and dryer.

My question is, should I move out? She’s made it clear she doesn’t want me to move out. I think it will be hard for me to get over my feelings and I think I’ll always hope she’ll fall in love with me if I live with her. Another question is, based on my situation and the story, do you think there’s a chance she might realize that she does love me once I’m gone?

To preface your questions about why she might not want to date me, I think it’s attraction. I’m 5’6 and 215lbs. Luckily I’m well put together, have a good job and face, but I could be more fit.  I’m currently in the process of losing weight (20lbs in 4 months and counting), in therapy, and on accutane so I’m doing everything I can to fix my problems lol. We get along really well and have great chemistry, you’ll just have to take my word for it. Every guy I’ve seen her with has been over 6ft tall so you do the math.

TLDR: I moved in with my roommate, Ashley, three years ago, and we quickly became close, doing everything together and emotionally relying on each other like a couple, though she never reciprocated my romantic feelings. After starting Accutane, which caused mood swings, I found myself struggling with jealousy when she gave her number to another guy at a party. I’ve realized our dynamic may be preventing us from seeking real relationships, so I’m thinking about moving though part of me still hopes she might develop feelings for me. Despite this, I deeply value our friendship and want to respect her boundaries while continuing to work on myself.",0,1733290156.0,relationships,9,0.5,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We’ve been close friends (she was in my wedding) for 5 years. Met in our early twenties, when I befriended both her and her (now ex) partner on the same night at a party. My partner and I double dated with them for a few years. She has really been there for me during some difficult times and is always very thoughtful and caring.

The first warning to me was 2 years ago, after she and her partner broke up, when she offered to help my partner and I move. she suddenly got very upset in the middle of our moving day and went outside. I then spent a while talking to her while my partner and my other friend continued moving our furniture (which I felt bad about). Apparently she was upset that I’d told her we still had occasional contact with her ex (the 4 of us had all been friends for a few years and he had asked us to get coffee with him). I told her I wouldn’t continue the contact with the ex. She said we were good but then immediately left.

Part of me was a little paranoid that she chose to do this on moving day because my partner and I had just purchased our first home, which was an exciting day for us. It felt like weird timing.

It sometimes feels like when there are exciting moments in my life this friend unknowingly makes it about her. At my bachelorette party, she got upset and left early, after what felt like a lot of me having to take care of her at the cost of me spending time with other friends who had traveled to be there (she lives close by). And the next day she kept texting me so I had to reassure her while trying to be present for the rest of the party.

Or when I texted our friend group that I got into a masters program in another state, she called me crying and said I was abandoning her. Honestly there are a number of examples like that.

It’s at the point where if I invite her to something in a group I need to plan very thoughtfully how to make her feel comfortable and I can’t relax. But if I don’t invite her she feels left out. I’m doing a study abroad soon and she wants to come visit me, and I’m already anxious that I’ll need to take care of her on that trip.

There was recently a weekend trip for our friend group where she had some drama with another close friend. She felt very threatened by my closeness with the person she had the conflict with, and interpreted me hanging out when them while they were fighting as me hiding that her (when in my view I didn’t need to ask her permission first). We talked about it later and she owned that I had the right to see this person, but getting to that point felt exhausting and really ruined the weekend for me.

When we got home she texted me to hang out and I didn’t respond for about a week because I felt frustrated and needed space. She then started reaching out to other people asking if I was ok since I didn’t respond, which felt pushy to me. She told me that me not texting her back was very triggering for her and brought up anxious attachment, etc. I get anxiety now anytime I see a text from her bc I don’t want to trigger her by not responding quickly.

Due to all of this (and some more incidents that im not including here), I started thinking we could transition to a more surface level friendship where we only hang in a group, but she kept reaching out to me, and I felt she deserved an explanation.

Eventually I tried to (gently) have a sit down conversation about it. I said I felt very anxious about our friendship and a little pressured to accommodate her needs during a time when I was navigating my own challenges and had less bandwidth. I gave a few examples.

She said she doesn’t expect me to take care of her feelings, but I don’t think she’s aware that her actions kinda put me in that position a lot. And even when she later acknowledges that she was inappropriate and apologizes (which she does), it’s really stressful to me to get to that point. I don’t have this stress with any other friend.

She felt really bad, and then I felt bad. She started crying and crying. She kept saying she wasn’t crying on purpose and was having really bad PMS, and I believe her. But even so — me gently expressing my issues was so upsetting for her that the convo about my needs kinda devolved into me consoling her.

I understand that she has very real abandonment trauma and insecurity and neurodivergence and I want to be understanding. But where is the line on me accommodating her (valid) mental health issues if it’s stopping me from being present with other friends? I want to be inclusive. But I also have trauma, some of which involves abuse/being scared of upsetting someone volatile. So this dynamic doesn’t feel good to me anymore.

But she has been there for me and supported me during some really big moments in my life. I genuinely don’t think she’s a bad person, and we have some amazing memories together, but I think she’s a little unaware or emotionally immature and we may have really different needs.

What do I do? Do I end the friendship with honesty? Is it even safe to do that? Do I try again to fade it to surface level and when she tries to hang I just white lie and keep saying I’m busy? Do I have other conversations with her about how to improve the friendship, and try to implement really strong boundaries when she is triggered? Or do I just accept that she needs more special accommodations than my other friends do and plan to better meet her needs? Please advise.

1h68qu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/transguns/comments/1h68qu8/security_and_opsec_check_in_week_4_tor/,security and OPSEC check in week 4: Tor,"(all of the following can be found in the clear net I am not endorsing nor recommending you do the follow but if you \*\*DO\*\* happen to decide to use this information its the best advise I can give also good resources include Mental outlaw and Sumsub  on youtube and r/Tor and please don't be logged in in you want to read on there and be on a VPN)

So here is the big one the \*DARK\* web its not that scary but it WILL most likely get you on a watch list if you access it without being smart about it so mullvad paid in cash or monero and ideally not on windows also do not use chrome, edge or safari browsers. chromium, firefox or the mullvad browser is best for this.

  
so what the heck is Tor anyway? tor is the onion router it works by you sending data to a server called an entry node this server (which can be a raspberry pi btw) encrypts your IP address and data and sends it to another server called a relay node at this point the relay node has the unencrypted IP address of the entry node and your encrypted data it encrypts the entry IP address and sends the data on to the Exit node which decrypts your search data and presents it to the site. This whole system is your tor relay it is standard practice to try to always make all three relays in three seperate countries to avoid legal jurasdiction and to prevent any one party from controlling too many nodes     also in case an attack can control a node the entire relay is changed every ten minutes while on the network.

getting started I should preface this is the basic guide meant for anyone to be able to follow so that means we will be going over whonix, safely running tor at home and bridges in a later guide.

  
go to  [https://tails.net/install/index.en.html](https://tails.net/install/index.en.html) this is TAILS website we use tails because it forces all of our traffic (with the exception of a time request sent over the clearnet when first booting up the system to allow it to enter the Tor network) tails is run solely in RAM and as such requires 16 Gbs of ram to prevent migraines in its users the benefits however is that nothing is ever stored to the SSD or HDD and as such cannot be recovered from there in addition TAILS boots up a seperate kernal (a low level OS) for the sole purpose of wiping all data left in RAM it automatically wipes everything the moment the USB stick is pulled which it is ready for at anytime without great risk of damaging the USB 

  
Tor has an eclectic set of donors and backers in that alongside crypto exchanges, VPN companies and human rights organizations there is the US state department and the Naval institute (the Tor network was invented by the US Navy) 

  
before you download tails you need to verify the PGP key signature a full install video here ( [https://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8/tailsos-guide-for-the-ultra-paranoid:1](https://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8/tailsos-guide-for-the-ultra-paranoid:1) )

I would say you must verify the PGP key before downloading as there are many Law enforcement agencies around the world which would like to be able to track Tor activity and they would target developers you will also need a PGP software ( [https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/](https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/) ) 

(I do plan on doing a post about PGP in the future however I need a volunteer please send me a chat if you'd like to help I do have other ways beyond PGP)  

so verify and download tails burn it to a USB and put a lanyard on it this USB should be a minimum of 8 GB but I would recommend a bit bigger at 32 GB and for your own health get the fastest read speed you can find that is compatable with your PC or Laptop otherwise you will like this distro even less

  
now shut down your computer go into your BIOS or UEFI settings and make sure you can boot from a USB you can access these by rapidly tapping F1, F2, F10 or F12 on your PC you can also look it up based on your model of PC

plug the drive in and boot from it if you have done everything before correctly you'll be brought to a screen where you can enter in your keyboard, data and time and configure persistent storage adjust your settings as you like and hit continue.

actually using Tor

  
so all of the following should be used on public Wifi  and be mindful of people (and their phone cameras) that can see your laptop screen. Ideally wait to start your tor connection until someone else or a group of people walk in and login to their PCs as the network admin and the ISP for the space WILL know someones using tor and know when they started using it. also ideally this should be a wifi or WiFis that you have never connected to before and your phone and any bluetooth devices should be turned off or not on your person to avoid anyone tying your phones MAC address to Tor connections at starbucks and it should be a shop you frequent so little none of the employees would recognize you. (keep your coffee orders boring and generic) also ideally you would use an older laptop bought with cash thinkpads tend to be plentiful and have a high enough amount of RAM if new enough also X series ones can run coreboot which we might address in the future.

  
connect to the Wifi and connect to tor you can do this by clicking the application ""tor connection"" in your applications if you have a bridge  you can configure it now after 5-15 seconds it should say you are connected to Tor now for a very important step 

  
WAIT 30 seconds at the least a couple minutes will not hurt if TAILS needs an update it \*should\* automatically tell you you can also run tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper in your terminal to check if an update is available but automatic or manual any persistent storage you have will be saved between updates

  
there is no reason  to ever run an outdated version of TAILS make sure it is the first thing you do after connecting to Tor and you do it every single time you use TAILS.

  
wonderful now you have Tor configured in one of  if not the most anonymous OS's ever devised using a network you've never used before meaning none of this can be tied to you

good job now's the hard part

 in the tor browser do not download extensions (they'll be gone unless you enable persistent storage anyway) as it makes you easier to fingerprint

use .onion sites when possible (reddit has a .onion version) and do not for the love of all you hold dear log into ANY SITE that you use when not on Tor (aka the clear net) not your email, not your netflix (won't work btw the download speed on tor is around 500 Kbs to 20 Mbs) not youtube, not pornhub, not your VPN provider. the number one way Tor users are tracked down IRL is because they either A used the same account across darknet and clearnet activites or B they talked too damn much. IF for some reason you most have an Email on the darknet enable persistent storage make the passwords as long as possible ( ideally 128 digit with uppercase, lowercase, special and numbers) using an random password generator and store them in keypass and NEVER WRITE THEM DOWN ideally use two or more seeds in your keypass master password and keep it hidden ideally in a place where you can honestly say you would forget about and people would believe ( buried in a desk drawer  or book is possible  buried in your basement is not) this way because keepass is only stored locally you will have no chance of mixing your darknet activites into your clearnet ones just do not log into your accounts from TAILS

  
consider yourself on read only mode.

in all likely hood you do not need to post on any .onion site if you can in anyway help it search and read only if you say nothing you leave the least footprint to be traced.

If you insist on posting something on the darknet ideally make sure it is legal (in most countries being on the darknet, dread ore darknet market places is not explicitly illegal it is just an excellent way to end up on watch close lists if caught) make it as breif as possible while giving the needed info and do not give ANY personally identifiable information not your area, not your situation, not how much you make ( oh I can afford that or I can't really manage that right now) not your hobbies, not your age nothing. If you can wait and its not country specific post it in a different language using ( [https://libretranslate.com/?source=auto&target=en&q=](https://libretranslate.com/?source=auto&target=en&q=) self host this and do not allow it internet access) after having translated it more then once (English to Finnish and post it in German for example) if you must post it in your language process it a few times (english to finnish to german back to english) and say it isn't your first language

  
do not make chitchat, do not joke, do not small talk the vast majority of hackers are caught that way.

  
finally as far as anyone in your life is concerned you don't know what Tor is, you've never heard of TAILS and the Darkweb is the incognito browser on chrome. 

  
do not tell anyone you know anything about any of this if you'd like to point them towards this series so they find this post that's fine but the second most common way Tor users are caught is by telling someone they use Tor so Keep Your Damn Mouth Shut.

welcome to the list btw thank you for reading please as always leave ANY questions, comments ,criticisms and thoughts in the comment I rely on them a fair bit to get better.

1h68qjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1h68qjo/in_your_opinion_what_do_you_think_happened/,"In your opinion, what do you think happened?","For context I am a 20 year old male who is 5'5"" and 210lbs, I have always been obese, up until maybe 4 months ago it was a lot worse, I'm talking upwards of 300lbs. I used to be a fairly carefree person who enjoyed life and lived it to the fullest extent that I could. One day last year I was in a very very bad car accident where everyone was lucky to walk away with their lives. On the way back home after the wreck I had my very first severe panick attack, to the point where my hands locked up and my speech started slurring almost as if I had a stroke. I went to the hospital and they did full body CT and gave me the all clear except for pretty nasty abdominal wall bruising. I was a little messed up for a few days after but then it all went back to normal. A month or two later (I don't remember at this point) I had just showered and shaved and began to lie down, when I did I had a very horrid palpitation, one that would change my life forever. It was the first one I had EVER felt in my life and it was a deep pause that stripped my breath from me. After that day I had panick attacks non stop everyday for well over a month. It felt like one never ending one, constantly anxious and aware of my heart and even had some stroke worries too which have since gone completely away. But after maybe a week to two of these non stop panick attacks, little sleep, and sitting stationary all day every day I had a severe SVT attack that needed cardioversion. The day it started I was having quite a few palpitations and decided to chug an entire cup of coffee which then started the SVT. But the attack did nothing but further my fears of a cardiac related death. Since then I have had a few small ones and never another big one requiring medical attention. I was slated to see a cardiologist but got covid right before my appointment and had to cancel. I continued running to the emergency room every panick attack I had and continued to be told everything was fine. One day a few months into all of this they just disappeared for almost an entire year. No really bad or noticeable palpitations and barely any panick attacks. Nothing really changed in my life except there was a lot of stress that melted away after a few months. Then about 6 months ago I moved and left everything I knew behind and my life changed drastically. I was around all new people, all new surroundings and an all new town. Things were good for about 3 months and then it all collapsed again, terrifying panick attacks and everything started from a very small SVT attack, now 3 months since the start of it all and nothing is getting better. Palpitations are a daily thing and they always feel like skipped beats, never really fast or anything just thump, skip, thump, skip. It's not every other beat but I'd say they're probably 5 to 15 of them a day. They've been happening lot recently as I lay down for bed. And used to be I never worried about my heart but since that day a few months after my accident I've feared death and heart issues. I lost my insurance a few months ago and currently cannot get any even though I make zero income at all. I just don't see how a car accident could lead to fear of my hearts health and I've convinced myself that they're unrelated and that day where the panick disorder started was my body telling me my heart was in very bad condition. The CT scans, EKGs, and chest Xray have shown no physical problems in my heart or my hearts functionality. I was diagnosed with Hypertension during this and was told my distal pulse seem to usually be 2+ whatever that means. The carefree attitude I once had has been replaced and now I always feel crappy, like today my heart has felt kind of weak and when walking my vision starts to shift up and down a bit. I'm stuck in this perpetual cycle of feeling like death is approaching and I physically can't get the answers I need now because no cardiologist is willing to see me without insurance. I'm stuck in a boat without a paddle in a fast flowing river and I just feel completely lost.",1,1733289970.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

My house is on an island where the war of 1812 took place and the locals said that a few battles were fought around the subdivision that I live in. The house is decent size for me, my spouse and our golden retriever. The house has wooden floors. We have tradition of changing the orientation of our living room and this year was the same. When we were changing the orientation, we found some old toy balls that our dog must have gotten into the weird spots and like every dog, our dog also loves playing with them but hates playing fetch (weird). So we got them out for her and she would play with them during the day and leave them out. She (dog) knows I hate toys in the bedroom so she never brings it in. Now it has been about two weeks since she has her balls but last night, I got woken up by a noise and it sounded like someone dropping a ball on the floor. But picked them and started bouncing off of the floor. The thing is, when and if you drop a ball, it bounces, however, the frequency starts slowing down. But this noise was like if someone had a tennis racket and was bouncing the ball off of the floor and is constantly bouncing. 
I thought that my partner would have woken up early and was playing with the dog. But then I heard my partner sleeping and then I saw that my dog was also asleep next to my bed. The noise is still there, so I decided to turn the light in the kitchen from my phone and the moment I turned the lights, the noise stopped, like someone holding the ball and then the ball dropped. I went outside in the kitchen to see what was going on and see nothing, not a single ball in the sight nor anyone. I then checked all the doors and windows to see if anyone could have broken in, but we set alarm before we go to sleep and if someone opens a door or window, it would have sounded the alarm. I didn’t think of it anymore as I was tired and went back to sleep. 
The next morning, while drinking coffee, I went around to check where all the balls were, and I couldn’t find any in the whole house. Checked all the corners, under all furniture and even the garage, not a single ball to be found. 
I moved to this town about 7 years ago and all my previous experiences were at my business. This was the first time at the house.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

In today’s fast-paced digital world, having a mobile app is no longer just a luxury for businesses—it’s an absolute necessity. And when it comes to building high-quality, cross-platform apps efficiently and effectively, React Native has emerged as the go-to framework.

But with so many options out there, how do you find the best [**React Native apps development company**](https://www.algosoft.co/react-native-apps-development) that can bring your business vision to life? Well, fear not! In this blog post, we’ll delve into the world of React Native and guide you through the process of finding the perfect partner for your app development needs.

So grab a cup of coffee and let’s dive in to discover how you can unlock the full potential of React Native for your business!



# Understanding React Native: What is it and how does it work?

React Native is a powerful and innovative framework for building mobile applications that combines the best of both worlds: the ease and flexibility of web development with the performance and capabilities of native apps. But what exactly is React Native, and how does it work?

At its core, React Native is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It allows developers to build mobile apps using a single codebase that can be used across multiple platforms such as iOS and Android. This means that instead of having to write separate code for each platform, developers can write once and deploy everywhere.

So how does React Native achieve this? Well, it works by utilizing native components rather than web-based ones. When you create a user interface in React Native, it translates your code into real native views using platform-specific UI elements. This ensures that your app looks and feels like a true native app on each respective platform.

Another key aspect of React Native is its use of declarative programming. Instead of telling the app how to do something step by step, you simply describe what you want the end result to look like. React Native then takes care of updating the user interface automatically whenever there are changes.

Understanding React Native boils down to recognizing its ability to streamline mobile app development through its cross-platform compatibility and efficient rendering process using native components. By harnessing these features, developers can save time while delivering high-quality apps that provide users with seamless experiences across devices!

# Why choose a React Native apps development company?

Why choose a React Native apps development company? Well, there are several compelling reasons why businesses should consider opting for a React Native apps development company when it comes to building their mobile applications.

First and foremost, React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript. This means that with one codebase, you can create apps for both iOS and Android platforms, saving time and resources.

Another reason to choose a [**React Native apps development company**](https://www.algosoft.co/react-native-apps-development) is the performance of the resulting applications. Since React Native uses native components instead of web views, the apps built with this technology have better performance compared to hybrid or web-based solutions.

Furthermore, React Native offers a rich ecosystem of pre-built UI components and libraries which accelerates the development process even further. This means that your chosen app development company can leverage these existing components to build your app faster while maintaining high-quality standards.

Additionally, by choosing a React Native apps development company, you ensure that you have access to a pool of highly skilled and experienced developers who specialize in this particular framework. These professionals will be able to fully utilize the capabilities of React Native and deliver top-notch mobile applications tailored specifically for your business needs.

Investing in a reputable React Native app development company ensures ongoing support and maintenance for your application. As technology evolves rapidly, having experts who stay updated with the latest trends in this field will guarantee that your app remains compatible with various devices and operating systems.

Opting for a React Native app development company brings numerous advantages such as cost-effectiveness, efficient performance delivery, and access to specialized expertise.

# Factors to consider when choosing the best React Native app development company for your business:

* **Expertise and Experience:** Look for a company that has extensive expertise in developing React Native apps. They should have a track record of successful projects and experience in working with businesses similar to yours.
* **Portfolio and Case Studies:** Review their portfolio and case studies to get an idea of their capabilities. Look for examples of apps they have developed, especially if they are in your industry or have similar functionalities.
* **Client Reviews and Testimonials:** Read reviews from past clients or ask for references. This will give you insights into the company’s professionalism, communication skills, ability to meet deadlines, and overall client satisfaction.
* **Development Process:** Inquire about their development process to ensure it aligns with your requirements. A transparent and agile approach is crucial for timely delivery of high-quality apps.
* **Communication Channels:** Effective communication is vital throughout the app development process. Ensure that the company provides clear channels of communication so you can easily discuss project updates, changes, or concerns.
* **Support Services:** Find out what kind of support services they offer post-app launch, such as bug fixes, updates, maintenance, and ongoing technical support.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** While cost shouldn’t be the sole determining factor, it’s important to evaluate whether the pricing structure fits within your budget while offering value for money.
* **Security Measures :** Discuss security measures implemented by the company during app development like data encryption protocols , secure login systems etc
* **Technical Skills & Flexibility :** The chosen firm must have skilled developers who are adept at using various technologies associated with react native . Additionally ,they should also be flexible enough to adapt new tools/techniques as per project requirement .

By considering these factors when selecting a[ **React Native apps development company**](https://www.algosoft.co/react-native-apps-development),you can ensure that you partner with a reliable team capable of delivering innovative solutions tailored specifically to meet your business needs.

# How to evaluate the expertise and experience of a React Native apps development company

Evaluating the expertise and experience of a React Native app development company is crucial to ensure that you choose the best partner for your business. Here are some key factors to consider:

* **Portfolio:** Take a look at their previous work and projects they have completed. This will give you an idea of their capabilities, design aesthetics, and overall quality.
* **Client Testimonials:** Read reviews and testimonials from their past clients. These can provide insights into the company’s professionalism, communication skills, adherence to deadlines, and customer satisfaction.

* **Technical Skills:** Assess whether the team has strong technical skills required for building robust React Native apps by reviewing their developers’ qualifications and certifications.
* **Communication and Collaboration:** A good development company should be responsive, transparent, and able to effectively communicate with you throughout the project timeline.
* **Scalability:** Consider if the company has experience working on projects similar in scale or complexity as yours since scalability is important for future growth potential.
* **Maintenance & Support:** Inquire about post-development support services such as bug fixing or upgrades after deployment as these aspects contribute to the long-term success of your app.

The only fandoms I'm looking for at this moment are Star Wars (set near the Clone Wars and Order 66), and MHA (set after the end of the series).

I'm happy to write with canon or original characters. People who write clone characters (OC or canon) get absolute priority, and anyone willing to write Tokoyami Fumikage. I'm looking for something with a mix of romance, adventure, lots of interesting twists and turns and heavy emotional moments that'll smack us both in the face. I like smut, but my priority is storyline. 

I'm a fairly active writer. Expect at least one post daily, with the occasional fun rapidfire exchange.   

I am looking to write any of these 3 characters, and have starters for them below: Hawks (MHA), Obi-Wan Kenobi (SW), or Aayla Secura (SW).

The starters are a good measure of how much I usually write. Please contact me to plot, and feel free to reply to my starters ;)



[[Just a bunch of starters below, feel free to ignore.]]



1. Hawks. Location: HPSC building. 

Every other office in the HPSC building was dark, except for the chairman's.

It was one of those nights, you know - the bad ones. Busy as hell, lots of fires burning under lots of asses that really didn't want them to. Hawks was pretty sure the Secretary of Education wanted to put a restraining order on him, but couldn't make it stick, and he completely empathized. Negotiations had been bad.

He's got plates to spin. Jobs to do. People to poke. He's used to juggling a hundred at once. He's just not used to doing it so slowly.

He stretched, back spasming in a way that had grown familiar since, well, probably Gunga Mountain. He maybe stretched too far and knocked four empty ice coffee cans off his cluttered desk.

It was of course that moment that someone else announced their presence. He spun around, smile firmly in place like it had been there all night. Fake as hell, but entirely convincing.

""You're not my ten o'clock appointment,"" Hawks drawled. He did not have a ten o'clock. ""What can I do you for, chickling?""

2. Aayla Secura. Location: hyperspace, flexible location.

In the pilot seat of a stolen starship, Aayla Secura slumped. Their course had been set, the only destination: away.

Felucia and the fleet surrounding it were marked on her travel log, still blinking with cheery indifference, while the glare of hyperspace blurred past. The cockpit was awash in blue.

She wanted to close her eyes, but suspected she might not have the will to open them again. A vibrant trill of terror cut through her mind. Very carefully, Aayla released it into the Force.

(The Force had screamed so loudly when the fighting started. Now it was as quiet as a grave.)

She had been preparing for an assault of the frontlines of Felucia when a wave of horror broke against her and set her to her knees. Barely a heartbeat later, the brave soldiers of the 327 turned on her. They had been her troopers, her allies and friends. Now they were responsible for the wound that bled sluggishly across her belly. 

She'd survived the initial clash. Now, she risked bleeding through hastily applied synthskin and bacta patches. But she wasn't the only one in this cockpit.

She turned to her unexpected copilot.


3. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Location: cantina, flexible. 

The cantina had a name no one remembered. It might even have been painted above the door, but someone had made off with the sign or it had been scoured clean after years of dust storms. But that was alright. No one who didn't know this place would want to visit it, and those who knew it had no where else to go.

This was not the place to find a Jedi, or a General, or anyone willing to give their true name. But the Age of the Jedi was over, and the Empire stretched across the galaxy in a wave of brutality. This was perhaps the only place that suited someone like Ben.

This was a special occasion. He found his patience for special occasions had greatly diminished in the past few years. He did not always appreciate being away from his camp.

He kept his head down, his attention on his hands and the meager swill of slop before him. No hood on because that was terribly obvious, but his eyes played at dull, vacant wandering.

i’m 19 y/o and have never engaged in sexual activity with anyone but i recently got a bf and i’m scared for when that day comes/terrified of receiving oral because i’m so scared that i’ll smell down there and it’ll ruin the experience. if not his, mine. i’m so insecure about it and i have girl friends who talk abt sex so freely and i almost envy that. i never talk about it bc i’m not confident at all & i’m scared ESPECIALLY of my bf going down on me 

it’s not fishy but it’s definitely musky/slightly oniony? sometimes and even a 30 mins after a shower if my legs are open & i have just a towel on i smell myself so i don’t think it’s sweat (haven’t ruled it out tho bc my inner thighs do sweat). i was thinking discharge could play apart bc it’s pretty much the same/a similar smell

and speaking of discharge i hate when i get that wet feeling so much and idk what to do. (it’s a clear/cream color) i used to wear panty liners everyday but then i read that’s bad for her. 

so is there just nothing i can do abt it? i’m always paranoid that i smell if anyone’s too close bc i feel wet and gross and i don’t wear cute underwear often bc i feel like my discharge is gonna ruin it. i get a good amount daily🥲🥲🥲

i thought maybe it could be my diet too. obviously only a gynecologist would know but last time i went a year ago she said nothing’s wrong (and i’ve been having this problem for as long as i can remember). i’m in college and usually have a lot of work so i find myself eating less due to being busy & a poor appetite. i don’t really like junk food (except salty foods). i eat a lot of fruits but i def don’t get all the nutrients/food groups recommended 😅. i drink coffee 3-4 times week too

so that brings me to the question (tldr): 

what does a healthy vaginal care routine look like? are there any products/foods or drinks that would help my case (or are beneficial in general)? also, what are good unscented soap brands for down there? i use regular baby wipes",2,1733289470.0,WomensHealth,2,1.0,False

I’m a 27-year-old teacher from Canada, and I wanted to share my experience navigating the dating world. I often hear people assume that being attractive makes dating easy, but I’ve found it to be far more complicated than it seems. I’m not sharing this for sympathy but to shed some light on the less visible struggles that come with this.

I’ve been single for a while now, and while I love my independence teaching, hiking, working out, and indulging in my favorite Thai food.. my dating life has been far from smooth. Strangers often compliment me, and I get attention in public, but it doesn’t translate into meaningful connections.

The main issue? Being seen more for my body than for my personality or values. I’ve had countless interactions where men approach me with a lot of charm, but it quickly becomes clear that their intentions are mostly physical. I’m not someone who’s into casual flings. I want genuine companionship, someone who values me for who I am, not just my curves. Even when I take the initiative to approach someone I find interesting, things often follow the same pattern great conversations, a strong connection… but then, after intimacy, their interest fades. It’s disheartening and makes me cautious to open up again.

At this point, I’ve almost given up on dating apps and random encounters. I spend more time enjoying my solo hobbies: reading, traveling, watching movies, and going to the gym. My leggings and yoga pants are my loyal companions lol, but it would be nice to have someone who’d join me for coffee dates, hiking adventures, or just cozy nights in. I guess what I’m trying to say is that dating isn’t necessarily easy for women like me either. It can be isolating when people assume that attraction makes relationships effortless. If anything, it’s made me more guarded, knowing how hard it is to tell who genuinely wants me versus who’s just after the surface.

If you’ve felt this way too, or if you’ve found ways to overcome these hurdles, I’d love to hear your thoughts.",0,1733289404.0,Vent,5,0.5,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h0693t/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_her_adult_sister/)**: November 26, 2024**

So my (M30) and my partner (F26) live in a country far away from both of our families. We live in a tiny one bed flat which is for all intents and purposes a studio (glass partition wall), it's pretty cramped even with 2 of us. I also pay all the rent, my partner covers food and a couple bills (far less overall and FAR less over the course of our relationship due to me earning considerably more). My GF has just spent a couple of weeks seeing said sister in another country. Her sister is doing some travelling and then had planned to come and stay with us. I've been given no dates and wasn't asked if this was OK or even how I felt about it.

I was pretty stressed about it. I work long hours in a stressful position which includes once a week on average 14 hour shifts and two sets of night shifts (so needing to sleep during the day) during the time she plans to come. I'm a very introverted person and value my free space. I would have to go to the bathroom to get changed because of the glass partition. I eventually told her how I was feeling, explained that I absolutely wanted her to spend with her sister, but asked that we consider others work around. She was disappointed but seemed to understand to some extent.

Today just before she boards her flight home she tells me she's sad, that she's crying and I ask why, because she's gonna miss her family? I'm like, well you're gonna see your sister again in a few weeks hey! To which she responds with a screenshot of her and her sister taking about how upset they are, that they just wanted to spend time together but since I'm 'stressed' then they will have to just cut their time short together and how much this sucks for them. Immediately after she's offline and on her flight.

They have just spent 2 weeks off work together and her sister is planning on travelling for 3 weeks alone before coming here, she just got a promotion doubling her salary. I feel that if it was so important to spend time together her sister should sacrifice some of her personal travel time and pay for her accommodation here and my girlfriend could contribute what she can also. But no, it's my fault they can't have fun together.

I feel incredibly guilty tripped and annoyed that she didn't even think to ask me or consider how I might feel about this. If we had space I would have no problem, her friend stayed last year for a month when we had 2 bedrooms.

I still don't even know when she is planning to come, for how long, where she will sleep (our sofa is not big enough for an adult to sleep on).

Anyway I went on a bit of a rant explaining how I felt about the whole situation. Am I being unreasonable in thinking this is not cool?

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: NTA, your partner invited her sister over despite the logistical limitations without discussing with you first, it’s your home too. it doesn’t seem there’s a budget issue as you mention said sister recently got promoted and doubled her salary which means sister could have booked a nearby hotel and your partner could have stayed with her few days. Worst I think is your partner throwing you under the buss in her exchange with the sister instead of acknowledging her part of creating this situation in the first place.

>**OOP:** Thanks for the re-assurance. I think I was definitely an ass in some of my reactionary comments and I'll apologise for those but I agree I don't think I'm at fault for the root issue here, despite being made to feel that I am.

Commenter: NTA. I would be really frustrated and upset if my partner tried to make a unilateral decision like this for a shared space. Especially one so tiny. This kind of behavior comes across as inconsiderate and lacking in maturity, especially given how she placed the blame on you rather than taking accountability. 

I would have a sit down talk with your gf and really lay it out. Ask her how she would feel if you invited a male friend or brother to stay there and how it would appear that you expected her to just deal with the situation, as uncomfortable as it might be. Ask her how considerate that would be. Offer her no judgement, just try to understand and help her understand why you felt the way you felt.

>**OOP:** Thanks for the thought out response. Definitely going to sit down and talk about it. Unfortunately I jumped right into sending a load of reactionary messages which were immature in themself, thankfully have been able to unsend them and so I will be doing just what you say and having a no judgement sit down to lay out how I feel and why.

Commenter: Especially if there is no way to close off the bedroom and the main financial provider needs to sleep during the day! Girlfriend is selfish and entitled for inviting her sister without a conversation and agreement from her boyfriend, and then for the guilt tripping.

>**OOP:** This is what really got me, nights are hard enough in a relationship anyway, I'm also in healthcare so really need to optimise sleep to be able to perform, I'm just baffled.

Commenter: Have you asked about her sleeping arrangements, because now I’m curious how they think that would work

>**OOP:** Yes. She said she would sleep on the sofa (maybe one night crashing on a sofa this size is doable but not a few weeks) or on the floor (which would mean trampling her if went to get water/pee in the night and having to step over her in the morning to get coffee etc +) where there is just not enough space, I can't even do yoga/stretches inside cos we have so little floor space.  
Just seems ridiculous to me.  
Of note there is a cultural difference, her family is different to mine and would often have much more communal living - but she knows that is different for me.

Commenter (downvoted): i understand the space is small, but you're expecting her to drop her cultural norms to fit yours? don't you see that as a bit ironic?

>**OOP:** I don't think it is as simple as asking her to drop her cultural norms, we live a very western lifestyle together, as does her sister, I think her bringing up that 'its normal for them' to live more communally is unfair. Her family and our living/work situations are entirely different. They don't live in tiny one bed flats. If I visit her country I would be expected to adapt to fit in with their lifestyle.

**Update (Same Post): November 27, 2024 (Next Day)**

I measured the couch they had planned for her to sleep on which I had told them isn't big enough, it's 4'5 in length (she is 5'5), there is not enough floor space for an air mattress or anything like that - it is simply not feasible.

To everyone who felt this was a deal breaker/relationship ender - that's kind of insane based on the above information. I agree with those who suggested that she was upset about any obstacles limiting her plan and that she was somewhat blinded by excitement to the reality of our situation. I get that, I have done similar in the past. I don't think she was intentionally manipulating me, I think she was upset and wanted to express that, I get that.

She apologised for making me feel bad, accepted the reality of our living situation and is trying to find workarounds.

It's clear that communication is really key in relationships. Had there been clear communication prior this whole situation could have been avoided. The reason I came to Reddit rather than talk with her more is because she was travelling for around 24hrs and offline. To those who suggested we talk without judgement and just try and understand where both sides were coming from, thank you - this is the way.",93,1733289261.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,13,0.88,False

In a groundbreaking study released by the Institute of Caffeinated Behavior (ICB), researchers have concluded that individuals who do not drink coffee are a staggering **99% more likely** to develop psychopathic tendencies and commit violent crimes. This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves through the coffee-loving community and raised eyebrows among non-coffee drinkers everywhere.

# The Study's Surprising Findings

The ICB conducted a survey of over **1,000 participants** across various demographics, including coffee aficionados, tea drinkers, and those who abstain from caffeine altogether. The results were nothing short of sensational:

* **99%** of non-coffee drinkers exhibited traits associated with psychopathy, such as lack of empathy and impulsive behavior.
* Coffee drinkers, on the other hand, reported feeling more grounded and sociable, with **85%** stating that their daily brew helps them connect with others.
* Interestingly, **75%** of participants who identified as “tea enthusiasts” also showed signs of mild psychopathy but were generally more polite about it.

# Expert Commentary

Dr. Arabica J. Roast, the lead researcher on the project, stated, “Our findings suggest a strong correlation between coffee consumption and mental health stability. It seems that caffeine not only wakes you up but also keeps your darker impulses at bay.”When asked about the implications of these findings, Dr. Roast added, “We encourage everyone to drink at least one cup of coffee a day to help maintain their sanity—after all, who wants to be a psychopath?”

# Public Reaction

The public response has been a mix of laughter and disbelief. Social media has erupted with memes featuring coffee cups and captions like “Stay caffeinated or risk becoming a criminal mastermind!” Some non-coffee drinkers have taken offense, launching the hashtag **#CaffeineDiscrimination**, arguing that they can be perfectly normal without their daily dose of java.",2,1733289018.0,u_Happy_Round6680,2,1.0,False

1h68f2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigHomeProContractors/comments/1h68f2v/7_tips_for_creating_compelling_roofing_project/,7 Tips for Creating Compelling Roofing Project Case Studies,"Creating roofing project case studies that grab attention and build trust is all about the details, so let's break it down with some real talk:

1. **Focus on Relatability** You’ve got to connect with your audience by addressing their common pain points. Talk about those annoying leaks or storm damage. People want to see their problems in your stories. Use a narrative that feels like you’re telling a story over coffee, and they’ll remember you.
2. **Highlight the Outcome** Start off strong with clear results. Like, if you saved a homeowner 30% on energy bills with new roofing, shout about it! Not just the good stuff, though—mention any hiccups along the way. It makes you seem more real and trustworthy.
3. **Explain the Solution** Lay out your game plan for fixing the client's problem. Break down the steps you took and why you took ‘em. Maybe use diagrams if it helps. This shows you know your stuff and can handle whatever comes your way.
4. **Include Key Facts and Visuals** People love visuals! Throw in some before-and-after photos, maybe an infographic or two. If you’ve got a time-lapse of your team working on a roof, even better! It breaks up the text and keeps folks interested.
5. **Leverage Testimonials and Referrals** Get those happy clients to talk about their experience. A good testimonial is worth its weight in gold. Also, consider setting up a referral program—give clients a reason to spread the word about your awesome work.
6. **Emphasize Local SEO** Local SEO is your friend. Sprinkle in those city names and local roofing terms naturally throughout your case study. You want to pop up when people in your area are searching for roofing solutions.
7. **Present Information Clearly** Keep it simple and easy to read. Use bullet points and clear headings so folks can find what they’re looking for without getting lost in a sea of text. Remember, attention spans are short these days!

I wanted to share a little story about my childhood friend and me as we ventured into the world of startups. We started with a simple online business selling instant coffee powders through Instagram and eCommerce websites, and the response was overwhelming! Encouraged by the support, we took the plunge and opened a small coffee shop focused on takeout. To our surprise, it was a huge success!

However, we soon realized that to increase our profits, we needed to offer food, but the space at our first outlet was just too small. So, we decided to open a second outlet, where we could serve both coffee and food. None of us had formal training in cooking or hospitality, but as passionate foodies who love experimenting in the kitchen, we figured it out along the way. Thankfully, our hard work paid off, and our café quickly became a hit.

Our signature coffee, which we always believed in, even caught the attention of some celebrity clients! As we’ve grown, we’re now ready to take the next step and open our next outlet. At this point, we’re looking for investors who can not only provide financial support but also help us expand by leveraging their industry contacts and expertise.

We operate all our outlets ourselves and are not looking to franchise. In exchange for investment, we are offering a percentage of the overall income for that particular outlet. Currently, all three of our outlets are in Mumbai, but we are open to exploring other cities as well. We are also open to overall company investment and in return, we are offering equity shares.

If anyone here is interested in collaborating or investing, we’d love to discuss potential opportunities.

Thanks for reading, and we’re excited to see where this journey takes us!

Sources close to the diplomatic scene report that these leaders often take advantage of lengthy discussions to catch up on much-needed rest.

# The Nap Chronicles

During a recent summit aimed at addressing pressing issues such as migration and corruption, officials observed that:

* **Juan Orlando Hernández** of Honduras was spotted dozing off while Vice President Kamala Harris discussed economic strategies.
* **Alejandro Giammattei** of Guatemala was seen snoring softly during a presentation on human rights violations.
* **Nayib Bukele** of El Salvador reportedly took a power nap right before his turn to speak, missing the chance to address key policy reforms.

# A Pattern of Drowsiness

According to a study by the fictitious Institute of International Sleep Studies (IISS), over **70%** of Northern Triangle leaders admit to napping during meetings. The study found that:

* **45%** of leaders prefer to nap during discussions about economic aid.
* **30%** claim they only stay awake for topics related to their personal interests.
* Surprisingly, **25%** believe that napping enhances their decision-making skills.

# Expert Opinions

Dr. Reston Snooze, a leading expert in political fatigue, commented on this phenomenon: “It’s not just about being tired; it reflects a deeper issue. If leaders can’t stay awake for discussions that affect their countries, how can we expect them to tackle corruption and violence?”

# Public Reaction

The public's response has been mixed. While some citizens express frustration over their leaders’ apparent lack of engagement, others have taken to social media with memes depicting their leaders as “sleepyheads.” A popular hashtag, #WakeUpLeaders, has gained traction, calling for more accountability.

# Conclusion

As the Northern Triangle grapples with significant challenges like migration and corruption, the last thing it needs is leaders who are too busy catching Z’s to address pressing issues. Perhaps it’s time for these officials to invest in stronger coffee rather than longer naps.Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to monitor the sleeping habits of our world leaders!",1,1733288516.0,u_Happy_Round6680,1,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kzqjxi/my_m_31_wife_28_wants_a_divorce_because_i_live_an/)  **Jan 18, 2021** 

[Copy of the original](https://imgur.com/a/L9WSmuo) 

I (M 31) have been with my wife (F28) for three years.  We had a short engagement, married quickly, and have a perfectly ordinary existence.  I love her, she loves me.  We do taxes, house work.  Watch movies.  All the normal things.  No physical cheating on either side as far as I know. 

But here's the thing.  I am a lucid dreamer, which means I can, to an extent, control my dreams which is something I find cool as it allows me to go on adventures while asleep.  It also makes scary dreams not so bad because I can just wake myself out of them. 

Over the last year or so I've been having a recurring dream about my ex, my first love (F 29).  Truth be told I never got over her.  We were together for 5 years from 15/17 - 20/22.  We broke up after I graduated from college because she didn't want to move from New York to South Carolina with me which is where the biggest industry for my field is. 

I was crushed but moved on and we've spoken sporadically over the years although we never crossed any lines.  I will admit that I've kept up with her own social media a bit but nothing stalkerish. 

Well a year ago she announced she was getting married and I experienced a resurgence of feelings for her, although I never acted on them or told her. 

That same night, I dreamed about her for the first time in years.  In the dream she showed up at my door and asked me if I wanted to get coffee.  I said yes of course.  The dream (which was not a lucid dream) ended there.  It felt so real, I couldn't shake the feeling once I woke up. 

It felt like we were actually reconnecting. 

Since then I've dreamed about her several times a week and I've practiced becoming lucid so I've been able to control the outcome more times than not.  We've lived a whole life together over the past year. 

Everything from dates to a trip to Paris together which we visited while in college.  We even re walked the same paths we did in real life. 

It got to the point I was looking forward to going to sleep to be with her. 

Fast forward to today, my wife told me she felt distant from me.  And I started to feel guilty because I thought what I was doing was harmless but she's obviously noticed a change in me. 

So I confessed.  About all of it.  At first she that I was joking but when she realized I was serious, she accused me of cheating on her and told her mom and sisters who are calling me a cheating weirdo.  She even threatened to tell my ex so she'll know what a ""fucking loser"" I am. 

Now I get that it's not anything a woman would want to hear, but it's not like I physically cheated.  I don't want to lose my wife, but I don't think she can forgive me for this. 

Tl:dr: I live an entirely separate life with my ex in my dreams and now my wife wants to divorce me.  But I really love her still and don't want to lose her.  Do we have a chance? 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**soulangelic** 

>Yeah, no, I think this might be a lost cause. I would certainly consider this cheating, and I think that it does indeed warrant a divorce. 

>You clearly don’t “really love her”—at least, not as much as you love your ex. 

**OOP** 

>>I do love my wife, which is why I married her. I just also have feelings for my ex, which I should have been honest about before we got married. 

>>I didn't mean for this to happen but once it did I wasn't able to stop it. Living that life with my ex while sleeping felt like getting to experience what I missed out on in young adulthood. 

>>With that said, my wife left overnight for a hotel and I don't know if she's coming back. 

>>I feel awful for hurting her. 

**~** 

**elzobot** 

>i’m asking this genuinely, not trying to be snarky at all, what did you think your wife’s reaction was going to be? did you expect what happened or did you think she would be more accepting? 

**OOP** 

>>I knew she would be upset but I felt I owed her an explanation once she communicated that due felt distant. I didn't want to gaslight her perception. I just hadn't known that she even noticed a difference in me. 

>>I just didn't think she would leave. She's turned off her location I have no idea where she is or if she's alright and her family won't speak to me now. 

>>I do love her and would like for our marriage not to end but that seems inevitable now as I process this.

After a major blowup, where my wife called me every name in the book, and got her family involved (which I understand completely so please don't take this wrong) my wife left.  I didn't know her whereabouts for over 24 hours. 

Early this morning about 3 am she came home and told me she wanted to file for divorce.  She didn't want to have to compete with a ""phantom"" and deserved better than a shit bag like me.  But she doesn't want to move out or start the process because it's a pandemic and she doesn't want to live on one income (we make roughly the same amount of money -- me 90,000 a year after taxes; and her 85,000)  . 

I tried to apologize to her for all the hurt I caused by making her feel like she wasn't enough, to assure her that I do love her even though I still love my ex and explain to her that I've never physically cheated or  had any inappropriate conversation with my ex.  But she won't budge.  She doesn't want me anymore.  I can't blame her.  I was selfish and I shouldn't have carried on what I now accept to be a one-sided emotional affair.  So I agreed to stay together, for financial purposes, for two years (or until the pandemic is over, whichever comes first) but she's kicked me out of our bedroom and basically claimed the second floor for herself. 

There's so much tension in the house right now, so I left as soon as the sun came up and went to a coffee shop to do some work.  While there, I received a message on IG from my ex that my ex wife sent her a long message from her own account telling her about everything that I told her.  I froze because I hadn't spoken to her in a long time.  But she saw that I had read the message and followed up an hour later, telling me she needed to know the truth. 

So, again, I confessed, expecting to be berated and called a loser again.  Because I had nothing else to lose.  But she didn't think that my dreams about her were weird or creepy.  She thought it was sweet that I still loved her, especially with her knowing that I'd never tried to have inappropriate conversations or force my way into her life. 

I'm aware that her not condemning my actions don't make them right or take away from the hurt I caused my wife, but knowing she didn't think negatively of me made me feel better.  We messaged back and forth for a couple of hours, talking about our relationship and how it ended and the choices we made.  In that, I learned that she and her fiance called off their engagement a few months ago.  I also told her my wife was going to divorce me because of the revelation. 

She expressed her condolences and that was the end of the conversation. 

I'm home now and I can't help but wonder if this is the universe's way of putting my ex and I back on the path to reconciliation.  Hate me if you want, but I made a mistake and I hurt my wife and my marriage is over now.  Or going to be.  But knowing that the person I ruined my marriage over doesn't think I'm the scum of the earth is worth its weight in gold. 

I don't know what will happen now.  But I can't imagine a friendship with my ex won't blossom from this, at the very least.  I know this won't make my wife happy since she contacted my ex to further shame me, but I may just not tell her.  We are, after all, divorceng. 

I hope the next few months and years can result in healing for both my wife and myself, and that we'll both live happy, fulfilled lives. 

Tl:dr: I live an entirely separate life with my ex in my dreams and now my wife wants to divorce me.  Now my ex and I have reconnected.

**[deleted]** 

>I hope you don’t take it out on her when you realize that your old flame isn’t the person she was in your dreams. 

>Because that was you. You were in love with another version of you. She’ll be someone else entirely. 

**OOP** 

>>I'm also a different person. And I wasn't in love with myself. The love for her influenced the dreams. 

**[deleted]** 

>>>When I say ""she'll be someone else entirely,"" I don't mean that your ex will have changed since you last knew her. I mean that your ex—in actual, real life—will be someone other than the person you spent so much time with in your dreams. That person in your dreams was not your ex in any meaningful way. She was an amalgamation of your memories of her, patched together using new material you created out of whole cloth to please yourself. 

>>>She won't ever be able to live up to the fantasy you constructed, because the fantasy woman *was* you. The things she did and said were things you invented, just like every character an author writes is a version of themselves. You've invested countless hours and serious emotion into a character you created, who is really only loosely based on your ex. Since a real woman can't read your mind like a dream-character can, and because a real woman doesn't exist only to make you happy, she will not—in real life—be the same person from your dreams. That may be disappointing to you when you realize it, so try not to take it out on the girl. 

**OOP** 

>>>>Fair. But I'm not expecting her to be. The dream could never compare to the warmth and love she radiates in real life. It was a coping mechanism. Real life will be better. 

**ilovesharks101** 

>>>>>You sound absolutely obsessed with this woman, and to be honest it’s quite disturbing. I imagine much of who she is has changed over the years. What if she’s not the person you remembered? She will never compare to the fantasy, and honestly your obsession over her perfection is rather frightening.

It didn't directly spill on the battery, rather it spread around it only touching the bottom/lower sides.  I picked it up right away and dried it off, but I'm concerned that the connection port (sorry for bad terminology) may have been compromised.  If it was water I'd happily let dry for a few days and get right back to use, but this was a sticky milky substance.  Should I use a q-tip and carefully clean edges with water, clean it another way, play it safe and just get a whole new battery, or am I overreacting?  Battery is a Sony NP-FW50.  TIA!

AITAH for using chili as a tool for revolution and accidentally dividing my neighborhood??","If you’d told me two weeks ago that I’d be impeaching a retired marine biologist, hosting a “Chili and Healing Circle,” and defending a rainbow flag from the self-proclaimed Queen of Hydrangeas, I’d have said you were nuts. But here I am, standing in the ruins of what was once a peaceful suburban neighborhood, asking the internet if I’m the problem.

Let’s rewind.

For context, I’m a 32F (my chili is award-winning), and my neighbor Greg is 58M (retired marine biologist, if that helps). The HOA President, who is 47M (makes artisanal birdhouses), announced at the cook-off that we’d be funding a new communal garden by raising everyone’s fees. Cue my sarcastic clap and, yes, *slightly* dramatic declaration: “As your Supreme Ruler, I veto this nonsense!”

Here's the thing: my 74F lawyer aunt, who *literally* specializes in HOA disputes, was there and said I was technically correct. She’s the one who showed me the fine print of the HOA charter where it says members can call for an immediate leadership re-election by popular vote during an official HOA gathering. *Guess what the chili cook-off counts as?*

The vote was 19 to 2 in my favor (Greg abstained because of “moral reasons,” whatever that means), and boom: I’m HOA president now. But then things got weird.

The ex-president tried to call an emergency meeting the next day (Monday), but I refused to recognize it under Article 12 of the charter. *By Tuesday morning, the entire old HOA board had resigned.* My aunt helped me draft the paperwork to make everything official.

By Wednesday, one of the old board members, Darlene (63F, self-described ""hydrangea expert""), fainted from “stress-induced heartbreak” when she saw me parking in the HOA President's reserved spot. She had to be taken to the hospital by her husband Frank (66M, who runs a vintage stamp blog).

Meanwhile, Greg (58M, still salty about the chili) tried to rally a counter-coup by forming an “independent HOA council,” which consisted of himself, his golden retriever Max (7M, good boy), and Martin (52M, a beekeeper who allegedly produces ""illegal amounts of honey""). They posted flyers around the neighborhood demanding my resignation. I confiscated them, citing HOA bylaws on unsanctioned signage.

By Thursday, Helen (34F, my unofficial VP) convinced her 37M husband (yes, the extremely hot one) to install motion-activated floodlights around the communal garden, which Greg insists are “aggressive” and “interfere with Max’s nighttime routine.”

Meanwhile, Cheryl (74F, lawyer aunt) filed an injunction to stop Greg’s independent council on the grounds that Max, as a dog, cannot legally hold office. The case is now pending in small claims court.

By Friday, Helen and I held a meeting in my living room, where we replaced all the old HOA rules with the “Chili Cook-Off Charter,” which focuses heavily on chili-related activities and a very generous chili-tasting budget.

Greg retaliated by planting *pineapples* in the communal garden and declaring them a ""symbol of dissent."" I responded by hosting an emergency HOA barbecue that evening where we made pineapple salsa and served it over chili as a joke. Greg didn’t show up, but apparently Darlene did, fresh out of the hospital, to dramatically “renounce” her HOA membership by throwing her hydrangea shears at my feet.

Now let me introduce Rowan (29NB, uses they/them pronouns). Rowan is a *literal saint*. They’re a trans, autistic, fat, vegan, ex-pole-dancer-turned-interfaith-minister who’s been working tirelessly to fund their surrogacy journey with their husband Amir (31M, a carpenter with a heart of gold). Despite their Borderline Personality Disorder (which they’ve been completely open about and manage with therapy), they are the most emotionally grounded person I know.

By Saturday, Rowan came with me to the weekly HOA bake sale to counteract Greg’s anti-chili propaganda. They gave an impromptu sermon on the *parallels between chili diversity and the human experience*. People were moved to tears. Even Helen’s hot husband (*finally*) admitted Rowan was ""the moral compass the HOA needs.""

But then Greg (58M, *still* bitter about the pineapple salsa) showed up and accused Rowan of being “a literal communist infiltrator” because they suggested adding a rainbow flag to the communal garden. Rowan, ever the peacemaker, invited Greg to attend their Sunday evening pole-dancing class to “work through his negative energy.” Greg stormed off muttering something about “the sanctity of pineapples.”

By Sunday, Rowan had recruited three neighbors (aged 33F, 45M, and 67F) to form a subcommittee called “Chili for All” to promote inclusivity in HOA events. They also brought Amir along to help renovate the neglected HOA clubhouse into a community center. *In one day*, they installed a reading nook, a self-serve coffee station, and a corkboard for neighborhood announcements. Rowan even offered to host a “Chili and Healing Circle” to repair the growing divide in the community.

However, things escalated when Darlene (63F, *still fragile after her hospital visit*) showed up claiming the reading nook was “an affront to the proud hydrangea heritage of this neighborhood.” Rowan calmly explained the concept of neurodivergent-friendly spaces, but Darlene fainted *again* and had to be carried out by Frank (66M, her stamp-blogging husband), who glared at Rowan the entire time.

At this point, Greg is threatening to “take this to the state level,” Rowan is baking vegan brownies for next week’s emergency HOA meeting, and Cheryl (74F, legal powerhouse and chili enthusiast) is preparing a cease-and-desist letter for Greg’s “Save the Pineapples” campaign.

Date: December 3, 2024



In a shocking revelation that has brewed controversy across Central America, a recent study has found that some of the region's most notorious leaders are not just corrupt—they're also surprisingly averse to coffee. The findings suggest that the worst offenders are steering clear of the beloved beverage altogether, raising eyebrows and questions about their leadership qualities.

# The Study's Findings

Conducted by the fictitious Institute of Caffeinated Politics (ICP), the study surveyed 100 political leaders across Central America, including well-known figures such as:

Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) - 0% coffee consumption

Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua) - 15% coffee consumption

Juan Orlando Hernández  (Honduras) - 20% coffee consumption

The results were startling: a staggering 65% of the leaders surveyed reported drinking less than one cup of coffee per week, while 35% admitted to avoiding coffee entirely. In stark contrast, leaders with higher approval ratings, such as Luis Abinader (Dominican Republic), were found to consume an average of 4 cups per day, suggesting a correlation between caffeine intake and political popularity.

# What Does It Mean?

Experts speculate that this aversion to coffee might indicate deeper issues within these administrations. “It’s hard to trust a leader who doesn’t appreciate the rich flavors of Central American coffee,” said Dr. Brewster Grounds, a leading political analyst at ICP. “Coffee is not just a drink; it’s a cultural staple. If they can’t enjoy our finest beans, how can we expect them to lead effectively?”

Moreover, the study noted that leaders who preferred tea over coffee were more likely to engage in questionable practices. For instance, Ortega, who reportedly enjoys herbal tea, was linked to several corruption scandals involving public funds.

# The Coffee Culture Connection

Central America is renowned for its high-quality coffee production, with countries like Guatemala and Costa Rica exporting millions of pounds each year. The irony is not lost on coffee farmers struggling to make ends meet while their leaders sip on chamomile instead of supporting local brews.

In response to these findings, local baristas have launched a campaign titled “Brew for Change,” encouraging citizens to demand accountability from their leaders—preferably over a cup of coffee.

#  Conclusion

As this caffeinated controversy unfolds, one thing is clear: if these leaders want to regain public trust, they might want to reconsider their beverage choices. After all, nothing says “I care about my country” quite like enjoying a steaming cup of rich Central American coffee.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story as we continue to sift through the grounds of political corruption in Central America.",1,1733287676.0,u_Happy_Round6680,0,1.0,False

1h680cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1h680cm/okay_i_am_in_a_dilemma_i_need_advice/,"Okay, I am in a dilemma, I need advice","So, 2 days ago I was in a job interview. It went average. There were three interviewers. One of them was this guy with a silly comical face(he always smiles) yet somehow looking extremely cute. Idk if it was gay radar or I just liked him at first glance but something drew me closer to him. He was making jokes all the time, the kind that is not too deep but would make you feel much more relaxed since most of the time job interviews do the complete opposite. 

It went well and I came back home. Yesterday I accidentally sent an email to that company(I swear it was an accident, not intentional). I didn’t realise this until HE called me and asked me whether I sent anything like that. 

Long story short, we solved the problem and he actually helped me over the phone to resolve the issue(I got paid less by my current job and I was trying to email them to figure it out, but the email was accidentally sent to this guy’s company.) Since he was also an accountant he counted my salary and tried to figure out why this happened. I got embarrassed tbh. But also kinda felt butterflies.

He is either a very nice person or he is just a closeted gay who is trying to make a connection. I showed him to a couple of my friends they said he definitely has the queer energy but still not 100 per cent sure.

I checked out his ig(okay I stalked him🤦🏻) and the only women he shared photos with are his 40+ years old coworkers. 

I talked to the accountant at my job and resolved the issue with him. Now I want to tell him that and ask him if I can take him out for a coffee as an apology. I don’t even care about the job anymore. I just want to get to know him better. But I am afraid it could backfire really badly and everything can fall apart really quickly. 

Look, I know how it sounds but I am not a creep or a serial stalker. Something tells me that this is a happy accident and I should take my chance. This never happened to me before. 

What should I do? I really need you guys’ advice🙏🏻",0,1733287497.0,gaybros,6,0.33,False

I want him to be happy. I also want to smother him with affection and have him stop talking to any other girls (not 'talking' as in flirting talking as in literally just regular conversations). Those two things are mutually exclusive, and him being happy will always take precedence. For both my obsession and love, I think they agree that I never want to be the reason he is burdened or hurt. 

I know the thoughts I have aren't healthy and I never externalize them. Sometimes I'm scared that I can't tell the difference of when I'm feeling love or obsession. I would never act obsessive with him, or manipulate him, or monopolize him, but if it were somehow morally okay and he was okay with it I hate to admit that I absolutely would. 

As an example he has a best friend. They're both straight dudes, and any time I ever suspected there was a girl in the picture it turned out to be his friend which is slightly hilarious (he can't talk because he's facetiming someone else? it's his homie. he's out on a coffee date with someone? it was his homie.) And I hate it. But I also hate that I hate it. My brain screams ""Spend time with me instead, do all those things with me instead, talk to me he's taking time with you away from me I hate him"" but deep down I'm grateful that he has a close friend in his life that makes him happy. His friend makes him happy. Which makes me happy, yet how I wish that friend would disappear like the despicable person I am. 

We aren't even dating so that adds a whole other level of delusion and patheticness on my end. I go as far as I think he'd be okay with. What he's okay with is very far away than what I'm capable of. I'd cling on to him 24/7 and spout off how beautiful and wonderful he is if he'd let me. But in reality that would terrify him and push him away, so I contain myself. He hasn't caught on to how much I'm holding back. 

I have a very specific fear scenario that runs through my head sometimes, where one day I slip up and can't contain it. I'm on my knees begging him to not leave me, that I love him so much, that I want to lock him up and spend every second with him, and he looks at me with a horrified expression. In that scenario I will have hurt him emotionally and broken his trust, which is the worst part. 

I know we are incompatible, because even if he did like me back romantically, it'd be on the basis of a lie. That I am less obsessive that I am. I think I'd keep the facade up in a relationship as well, but it'd tear me apart inside because he's the complete opposite of me. He doesn't like physical affection, doesn't like clinging or clingy people, not good with expressing mushy or sentimental feelings. 

So if this is how I love, then I am afraid. I am afraid I will never meet someone and be able to give them the same magnitude of happiness they give me. Sometimes, I don't even desire an equal love back, just for tolerance of me. Someone who wouldn't run away from all that I am. Someone who doesn't even need to give anything to me in return as long as they accept *all* of my love without being disgusted. 

basically my biggest fear is no one will ever match my freak LMAOOOO",3,1733287457.0,Obsessive_Love,0,1.0,False

I’ve found most premium brands to be overwhelmingly, cloyingly sweet unless they are a relatively plain flavor with bitter notes, like dark chocolate or coffee. Of course, the midprice and cheap ones now are usually not actually ice cream and have that weird stabilizer texture. 

I’m not a crazy person— like, I believe ice cream should be sweet! Even very sweet! But I want it to taste deeply of something other than sugar and fat. I’m particularly partial to fruit flavors, picky about baked good inspired varieties, and generally prefer classics to the really zany stuff, but am open minded.

1h67wf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subaru_Outback/comments/1h67wf6/mixed_experience_so_far_with_2024_subaru_outback/,Mixed experience so far with 2024 Subaru Outback Limited purchased 1 month ago....,"hi there....so, my family has always had Subarus. Most recently my Mom and I have been sharing a 2015 Outback Limited that we've had since it was new. It has 62,000 miles on it and is a stellar car. My Mom wanted a new car, so bought a certified pre-owned 2024 with 6000k miles on it. So far............mehhhh. We're kinda sad and disappointed. Not sure we'll keep it.

**POSITIVES**

* it's quiet and the ride is smooth 
* you don't have to manually pull a lever to unlatch the gas tank 
* ability to customize seat placement is useful with 2 very different people driving the car 
* very comfortable
* quieter on the highway 
* heat and defroster come on more quickly and work well

Those are all very nice plusses but I'm afraid they're the only plusses.

**NEGATIVES--compared to 2015 Outback Limited (and other cars)**

*  headlights that are aimed way down too low 
* headlights have weird black ""things"" hanging in front of the headlights 
* entertainment screen is enormous and unwieldy 
* 2 separate little storage spaces between the 2 front seats have been eliminated 
* no longer a little ""well"" to prop your phone in 
* no area under entertainment screen big enough to stow bunch of things as well as charge phone (as 2015 had) 
* every time we get in the car we have to turn off the ""auto-dimming"" rear mirror 
* every time get in car have to turn off that function that makes your car ""stall"" at stop signs 
* up/down temperature arrow buttons aren't backlit---UNTIL you put the car in gear--It's cold and dark where we live for much of the year and you want to turn on ignition and adjust the heat--but car to must be in gear first--how does that make sense?(!) 
* you have to push with all your strength for 10-seconds on the button to turn off the radio---why? 
* touch screen lags---often is not responsive---sometimes it doesn't even come on and is just a grey screen with a swirling icon for up to 30 seconds before it comes on 
* often have to push touch screen again and again and again before it responds to change stations or adjust heat etc. 
* sometimes touch screen doesn't ever respond and we just give up 
* seatbelt warning is so deafening it damaged my hearing--immediately escalates to outrageous audio level (sometimes I want to undo my seatbelt if I have a difficult parallel park, or if I know I am going to jump out of my car to get into work, or if I need to get settled in a tiny bit before snapping on the seatbelt--again: literally--from only 1/2 a dozen times of not getting it snapped in on time--have developed tinnitus from this.  And it makes us very anxious as well--not a good feeling--this panic that your ears are about to be blown off)
* we don't feel in control of this car---it seems at times it is in control of the driver---which we do not like  
* take a sip of coffee or reach over to pull down the sun shade on the driver's side it starts flashing EYES ON THE ROAD EYES ON THE ROAD!I 
* we have always used cruise control often, but now it takes over the car and slows down and speeds up according to its own will--not what *we* want 
* the other day the car took over the steering wheels and I literally had to fight it with all my strength to get back on course--it was terrifying and I don't understand wtf happened!
* Sometimes on the highway, feels like a hurricane outside, like the way most cars do when being blown from unusually high winds--I looked at the trees and they weren't even moving--it was NOT acting that way because it was being blown by high winds. What is going on?
* With winter here I'm very concerned what might happen on the icy windy roads and highways we have here. Where you must be absolutely in control -- not leave it to some car with a mind of its own. I don't trust what it is doing.

We never had any of these problems with the other Subarus we've owned.  We are seriously considering returning this car.   
  
We're wondering whether this was in fact a ""loaner"" car---or whether maybe someone else bought it and returned it?  
  
I noticed someone named Bob's phone had been hooked up previously to the car AND Bob ALSO clocked in 3000 miles on this car....seems like a lot for a loaner. I even mentioned to the salesman 6k seemed a bit high mileage for a loaner. He just said ""Sometimes people drive loaners quite a bit.""

Really sad and disappointed about what seems to have been a mistake --- and changes that are beyond an adjustment period.    
  
Prior to this car (separate from my Mom) I went from a Mazda to a Mercedes and **never** had these radical adjustments or learning curves.  Very discouraging.

**Have others experienced this?  Are there ways to permanently disable some of these arbitrary intrusive features?**   
  
**Should the salesman have told us about all these things and shown us how to deal with all them?**   
  
**Does anyone have any insight into what is going on regarding these** ***radical*** **changes? Is how our car acting usual?**   
  
**Do people who--like us--have owned Subarus for years actually like these things about it?  Are these common observations and complaints others have?**

It doesn’t hurt or feel anything different. It just has a significant colour difference if you look closely enough. I also regularly drink orange juice/coffee if that makes a difference.

I was just wondering if it is possible the dental glue that is used for the tooth gem that is turning yellow?

The one guy who told me, in a public library, that I was “lucky I wasn’t one of the humans that was artificially created by aliens.""

If you don’t know from my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pxrnnf/aliens_visited_us_but_no_one_remembers/), that’s pretty much the gist of him.

And again, my friends begged me to stay away from this person. To their credit, most sane people would say something like hey, probably don’t talk to people who have claimed they have met and were tortured by aliens. Really my friends were reasonably worried that I was going to be murdered by some random homeless guy I met in a library. I suspect they also thought I was borderline having a psychotic episode myself. I get it, I really do. 

But they hadn’t met him. They hadn’t been *read* by him.

I remember scrolling through his messages to me. Reading them over, making sure I got the all the directions right. Not in a careful “have I followed these correctly” kinda way, but more of a disbelieving “are you fucking kidding me, is this really what I have to do”, kinda way. 

Apparently, the only safe way to speak with him about anything was through encrypted messages through an E2EE messaging app. Not sure what that is but OK. Go off. That’s a download or two, not too hard. But also, it has to be done on a brand new pre-paid cellphone that I needed to purchase with a VISA gift card. A gift card, that needed to be purchased with cash in a location hours away from my home. This, you see, was the only safe way to communicate. For some reason.

Why bother, my friends asked. A couple things. One, I am obsessed with the truth about this world. I love the occult, the conspiracies, all of it. I’m not crazy mind you, it’s really a hobby for me, especially because any coherent logical reading of any paranormal phenomena, any conspiracy, ends up in a trash can labeled “probably didn't happen”.

This time though... 

I couldn’t help but open and re-read an e-mail I had. It was from my latest blood test results I had gotten a week ago.

“B+” it said. I didn’t know my blood type until then. Well, that’s a lie actually- the alien guy, who I had met months ago, took one look at me and told me what it was. Lucky guess you say. He then told me that I had twisted my ankle playing soccer a year ago, which was true. He knew where I had a birthmark, my family medical history, my exact eyesight… He roughly knew what I had eaten that morning. He knew my original hair color, before I dyed it. He knew I smoked weed once in college, but never liked it, and that I don’t drink much at all. 

A guy says something like that to you, tells you things he can’t possibly know, that you don’t even know, and you start to reconsider the part where he started talking about aliens.

I ended up being able to call him, finally, after decrypting the GGPG public key that he had sent. I have to say, I really hope he is just some homeless guy.

”Hello Isaac,” He spoke. He was a composed man, moreso than many people I’ve met, let alone someone who supposedly live on the streets. Right then though, he had sounded a little excited to have someone to speak to. 

”Hello alien man. I’ve looked very dumb and very suspicious in several local major retail locations because of you.”

“Well, luckily you shouldn’t be visiting those places anytime soon, since they should be hours away from your home address. Of course, that’s if you’ve followed my instructions.”

“Yes I made sure to follow your insane instructions. Can you please tell me more about the alien again now that I’ve suffered?”

He could barely stifle a chuckle. 

”The one you think I copied from Science Fiction?”

”Well, yes. You said its skin was gray, and that it had arms and legs or something like that. I’m just getting my bachelor’s in biology, Dr. Alien Man, but even I know that’s sci-fi crap from like Star Wars or Mass Effect or something. The chance that real aliens evolved to look anything like us, bi-pedal or whatever, is extremely low.”

”I suppose Dr. Alien Man works since I do have a PhD. Well, I guess had a PhD. I don’t think my credentials carried over to the New World created by the aliens. And while you’re mostly correct, I didn’t say it’s skin was gray, nor that it  evolved to look the way it does.”

“Wait, what? Then what *did* you say?”

He paused briefly, considering his words.

**”** I said it *chose* to look that way, Isaac. It’s no longer bound by what we understand as evolution. It took that shape to mock us.”

“Mock us? How can you know that?”

“You truly don’t understand even the beginnings of it. The alien wanted to expose the limits of our biology, to show us how fragile our pathetic species was. And yes... it tortured us. It enjoyed showing us what we could never understand, never become.”

I didn’t have much of a response to that, and let him continue.

""I can’t fully explain how far beyond us it was, Isaac. We never had a chance. Its biology was ahead of ours by thousands of years, maybe more. That gap gave it abilities we could never hope to understand—telepathy, psychophysical manipulation... it could control people, make them prisoners in their own bodies, witnesses to the things they did. No one liked to call it what it was, but it was essentially mind control.""

""It could do more than that, though. It could move objects without touching them—telekinesis, I guess you'd call it. The thing’s presence was inside your mind, constantly. As easily as opening and reading a book, it could invade your thoughts, uncover your secrets, change your very desires. If it wanted, it could erase memories or rewrite your entire personality, and you’d never know it wasn’t yours.""

He continued, speaking quickly, as if explaining critical information.

""We studied it in secret for a while, learned some things. Like I mentioned before, its abilities had limits. ‘Monitoring’ people’s thoughts was easy- it could hear and process thousands of minds at once, like background noise. But controlling someone fully—body and mind—that took more focus. It could maybe manage a hundred people at a time, at best.""

”That doesn’t seem like too big of a deal, “ I finally said.

""”Do you know how many people control the world’s nuclear arsenal? How many cities would need to vanish before all of humanity pitifully surrendered to a new God?”

""I’m guessing... not many""

""Not many at all,"" He committed, pausing to take a sip of something.

I knew he loved tea from when I met him in a library. This time it was a long swig, and he drank deeply, like he was downing something stronger. I let him have a moment of respite to himself before speaking again.

""Uh, not to pry, but you seem really involved in this. What are you, exactly? A scientist? Who’s ‘we’?""

I’m not great at reading people, but his tone afterwards... I recognized it. It was the same way my dad used to speak to me when times were tough. Late at night, after working long hours, staring at bills he couldn’t pay. He’d look at me when I wandered into the same room as him, and I'd ask him what was wrong.

Nothing, he'd say, like he was tight in the chest, but I could tell he was holding in a sadness. It sounded like he’d been eating it his whole life. 

That’s what the guy reminded me of, anyway. 

""I was a fake,"" he said, as if confessing, ""I worked with real scientists, sure, but only because I knew someone. Ken—he got me in. We’d been in the same PhD program, but I was burning out. He was becoming a professor, and he knew what was happening early on. So, I became part of the privileged few from the start, with his invitation. At first, it was just a handful of academics, a few government types, trying to understand what this thing was. Eventually, when we ran out of people and things got worse, we started bringing in others.""

He paused.

""They were all braver than I was. Most of them didn’t make it. The ones that did might as well not have. That thing made sure of it. I can’t point you to any gravestones... nothing I say has any physical proof.""

I couldn't help my curiosity, and couldn't leave him any longer to ruminate. I spoke to him-

“You seem... surprisingly sharp for someone who’s lost it. And well-read. I don’t think you’re making this up, the same way I don’t believe two perfectly identical craters just appear in town and no one has an explanation. So, yeah—I believe you. But I want the whole story. What was it really like, living under this thing?”

He shrugged.

“The worst parts? Well it's that life kept going. Work didn’t stop. It didn’t want to wipe us out—that would’ve been too easy. It was more like burning an anthill and watching the chaos. It forced society to keep moving, a sick parody of what it was before.

""A lot of people ended up in hard labor. I spent a year mining rocks. Twelve hours a day, hauling stones that meant nothing, while people dropped dead from exhaustion. We called them the lucky ones. At the end of the week, we’d drag these useless piles to the beach and throw them into the ocean. Then we’d start all over again.

""Buses still ran on time, better than before. Miss a stop by a minute, though, and the driver got flayed alive. Corporate meetings kept happening. It killed the loser of the World Cup final. Then sometimes, it killed the winner instead.""

I objected.

“How could it control so many people? You said yourself it had limits to how many it could control at once""

He sighed.

“That must have been its favorite part. It had… followers. Those who, in absolute fear of what the alien could do them, worshipped it and offered themselves to it. It would rewrite their already willing brains, and . They had a uniform, bright pink, and they received what it called its commandments. Each day there would be new orders- new arbitrations we would have to follow. And its followers enforced them. Their reward was freedom from the pain, the fear of the hell around them.

""Not that selling your soul to that thing was a small price to pay. The disciples, as they called themselves, had long lost their humanity. Spiritually, they were mutilated, the alien made sure to take whatever we considered “good” in people and remove it, as if to prove a human was something like a toy, and that the inherent virtue we grew to value as a species was actually just a part of a machine that could easily be removed. ""

I could feel his intensity increase, even over the phone.

""I remember one time when I was close, it did something like that to my friend. There it stood, smiling in a mockery of our facial expressions.""

The moment passed, and his dialogue continued-

“Anyway, the bastards, the disciples, would kill, torture, whatever. I think when it rewired them, it removed whatever part of the brain controls empathy and replaced it with this sick enjoyment of seeing others in pain. Just seeing that bright pink was enough to put people into a panic.

""Natural disasters would wipe out whole towns, and the disciples forced its inhabitants to live in the ashes of what remained until exposure slowly killed them. Kids starved, watching commercials for soft drinks and candy, dying of malnutrition. It didn’t care if it made sense. The point was to make us feel helpless, mock our very society and humanity. To remind us that, even when we weren’t victims of its power, we were victims of our own failings. It wanted us to be ashamed of what we’d built—of who we were. Because, to it? We were nothing but cavemen. Less than that. We were cavemen staring up at a god.”

“You don’t need to tell me… but what happened to your friend?” I asked.

“It was Ken,"" he spoke with some effort, ""My friend, my mentor. The one who got me into this whole mess.”

I noticed his voice cracked for the first time.

""The alien… it didn’t just end him. That would’ve been a mercy.

""We used to meet in this diner, every Wednesday. Same booth, same greasy food. Ken always liked routine. He’d sit there with his notes, coffee in hand, planning everything. One day, I was late. I walked in, saw him sitting in our spot, and he smiled at me—just like any other Wednesday.""

His voice grew quieter, as if speaking any louder would make the memory too real.

""But the moment I sat down, everything changed. Ken… he was flung out of his seat. Like he was a rag doll pulled by an invisible noose. The entire diner went still, like time had stopped, and there he was, suspended in the air by nothing—just hanging there, helpless. His legs kicked, but he couldn’t move. The look in his eyes, him gasping for air, rapidly looking around… I’ll never forget it. When he was re-written.

“Ken was brilliant. Maybe the smartest of all of us. And that’s why it chose him. It knew he was the leader of our group, knew how much we depended on him. So it... chose him to be an example.

""He was different afterwards. It used him as a… puppet. For months. It used him to betray us in ways that weren’t even necessary—he’d leak locations of our members, sabotage our equipment, lead Every time we thought he was finally dead, he’d come back, doing things we couldn’t bear to watch. And it made him aware of every second of it. Imagine… being trapped inside your own body, watching yourself destroy everything and everyone you care about, helpless to stop it. That was Ken’s fate; it started using his mind against him”

He went silent for a long time, and I had no idea what to say. I knew he needed a break.

When I finally told him I had to up to leave, I awkwardly thanked him for his time. I told him I cared about him, and told him to stay safe. It was probably a weird thing to say, but he didn't appear to mind. Instead it seemed like that small bit of acknowledgment was something he hadn’t felt in a long time.",2,1733286764.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1h67oys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1h67oys/aita_for_dating_a_coworker_that_was_previously/,AITA For Dating a Coworker That Was Previously Talking to Another Coworker of Ours?,"I (28f) started at my job back in September and was immediately attracted to my now boyfriend Collin *(fake names for everyone involved)* (25m), but quickly realized he was more or less talking to another coworker of ours Jenny (25f). We work in a bullpen style office, open with short cubicles so you can pretty much see and hear everything that goes on with everyone, but it is technically two suites with our copy room connecting the two. Collin is in one suite, myself and Jenny are in the other and our cubes are kitty-corner from one another, so I was pretty much front and center for their multiple flirty conversations a day when Collin would come talk to her at her desk--there are also several women in their 50s/60s who ATE it up, thought they were adorable and really fed into it all with one woman Chrissy (65f) who really cares for Jenny and was leading the pack for them to be together.

Around my second week there I had to sit with Collin to learn about his department (we all work in different departments, none of us share a direct supervisor, none of us share the same clients) and we just naturally clicked very easily. Very similar sense of humor and we just were able to riff off one another and keep a conversation going for a long time very easily--which at the time I interpreted as a coworker attempting a friendship which I was thrilled about after a very big transition into this job. Around the same time give or take a week, some of the younger people in the office went out for drinks where both Collin and Jenny came and I even talked to him about asking her on a date and was encouraging him genuinely thinking that there was a friendship between us and trying to give what I felt was good advice. After a 30 minute conversation about where he should ask to take her to, come Monday I find out he never asked her. More important context, they never hung out outside of work (with the exception of the group happy hour that myself and another coworker put together), never went on a date, and never did anything remotely physical.

As time went on we started talking more and more when he was at Jennys desk or if I was in the other suite, and eventually we started walking out together at the end of the day and would carry on the conversation for a little in the parking lot. He stopped frequenting her desk as much and their conversations really dwindled as ours increased, it didn't seem drastic or abrupt in my mind it felt like the natural progression of losing interest in one person and gaining it in another. The complete end to their little flirtationship was when Collin wouldn't walk to get coffee with Jenny and she told our older coworkers about it who then confronted him about the mistake he had made and how he needed to apologize, he found the whole thing immature left a bad taste in his mouth and it confirmed he wasn't interested. We started talking and hanging out about a month ago and have only been dating for like two weeks--it's obviously all very new but it has caused an insane amount of bullshit within that time.

Chrissy has never been a huge fan of me, she's made several pointed comments to me and will blatantly ignore me when I'm in the same space as her, around the time Collin and I first started talking more in the office she reported me to HR for wearing yoga pants (its a very casual office, leggings and sweatpants is very much the norm) which I took more or less as a warning from her. In the weeks since, both Chrissy and Jenny have very much followed through with that warning and have by name attempted to embarrass me about my clothes in an office wide email sent by the two of them, reported Collin and me to HR for our ""personal relationship"" (which while true, was purely speculative on their part as we don't make a show of anything at the office--we talk less then we did before we started dating and a lot less then Collin and Jenny did at work because I'm trying to be mindful and respectful of the situation). Today, he went to our side of the office to make coffee and stoped to talk to me at my desk for approximately two minutes before Chrissy very loudly told him to get his coffee and go.

So all of this context and I'm torn if I am ultimately the asshole, I would like to think of myself as a girls girl and in my head I can justify things because they weren't dating or frankly in the realm of dating, I was even supportive about their situation which clearly neither of them felt strongly enough to move the needle on or act on in any real way, I was never friends with Jenny and feel like I shouldn't owe this person loyalty because we happen to be employed at the same place and frankly the lengths she and Chrissy are willing to go to are impacting my work life in a profoundly negative way. BUT I can empathize with how shitty that has to feel not only having that end but then having to see that person talking to someone new every day, like thats obviously impacting her work life in a negative way (though no one is reporting her to HR and threatening her job security but I digress) and I also understand that maybe the optics of me being supportive of them and then dating him ARENT GREAT and probably seem like I was fake and manipulating the situation from the beginning. I've been so back and forth about this for weeks, I'm angry and I'm drained and I realize there is no win-win resolution here, but in order for me to attempt any kind of resolution I have to know Am I The Asshole?",1,1733286428.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

I had a friend pass from pancreatic cancer and basically did only what the docs told him to do: eat any kind of calorie you want - so he ate mcdonalds and donuts;(  I  am hopeful I can encourage her to include some of these options below as I fell I failed with him.

1h67m73,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h67m73/aitah_for_dating_a_coworker_that_was_previously/,AITAH For Dating a Coworker That Was Previously Talking To Another Coworker of Ours?,"I (28f) started at my job back in September and was immediately attracted to my now boyfriend Collin *(fake names for everyone involved)* (25m), but quickly realized he was more or less talking to another coworker of ours Jenny (25f). We work in a bullpen style office, open with short cubicles so you can pretty much see and hear everything that goes on with everyone, but it is technically two suites with our copy room connecting the two. Collin is in one suite, myself and Jenny are in the other and our cubes are kitty-corner from one another, so I was pretty much front and center for their multiple flirty conversations a day when Collin would come talk to her at her desk--there are also several women in their 50s/60s who ATE it up, thought they were adorable and really fed into it all with one woman Chrissy (65f) who really cares for Jenny and was leading the pack for them to be together.

Around my second week there I had to sit with Collin to learn about his department (we all work in different departments, none of us share a direct supervisor, none of us share the same clients) and we just naturally clicked very easily. Very similar sense of humor and we just were able to riff off one another and keep a conversation going for a long time very easily--which at the time I interpreted as a coworker attempting a friendship which I was thrilled about after a very big transition into this job. Around the same time give or take a week, some of the younger people in the office went out for drinks where both Collin and Jenny came and I even talked to him about asking her on a date and was encouraging him genuinely thinking that there was a friendship between us and trying to give what I felt was good advice. After a 30 minute conversation about where he should ask to take her to, come Monday I find out he never asked her. More important context, they never hung out outside of work (with the exception of the group happy hour that myself and another coworker put together), never went on a date, and never did anything remotely physical.

As time went on we started talking more and more when he was at Jennys desk or if I was in the other suite, and eventually we started walking out together at the end of the day and would carry on the conversation for a little in the parking lot. He stopped frequenting her desk as much and their conversations really dwindled as ours increased, it didn't seem drastic or abrupt in my mind it felt like the natural progression of losing interest in one person and gaining it in another.  The complete end to their little flirtationship was when Collin wouldn't walk to get coffee with Jenny and she told our older coworkers about it who then confronted him about the mistake he had made and how he needed to apologize, he found the whole thing immature left a bad taste in his mouth and it confirmed he wasn't interested. We started talking and hanging out about a month ago and have only been dating for like two weeks--it's obviously all very new but it has caused an insane amount of bullshit within that time.

Chrissy has never been a huge fan of me, she's made several pointed comments to me and will blatantly ignore me when I'm in the same space as her, around the time Collin and I first started talking more in the office she reported me to HR for wearing yoga pants (its a very casual office, leggings and sweatpants is very much the norm) which I took more or less as a warning from her. In the weeks since, both Chrissy and Jenny have very much followed through with that warning and have by name attempted to embarrass me about my clothes in an office wide email sent by the two of them, reported Collin and me to HR for our ""personal relationship"" (which while true, was purely speculative on their part as we don't make a show of anything at the office--we talk less then we did before we started dating and a lot less then Collin and Jenny did at work because I'm trying to be mindful and respectful of the situation). Today, he went to our side of the office to make coffee and stoped to talk to me at my desk for approximately two minutes before Chrissy very loudly told him to get his coffee and go.

So all of this context and I'm torn if I am ultimately the asshole, I would like to think of myself as a girls girl and in my head I can justify things because they weren't dating or frankly in the realm of dating, I was even supportive about their situation which clearly neither of them felt strongly enough to move the needle on or act on in any real way, I was never friends with Jenny and feel like I shouldn't owe this person loyalty because we happen to be employed at the same place  and frankly the lengths she and Chrissy are willing to go to are impacting my work life in a profoundly negative way. BUT I can empathize with how shitty that has to feel not only having that end but then having to see that person talking to someone new every day, like thats obviously impacting her work life in a negative way (though no one is reporting her to HR and threatening her job security but I digress) and I also understand that maybe the optics of me being supportive of them and then dating him ARENT GREAT and probably seem like I was fake and manipulating the situation from the beginning. I've been so back and forth about this for weeks, I'm angry and I'm drained and I realize there is no win-win resolution here, but in order for me to attempt any kind of resolution I have to know Am I The Asshole?",1,1733286169.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Over the weekend, I (34) realized how touch-deprived I am. One of my love languages is physical touch. I had a rough year or so with a health issue. It's all good now, but it feels like I've lost another big chunk of time (I don't need to go into details about 2020-2021). I've been single for most of my life. Since 2017, I've had a handful of one-off hookups here and there, a few multi-week stints but nothing substantial. My only 1.5-year relationship was incredibly toxic (don't worry, I've learned). I've done the work, but my therapist says dating involves timing and a little luck.

You'd think dating would be easier in major metro area, but it's not. There's so much to do, no one wants to commit to a coffee date for fear of missing out on something better. I know I shouldn't complain—the rural areas have it way more rough. I don't know what to do. The dating apps get worse every year. This year, I haven't been on a third date or kissed someone I had wished to see long-term. I always make the first move, I don't mind that. I used to bartend, so talking to strangers irl isn't an issue. I'm told people are drawn to me in everyday life, just not emotionally available single wlw. I'm pretty sure people think I'd be good to date. Everyone wants to set me up with someone if only they had someone. The thought is sweet albeit disheartening. It's really feeling like I'm the problem.

I've tried self-soothing...I have a weighted blanket and lots of pillows. I self-touch, take baths (I try, I don't last long), volunteer at an animal shelter. Nothing helps. I want someone to kiss my nape, caress my cheek, hold me close, and stroke my hair...It's not the same, doing it to yourself. I keep thinking about my last hookup to try to feel something outside of myself. Does that make sense? Despite not speaking each other's language fluently (we had a threesome with Google Translate), we mutually agreed after our night that the comfort level we shared transcended words. It just felt so good. So it's either remembering that sexy night or find solace in AO3 smut. I don't know what else to do...anyone else have other methods?
