***Secure sourcing of critical minerals is critical to the defense industrial base, which uses them to produce virtually every Defense Department system, from unmanned aerial systems and fighter jets to submarines, said Adam Burstein.***

[A B-52H Stratofortress bomber from Barksdale Air Force Base, La., sits on the runway at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of a U.S. Strategic Command bomber task force, April 17, 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/vwcn9v65dkce1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cae0c9a0095b9aa2b695ab6c14e61d5f4ae7432)

Burstein, technical director for strategic and critical materials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, spoke today at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.   

""Recent disruptions \[due to\] adversarial actions have underscored what we have long recognized, that it is more urgent than ever to build capability and resilience in supply chains for critical minerals,"" he said. 

To do so, DOD must address challenges. Besides adversarial disruptions of critical minerals, there are other problems related to critical minerals like insufficient labor and training in the U.S. to meet defense production demand, and inadequate U.S. and allied sourcing for key materials and production, Burstein said. 

# An example of disruption vulnerabilities, he said, has been China's attempts to impose export bans on key materials such as gallium, germanium and antimony.

# ""[This has] demonstrated China's willingness to cause such a disruption to critical U.S. supply chains and highlights the urgency of securing our supply chains against such tactics,"" he said.

# Industrial-based policies focus on increased domestic mining and processing and align with broader DOD objectives to secure critical supply chains, he said.

For example, since 2020 DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic rare earth element supply chains, he said. 

There are 17 elements on the periodic table referred to as rare earth. DOD needs nearly all of them in some capacity, he noted.

To address this critical need, the department has embarked on a five-year rare earth investment strategy to build domestic capacity. There is only one rare earth mine currently active in the United States, he noted.  

Partnering with allies is also key to success, he said. Earlier this year, Congress added the United Kingdom and Australia as domestic sources, in addition to Canada, for purposes of the Defense Production Act.

""This means we can now make direct investments in our closest partners and reflects the enduring commitment of the U.S. government to partner with key allies over the long term,"" Burstein said.  

For instance, last year, the U.S. issued multiple DPA awards to projects based in Canada, which also received joint funding from the Canadian government. These projects are targeted to increase the secure supply of key materials, including cobalt, graphite and tungsten, he said.

https://preview.redd.it/ak2z06tfdkce1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=7933d51ca7b74dcd89715e6e03fa8cd6784d4fed

""By partnering with our close allies, we can capitalize on opportunities to leverage each other's strengths to mutually reinforce our domestic and allied defense industrial bases,"" he said. 

This includes 19 security supply cooperation arrangements that the U.S. has with partner nations, which allow DOD to request priority delivery for DOD contracts, subcontracts, and allow the signatory nations to request the same of the United States, he said. 

""These agreements further demonstrate DOD is committed to strengthening and expanding existing alliances and forging new partnerships that increase capabilities and strengthen defense industrial bases,"" he said. 

Stockpiling of critical minerals is another DOD strategy that reduces risk from unanticipated demand spikes or supply chain disruptions, essentially acting as shock absorbers, Burstein said.



# JAN. 11th 2025~ Kratos Signs $1.5 Billion Deal for DoD Low-Cost Hypersonic Testbed

[Kratos Signs $1.5 Billion Deal for DoD Low-Cost Hypersonic Testbed - The Aviationist](https://theaviationist.com/2025/01/11/kratos-mach-tb-dod-low-cost-hypersonic-testbed/)

[Artist’s rendering of Kratos’ Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle. \(Image credit: Kratos\)](https://preview.redd.it/ugu4n0h0ekce1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=86583c51a04ba92df342cffe7dddaf5a18a436e5)

# American Defense firm Kratos has signed a $1.5 billion contract, its largest ever, with the Department of Defense for a low-cost hypersonic testbed and related services, including subscale, full-scale and air launch services.

The American technology and defense company Kratos signed a contract with the Department of Defense on Jan. 06, 2025, for “systems engineering, integration, and testing, to include integrated subscale, full-scale, and air launch services to address the need to affordably increase hypersonic flight test cadence”. The contract, worth [a maximum of $1.45 billion](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-145b-mach-tb-20-contract-award) over a 5-year period, if all options are exercised, falls under Task Area 1 of the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) 2.0 program.

# MACH-TB

First initiated by the U.S. Navy in 2022, the MACH-TB program is now in its second phase, after the MACH-TB 1.0 resulted in over 25 flight tests and the creation a hypersonic boost glide testbed. The 2.0 phase will see that technology transition from design and concept demonstration to full-flight test capacity.

The program is meant to support the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0 by creating an affordable flight test bed to rapidly increase [hypersonic flight test](https://theaviationist.com/2024/03/29/check-out-this-cool-video-of-the-first-ever-ta-1-hypersonic-test-flight-launch/) capacity. The objective of MACH-TB 2.0 is to provide an affordable bridge between hypersonic ground tests and system level flight tests and reduce overall hypersonic development risks and time.

The team led by Kratos includes several other defense companies, including Leidos and Rocket Lab. The company’s CEO Eric DeMarco remarked that “Kratos is honored to receive the largest contract award in our company’s history, a testament of the value Kratos’ employees and team bring both to our Company and United States National Security.”

In December 2024, Kratos also announced it was awarded a $6.5 million contract by the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://theaviationist.com/2023/02/07/darpa-final-hawc-concept-test/) (DARPA) to provide flight testing for hypersonic research supporting future weapon systems. The company said it will leverage flight proven, affordable hypersonic test beds and sounding rocket-based launch vehicles to fulfill various flight experiment requirements and validate modeling and simulation tools rapidly and affordably for future hypersonic flight testing.

U.S. officials argued in the past that the limited test infrastructure hindered the [development of hypersonic systems](https://theaviationist.com/2024/12/13/lrhw-second-test/) and the nation was falling behind China and Russia which already fielded hypersonic weapons. Flying low-cost testbeds like the one that Kratos is going to produce under the MACH-TB contract are key assets for testing at hypersonic speeds above Mach 5.

# Kratos Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle

Kratos revealed last year a successful flight of its Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle for a Missile Defense Agency experiment. The vehicle flew for the first time in June 2024 and the company confirmed it went [over Mach 5](https://theaviationist.com/2022/05/17/agm-183-arrw-successful-test/), which is considered the boundary of the hypersonic speeds range.

Kratos says it developed Erinyes in three years for under $15 million, with a mix of both internal investment and congressional funding. According to company officials, the system was developed in response to the DoD’s concerns about the hypersonic test infrastructure.

""With the recent successes of our low-cost Erinyes Hypersonic Flyer and Zeus Solid Rocket Motors, Kratos is a leader in the testing and fielding of hypersonic systems,” said Dave Carter, President of Kratos Defense and Rocket Support Services Division. “We are very excited to bring this unmatched expertise to the MACH-TB 2.0 program.”

Carter also highlighted the Erinyes’ [affordability](https://theaviationist.com/2024/11/02/an-in-depth-look-at-the-ngad-review/), as the vehicle without its rocket motor only costs around $5 million. He also added, well before the award of the new MACH-TB 2.0 contract, that he expects Erinyes to play a key role in the program moving forward, potentially flying experiments already in 2025 or 2026.

A spokesperson confirmed to [*Breaking Defense*](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/kratos-wins-firms-largest-ever-1-5-billion-award-for-dod-hypersonic-testbed/) that Erinyes is just “one of the hypersonic frontends” planned to fly under the MACH-TB program and “\[t\]here will be others as well.” Erinyes, meanwhile, is planned to fly for the second time this year.

Among Kratos’ current development programs there is the Zeus rocket motor, designed to provide greater thrust and range at a lower cost. Similarly to Erinyes, the company sees the system as a response to a need for affordable launch vehicle propulsion and it will eventually be a propulsion option for Erinyes.

# Kratos Defense

Founded only in 1994, Kratos has rapidly made a name for itself in the defense world. The San Diego-based company is behind the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System (LaWS) tested from 2014 on the [USS Ponce](https://news.usni.org/2014/12/10/u-s-navy-allowed-use-persian-gulf-laser-defense) (AFSB(I)-15, formerly LPD-15) amphibious vessel. The AN/SEQ-3, whose operating power is unknown but estimated to be in the range of 15-50 kiloWatt (kW), was used by the USS Ponce and, after 2017, by its replacement [USS Portland](https://news.usni.org/2018/01/10/lpd-portland-selected-host-onr-laser-weapon-demonstrator-serve-rimpac-2018-flagship) (LPD-27) to engage drones, small aircraft and high-speed boats.

After buying the Detroit-based small turbojet manufacturer Technical Directions Inc. (TDI) on Feb. 24, 2020, Kratos provides the TDI-J85 for the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) [Gray Wolf](https://theaviationist.com/2024/07/15/us-developing-cheap-mass-producible-erams-for-ukraine-heres-why/), a low-cost cruise missile built by Northrop Grumman with a range of over 250 NM (460km) and that can be used in a networked swarm like the AFRL *Golden Horde* initiative.

Kratos also produces the [XQ-58 Valkyrie](https://theaviationist.com/2021/04/06/ever-seen-a-drone-dropping-another-drone-take-a-look-at-the-xq-58-valkyrie-releasing-an-altius-600-uas/) (initially known as XQ-222), an experimental stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) built for the U.S. Air Force’s Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) program. The aircraft first flew on Mar. 05, 2019. Kratos officials have said they can produce 250 to 500 XQ-58 per year at a unit cost of $4 million for 50 airframes a year, or less than $2 million for over 100 planes per year.

The XQ-58 has been shown to be able to [release an Altius-600 small UAS](https://theaviationist.com/2021/04/06/ever-seen-a-drone-dropping-another-drone-take-a-look-at-the-xq-58-valkyrie-releasing-an-altius-600-uas/) (Unmanned Aircraft System) from its internal weapons bay, and it’s being developed for a future use as a SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) platform, and even as a air-to-air UCAV, carrying AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles.

Kratos has been working also on other hypersonic programs, beyond the aforementioned Erinyes and Zeus. These include a range of services for commercial and military customers. The company started out providing its sounding rocket technology to support the MDA’s and the Naval Surface Warfare Center’s work on the [Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System](https://theaviationist.com/2024/12/13/guam-sm-3-first-ballistic-missile-defense-test/). Since then, Kratos supported various hypersonic experiments and is now also on contract with the AFRL for the Mayhem program, expected to develop a hypersonic ISR and strike platform.

Welcome to Edition 7.26 of the Rocket Report! Let's pause and reflect on how far the rocket business has come in the last 10 years. On this date in 2015, SpaceX made the first attempt to land a Falcon 9 booster on a drone ship positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. Not surprisingly, the rocket crash-landed. In less than a year and a half, though, SpaceX successfully landed reusable Falcon 9 boosters onshore and offshore, and now has done it nearly 400 times. That was remarkable enough, but we're in a new era now. Within a few days, we could see SpaceX catch its second Super Heavy booster and Blue Origin land its first New Glenn rocket on an offshore platform. Extraordinary.

As always, we [welcome reader submissions](https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/). If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

**Our annual ranking of the top 10 US launch companies.** You can [easily guess who made the top of the list](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/annual-power-ranking-of-us-launch-companies-finds-a-shake-up-at-the-bottom/): the company that launched Falcon rockets 134 times in 2024 and launched the most powerful and largest rocket ever built on four test flights, each accomplishing more than the last. The combined 138 launches is more than NASA flew the Space Shuttle over three decades. SpaceX will aim to launch even more often in 2025. These missions have far-reaching impacts, supporting Internet coverage for consumers worldwide, launching payloads for NASA and the US military, and testing technology that will take humans back to the Moon and, someday, Mars.

*Are there really 10?* ... It might also be fairly easy to rattle off a few more launch companies that accomplished big things in 2024. There's United Launch Alliance, which finally debuted its long-delayed Vulcan rocket and flew two Atlas V missions and the final Delta IV mission, and Rocket Lab, which launched 16 missions with its small Electron rocket this year. Blue Origin flew its suborbital New Shepard vehicle on three human missions and one cargo-only mission and nearly launched its first orbital-class New Glenn rocket in 2024. That leaves just Firefly Aerospace as the only other US company to reach orbit last year.

**DoD announces lucrative hypersonics deal.** Defense technology firm Kratos has inked a deal worth up to $1.45 billion with the Pentagon to help develop a low-cost testbed for hypersonic technologies, [Breaking Defense reports](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/kratos-wins-firms-largest-ever-1-5-billion-award-for-dod-hypersonic-testbed/). The award is part of the military's Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) 2.0 program. The MACH-TB program, which began as a [US Navy effort](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3591504/department-of-defense-demonstrates-advanced-hypersonic-technologies/), includes multiple ""Task Areas."" For its part, Kratos will be tasked with ""systems engineering, integration, and testing, to include integrated subscale, full-scale, and air launch services to address the need to affordably increase hypersonic flight test cadence,"" according to the company's release.

*Multiple players* ... The team led by Kratos, which specializes in developing airborne drones and military weapons systems, includes several players such as Leidos, Rocket Lab, Stratolaunch, and others. Kratos last year revealed that its Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle [successfully flew](https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/hypersonics/2024/07/03/kratos-erinyes-test-vehicle-logs-hypersonic-speeds-on-first-flight/) for a Missile Defense Agency experiment. Rocket Lab has launched multiple suborbital hypersonic experiments for the military using a modified version of its Electron rocket, and Stratolaunch [reportedly flew a high-speed test vehicle](https://aviationweek.com/defense/missile-defense-weapons/stratolaunch-succeeds-second-talon-launch) and recovered it last month, according to Aviation Week & Space Technology. The Pentagon is interested in developing hypersonic weapons that can evade conventional air and missile defenses. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

# JAN. 9th 2025~Report to Congress on Hypersonic Weapons

[Report to Congress on Hypersonic Weapons - USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2025/01/09/report-to-congress-on-hypersonic-weapons-16)

# The following is the Jan. 2, 2025, Congressional Research Service report, Hypersonic Weapons: Background and Issues for Congress.

# From the report

The United States has actively pursued the development of hypersonic weapons—maneuvering weapons that fly at speeds of at least Mach 5—as a part of its conventional prompt global strike program since the early 2000s. In recent years, the United States has focused such efforts on developing hypersonic glide vehicles, which are launched from a rocket before gliding to a target, and hypersonic cruise missiles, which are powered by high-speed, air-breathing engines during flight. As former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Commander of U.S. Strategic Command General John Hyten has stated, these weapons could enable “responsive, long-range, strike options against distant, defended, and/or time-critical threats \[such as road-mobile missiles\] when other forces are unavailable, denied access, or not preferred.” Critics, on the other hand, contend that hypersonic weapons lack defined mission requirements, contribute little to U.S. military capability, and are unnecessary for deterrence.

Funding for hypersonic weapons has been relatively restrained in the past; however, both the Pentagon and Congress have shown a growing interest in pursuing the development and near-term deployment of hypersonic systems. This is due, in part, to the advances in these technologies in Russia and China, both of which have a number of hypersonic weapons programs and have likely fielded operational hypersonic glide vehicles—potentially armed with nuclear warheads. Most U.S. hypersonic weapons, in contrast to those in Russia and China, are not being designed for use with a nuclear warhead. As a result, U.S. hypersonic weapons will likely require greater accuracy and will be more technically challenging to develop than nuclear-armed Chinese and Russian systems.

The Pentagon’s FY2025 budget request for hypersonic research was $6.9 billion—up from $4.7 billion in the FY2023 request. The Pentagon declined to provide a breakout of funding for hypersonic-related research in FY2024, but requested $11 billion for long-range fires—a category that includes hypersonic weapons. The Missile Defense Agency additionally requested $182.3 million for hypersonic defense in FY2025, down from its $190.6 million request in FY2024 and $225.5 million request in FY2023. At present, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not established any programs of record for hypersonic weapons, suggesting that it may not have approved either mission requirements for the systems or long-term funding plans. Indeed, as former Principal Director for Hypersonics (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering) Mike White has stated, DOD has not yet made a decision to acquire hypersonic weapons and is instead developing prototypes to assist in the evaluation of potential weapon system concepts and mission sets.

As Congress reviews the Pentagon’s plans for U.S. hypersonic weapons programs, it might consider questions about the rationale for hypersonic weapons, their expected costs, and their implications for strategic stability and arms control. Potential questions include the following:

* What mission(s) will hypersonic weapons be used for? Are hypersonic weapons the most cost-effective means of executing these potential missions? How will they be incorporated into joint operational doctrine and concepts?
* Given the lack of defined mission requirements for hypersonic weapons, how should Congress evaluate funding requests for hypersonic weapons programs or the balance of funding requests for hypersonic weapons programs, enabling technologies, and supporting test infrastructure? Is an acceleration of research on hypersonic weapons, enabling technologies, or hypersonic missile defense options both necessary and technologically feasible?
* How, if at all, will the fielding of hypersonic weapons affect strategic stability?
* Is there a need for risk-mitigation measures, such as expanding New START, negotiating new multilateral arms control agreements, or undertaking transparency and confidence-building activities?

# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel

***""Vacuum-grade niobium’s*** [***role***](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/) ***in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures*** [***over 2,400 degrees Celsius,***](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/) ***renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium’s pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a*** [***high strength-to-weight ratio***](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/)***, which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like*** [***SpaceX and Hermeus***](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/) ***depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.***

***For decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic*** [***Gemini and Apollo***](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474) ***programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since*** [***1959***](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf)***. This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated*** [***8,800 metric tons***](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/) ***imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from*** [***Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)***](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/)***. This heavy reliance on just two primary sources—both neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere—exposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China’s dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.""***



***\~""China’s influence over Brazil’s niobium production conforms to a*** [***pattern***](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/) ***of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the*** [***second most critical of 50 minerals***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072)***, falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth"".\~***

# ~Diversification of Niobium Sources

# Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue. The [Elk Creek project](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states) in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act [calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/), and “encourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.” ......~

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies""***

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

It’s the sneaky little gremlin that can sit on your shoulder while you’re trying to build a business, isn’t it? And let me tell you, as an entrepreneur, it’s like discovering that your coffee machine is broken right before a major presentation—utterly devastating. One minute you’re riding high on the wave of creativity and ambition, convinced you're destined for greatness, and the next you’re questioning every decision you’ve ever made, wondering if you should have just stuck with a “normal” nine-to-five job. 

I’ve been there—knee-deep in spreadsheets, staring at the blinking cursor like it’s about to spill the secrets of the universe, and instead, it just stares back, taunting. But here’s the thing: when that doubt rears its ugly little head, I’ve found that anchoring myself in faith changes the game entirely. It’s like having an invisible life vest in a sea of uncertainty.

Picture this: When I start to feel overwhelmed by the “what-ifs”—the “What if I fail? What if I can’t pay my rent? What if my cat secretly judges my life choices?”—I step back and remind myself of what I believe. It's those scriptures that remind me that I am fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14) and that God’s got a plan even when my planner looks like a chaotic series of coffee spills and crossed-out ideas. And let’s be honest—my planner could use a serious upgrade.

Faith, for me, isn’t just a comforting thought; it’s an action. It’s about consciously choosing to believe that I’m not venturing into the unknown alone. I lean into my community, those amazing people around me who remind me of my potential—sometimes with a little light-hearted ribbing. I mean, who wouldn’t want a friend to call you out on your overthinking while also sending you memes to lighten the mood?

There’s something so powerful about gathering with others who share similar struggles. I’m reminded of Ecclesiastes 4:9-10—it’s not just about me. “Two are better than one,” and let me tell you, nothing beats the energy of a brainstorming session where you can shoot down each other’s wild ideas or celebrate those small victories that feel like monumental achievements. 

In the moments when self-doubt tries to sweep me off my feet, I lean into that anchor of faith. I remind myself that God works through my weaknesses and, honestly, my numerous, and I mean NUMEROUS, blunders to show His glory. It’s about embracing that journey, those ups and downs, and trusting that every twist and turn is shaping me into who I’m supposed to be. 

So next time self-doubt pulls up a chair and starts chatting, remember—you’ve got the ultimate support team backing you. Pray, reach out to your community, and lean into that faith. Because who knows? The next brilliant idea or opportunity could be just around the corner, waiting for you to say “yes” rather than letting doubt clench your heart. Trust me, if I can take a leap, so can you. And if I fall, well, I promise to share a good laugh about it later. After all, we’re all in this together.",1,1736690471.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling to manage everything and have booked the funeral and got the ball rolling on sorting out his estate. I don't live nearby so logistically it has been hard to do things but have managed most of it through phone calls and online.

I have two aunts who live nearby my dad's old house (Aunt1 and Aunt2). They weren’t close to my dad and didn't talk to him while he was alive.

Aunt1 and I have had a very warm relationship, but Aunt2 is someone I don't know very well. We haven't kept in touch and I wasn't invited to her family's events. After my dad passed, Aunt2 insisted I come to my dads house place to pick up some financial documents and other items. Most of the work has been done online, so I felt this was unnecessary, but I agreed since no one else was handling it and it might speed things up.

I made plans to pick up the stuff and meet them both for coffee afterward. They had previously told me they wouldn't be going into the house and I didn't expect help from them - but let them know that I would appreciate a coffee in a nice warm coffee house and have a nice chat.

Yesterday, I drove 4 hours to get there, but I was way later than planned. It was an incredibly emotional day going through my dad’s things, and by the time I called them, they said it was too late because Aunt2 had pottery class. I was upset because I rarely visit that area, but to be fair, I hadn’t communicated well and left them in the lurch a bit.

The next day, Aunt2 texted me again, and her tone felt demanding. I was already emotionally spent, so I sent this message:

Her response:

>

Then Aunt1 chimed in with this:

>

I get that I didn’t handle things perfectly, but I feel like Aunt2’s attitude was too pushy, especially since we aren’t close. I’m exhausted, grieving, and barely keeping up with everything. On the other hand I haven't communicated very well and probably have done more stuff on my own than I needed to - I do feel a bit frustrated - it's like people keep saying they will help but haven't actually help.",1,1736690456.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I read somewhere about a chocolate loaf, I’ve tried this before but primarily just added chocolate chunks to the sourdough. Not bad but really nothing special.
For this one I added cocoa powder, cafe bustelo and dark chocolate chunks.
With the chocolate chunks it’s great but I tried a bit of just the bread and it just tastes like sour dough….

Here’s my recipe
I make double

750 grams water
200 grams starter
900 grams King Arthur bread flour
100 grams King Arthur wheat flour
20 grams salt
100 grams cocoa powder
50 grams cafe Bustello instant coffee

For this bake I tried extending the covered time to make sure the bread was cooked throughly and keep the outside from burning.

I do 6 minutes lid on at 450 add a bit of water to the Dutch over
open and rescore.
Then I left the lid on another 20 minutes.
Then 15 minutes lid off at 450.

Also added my jalepeno and cheddar loaves here for fun.

It’s been rocky ever since and my anger and resentment towards her have grown in the past year even though I want a good relationship with her again. 

A lot of resentment stems from the fact I feel she should have protected me more during my childhood. 
My father used to have a lot of anger issues and would yell and throw things often. When I was older and got into fights with him he would ignore me for days until I apologised. 
My mother never did anything. She’s always been very submissive and I know she was afraid of him too, but I feel as a mother her love for me should have outweighed her fear of him. She never comforted me or told me what my father was doing was wrong.
I also experienced trauma in my early childhood that I only remembered when I was 20. Looking back I displayed obvious symptoms of trauma when I was a kid and feel she’d have to have noticed it. 

Despite all that, we were close. Then at fifteen our relationship changed. I developed a chronic pain disorder that remained undiagnosed for over a year. During that time my mom thought I was faking and just being lazy. She’d take all my entertainment away as ”encouragement“ for me to go to school. 
When I was finally diagnosed she immediately got me help but never apologised. I was just so relieved to be getting treatment and that I was being believed that I didn’t see how fucked up that was.

My parents also separated when I was fifteen and my father moved out. 
My mom more or less kicked me out/forced me to live with my dad at seventeen (she and her new partner bought a house with no space for me). 

I’ve only started being angry in the past few years. She’s always been so meek that I felt I had to protect her and not the other way around. I went to therapy and have worked through my childhood trauma but now there’s just so much rage inside me.

She is making an effort to keep in contact- calls me, invites me over for coffee, sends me money when it gets tight. But every time I hear her voice I’m instantly annoyed. 
I have forgiven my father oddly enough. After the divorce he worked on his anger issues and we got quite close when I moved in with him. 

I want to forgive my mom as well. I just don’t know how. Therapy isn’t an option at the moment unfortunately. My health insurance won’t cover any more sessions for the time being. 
I don’t know if talking one on one and airing it all out will help, since she’s so conflict avoidant I think she’ll just apologise and agree with me to get it all over with. 
Is there anything else I can do to work towards forgiveness? If I were to talk to her about all this, how can I avoid her just trying to „keep the peace“? 

TL;DR I’m angry that my mom didn’t protect me from my father and neglected signs of trauma and other illness. I want to forgive, but don’t know how.",2,1736690199.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Almost 2 years ago i have run my second half marathon. Average pace was 6:20/km, had no watch, no normal training, so I just went with it. Right now I am on a journey to run a full marathon, have a running program, a watch to track my heart rate. And i found out that I have quiet a heart rate problem. It is better now after 2 months of training, but atm on an average heart rate of 150bpm, my speed is 7:30/km. And I feel so slow. 
I was wondering, I am drinking quiet much coffee, does it have a big impact on my hr?

1hzn0by,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1hzn0by/aita_for_snapping_at_my_coworker_that_brings_an/,AITA For snapping at my coworker that brings an Ouija board to our team meetings? ,"Hey guys. I (M44.5) really need some guidance on this because I’ve become the office pariah because I finally stood up to our office Wiccan, Brenda (F118). 

I work in a pretty standard office job with a team that mostly gets along. We’ve got the usual mix of personalities that you find in an office environment these days. We’ve got some stoners, an overachiever, that person who always makes passive-aggressive comments about the coffee machine, and a boss that makes Michael Scott look like Elon Musk. But recently, one of my coworkers Brenda, has been doing something that I honestly can’t believe is actually happening in 2025.

Brenda has been bringing an Ouija board to every meeting. I’m not kidding. Every single meeting, for the past three weeks, she’s been trying to summon up a full-on “spiritual counsel”  in the middle of our meetings. It started out kind of innocently. She’d just casually bring the board into the room, put it on the table, and then start ""communicating"" with the spirits. At first, I thought it was a joke or maybe just one of those quirky things she was doing for attention. But no, it’s serious. She insists that the spirits can help guide us with business decisions, like how to handle client objections or which font is most ""spiritually aligned"" with our company’s mission. This wouldn’t be as much of a problem if we weren’t now printing out new business cards in Comic Sans. How does the spirit of a 15th century Yak farmer even know what Comic Sans is? 

Anyway. The ouija board was one thing but last week, during a meeting to discuss our product launch, Brenda interrupted a perfectly normal conversation by suddenly starting a séance. She literally stopped the discussion about our marketing strategy, closed her eyes, and said, “I need to connect with the spirits to find out if we should go with the purple or blue branding. The energies are uncertain.”

We all sat there, staring, as she began chanting over the Ouija board. And when I say chanting, I mean it was like she was trying to summon the ghost of a 16th-century wizard who didn’t even know what a PowerPoint was. She closed her eyes, put her hands on the board, and started muttering things like “Show us the way… Guide us with your eternal wisdom…”

I was livid. We were 10 minutes into discussing the most important marketing campaign of the year, and here she was, asking ghosts if they preferred Arial or Times New Roman. It was honestly like being trapped in an office-themed episode of ""Scooby-Doo."" Granted, the aforementioned office stoner does bring a Great Dane into the office as his support animal that he named “Scrappy” after Scrappy-Doo from the 2002 live-action Scooby-Doo adaptation. (I’ve reported him to HR already.)

I had enough. I raised my hand. “Brenda, seriously? We can’t do this right now. I need to know if we’re going with the 15% or 20% discount. I don’t care what Brother Balthazar thinks about fonts!” She paused, looked me dead in the eye, and said, “Brother Balthazar is an ancient spirit who knows the deep mysteries of the universe, and he has wisdom far beyond what you could possibly understand. He even knows how to fix the formatting in your Excel spreadsheet.” 

That was it. I snapped. I stood up and said, “I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than have the spirit of Brother Balthazar tell me how to format an Excel spreadsheet. This is a work meeting, Brenda. I’m tired of taking business advice from 1,000 year old eunuchs!” 

The room went silent. Everyone stared at me, some of them blinking like they didn’t understand what just happened. Brenda, of course, was fuming. She stood up, dramatically knocked over the Ouija board, and shouted, “You are disrupting the cosmic flow of our team’s potential! I was just trying to tap into the higher consciousness, but now I see you are closed off to the universe’s guidance!”

At this point, I was seriously questioning my entire life. The energy in the room was so awkward that I could feel my soul draining away as we just… sat there. My boss, who had been sitting there eating a comically large baguette (he didn’t even butter it) during the whole thing, finally finished his 38 inch snack and said, “Uh… maybe we should wrap up today’s meeting and reconvene later?”

But before anyone could leave, Brenda insisted that we perform a “spiritual cleanse” to restore balance. She handed out sage bundles to everyone and said we needed to “smudge away the negative energy” from the meeting. I didn’t take one and told the team that I would rather light up one of Greg the office stoners joints in front of the spirit of the 1970s conservative that Brenda had summoned than a sage stick. 

Later that day, I got a message from Brenda on Teams saying that I had “disrespected her spiritual journey” and that I needed to “open my mind to the possibilities of the beyond.” She also added that I should “try being more receptive to the guidance of the ancestors” if I want to succeed in life. Now a few of my coworkers are mad at me too. She even attempted to summon my dead Grandma to yell at me. Some coworkers have said I shouldn’t have “disrespected Brenda’s spiritual beliefs,” and others just think I’m “being a buzzkill” because I don’t believe in the power of the Ouija board. My boss suggested I “reconsider my attitude towards alternative methods of team building.”

So Reddit, AITA for telling Brenda to stop using the Ouija board and conducting séances during work meetings? I get that she has her own beliefs, but I honestly don’t think I should be required to let ghosts guide our product development or decide what we should do for the office Christmas party (unless she manages to summon the Holy Spirit). AITA for drawing the line here?

TL;DR: Coworker conducts a séance during meetings using a Ouija board to get ""spiritual guidance"" for work decisions. I snapped and told her I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than take advice from ghosts. Now the team’s mad at me. AITA?",2,1736689638.0,AmITheAngel,1,1.0,False

Sam found one of my videos on TikTok and left a pretty flirty comment, and then slid into my DMs. For the first two weeks the conversation flowed constantly; we would text nonstop and we really had a (what seemed like) a genuine connection and attraction towards one another. So we decided to see each other. I’m in the middle of a separation and was upfront with Sam about that, to which she said that was fine and she didn’t care. 

So I drive to the next state over to visit her, and I was supposed to stay with her for 2 nights. Those of you who are also in WLW relationships will understand that it’s pretty normal for things to move much quicker than in straight relationships, so this wasn’t something I wasn’t used to. Anyway, the morning of the 2nd day she called me out onto the patio and told me that we were “fundamentally different,” and that it was best if I left to go home. So I grabbed my things and left. I didn’t argue with her and I stayed calm. Before I actually started driving, I sent her a text telling her that I really do wish the best for her and that everything works out for her. This was a genuine text and I meant absolutely no malice or sarcasm behind it. She then calls me and proceeds to SCREAM at me about how I need to fix things with my (now) soon to be ex spouse and I don’t understand what she’s going through. Again, all of this was out of the blue and I didn’t argue or scream back. I stayed calm but ultimately hung up on her after she laughed in my face and I told her that we’re adults and I’m not going to be her punching bag.

Fast forward a week, and I reach out to her again. I understand I probably shouldn’t have done this, but I wanted to have a genuine conversation with her where she could just tell me what was going on with her. Anyway, we decide to start talking again. A week later I go BACK up to visit her and everything is great! The sex was amazing, we connected and had amazing conversation and spent the whole time laughing and getting to know each other. She said I make her feel seen and bring a certain softness into her life that she was missing.

So we decide we’re going to make it a weekly thing of seeing each other. But this past week, her texts are shorter and shorter. Conversation doesn’t flow like before and the flirty conversations have all but disappeared entirely. I figure she’s just really stressed and busy and try not to read into it too much. She also has a lot of trauma that she hasn’t worked through, although if you were to ask HER, she’d argue to the contrary. Because of her trauma, her outlook on life is a lot more bleak than mine. Everyone leaves, everyone lies, no one actually stays. And yet she says that she gives a relationship a few months to get better before calling it quits. My relationship/marriage that I’m separated from has lasted 14 years! And she looks at that like a disadvantage, regardless of the fact that it is a testament to how committed I am in relationships. It’s like she snubs her nose at joy! I told her all the fun things I like to do during Christmas, for example, and she just gave me this weird disgust-like look and said, “yeah you can have that. No thanks.” 

So this week again, I go up to see her. She had already said she wasn’t feeling well due to kidney pain so it was just gonna be us hanging out and whatnot. Which is fine. I don’t expect sex from anyone and that wasn’t the reason I was up there anyway. So I get up there, and aside from the peck on the lips she gave me when I came in, she didn’t show any affection towards me at all. Not holding my hand, putting her hand on my leg in the car, nothing. I thought this was weird, but again wrote it off as she just isn’t feeling well. The first night I’m there, we’re in the middle of a deep “getting to know you” conversation when she gets a call from one of her friends and excuses herself. I just stay seated on the couch and quietly wait for her to get off the phone so we can resume our conversation. 3 HOURS LATER and this woman is STILL on the phone with this same person, and what’s worse is she never once told the friend she has company earlier and would need to call her back later. So finally I just went to bed. She was still on the phone and I don’t know what time she got off.

During the night, she wanted to cuddle which I gladly welcomed. But the next morning we were back to being distant. So I just made me some coffee and did my normal routine. Around 10:30a she said she wanted to get out of the house and get a beer. It’s important to note here, that I’ve seen this girl start drinking a beer at 7:30a and that first night I was there, she had gone from about 10 beers throughout the course of the day!

So I get ready to go to the pub and we head down to the car. It has snowed the night prior and there was ice on her windshield that got dumped into her seat when she was trying to get in. I laughed at the situation but she just looks at me and goes, “it wasn’t THAT funny cause now I’m pissed and we aren’t going anywhere.” So I get out of the car and home girl is just leaving me behind not saying a word while walking back up to her apartment. At this point, the vibe is just very off so I ask her if she’d like me to go ahead and head on out. Keep in mind, the plan was for me to stay until the afternoon and by this point it’s only 11:30a. She says yeah, so I grab my stuff and go home. 

So now we’re 2 for 3 of visits that have ended in her pissed off at something and the day is ruined. I have autism and she’s made passive aggressive ableist comments about how “neurodivergent” should only apply if you are severely mentally and physically disabled where it impedes on your ability to function on your own. She also made a comment on the phone with her friend the other night about how a girl she knew was “stupid” because she doesn’t understand social cues. This woman has diagnosed autism. So now we’re 2-0 of negative comments she’s made about neurodivergence when she also knows that i myself have autism.

Her being on the phone that long the other night just felt like a massive FUCK YOU to me; like she didn’t even respect my time or even the fact that we’re were in the middle of something prior. Like I said, she never mentioned to the friend that she had company over. 

She did lose her mother 2 years ago, but I noticed in her apartment she has her mother’s ashes, and right next to them is a wooden spoon. I asked her what the significance of the spoon was, and she said it’s the same spoon her mom would beat her with! Like why would you decided to put THAT next to her urn. That that is what she chose to remember her mom with!

So…am I reading into this too much or is the woman just a straight up jerk? Is there anything I can do to pull her out from the nihilistic view of everything and everyone, or would this also be just a wait of time…,",0,1736689581.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I know coffee is a stimulant drug. I'm extremely sensitive. If I have 1 coffee, particularly after quitting, even at 6-7am, I will be awake for like a day before I can force myself to sleep. If I have 2 in a row I'm like the [Java Guy on MAdTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTjkjtUpAkw).  3 coffees and I'll start feeling bad. Heart palpatations or fluttering occasionally way too much.

But I've never felt its helped me ""focus"" like some people do. Is this genetic? I feel it makes me amped up as a stimulant should and I like the caffeine-high, but rather than ""focus"" on productive stuff it makes me do a bunch of random stuff that is useless. Checking social media apps, messaging, reading, and just doing a bunch of tasks without aim.

I don't want to go back but I'm looking at being more productive this year waking up at 5am, gym, doing work and also trying to spin up side work to sleep around 10-11. So I was thinking should I perhaps use 1 cup as a tool.

Any thoughts?

PS: Even with the 1 earl grey over past few days, I feel more relaxed, calm, and ""chill"" without having coffee since December. I'd expect when I quit 100% all caffeine from today I will feel even better?

Also, I am sleeping better. I don't think I'm depressed but at the same time one of the craziest things about anxiety and depression is I feel like i dont notice it - until I don't have it anymore.",1,1736689450.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

She’s about 5'6"" or 5'7"" with a slim build. If you know who she might be, or if you are her and remember giving a 6'1"" English bloke with fair-to-blonde hair a trim, I’d really love to hear from you. Maybe we could have a chat over coffee?

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Does anyone have some experience with a low-fiber diet regarding gut health?  
It seems to me that I am doing much better regarding my gut health especially constipation when I am choosing low-fiber foods. I can eat vegetables and fruits but when I start to eat more oatmeal or for example buckwheat my constipation instantly becomes worse - like no bowel movements for days actually.

Has anyone here had a similar situation? Or see great results regarding your well-being while keeping a low-fiber diet?

I try to eat pretty healthy, I do not eat gluten, any sugar, no coffee or alcohol, no processed food basically, I am ex vegetarian I eat fish and meat so keeping a low-fiber diet does not make my variety of foods drastically small, it is just something that I noticed. I have a very sensitive gut that reacts very easily so I have to keep a strict diet and very disciplined lifestyle to feel great and have a nicely functioning body. I had severe constipation and gut issues due to my past with ED (and I think being vegetarian made things even worse) . I visited several GI doctors and they all suggested using more fiber, fiber supplements, and everything with fiber which made things even worse for me and made me basically miserable for years and led me to severe ED because I was scared to eat anything as it would lead me to being bloated and constipated until I started to experiment with food myself and saw that actually low fiber is the diet that makes me feel better, which I found very interesting as doctors always pushed fiber for me.

So basically I am wondering if anyone has similar experience? I would really like to learn I am not alone in dealing with this :D",1,1736688804.0,exvegans,1,1.0,False

1hzmoqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/learningfrench/comments/1hzmoqu/exposure_and_repetition_to_learn_french/,exposure and repetition to learn french,"I've been learning French for a few years now in order to communicate with my wife's French family. Duolingo and podcasts like coffee break french, easy french, and little talk in slow french were a helpful start, but I felt like I was missing something. For one, I kept confusing noun genders --  something duolingo doesn't focuses on. And two, a lot of learning material is geared towards oddly specific situational French, i.e., how to order in a restaurant, how to make a reservation, or how to buy some clothes. 

That's great, but that's not what comes up in conversation. I want to be able to talk to someone casually. For that, I use [italki.com](http://italki.com) and can't recommend it enough. It allowed me to get over the fear or messing up, so now I can actually speak, though haltingly at times. 

To fix the other problems I ran into with the apps and the podcasts, I built [encorefrench.com](http://encorefrench.com), which I am actively developing. Me and an AI have parsed French newspapers, podcasts, and conversations to find the core of French. For now, the app is designed for practicing noun genders and reviewing popular phrases. Since it is based on the most common words and phrases in french, i.e., **it is practical.**  No more ""the horse prepares the dinner"" type phrases form duolingo. Because it is limited to the most common, you can quickly rack up **repetitions**. 

Before I started using encorefrench, I would often start a sentence and then get hung up on a noun because I couldn't remember how to make the adjective or article match. Not so much anymore. Also, I've found that much of conversation is built from very common phrases, like ""of course"" or ""no way?"" or ""do you see what I mean?"" These kinds of responses give you the confidence the carry on a conversation and help people look at you like a real french speaker. Try out my app and give me recommendations for ways to improve.

We have never had a great relationship as she has cheated and lied about it at within the first two years. 

She has never been the best at communicating and I have seeked counseling twice through out the relationship, to try and work at us. We have broken up 4 times through out the ten years and seems to me that it is my fault everytime, or atleast she makes it seem that way.

This time, I know it’s my fault. As I said I have tried to communicate and it usually gets flipped on me and creates a bigger fight. So in the past year and a bit  I’ve fallen into a depression, feeling less and less connected. I know I’m not perfect, but I love my children with all my heart, and couldn’t leave with them for fear of not seeing them everyday and financial struggles that will come with the seperation. 

With my depression I started changing choosing drugs and gambling(in hopes of winning some money to help with my future plans). My drug was cocaine, not used often. A total of 6 times over the past 8 months and no more then 1.5 g consumed in a night(bachelor party). My go to was .5 through the other 5 times with nights out with friends usually a golf sim, pool, bowling ect.  I’ve never cheated and have forgiven her for her mistakes.  She caught me with less then .5g on nye. And has labeled me an addict and told me I need to seek help from proffesionals and to provide proof I’m no longer using in order to see the children. 

It’s killing me. I admitted everything, never lied even admitted the amount I used, down played it slightly as I realized how angry she was. The children and ex never physically saw me using, had her suspicions. I haven’t seen the kids since that day, I’m lucky and can face time. I just want to hold them and tell them I’m okay, I’m not sick like they are being told. I am getting counseling haven’t used in since and no plans on to again. Have gone further to stop drinking alcohol and smoke pot. How ever I don’t feel any achievement in doing these things. I have a plan and I’m going to stick to it. I have a doctors appt coming up to further discuss these things and to try and get some proof to prove to my ex family that I’m not an addict. 

I don’t know what I should do to provide proof other then a urine test, and am terrified they aren’t going to care/believe it anyways, which will make my depression worst. 

I’ve started new habits, in bed no later then 10pm up by 5-6 am and make my bed, exercise have tea and walk. I can’t even drink coffee anymore as the caffeine causes me anxiety. I haven’t talked to me ex yet, don’t want to without anything positive To show. 

What should I be doing to speed up the process to see my kids, I don’t rlly want to go a legal route, as I’m scared I may never get to hold them again if they blow it up.

A little bit of context: may friend ako na nasa live in situation with this guy. Lagi silang nagaaway as in, halos bawat araw lagi na lang silang may problema tapos samin nya sinasabi mga problema nila. Ayaw nya lang umalis kasi nakakalibre sya ng rent, pero ang banggit nya samin, palautang lang din yung guy para masupport yung luho nila both.

Yung friend group namin from high school nasa iba’t ibang city na. Kami na lang dalawa nasa parehong city. Umabot sa point na umalis sya at samin nakitira for a while. Pati husband ko nalaman na rin situation nila. And wala naman samin yun kasi we’re here to help.

Bumalik sa kanila and nagkabalikan sila ulit. Pero yung guy ayaw na syang makipagkita samin kasi bine-brainwash daw namin sya against him. Dalawang beses ko pa lang nameet yung guy kasi ayaw nya daw sakin, kasi mahilig daw akong pumarty and isasama ko lang daw jowa nya para magcheat gaya daw ng ginagawa ko sa husband ko.

Nadamay pa relationship ko with my husband, na four years na kaming magkasama. We never had these problems kasi nagtatrust kami sa isa’t isa.

But anyway, nalaman na lang namin one time na pumunta sya sa bahay namin with only a bag of clothes kasi tumakas daw sya, yun pala napagbuhatan sya ng kamay nung guy. 

So sinugod namin dali-dali yung bahay nung gago at pilit kinuha yung rest of her stuff. Nung una ayaw pa ibigay pero sinabi namin na irereport namin sya, pumayag naman.

Pinatira muna ulit namin sa bahay namin yung friend ko, and sabi rin nung friend group mabuti pa bumalik na muna sya sa parents nya (they live outside the city). Nung sinundo sya ng parents nya sa bahay namin, pinag-usapan namin kung irereport ba namin yung guy. Pero si friend ayaw nya, gusto nya lang daw lumayas and magpahinga.

We respected her decision. Yung tatlo namin friends sa group namin, binibisita sya lagi and sila nag-update sakin ano nangyayari sa kanya. Nag-uusap din kami sa phone and sabi nya balak nya bumalik sa city kung saan ako nakatira para magtrabaho ulit.

I offered to help her find a place to stay and siguro dahil paranoid din ako, I crossed the line and worried na paano kung malaman nung ex nya na bumalik sya baka hanapin sya (kasi nakailang balik yung ex dito samin para makipagusap sa kanya). 

Sabi nya wala daw problema kasi sorted na lahat. Akala ko naman sagot ng company nya yung housing and all that. Hindi na ko nanghimasok.

One day nalaman ko na lang, nakasalubong ko siya sa isang coffee shop KASAMA si guy. Syempre natakot ako, I almost made a scene. Tapos pinapakalma nya ako, na hindi daw nya sinabi sakin na nakipagbalikan sya kasi alam nya ganito ako magrereact. Naoffend ako kasi I was just looking out for her. Gusto ko suntukin yung guy kasi parang nakatitig pa sakin na “I won” (pero baka guni guni ko na lang yun kasi naunahan na ko ng galit).

Some days later, my friend and I decided na magkita sa isang coffee shop. And sabi nya sakin wala daw naman akong magagawa kasi desisyon naman daw nya yun. Wag daw akong manghimasok sa buhay nya. Sinabi ko na lang din na kelangan ko muna ng space kasi nag-aalala ako ng malala na inaatake ako ng panic attacks sa kung ano pwede mangyari. Pero if sya walang problema, ano ba magagawa ko?

1hzmdlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hzmdlk/is_there_a_point/,Is there a Point?,"I'm 32M and I have never been on a date in my entire life.

To give you some context, I was brought up by a single mom and growing up we didn't have much money. So instead of going clubbing by borrowing money, I decided to work on my education, and I got my degree and a few post-grad diplomas and started working when I was 21. By the time I was 25, I was able to get to a middle-management position, with a comfortable salary, a decent living situation, a decent vehicle (nothing fancy). I'm good with money, so I managed to save a ton, to the point that whenever someone asked me for a loan, I would just give it to them, as I had enough money in the bank to spare.

At the workplaces, I was generally well liked, and made friends here and there. I'm still in touch with some of the friends I made during my uni days, and meeting women and talking to them was never a problem for me. I like helping people, and I have noticed that people generally would try to help me a lot whenever I get into a fix. Yet, I can't wrap my head around where it has all gone wrong, in terms of dating.

In my mid to late twenties, I went out with my friends here and there. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in large groups, mostly mixed gender groups. There was a time, in my mid-twenties when I used to go to the pubs 2-3 times a week and had a lot of fun with my friends, but I really didn't meet anyone who was interested to go out with me. Sometimes I would go to the beach or to events with my friend groups, and I would be the only guy in the group, rest being all female friends. Across the years, I acquired a lot of female friends, and even now half of my good friends are women. So I never had a problem meeting women, it's just that I would constantly be the ""friend"" and never the ""date"". Often, I would spend hours and hours with these friends, where they just talk about their lives, and I guess because I listen, I became a sounding board for ideas and their confidante. At times it would be one-on-one conversations over a coffee, a pizza or a beer which would last for half-a-day some times, but the moment I try to show my interest for a proper date, they would laugh it off, or politely decline.

At times at the pubs, random girls would come and talk to me 2-3 times. Some would come and say ""you're everything I need"" or shit like that, and I would add them on socials, and we would message for a while. But when I ask them out for a date, they would stop replying.

Usually when I go anywhere I speak to everybody and I have met a lot of women that way, but that would never translate to a date ever.

I would often tell myself, that perhaps no one wanted to go out with me because I'm ugly, but then when I see myself in the mirror, I know its not true. I mean, I'm no Brad Pitt, but I don't look that bad. I'm not the tallest, but I'm not shortest either, around 5'11''. Around the time I was 27, I thought my looks were the problem, so I hit the gym, corrected my diet and was like 65kg, with body fat of around 17%, with visible abs (not washboard abs). Lot of the girls at the time, would come and touch me all over, and give me a thousand compliments, girls came and told me I'm strong, one time, one said that I'm ""strong like a Trojan"", but nothing came of it dating wise.

I would flirt for ages with girls, and speak on the phone for hours and hours, but whenever I popped the question of an actual date, nothing doing. Don't get me wrong, they would be ok to go out with me in my car, or in their car, for a ""chat"" or a ""conversation"", and I have noticed most of these women, often times reply the moment I send them a message, but whenever I bring up the question of an actual date, it would not happen.

I tried dating apps- had a few matches here and there. Girls gave me their numbers, but then would ghost me constantly, before a date.

Eventually, I lost interest, because maintaining a proper diet and exercising constantly, while not achieving anything was hard. I gave it up after a year or so and started falling into bad patterns.

I was brought by a single mom, who was a pacifist. Her philosophy for life was that if someone slaps, you have to stand there and take it and not retaliate. In my late twenties, I thought perhaps a lack of masculinity, and me not knowing what a proper relationship between a man and a woman were the reasons for my lack of success, so I worked really really hard on improving myself in that regard, apart from masculinity I worked on conversation skills, empathy, emotional intelligence, body language, posture and so on. I can stand up for myself now a lot more than I used to, and especially at the workplace I have had no problems standing up for myself, getting back at people who wanted to mess with me and climbing the corporate ladder at a rate of knots. But in the dating sphere, not even a slight improvement.

I've been working on this for years now to no avail. Now, I have managed to develop an eating disorder and pissed off most of my savings on therapy. I have no appetite for food anymore and eat like a meal a day, and keep losing weight. Work is the only place where I can find solace and forget about my problems. But I'm not sure, how long I can go on like this.

None of my friends have this issue. They are all well-settled, so I have to put on a mask in public and pretend like everything is alright, when it isn't.

I look at other couples littered everywhere I go, how do they do it? And at this point really, I'm not sure whether its too late for me. It's going to take months, if not a year at least to get back in shape both physically and mentally. And it's like a catch-22, I'm not going to feel better till I go out with someone, and in my current state, I doubt whether anyone would go out with me, because now I'm a mess and even if someone does go out with me, I have no idea how to build and sustain a relationship, or how to behave and what to say and what not to say. Honestly, I'm out of energy.

The mechanism was locked by some zip tie and clearly the cashier believed it was just a coffee table with Louis XV style feets. I asked to unfold it and it worked perfectly.

1hzmba3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealHookupAdvice/comments/1hzmba3/its_getting_weirder/,It’s getting weirder..,"So I (F24) have been dating this guy (M24) for a little more than a year and we also have been living together for about 7-8 months now. I love the guy but he does things which bothers me to my core. Some things I can ignore but at times it gets difficult to deal with it. The main struggle is he smokes up a lot and gets violently high every single day. Comes home from work, doesn’t even change out of his work clothes, and starts crushing and smoking up. On the week offs, that’s the first thing he does. He would forget brushing his teeth and cut down on food so he can save money to score and smoke up. When we were friends before we became a thing, we used to party together and get high together as well, mostly on the weekends. It wasn’t a regular thing before but within a year it seems like he’s gotten addicted and can’t go a day without it. 
And it’s not just that, he would end up messing and dirtying the house. And he doesn’t help clean.. like AT ALL. It feels like I’ve taken up the wife job and I’m not even his wife, I end up cleaning, taking care of him, washing clothes and what not. I don’t mind doing things for him, but sometimes I get too tired and overwhelmed with cleaning the huge mess he makes almost everyday, and he does nothing to help even if I ask him to. He says he’ll get to it and suddenly it’s night time and he’s sleepy and he dozes off. It ends up being me at the end cleaning it. If he drinks coffee, his mug would be on the table for days in the same spot if I don’t pick it up. He gets so lazy, he wouldn’t get up for ANYTHING. It’s always, “go bring me this-that.” And when I get annoyed with his constant little demands, and speak up, he would taunt me saying things like, “I do so much for you. I care and think so much about you and you can’t do this little things for me.” It takes me around 2-3 hours everyday to clean the house, wash and dry clothes for the both of us, do the dishes etc.. I have no time for myself. 
Sometimes I feel like him smoking up has changed his brain wirings because he would get rude to me sometimes and it would be unnecessary. 
I dont mean to say he’s a bad person. Because he’s been struggling with issues at home, like his dad has cancer and he’s sick so there’s hardly any inflow of money in his house and he has to take care of their finances as well as ours since I’m jobless atm. I’m closer to getting a job, but it’s making me think how things would be at home if I’m working as well and then dealing with this after I’m home with my bf. I don’t want to come home and have the sight of him just getting high. 
We don’t do anything new or exciting. He hardly leaves the house. We haven’t gone out for dinner in soooo long. The last time we had dinner was on my birthday in November. And I don’t want to wait for special occasions to be taken out. And I’m not demanding anything expensive. I sometimes say let’s go out for just a walk, he wouldnt be interested to. 
He also has weird fantasies. Like I’m never enough. He wants us to be involved with other people irrespective of gender. He says I can do it on my terms, but the thing is I don’t want to. At all. Because of the pressure he creates, I end up saying sure, but when it’s time I chicken out because I’m just not comfortable. 
One such instance of this pressure was him making an onlyfans for me and posting my pictures on there. I did say yes initially but I couldn’t keep continuing, it just made me feel gross. And he got mad at me because I chickened out and he said things like, continuing with onlyfans would help us make a lot of money and what not. But I don’t want to do it. He doesn’t understand that. It comes up every now and then and as usual he gets upset when I say no. 
Out of one such pressure, he made me flash in front of someone twice. Each time I was uncomfortable but I ended up doing it because he went on about it and kept begging for 20 minutes. He wouldn’t let it go at all. All after getting super high. And in the process he got undressed as well and sat naked for 10 minutes in front of someone. That poor dude was uncomfortable as well. 
The days go by the same, there’s no change. He comes home from work, gets high, eats dinner, talks to his family, and sleeps. If he’s feeling it, we have sex. And even then he wants something different. He wants me to talk about a past sexual story I had with someone else from when I was single, and he would finish to those stories. It’s just super weird. 
And then after sex, he would say more weird things like how small my boobs are, and how non existent they are, etc. 
What do I do in this situation??? Help!!!

1hzm8eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hzm8eu/i_need_help_making_sense_of_this/,I need help making sense of this,"Hey everyone!

This is going to be really long and a lot of information!!! I apologize!

Just under 3 weeks ago, my ex gave me the silent treatment after I misunderstood something as him being passive aggressive (the silent treatment was something he did often and was definitely the catalyst of our breakup).

I'm definitely still heartbroken, I still love him, he lived together, we have been together for years and I literally thought we would grow old together, I poured so much into the relationship.

When the initial break up conversation happened, I told him ""I don't want to end the relationship, but I can't force you to stay"" and then I asked him if our relationship was ending and he responded ""well it doesn't make sense if we stay together"", CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG, but to me, that means he is agreeing to the end of our relationship. Not once did he tell me he wanted to stay together and work on our issues together, all he really did was bring up a breakdown in our communication and a few other things that he has issues with but never communicated them with me until this conversation.

I did not have the strength to stay in our home, I was very very sad and heartbroken so I went and stayed with my mom (he did not stop me when I was packing my things. He did not tell me that he didn't want to break up). During this time, I was panicking, I didn't want to end the relationship so I was texting him, begging him to try again, begging him not to end things, I was desperate to talk with him again. He would not budge, I asked him if he would just take the week to re-think and for us to talk again, he told me he did not want to talk and apologized that I'm having such a hard time with this. At the time, I was very desperate, so I was begging him to just talk with me again, he finally agreed but told me he needs space and he told me ""dont have hope"", HE LITERALLY TOLD ME NOT TO HAVE HOPE!!!!!! I agreed to give him space.

During the week I was giving him space, I went to see my family in a different city (I had 9 days off for the holidays). The time came for me to go back to where I live, I kept having panic attacks, I kept crying, I didn't want to see him because of my high emotions. So I went to my mom's, I wasn't in a place to talk again and During that whole week, he did not communicate with me so I took that as him not wanting to talk. The next day, I got myself together and I sent him a text asking if we can meet for coffee and talk and explained that this week is going to be really busy because I have class pretty much every evening and work full time. During this time, I was getting ready for a new semester, I went to pay my tuition and get a new laptop. He replied to my text saying he couldn't meet because he was working (he's a teacher at a different university), I asked when works for him. He told me he wanted to talk the other day (HE DIDNT COMMUNICATE THIS WITH ME), so I asked him to tell me if there's a time that works for him because I wasnt in a place to talk then and explained how I had no control over my emotions, I was extremely hurt and sad. We had some back and forth, me wanting to meet and him not wanting to meet. I brought up him avoiding the issue, he explained that he wasn't avoiding anything but he was setting a boundary with me, he did not want to talk. Because of this, I was forced to accept things, I respect people's boundaries and I never ever want to overstep them. He told me to just make a plan about our living situation and let him know and that he was trying to find a new place to live. That's it. So I took a few hours, I sobbed in my car, then after working on calming down, I decided I couldn't handle a move while being a full time student and working a full time job so I told him I will stay on our lease until the lease is up. He agreed and said he would try to be out of the house by January 15th. I stayed with my mom during this time to give him space to pack and begin his move.

I went back to work and started my classes, I was grieving this loss. I cried and cried at night until my head hurt and my shoulders hurt. It effected me physically, I was aching because of how much emotional pain I was in. I would have panic attacks. I began to accept that we were really over, I had therapy, I focused on my job and school and kept myself busy morning to night and slept at my moms house.

Yesterday comes around, I'm being sent out of town for training for my job so I wanted to remind him about a few things that I didn't want him to forget so I sent him a text (he did not speak to me at all during the whole week, he didn't reach out, I got absolutely nothing from him), the text I sent was just a reminder about a table, dressers, some of his things in our storage room in our basement, little things I didn't want him to forget but I didn't have the strength or even access to a truck to haul out. I also shared that I won't be back until January 19th but if he moves out before then, he can leave his keys in the mailbox and my mom would pick them up for me. He replied ""I'll try to be out by the 15th but ok"" I replied ""ok"". I thought that was it and went about my day I was travelling out of town for my training so I decided it would be nice to leave early and stay in a nice hotel for a couple nights and do some shopping and work on a paper.

I wasn't paying attention to my phone for a few hours while I was driving. So when I finally arrived, I noticed he sent me a text saying ""so much for closure, I guess you got everything you needed"", I replied reminding him that I wanted to talk last week and he didn't, he set the boundary with me. He began to twist it into him not wanting to break up by saying he never agreed to breaking up and then tried turning the tables and putting the blame on me for packing and leaving to my moms. He also accused me of talking to other people or trying to find someone new which isn't true at all, I'm smart enough to know rebounding doesn't work especially because I still have so much love for him and I'm completely broken lol. He said he wanted me to come home, he wanted me to tell him how much I love him and make things work. I explained that I was in so much pain thinking he didn't want anything to do with me, he was the one who did not want to meet. I was weak and began to try and make things work, I kept asking him what he wanted to do, I kept telling him I still love him and I still have hope that we can still work on things, I explained that I wanted to grow old with him and never give up. He kept dodging the question anytime I asked him what he wants to do now and kept implying he wanted us to work things out and even told me he still loves me a few times. I tried calling him because I started to feel confused, he wouldn't answer my call. After some back and forth, he made it seem like I was the problem and that I was the one who ended the relationship by leaving, putting the blame on me. He brought up a problem with his kids, about how I'm not a mother to them (he has his kids pretty much once a month, sometimes twice due to them living in a different province). I apologized for this and explained that I thought giving them the space to spend quality time with their dad was the right thing to do, I didn't want his daughter to feel like I was taking him away from her because I have experience watching my own dad building a life with a different woman and I felt abandoned, I didn't want her to feel like I felt. I felt like me spoiling them with gifts and their favourite foods was the correct way of doing things. But it wasn't so I apologized for making him feel like I wasn't truly there or I didn't like his kids (I actually really care about them and love them and I'm grieving losing them too, I'm going to miss hearing them playing and running around our house and shopping for them and the funny little conversations I would have with them).

And that was it. He stopped replying to me. I cried myself to sleep and I feel like I have to restart my grieving. I don't understand why this conversation had to happen, he dangled hope in my face just to throw it away. I feel so confused and sad.",1,1736687084.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1hzm8bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1hzm8bj/its_getting_weirder/,It’s getting weirder..,"So I (F24) have been dating this guy (M24) for a little more than a year and we also have been living together for about 7-8 months now. I love the guy but he does things which bothers me to my core. Some things I can ignore but at times it gets difficult to deal with it. The main struggle is he smokes up a lot and gets violently high every single day. Comes home from work, doesn’t even change out of his work clothes, and starts crushing and smoking up. On the week offs, that’s the first thing he does. He would forget brushing his teeth and cut down on food so he can save money to score and smoke up. When we were friends before we became a thing, we used to party together and get high together as well, mostly on the weekends. It wasn’t a regular thing before but within a year it seems like he’s gotten addicted and can’t go a day without it. 
And it’s not just that, he would end up messing and dirtying the house. And he doesn’t help clean.. like AT ALL. It feels like I’ve taken up the wife job and I’m not even his wife, I end up cleaning, taking care of him, washing clothes and what not. I don’t mind doing things for him, but sometimes I get too tired and overwhelmed with cleaning the huge mess he makes almost everyday, and he does nothing to help even if I ask him to. He says he’ll get to it and suddenly it’s night time and he’s sleepy and he dozes off. It ends up being me at the end cleaning it. If he drinks coffee, his mug would be on the table for days in the same spot if I don’t pick it up. He gets so lazy, he wouldn’t get up for ANYTHING. It’s always, “go bring me this-that.” And when I get annoyed with his constant little demands, and speak up, he would taunt me saying things like, “I do so much for you. I care and think so much about you and you can’t do this little things for me.” It takes me around 2-3 hours everyday to clean the house, wash and dry clothes for the both of us, do the dishes etc.. I have no time for myself. 
Sometimes I feel like him smoking up has changed his brain wirings because he would get rude to me sometimes and it would be unnecessary. 
I dont mean to say he’s a bad person. Because he’s been struggling with issues at home, like his dad has cancer and he’s sick so there’s hardly any inflow of money in his house and he has to take care of their finances as well as ours since I’m jobless atm. I’m closer to getting a job, but it’s making me think how things would be at home if I’m working as well and then dealing with this after I’m home with my bf. I don’t want to come home and have the sight of him just getting high. 
We don’t do anything new or exciting. He hardly leaves the house. We haven’t gone out for dinner in soooo long. The last time we had dinner was on my birthday in November. And I don’t want to wait for special occasions to be taken out. And I’m not demanding anything expensive. I sometimes say let’s go out for just a walk, he wouldnt be interested to. 
He also has weird fantasies. Like I’m never enough. He wants us to be involved with other people irrespective of gender. He says I can do it on my terms, but the thing is I don’t want to. At all. Because of the pressure he creates, I end up saying sure, but when it’s time I chicken out because I’m just not comfortable.

# Children Sing African Songs In Four Dialects at Meet

Mrs. Thomas Larson, Corres.

HAINSEVILLE—IDLEWILD

All who attended the special program at the Hainesville church last Thursday evening were well rewarded when Mr. and Mrs. Axel Gjestland and family, Missionaries from South Africa, took them by means of colored slides on a visual tour of Durban and the surrounding territory in their particular Mission field, clearly explained by Mr. Gjestland. Mrs. Gjestland, who is a third generation Missionary, her father and grandfather having been active workers, demonstrated peculiar native Zulu songs and mannerisms. The three children present, Norman, Irene and Sylvia sang songs in four different languages while Mr. and Mrs. Gjestland and the children sang a number of songs we all enjoyed. A free will offering was taken and presented to the Mission cause.

The Gjestlands, while here, were guests of Mrs. Arne Gjesteland and Mr. and Mrs. Richard Gjesteland and Sharon. It’s seven years since their last visit and they enjoyed visits with many old friends. One of the Gjestland’s sons remained at Durban while two other sons are in the armed services.

Following the much enjoyed program the ladies served coffee and a lunch, so all enjoyed a social time. Thanks everyone.

1hzm684,https://www.reddit.com/r/LagottoRomagnolo/comments/1hzm684/why_wont_my_lr_sleep_later/,Why won't my LR Sleep later?,"We have a 7.5 month old male Lagotto that has slept in a crate every night since we brought him home at 8 weeks old....182 nights to be exact. 

Our challenge is that he wakes up at or before 5:30 AM almost every morning, and we'd like to be able 1) sleep a little later and 2) ask that he remains quietly in his crate until we let him out. When he wakes up, he starts with a light whine and whimper, followed by more intense crying, and then a periodic bark. This morning he cried for over 30 minutes before we finally let him out (waiting for a moment of silence so as to not reinforce the crying.)

His crate is fully covered, and has a Kuranda brand dog bed inside of it, and the crate is not located in our bedroom. Other details:

* He is crate trained; he understands the word ""Crate"" and we do not have to force him into the crate before bed. We regularly play Susan Garrett's Crate Games.
* When we leave the house during the day / evening, we lock the dog is in his crate. And he does not bark or cry when he hears us come home - he just waits until we let him out.
* His wakeup time does not correlate with his bedtime. For example, we often put him in his crate for bed around 9:30-10:00 PM and he will still wake up at 5:15 to 5:30 AM. Last night we put him in his crate at 11:00 PM and he woke up at 5:25 AM today.
* He eats twice a day around 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM. We do not feed him imediately when he wakes up.
* We have tried setting an alarm near his crate, and waiting to let him out of his crate until the alarm goes off with the hope that we can condition him to sleep until the alarm - no luck so far.
* In fact, we often do not do anything with him when he wakes up. As I type this post (6:30 AM), he is currently napping in front of the patio door. He has not gone to the bathroom yet either....it appears that he just wants to get out of his crate to go sleep somewhere else.
* We actively spend time exercising and trying to stimulate his brain. Below was his schedule from yesterday:
   * 5:25 AM - Crying / Barking in Crate
   * 5:45 AM - Alarm Clock goes off, get dog out of crate
   * 5:45 to 6:15 AM - Dog lies around while I make coffee
   * 6:15 AM - Pee and Poop Outside
   * 6:55 to 7:50 AM - Walk \~1.5 miles, dog park, sniffs, 50% of breakfast while walking for training. More breakfast when we get home + save some for puppy class later
   * 8:00 to 12:30 PM - He will nap / lounge around the house while we clean, eat, do weekend chores
   * 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM - Puppy Training Class
   * 2:15 PM to 4:45 PM - Groomer
   * 4:45 PM - Quick walk and Potty
   * 5:45 to 6:00 PM - Dinner via Puzzles
   * 6:00 to 8:30 PM - Nap in Crate while we went out to dinner
   * 8:30 to 9:30 PM - Walk in park, run around on long 35' leash
   * 9:30 PM to 9:45 PM - Bully stick
   * 9:45 PM to 11:00 PM - Lie around while we watch TV, get rubs.
   * 11:00 PM - Lights out, in Crate
   * 5:25 AM - WAKE UP 
* We want him to sleep in a crate overnight so that he is used to it when we need to board him, and because we do not trust him to be out of his crate while unsupervised overnight.

  
Is this just puppy growing pains? In a year are we going to be begging him to wake up because he wants to sleep in until 10:00 AM?",1,1736686875.0,LagottoRomagnolo,2,1.0,False

I don’t mind doing things for him, but sometimes I get too tired and overwhelmed with cleaning the huge mess he makes almost everyday, and he does nothing to help even if I ask him to. He says he’ll get to it and suddenly it’s night time and he’s sleepy and he dozes off. It ends up being me at the end cleaning it. If he drinks coffee, his mug would be on the table for days in the same spot if I don’t pick it up. He gets so lazy, he wouldn’t get up for ANYTHING. It’s always, “go bring me this-that.” And when I get annoyed with his constant little demands, and speak up, he would taunt me saying things like, “I do so much for you. I care and think so much about you and you can’t do this little things for me.” It takes me around 2-3 hours everyday to clean the house, wash and dry clothes for the both of us, do the dishes etc.. I have no time for myself. 
Sometimes I feel like him smoking up has changed his brain wirings because he would get rude to me sometimes and it would be unnecessary. 
I dont mean to say he’s a bad person. Because he’s been struggling with issues at home, like his dad has cancer and he’s sick so there’s hardly any inflow of money in his house and he has to take care of their finances as well as ours since I’m jobless atm. I’m closer to getting a job, but it’s making me think how things would be at home if I’m working as well and then dealing with this after I’m home with my bf. I don’t want to come home and have the sight of him just getting high. 
We don’t do anything new or exciting. He hardly leaves the house. We haven’t gone out for dinner in soooo long. The last time we had dinner was on my birthday in November. And I don’t want to wait for special occasions to be taken out. And I’m not demanding anything expensive. I sometimes say let’s go out for just a walk, he wouldnt be interested to. 
He also has weird fantasies. Like I’m never enough. He wants us to be involved with other people irrespective of gender. He says I can do it on my terms, but the thing is I don’t want to. At all. Because of the pressure he creates, I end up saying sure, but when it’s time I chicken out because I’m just not comfortable. 
One such instance of this pressure was him making an onlyfans for me and posting my pictures on there. I did say yes initially but I couldn’t keep continuing, it just made me feel gross. And he got mad at me because I chickened out and he said things like, continuing with onlyfans would help us make a lot of money and what not. But I don’t want to do it. He doesn’t understand that. It comes up every now and then and as usual he gets upset when I say no. 
Out of one such pressure, he made me flash in front of someone twice. Each time I was uncomfortable but I ended up doing it because he went on about it and kept begging for 20 minutes. He wouldn’t let it go at all. All after getting super high. And in the process he got undressed as well and sat naked for 10 minutes in front of someone. That poor dude was uncomfortable as well. 
The days go by the same, there’s no change. He comes home from work, gets high, eats dinner, talks to his family, and sleeps. If he’s feeling it, we have sex. And even then he wants something different. He wants me to talk about a past sexual story I had with someone else from when I was single, and he would finish to those stories. It’s just super weird. 
And then after sex, he would say more weird things like how small my boobs are, and how non existent they are, etc. 
What do I do in this situation??? Help!!!

1hzm3su,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1hzm3su/how_to_build_an_emergency_fund_step_by_step/,How to build an emergency fund step by step,"Hello everyone,

let me tell you a personal story first, before we dive into the topic of the title.

When I first started working at the age of 17, I blew every single euro I earned. I was fortunate enough that my basic expenses such as food and shelter were covered by my parents (because I still lived at home) and that made saving money very unnecessary.

Eating out, clothes, skateboards, random shit here and there and by the next paycheck my account was empty.

I had a girlfriend at the time and when summer came she said: “Hey, let’s take a trip to the seaside.” Well, I couldn’t. I literally had no money because I was so reckless. Then I started reading a lot about personal finance and the first thing everybody tells you is to build an “emergency fund”.

But what is it? For me an emergency fund is a certain amount of money you save up in case something bad happens, so you still have enough money to live comfortably for 3-6 months.

When you first start earning money, emergency fund is what you should start building from the beginning. Forget crypto, stocks, gold, clothes, cars, … If you have the option, save 6 months worth of your living expenses first, because the future is very uncertain and you never know what might happen.

When you have an emergency fund, life is a lot less stressful and you become a lot more flexible with the things you do and the risks you take.

Soo, how do you build an emergency fund when you can barely get through the month. I’m no expert but I think with consistency and persistency everything is possible.

I wrote this to help you build your emergency fund and become less stressed. We all know how bad having money problems actually is.

Hope you enjoy.

Life has a way of throwing curveballs when we least expect them. Our car breaks down, a medical bill pops up, or someone starts mentioning “layoffs” at work. These moments can feel overwhelming, especially when money is already tight. That’s where an emergency fund comes in. And it’s not about getting rich, it’s about having a safety net so that life’s surprises don’t knock you off your feet. But let’s be real, the idea of saving money when you’re already stretched thin can feel impossible. It’s not. You don’t have to overhaul your entire life overnight. You just need to take it one step at a time.

Start small. The idea of saving three to six months of expenses can feel like climbing a mountain, but don’t let that number paralyze you. Set your first goal at 500**€** or 1,000**€**. That’s enough to cover a lot of the unexpected expenses that tend to pop up. Car repairs, a trip to the doctor, or an emergency flight. Breaking it down into smaller milestones makes it manageable and gives you something to celebrate along the way.

The next step is finding where the money can come from. This doesn’t mean cutting out everything you enjoy, but it’s about being more intentional with where your money goes. Take a look at your expenses. Are there subscriptions you don’t use? Can you swap a few takeout meals for home cooking? Even small adjustments, like brewing your own coffee or canceling an app you barely use, can add up faster than you think. The key is not to deprive yourself but to align your spending with your priorities.

Set up a separate savings account for your emergency fund. This isn’t your regular bank account, and it’s definitely not the one linked to your debit card. You want it to be accessible in an emergency but not so easy to dip into that you’ll raid it for concert tickets or gadgets. Online savings accounts or even a high-yield savings account work well because they’re slightly removed from your day-to-day spending.

Automate it. Once you’ve figured out what you can save, even if it’s just 20**€** a week, set it up to transfer automatically into your emergency fund. This takes the decision-making out of the equation and ensures that you’re consistently building your fund. You’d be surprised how quickly 20**€** here and there adds up when you don’t have to think about it.

Finally, make peace with the fact that it won’t be perfect. There will be months when things come up and you can’t save as much, or you’ll need to dip into your fund before you hit your goal. That’s okay. That’s what the fund is there for. The important thing is to keep going. Every euro you save is a step toward less stress and more control over your life.

Building an emergency fund isn’t about reaching some arbitrary number. It’s about creating breathing room in your life. It’s about knowing that when something goes wrong, and it will, you have a plan. And there’s power in that. You might not be able to control everything life throws at you, but you can control how prepared you are to handle it. Start small, stay consistent, and know that every step you take is a step toward peace of mind. You’ve got this.

I hope this gives you a better understanding of how important having an emergency fund is and how to save for it.

If you have any other questions on this topic, please ask them in the comments and I’ll be happy to help you.

If you don’t wanna read just know that I’m only here to flirt and feel pretty 🤍 sorry, hate to break it to ya but I’m not interested in something too quick, please don’t bother if those are your intentions 

Nothing serious— just looking for someone who can keep up with sharp banter and a desperate attempt to channel alluring chaotic energy. I’m a mix of early 2010s pop culture nostalgia, too much coffee, and a love for timeless style debates (will the Row bags really be worth the hype?). 

Bonus points if you can make me laugh or casually drop a philosophical musing mid-conversation.

Let’s talk about your favorite book, argue over the best Tarantino film, or exchange outrageously exaggerated compliments.

1hzm2c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hzm2c2/its_getting_weirder/,It’s getting weirder..,"So I have been dating this guy for a little more than a year and we also have been living together for about 7-8 months now. I love the guy but he does things which bothers me to my core. Some things I can ignore but at times it gets difficult to deal with it. The main struggle is he smokes up a lot and gets violently high every single day. Comes home from work, doesn’t even change out of his work clothes, and starts crushing and smoking up. On the week offs, that’s the first thing he does. He would forget brushing his teeth and cut down on food so he can save money to score and smoke up. When we were friends before we became a thing, we used to party together and get high together as well, mostly on the weekends. It wasn’t a regular thing before but within a year it seems like he’s gotten addicted and can’t go a day without it. 
And it’s not just that, he would end up messing and dirtying the house. And he doesn’t help clean.. like AT ALL.

(I get nauseous when travelling after eating a meal from a cold, windy area). Until it went downhill back in December


Story:

Alot of people in our class started getting sick at 2nd week of December

I remember it was 2nd week December weeked that i felt lightheaded. 3rd week Monday was when i felt a fever developing. That day i was passing so much gas. And then i had a fever for 2 days. 

After recovering from the fever, whenever i eat something, I feel like acid is climbing my throat. So i decided to not eat but when i didnt eat, I get the same result. Its been like this until New years. 

I also noticed that i get motion sickness easier and it triggers my acid reflux (even the though of a long trip triggers it). I still cant eat as much as i used to. Well i can but it takes tons more effort to not puke.

A month after my fever (January 12, 2025), I can eat normal amounts but I can only do it without distractions. And i feel like have a very weak stomach (takes so long to digest). Im also losing lots of weight. My belt that fits snug feels so loose now. Also, laughing (the intense version), triggers my acid and makes me want to vomit. (I CAN'T EVEN LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME NOW?!?!?) I also can't drink coffee because it makes me nauseous.

As far as i know, Theres also 2 people that in know that has experienced the same exact disease around the same time frame. My classmate and my mom's friend

So what can my disease be? I heard it can be Norovirus since its my first time getting a fever that also gave me fucking gastritis or something. And do you guys have any tips for me? Thanks in advance...

Today's weather was so nice, and it was really surprising. Recently, the temperature had been low (low for me). The morning sunshine beamed inside my room, and it was getting warm outside. I went out my balcony to clean up a bit and prepare for my sunbath.

I am jealous of people who have a dedicated sunroom. I love being surrounded by plants and enjoy the sun. Although my tiny apartment doesn't have a sun room, I have a decent-sized balcony (or maybe it's a tiny terrace?) with an outdoor sofa. I've decorated the area with string lights and plants. It's really cozy, especially at night with the string lights on and the candles burning. 

However, I probably only get to sit outside less than 10 times a year. It's too hot In the summer, and there are bugs, mosquitoes, and roaches. (I absolutely hate roaches. I've tried everything, but I still can't get rid of them. They come from the street and the other parts of the building.) In the winter, it's safer because there are no roaches, but it quickly becomes too cold to stay outside.

Today, it was one of the rare occasions when I could finally enjoy my time on the outdoor sofa. I read a magazine while sipping my coffee and listening to the music—life is good! It was actually a little bit too hot, and I think I might have even gotten mild sunburned. But I didn't mind; it was nice to enjoy the sun during the winter.

1hzltes,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hzltes/there_is_agod_and_im_here_to_prove_it/,There Is AGod And I'm Here To Prove It,"""Just have faith,"" Stuart said, sipping his coffee like it wasn’t the most ridiculous thing I’d ever heard. Faith. Like that ever paid rent. Faith didn’t stop bills from piling up or my boss from breathing down my neck. But Stuart swore by it. He’d been through worse. He'd lost his wife, his job, even his dog, and yet here he was. Calm, collected, and annoyingly happy.  

I laughed it off at first. Faith. Sure. But his words stuck like a splinter under my skin. That night, staring at the cracked ceiling of my shitty apartment, I muttered something to the dark. Not quite a prayer. More like a dare. *If you’re out there, prove it.*

The first sign was small. A job offer. Nothing flashy, just a step up from the dead-end grind. Then my car, which had been coughing its last breath for months, roared to life without so much as a tune-up. Stuart grinned when I told him.

""See? Faith works.""  

So I leaned in. Quiet prayers in the shower, muttered thanks before bed. My faith grew like a tumor, spreading through me, taking root. The more I believed, the better things got. Promotions. New friends. Even love. My life was no longer a punchline. It was...good.

But good rarely lasts...

The cough started in October. By December, I was choking on blood. The doctors were baffled. My tests came back clean, yet, I was wasting away. They didn’t have any answers.

But I did.  

I prayed harder. I begged. Every night, I clung to my faith. *You gave me this life. Don’t take it away. You’re there. I know you’re there. Save me.*  

And...

God listened.

I didn’t die.

The hospital bed was cold beneath me when I woke. My breath rasped in the silence, sharp and unnatural.

Stuart came in first, rushing when I shouted for him. But relief turned to horror when he saw me. He backed away, stumbling over his words. ""Y-you...don't look right,"" he stammered.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, confused as I felt absolutely fine, just hungry.

""You-...you don't look...*alive,* Helen.""

But I was alive. I awkwardly smiled to prove it, but his face twisted into shock as all my teeth fell out.

I ran to the mirror, screaming.

My skin was gray and taut. My eyes were black pits reflecting nothing. My faith had saved me, but not in the way I’d prayed for. I was alive, yes, but, something else entirely.

And then the hunger pang hit me again.

Stuart was the first. We then fed on the doctors, nurses and patients together.

Now...there’s no stopping it.

The infection spreads fast. A bite, a scratch--it doesn’t take much. They all rise just like I did, empty but, alive.  

Stuart was right. Faith works.

There *is* a God.  

And *I’m here* to prove it.",6,1736685562.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

Still can't eat properly,"Rundown of my health history: It was the start of school (August 2024) when i started having stomach issues because of stress. (Can't eat properly) but managed to half-recover. (I get nauseous when travelling after eating a meal from a cold, windy area). Until it went downhill back in December


Story:

Alot of people in our class started getting sick at 2nd week of December

I remember it was 2nd week December weeked that i felt lightheaded. 3rd week Monday was when i felt a fever developing. That day i was passing so much gas. And then i had a fever for 2 days. 

After recovering from the fever, whenever i eat something, I feel like acid is climbing my throat. So i decided to not eat but when i didnt eat, I get the same result. Its been like this until New years. 

I also noticed that i get motion sickness easier and it triggers my acid reflux (even the though of a long trip triggers it). I still cant eat as much as i used to. Well i can but it takes tons more effort to not puke.

A month after my fever (Present), I can eat normal amounts but I can only do it without distractions. And i feel like have a very weak stomach (takes so long to digest). Im also losing lots of weight. My belt that fits snug feels so loose now. Also, laughing (the intense version), triggers my acid and makes me want to vomit. (I CAN'T EVEN LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME NOW?!?!?) I also can't drink coffee because it makes me nauseous.

As far as i know, Theres also 2 people that in know that has experienced the same exact disease around the same time frame. My classmate and my mom's friend

So what can my disease be? I heard it can be Norovirus since its my first time getting a fever that also gave me fucking gastritis or something. And do you guys have any tips for me? Thanks in advance...

So yeah that's my rant about my health. Planning to meet a Doctor soon to get informed.",1,1736685515.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

She loves me and I want this to work out but I just cant forget certain stuff that happened in the past and stuff thats happening now. 

I feel like everything is piling up. Lies from the past along with irritating stuff that she does now. Let me explain. 

We have been together for almost two years straight. When we dated the first time for like three weeks, I “broke up” with her over something stupid just because I didn’t care at the time. It’s just another girl I said to myself. 
A month later I realised that shes not just a girl because I hadn’t been in a relationship with another girl in about two years so I was thinking about going back but I didn’t regret breaking up either. And I told my friend ( who is friends with her best friend) “Eh screw it if she hasn’t fucked another man in between this time why not. If she has she stays in the past.” He then went and told HER best friend that and so it reached her. 

We then got back together.
We talked for about 3 hours in my car and I ask her what happened the time she hang up with her ex. (My friend told me that she started talking to him and they just went out for coffee.)
And she told me that they just talked and that she never saw him in person again.
So I just let it go I say whatever thats nothing.
What really happened was, she went out with her ex for like a week and if even now I know the full truth, they fucked once. How I found out? She was searching for a specific message on her best friends chat while we were cuddling and theres a message I read from that period that we had broken up saying “we did the usual, and some light sex”. I was furious because why am I learning about this a year and a half after we got back together? Do I even break up with you? I tell her. “Wtf is wrong with you lying to me like that?”
This has been stuck with me since then and every time I imagine her having sex with the dude my whole mood gets ruined. I realise my whole two year relationship’s foundation is a lie she said. We talked about marriage, kids and everything. We already live together.
Now, 3 months later, I have trust issues on daily basis and I keep telling myself that it’s my fault and that Im an insecure piece of shit. I feel like even now, if she receives a text from him, she will cheat and that she still has bottled up feelings for him.
Tl;DR I found out that after a year and a half of our relationship thats she had sex with her ex when we stopped dating back when we first met so now I have huge trust issues towards her.",0,1736685396.0,relationship_advice,8,0.4,False

2nd was pretty random as I thought she wanted to change her name to ""Yume"" from ""Aika."" I tried asking her through head pressures if she wanted to and she wanted to, so I just changed her name entirely.

3rd one again was completely random. I just woke up and was eating my breakfast which was the leftovers pizza from yesterday's, After a few bites I was gonna talked about how plain it was but before saying plain she said ""garbage,"" which felt ""alien"" to me since I like any type of bread even if they were plain.

Lastly, 4th: I was active forcing then thought that I'd look or search for Yume's thoughts rather than wait for them, then heard her say ""Can't wait."" I previously drank hot black before forcing, then asked her what she thought about it, saying I prefer hot black coffee instead of cold, promising that I'd buy one for her the next day.

I'm also not sure if I'm doing everything correctly. I've been relying on chat gpt and 1-3 guides since day 1 and avoiding talking to someone about tulpamancy because of certain things about myself.

Advantages and Drawbacks of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me

Investing in rural land for sale near your location can present a profitable and fulfilling endeavor. From the pure air to the stunning sceneries, there are several appealing characteristics to land ownership. Nonetheless, like any financial commitment, there are also various potential downsides to keep in mind. In this article, we will delve into the advantages and drawbacks of investing in rural land for sale near you.

Advantages of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me

1. Possibility of High Return on Investment
Investing in rural land can result in a high return on investment. With the growing demand for organic and locally-produced goods, there is an increasing likelihood for profitability in the agricultural industry. By owning land and cultivating your own crops or livestock, you have the opportunity to take advantage of this demand and generate a substantial income.

2. Land Appreciation
Land has historically been a reliable investment, and rural land is no different. As the population continues to expand, the demand for cultivable land is also increasing. Over time, the value of rural land tends to appreciate, making it a dependable long-term investment.

3. Diversification
Investing in rural land offers an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio. Unlike conventional stocks and bonds, farmland is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. By diversifying your portfolio with rural land, you can mitigate your overall investment risk and potentially enhance your returns.

4. Tax Incentives
Owning rural land can offer several tax advantages. Landowners may be eligible for tax breaks such as deductions for property taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation. Additionally, there are special tax incentives for agricultural producers that can further reduce the tax burden on land-related income.

5. Personal Fulfillment
For many stakeholders, owning land is not just about financial gain. It provides an opportunity to connect with nature and engage in an environmentally sustainable lifestyle. Land ownership can bring a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that goes beyond monetary value.

Drawbacks of Investing in Rural Land for Sale Near Me

1. Significant Initial Expenses
One of the primary barriers to investing in rural land is the substantial upfront cost. Acquiring rural land requires a significant capital investment, whether you are purchasing property, equipment, or livestock. Additionally, there are ongoing costs associated with land maintenance and operation, such as seed, fertilizer, and labor.

2. Market Fluctuations
Like any commodity, the agricultural market is subject to price volatility. Fluctuations in crop prices, changes in government policies, and unpredictable weather patterns can all impact the profitability of rural land. As a result, investors in rural land need to be prepared to endure market fluctuations and potential financial losses.

3. Time and Dedication
Owning rural land requires a considerable amount of time and dedication. Farming is not a passive investment and often necessitates hands-on management and physical labor. Whether it's tending to crops, caring for livestock, or maintaining equipment, landowners need to be prepared to invest their time and energy into the operation.

4. Environmental and Regulatory Variables
Farming is subject to an extensive array of environmental and regulatory variables that can impact operations. Compliance with environmental regulations, water usage restrictions, and zoning laws can all affect a farm's ability to operate and its profitability. Additionally, changes in government policies related to agriculture can create uncertainty and additional challenges for landowners.

5. Limited Liquidity
Unlike stocks or bonds, rural land is not a liquid investment. It can be challenging to quickly sell land, especially during economic downturns or when the real estate market is weak. This lack of liquidity can make it difficult for investors to exit their investment if needed.

Conclusion

Investing in rural land for sale near you presents both potential advantages and risks. Before making a decision, it is important to carefully consider both the advantages and drawbacks of land ownership. The potential for a high return on investment, land appreciation, and tax benefits make rural land an attractive investment option. However, the significant initial expenses, market fluctuations, and time commitment required for land ownership are important factors to consider. By weighing these factors and conducting thorough research, investors can make informed decisions about whether investing in rural land is the right choice for them.

Falling into place around my phone like the hands of virtuosic violinist taking command of their bow. I pick up the call before the phone even leaves my pocket. Looking down at my thigh, the phone creeps into view from behind the fabric of my jeans. The caller id is not as expected. “Blood Bank”. I take the phone to my cheek.

 

“Hello?” I spoke like I questioned if someone was at the other end.

 

“Yes, hello It’s Michelle from the blood bank, are you aware of how much of a difference 20 minutes of your time can do for others?” As phone salesmen come they all seem aggressively upbeat. But she was something different. She didn’t really sound like a woman. She sounded feminin; but too aggressive in her sales pitch. Like someone had coerced her into having the cadence of a top sales**man**. It was slightly off-putting, in that same way as salesmen admittedly always are.

 

“No. Sorry Michelle but I am actually not that interested in blood donations.” After I said it, I realised that she had set a trap for me. Her initial question was designed for me to stay on the line. Even my no was an invitation to educate me further on the possibilities of helping others. And she was at it immediately.

 

“That is no fault of yours mister. Many people have no idea.” She sounded playful.

“When donating blood you are actually donating three separate life saving materials. That means that only one donation could save three lives. That’s only 20 minutes of your time! Doesn’t it sound exiting to make such a big difference to so many people?”

 

It was an malicious question to end on. What could I say to that? I wouldn’t capitulate to her that easily. I was figuring out how to divert without sounding selfish. Noticing my hesitation she started again.

 

“If you are willing to become one of our lifesavers you are in luck! Because we are actually extending a special service to people in your neighbourhood. That means that if you want us too, we can come to you! Dosen’t that make it convient? Do you know what blood type you have sir?”

 

Reacquiring my footing I try again.

“No. I’m actually not really interested.”

 

Ignoring me again she changed path.

“Well that’s fine most people aren’t that keen on knowing their blood type. But figuring out what blood type you have could potentially save your life. It can be vital in future emergency situations. Are you interested in the home donation service?”

 

“how would that help me?” I guess this was the idea. Keep me on the line until they finally posed me a piece of information I was interested in.

 

“well sir, If you are ever in the hospital the doctors would be able to match your social security number to your blood type. Making sure you can receive blood immediately without waiting for doctors to do testing in such a time sensitive situation. So this donation is also a chance to help yourself.”

 

I am not much for a sales pitch. But this one worked. I could tell others I had done a good deed. And I was actually creating a safety net for myself. Besides, chicks dig men that donate, and this is by far the least time expending option.

“Is that information automatically put into the system?”

 

“Yes our staff will fill it in for you”

 

“You said you could come to me?”

 

“Yes. We have nurses that will travel from donor to donor during normal business hours.”

 

They are bringing their nurse to me. I guess it is more convient. Well any method they use to save more taxpaying lives, I guess.

 

“What time?”

 

“Anywhere within normal working hours, we will schedule a route that matches our donors preferences.”

 

“I’ll be home around one o´clock on Thursday” Even though I work from home I wanted to give a time. It just felt like a way of taking back control over the conversation. I deserved to make them come too me when I wanted. And as much as I regret to admit it, saying one o’clock meant I was sure to be awake by then. Being single with a programming job made it a little to easy to sleep in late. This often forces me to code at night. I tell my self I’m a night writer, but really I think by now procrastinating has become so prevalent in my life that I am forced to schedule around it.

 

“That will fit perfectly, one o’clock Thursday. What’s the address?”

 

\[redacted\]

 

“Perfect. I wont take up any more of your time mister..”

 

“Skinner”

 

“Have a great day mister Skinner”

 

“You too miss” as I took the phone away from my ear I was reminded of my fear of needles. I never had an easy time with foreign objects being inserted into me. I remember telling my highschool girlfriend that it was a good thing I wasn’t into men. I think statements like that is why she left; although she did manage to laugh them off in the beginning. I still think those same idiotic thoughts. I feel a kind of connection to my past as I laugh about it; just as she used to. I hang up the phone as the first snikker leaves my lips. Hope Michelle didn’t hear that. God I am such an awkward man.

\----------------------------------

 

As the day creeps closer, I start feeling my skin clinging itself tighter to my tissues. Tucking away my veins behind their only layer of protection. Looking at the soft skin in my elbow joint has become habitual. Eyeing down the treasonous vein puffing out my skin right at the most opportune point of attack. Looking at it forces conjurations of being penetrated. The sensation of the needle rubbing against me from within my life pipes. And then to have it remove my essence like I didn’t need my blood anyway. That couldn’t be safe. There is a reason why I have the amount of blood I have. Surely there is. And having it removed is unnatural, and almost surely detrimental to my health. Such invasive medicine should be outlawed. Wishing the imaginative needle gone, I start thinking about the needle tickling me from within my vein as the surgical instrument was retired from it’s violation of my cellular integrity. In turn, I shudder.

 

There is little escape now though. It’s almost one a clock. The nurse would be here any minute. Looking around my home I realised that it was completely unpresentable. I had to clear out my livingroom at least. I started by clearing away old plates. Too many tv dinners. Some of the plates had begun sticking to each other. I put them in the kitchen and take the bin with me back to the livingroom. Old bags of snacks and drinks lay scattered about as well. While picking them up I was interrupted by the doorbell ringing. I kick the last pieces I could see under the sofa and put the trashcan on the other side of the kitchen door. Closing it. The doorbell rang again as I moved towards it. Having almost forgotten all about my fear of needles for a short minute of clean panic.

 

Sharp inhale.

 

Long exhale.

 

Simultaneously I depress my shoulders and door handle.

 

Light floods in through the door, like an army of photons breaking down a castle door. Blinking I see a silhuet come into focus.

 

“Hello mister Skinner” The voice is almost cheerful. And by the end of the sentence my vision has acclimated to the light and I can finally see my visitor clearly. If I had to describe her appearance I would say no more than 25, blonde, narrow nose, her forehead only reaching my shoulders, full lips, playfull smile like a cats, holding a small white cuboid box with a big cartoonish drop of blood on it, her knees pointing inwards. If I had to use only one word it would be: nurse. In other words. She looked the part.

 

“Ohh hey, miss.. and, your name?” She looked at me for a second, her smile dropping from her face. The cheerful voice remained.

 

“Walker. Audrey Walker. Can I come in?” Her smile returned with a vengeance.

 

“Yes of cause.” I stepped aside letting her into me domicile. As she took the first step over the barrier of my doorstep I felt a cold run up my back. In that moment all I could think was. God she is hot. Don’t fuck this up. It had been so long since I had been within arms reach of a woman, it gave me shivers.

 

“Do you have a comfortable place for us to sit?” The question caught my female starved mind as very sugestive. And I stumbled getting my footing back to the professional.

 

“I can, I’ll sit wherever you would want me to sit; at.” Pathetic.

 

She laughed.

 

“Well your *couch* seems suuper comfy” There was a question embedded in the suggestion. A slight change in inclination at the the word “couch” that made it clear that I was supposed to direct her to the area. I did.

 

She almost skipped over to it. Laying her white box on the newly unburdened coffee table. She turned nimbly on the balls of her feet and bent at only her knees and hips as she sat herself gently onto my couch. I would remember where she had been seated.

 

“Are you joining me?” Once again I felt like she was using sexual undertones for some sort of gain. But damn it if I wasn’t willing to entertain her.

 

“Yes, yes I am. Where do you want me?” I tried to act like I had meant it as flirtatious, while in fact it was just a coincidence of my nervous brain falling into her submission.

 

“Well for *now* mr. skinner. I want you right here.” She padded the sofa next to her. I remembered the trash underneath it. I caught myself wishing that she wouldn’t see it.

 

I walked slowly,  unsteadily. Putting one foot in front of the other felt like a puzzle to me. How do people handle these emotions? Heart throbbing I bent over gripping the armrest. She opened up the white box and suddenly all of the sexual tension I had been engrossed in vanished. The light reflecting off the deflated plastic bag evaporated it like a puddle in summer. Now all I could think about was that empty canister, which would hold within it the liquid that now kept me alive. Some part of me given away to the dying masses.

 

“You afraid of needles?” She reached out for the bag while I quivered in fright.

 

“Not really.” I lied. She lifted the bag and the attached tubes out of their container.

 

“Don’t worry I’ll be gentle with you.” She smiled at me. Once again I thought of her tone as suggestive. But it didn’t matter. Nor did it matter how gentle she was actually able to be with me, the blood would be drained from me regardless.

 

Laying the bag on my table, she then took a small vial out from her pocket.

 

“Can I get you to verify your information for me?” She said while looking intently at the small vial.

 

“Yes of cause, it’s \[redacted\]”

 

“Yes and you grew up in?”

 

“\[redacted\]”

 

“Perfect, that’s the worst part over” Her smile was getting annoying. Or I was getting angry. I needed her to know how I felt, without seeming less masculine. An impossible task.

 

“How much blood are you taking?” An authoritative question. I think I solved that nicely.

 

“It’s only 0.85 liters, plus the 20 millilitres for the blood test.” I didn’t know how much that was of my total, or if it was standard to take that much… or that little?

 

“Oh that’s; just, ffine.” Damn I was back on the defensive. She was taking the alcohol swap and the small needle with the three-necked nuzzle. I could already feel my nervous sweat erupting from my skin like molten lava. The evaporation of the droplets quickly turning my perfectly adequate body temperature into shivering cold.

 

Taking a small adjustable ribbon she slid it up my arm. Her nails stroking my skin every inch along it’s journey to my bicep. Retracting her hands she ripped the packaging of the alcohol swap. Revealing the small white fabric solely responsible for maintaining my genomic integrity against the microbial assailants lurking on my skin.

 

She leaned in and grabbed my forearm. Her hands where soft. I closed my eyes as soon as our skin contacted. It was involuntary. A cold wetness fell on my skin as I once again opened my eyes. She was fully focussed on that one treasonous vein of mine. Packing away the alcohol swap she quickly brought the needle to the vein. I didn’t know if it would be best to look or not.

 

“You are going to feel a little sting.” Her gaze fixed to my vein, not a moment of compassion for my situation.

 

“Can you count down?” She looked at me with surprise.

 

“Sure.” Smile returned. Her gaze returned to the vein. I had to figure out if I was going to look or not.

 

“3” If I looked I wouldn’t be surprised by the sensations that would follow.

 

“2” If I looked I would watch as my body became scared, and blood became scarcer.

 

“1” If I didn’t look I could focus on something else. I might not feel as much of it.

 

I blinked. And kept my eyes closed.

 

I felt an exponentially rising pressure on my skin. Then my cartilage gave in, it collapsed with a snap as the needle broke through my armor. When it settled within me, the vein bounced back up like a spring enclosing the foreign object. As it scraped upon the needle I felt me toes cringe. I let out a small puff of air, and opened my eyes.

 

She put the tube of the bag into the nuzzle and turned a hinge. The blood poured into it.

 

“Keep on working this hand gently.” She said and tapped my palm.

 

I was losing consciousness. Watching the liquid streaming out. She couldn’t take this away from me. I spent all my energy remaining upright. Controlling my breathing. Not because it helps against panic or whatever. But because I didn’t want to be visibly flustered.

When I awoke it was to gentle laughter and a stroke on my arm.

 

“Haaey mister.” I liked this smile even less. It was belittling. Degrading. How dared she look at me like that.

 

“I think you dosed of there for a minute. Hihi.” Fuck her. What had she been doing in the meantime. Had she been going through my stuff?

 

“Good news is that we are done! So I hope I´ll get to see you again. It’s really very kindhearted of you to donate and save lives.” She grasped my forearm with her hand. A small ball of cotton was secured to my joint with tape.

 

Out of my peripheral red caught my eye. I was looking at the bag full of what was collected from me. I was trying to estimate the amount of it. Thinking about how it would look, if instead it where to be spread out over my floor. Silently comparing that with the amount of blood I had seen in horror movies. And if the character survived or not.

 

She left. I felt at home again. The sun was still shining. I threw out the trash under the couch. And updated my dating profile.",1,1736684646.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

1hzljl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1hzljl7/looking_for_advise_for_a_new_projector/,Looking for advise for a new projector.,"Hello, I'm considering buying a new projector and would like some recommendations.

My budget is between €800-€1000.

We would use it to watch the occasional movie or series in the living room.
The living room has 2 big windows, but we don't mind closing the blinds whenever we want to watch something.

The projector would be on the wall where the windows are and would be projecting to the opposite wall. The distance between walls is 4.10 mts.

We were considering mounting the projector to the wall, just above the couch, but have some concerns about how the noise could be annoying while we are seated below.

An alternative would be to have it on the coffee table in front of the couch. Based on the width of the table, it could be between 1.40mts and 2.30mts from the wall to project. The difference is it would be projecting from below instead of from above the couch.

Ideally, we would prefer mounting it to the wall so that it doesn't get in the middle of anything, so something not too noisy would be ideal.

The projector would project directly to a clean, very very light beige wall.

Okay, so my skin feels pretty gosh darn good after removing the mask after tossing and turning for the last 8 hours because there was a moist piece of silicone smothering me all night 🤣 

In all seriousness, I am a very light and fussy sleeper. I’m not sure why I thought I’d be able to get any rest with this on me. A few times over the night I felt a gross moistness but ignored it because I wanted to see this experiment through. But believe me when I tell you I truly considered ripping it off.

It could’ve been the combination of the LP cicaplast and the silicone that made the unpleasant sensation. It could’ve been that I got too warm and started to sweat. What I do know is that something like this, unless you have ZERO sensory issues and/or can sleep like a rock no matter what, should only be done—if ever—once in a blue moon. 

Or perhaps just take it off when you’ve had enough. I think even leaving it on for a few hours is better than nothing at all.

But now I’m curious if there is a material that could be used that would allow some air flow while also maintaining a good barrier and prevent absorbing of whatever you have on your skin into the material. 🤔💭

I’m not saying don’t try it! Just saying I’m not sure if it’s ***worth*** a poor nights sleep for moist skin that will maybe or maybe not last me throughout the day!

Thanks for coming along for the ride. I’ll DM those of you who wanted the name of the mask … after I’ve had my coffee lol.

1hzlhb1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hzlhb1,Setup UPDATE AUS (game changer !),"Excited as to share this with you all. Special thanks to Rennets for bouncing ideas off of about what updates to the setup to do. 

So what I've done in the past few days has been pretty epic. MASSIVE morale booster for me as I was really feeling pretty on the ropes with the crazy heat down here lately and struggling with what to do next and ways to move forward with bettering this situation/setup. 

So I started by tinting the front windows (factory doesn't fit any tint to the front 2 windows so sorted that. 

(This all started from that little $40 dollar fan from Kmart =] )

Then I noticed we had some epic sales on ecoflow stuff here for summer (50% off) so I sorted a power bank.

Then I noticed KINGS had some massive summer sales too so I fitted up 200w of solar along with some roof cross bars that I got for an awesome deal from a local shop. 

Also did a ton of research on fridges and found an awesome cheap option that has a secop compressor (same compressor as the dometic and Waeco fridges) and have been shocked at how quietly it runs and how fast it goes from ambient down to 4°C. Finally had a cold drink tonight and the smile it brought was ridiculous =]

I moved my bed all the way over to one side and managed to fit this fridge by the side so it's accessible.

Super excited to get this battery bank in here. Looking at getting an air fryer or something to cover making meals and being able to stop eating shit food all the time that's getting insanely expensive FAST.

If anyone has recommendations on air flyers or other compact options for ways to cook I'm all for hearing them. Also some kind of fast boiling kettle/mug for morning coffee would be great. 

Anyways, there's my share with you guys. Hope it's entertaining at least maybe gives someone some inspiration or ideas. I was really at a low point and didn't know what to do about it. Slowly getting a routine now too. Finding more spots and having a route to empty out the piss jug, shower, find spots to give myself a haircut and trim etc. 

Anyways. Long post. I'll cut myself off there.

Hope you're all doing well and anyone that needs to hear it, there's always a way forward to better conditions. Love this group here and the ideas and the support and all of those good things. 

Here's to us all.
