Main causes were misunderstandings, lack of communication, my own stupidity, and my lack of thinking before I speak

Things pretty much went in this order

1) I said/texted something (which was misinterpreted)

2) Everyone thinks I‚Äôm mad at them??

3) I dont realize they think Im mad (im an idiot)

4) They think im acting fake whenever we hang out cause im ‚Äúobviously‚Äù mad at them but im ‚Äúacting‚Äù normal 

5) They start overthinking everything I say and reading my texts like the bible, thinking my words have double meanings (im literally big chilling)

6) I also plan a trip to meet my long distance ""friend"" (wink wink) knew him for a year atp, and I tell all the girls about it at different times

7) most of them dont ask much about it cause again, they think im mad at them

8) two of them ask abt my trip and my safety, im meeting a man, i blow them off, (this is my fault, i shouldnt have done that, i took it more as, ""they think im stupid and they dont trust me"") they didnt trust me atp tho so i was right on that... but they cared abt me and if i cared abt them i wouldve taken time to answer their questions

9) this is the breaking point for some  of them, i go on the trip, i have a bf :)

6) I find out that one of them is mad at me (through a third party)

7) I confront her (wondering why shes mad at me, im literally an idiot, still have no clue...)

8) we schedule a call (im tweaking abt my friendships and I apologize THROUGH TEXT to another girl in the group, who I realize I actually did dirty on multiple occasions) it was through text cause she was traveling (not the best time to do that‚Ä¶, can you tell i was spiraling?)

9) 20 min before the call im notified that the whole group will participate in said call (except girl who is traveling) (im tweaking, thinking i said a slur or sum)

10) they jump me, i apologize, my sister, who is also part of the friend group, defends me, cause if I said anything they would have thought I was not listening/dismissing them

11) Its been 5 months, i only communicate with one of them

12) The girl I actually did dirty comes back from college, we set up a time to talk, she mentions a lot of things I KNOW are misunderstandings, I get the feeling she has talked to the other girls and they have come to the conclusion that im evil (theyre entitled to this)

13) I clear up the most horrendous misunderstandings or rumors, then halfway through the convo I decide that it is a waste of time to clear every detail out (i cant even remember half of the things she brings up)

14) I also come to the conclusion that because I was a terrible person to her I don‚Äôt deserve her friendship, and i tell her this, and I apologize to her

15) We decide to end the friendship, she seems to still want to go out, get coffee, I suggest other wise

16) I am happy for her, I think we have outgrown each other, and that us ending our friendship is the best decision

17) I thank her for all the good times

Conclusion:

I will now proceed to formally end my friendship with at least one other girl, and talk things out with the other girls, I am convinced they will all side together

It hurts, I basically have no more friends other than my sister

I am not angry, I think initially I was, but I also realize that my expectations of friendship are not the same as theirs.

Maybe it was a long time coming

Am I a good friend? my answer is ""definitely not the best""

will i learn from this?
yes

so did I do the right thing?

My husband and I got into clones January 2024 and figured we should post a state of the collection to show off the pick ups over the past year. We tried to smell the OG's whenever we could before buying, but we also ended up blind buying a good amount. Luckily, we ended up liking everything so far and don't really consider anything to be a miss. We wear everything we have and don't tend to avoid any of them.

His favorites/most complimented (in no particular order):

1. CDNIM EDT - Best bang for your buck and absolutely a beast mode fragrance
2. Lattafa Asad - Another bang for your buck and tied with CDNIM EDT for most compliments
3. CDN Precieux - Super high quality, but weaker performance than CDNIM EDT
4. FW Suits - The go to formal/wedding fragrance
5. Turathi Blue - Dad almost stole the bottle
6. Missoni Wave - Favorite spring/summer fragrance along with Turathi Blue
7. Sheikh Shuyukh Final Edition - Better than Y EDP imo, no reason to buy the OG
8. Alhambra Fusion Intense - Cannot tell the difference between this and TF FF
9. Portfolio Neroli Canvas - Masterpiece, feels like the highest quality cologne in the collection
10. Khamrah Qahwa - Like the sweet warm embrace of a lover who happens to be holding a coffee

Her favorites/most complimented (in no particular order):

1. Ard Al Zaafaran Bint Hooran - One of my favorite sweet fragrances and I love the bottle
2. Afnan La Fleur Bouquet - Love this for spring/summer
3. Armaf CDN for Woman - Doesn't last long for me but one of my most used for casual outings
4. Lattafa I am White (Ana Abiyedh) - Pricy but also smells expensive and clean; husband wears the Amber Oud Gold which is technically the better clone of Erba Pura but we like both
5. Armaf CDN White Imperiale - Was my signature for a while, wore it so much I got sick of it. 10/10
6. Afnan Zimaya ""Sharaf Blend"" - So many compliments and has been lovely for winter, got sniffed up by all the girlies and grandmas over the holidays
7. Al Haramain L'aventure Femme - Love it out of the box but masturbating, Aventus femme DNA is super underrated
8. Zara Golden Decade EDP - Pretty identical to YSL Libre Intense, current signature and great longevity imo
9. Al Haramain Junoon Noir - Al Haramain is one of our new fave clone houses, I love this as one of my main sweet/floral scents and it's not overwhelmingly sweet
10. Ariana Grande Sweet Like Candy - Not a clone but I do love the scent a lot, too bad longevity is doodoo

Later, I feel frustrated because I‚Äôm not being fully honest, and that might mean I‚Äôm not getting the help I need. Personally I think it stems from me being a people pleaser. If someone spill their coffee, even with no direct contact from me, I still feel like I did it.

Everyone dreams of a dazzling, Hollywood-worthy smile that lights up a room. Teeth whitening strips have become increasingly popular as an affordable and convenient solution for achieving brighter teeth. But many people wonder: are teeth whitening strips truly a permanent fix for discoloration? The world of dental cosmetics is complex, and understanding the longevity of teeth whitening treatments requires a closer look at the science, effectiveness, and limitations of these convenient whitening products. Whether you're a coffee lover, a red wine enthusiast, or simply someone looking to boost your confidence with a brighter smile, this comprehensive guide will unpack everything you need to know about the permanence of teeth whitening strips.

Understanding Teeth Whitening Strips: How They Work

Teeth whitening strips are thin, flexible pieces of plastic coated with a whitening gel containing peroxide-based bleaching agents. When applied to the teeth, these strips work to remove surface stains and penetrate the enamel to break down deeper discoloration. The primary active ingredients typically include:

- Hydrogen peroxide
- Carbamide peroxide
- Glycerin
- Water
- Adhesive agents

**How Whitening Strips Actually Remove Stains**

The chemical reaction between the peroxide and tooth enamel helps break down stain molecules, creating a whitening effect. However, this process is not permanent and requires consistent maintenance.

The Temporary Nature of Teeth Whitening Strips

Contrary to popular belief, teeth whitening strips are not a permanent solution. Most professional dentists and dental researchers agree that the effects typically last between 4-6 months, depending on individual habits and oral hygiene. Factors that impact the longevity of whitening results include:

1. Dietary habits
2. Smoking
3. Oral hygiene practices
4. Natural tooth color
5. Age
6. Underlying dental conditions

**Factors Affecting Whitening Durability**

Certain lifestyle choices can significantly impact how long your teeth remain white after using whitening strips. Consuming staining substances like coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco can quickly reverse whitening effects.

Potential Risks and Limitations of Teeth Whitening Strips

While teeth whitening strips can be effective, they come with potential drawbacks:

- Tooth sensitivity
- Gum irritation
- Uneven whitening
- Enamel damage with prolonged use
- Limited effectiveness on certain types of discoloration

**Professional vs. Over-the-Counter Whitening**

Professional teeth whitening treatments often provide more consistent and longer-lasting results compared to over-the-counter strips. Dentists can customize treatments and use higher-concentration whitening agents.

Maintaining Your Whitening Results: Best Practices

To extend the effects of teeth whitening strips and maintain a bright smile, consider these recommendations:

1. Practice excellent oral hygiene
2. Use whitening toothpaste
3. Avoid staining foods and beverages
4. Regular dental check-ups
5. Touch-up treatments every 4-6 months

**Natural Alternatives for Teeth Whitening**

Some natural methods can help maintain whiteness:
- Oil pulling
- Baking soda brushing
- Eating crunchy fruits and vegetables
- Drinking water after consuming staining substances

When to Consult a Dental Professional

If you experience persistent sensitivity or uneven whitening, consulting a dentist is crucial. Professional guidance can help you determine the most suitable whitening approach for your specific dental needs.

**Cost Considerations**

While over-the-counter strips are more affordable, professional treatments might offer more value in the long term due to their effectiveness and longer-lasting results.

Conclusion

Teeth whitening strips provide a convenient but temporary solution for achieving a brighter smile. Understanding their limitations and maintaining good oral hygiene can help you maximize and extend the whitening effects.

Conversations, moments, sensations‚Äîthey slip through my fingers, and I wonder which reality they‚Äôre from. They all happened, didn‚Äôt they? Each one. But I never know which time shift I‚Äôm in when I remember.

Tonight, my mind pulls me into a moment I‚Äôd buried. You said you‚Äôd just been to New York‚Äîyour voice was soft, almost wistful. You said someday you‚Äôd go back. You wanted to live there. I think I laughed then, because it felt so far away, like an idea made of smoke. But now? Now it‚Äôs real. You‚Äôre there. You moved away. You left me here, anchored to this California coastline we once called ours.

I keep replaying the way the salt air tangled in our hair, how the ocean seemed to mimic the way you‚Äôd pull me in and push me away. You were always running toward something, weren‚Äôt you? Some unseen horizon I could never reach. But I didn‚Äôt stop trying.

Now, I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs still. Still in this house, still in this city, still holding the pieces of you. The empty space you left behind feels like it has a sound‚Äîlow, humming, endless.

I can feel the echoes of our mornings, coffee too hot against my tongue, your laugh spilling out like sunlight. And the nights‚Äîoh, the nights‚Äîwrapped in music and skin, our bodies speaking the truths our mouths never could. Those nights carved their way into me like an etching on glass, a permanence I can‚Äôt shake, no matter how many timelines I shift through.

You‚Äôre gone. You‚Äôre gone, and I want to hate you for it. But how can I, when all I feel is this unbearable longing? My heart trembles like a struck chord, the vibrations of it begging for release. It‚Äôs as if the red string tying me to you is fraying, but it won‚Äôt break, no matter how much I pull.

I wonder if you ever think of me in your new city. Does the noise drown me out, or am I there in the quiet moments‚Äîbetween the sounds of traffic and your own heartbeat? Do you remember the time we talked about the stars, and you said you didn‚Äôt believe in fate, only choice?

Because here I am, still choosing you. Still tethered to this ache that feels like fire and silk all at once.

But this is your story now. This time around, you need to heal the parts of yourself that I couldn‚Äôt reach. And I, left in the stillness, am trying to find my way without you.",1,1736754157.0,supernovadarling,0,1.0,False

I just got a Delonghi Eletta Explore Cold Brew at the beginning of the year, it was on sale for ‚Ç¨690. I drink mostly espresso, but my wife loves milk drinks, so we went with this model to suit both of our preferences.

Overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy with the purchase. I like how the espresso tastes, not quite the same as a dedicated espresso machine, but good enough for a super-automatic.

The thing is, I‚Äôm currently trying to dial in the machine and I‚Äôve been using a commercial medium roast coffee for testing (so I don‚Äôt waste the good stuff). I set the grinder to 3.5, as suggested by many here on Reddit. However, I‚Äôm occasionally getting the error message:

*""Could not brew your coffee, please reduce intensity and try again.""*

I suspect the puck is clogging the machine and causing this issue. This error is sporadic, it doesn‚Äôt happen every time.

For other Eletta Explore owners: Is this normal when grinding at 3.5, or should I adjust the grind size to 4?  
Or maybe I have a faulty machine?

So just for context, I am 1.5 months into my new job and have never talked to this lady. She sits nearby and we aren't working with one another.

So while I was grabbing my coffee I realised that she was going to go next and I apologised. 

Her: ""Wow you're so tall""

Me: Smiled and said yea I get that alot. 

Her: ""You're fit too. You should really be a model""

Me: Laughed and said nah cannot la

Her: ""You're so young too, you look 22 or 23"" (If I had to guess shes in her mid to early 30s and I'm in my mid to late 20s.

Me: I laugh again and tell her my age and she said haha wow you're so young.

At this point its starting to feel abit sexually tense and awkward for me with all the compliments so I thanked her and made my way back to my desk. 

And I know what you're thinking: She's just being nice and making small talk. But it didn't feel that way at all. It feels like how a guy would hit on a girl by complimenting her looks and body and if the roles were reversed it would be harrassment and really uncomfortable for the girl. If someone wants to make small talk, wouldn't it go like ""Hi, hows your day?"" or ""How you liking it here so far?""

Note that it was just the 2 of us in the break room this whole time.

What do you think? Am I overthinking or am I really being hit on? If so ima smash the office milf.

Going to share some methods/ideas that have worked for me mostly in South East Asia and Mexico.   
I like to stay in one place for at least a month before 

Two things to always keep in mind  
Choice of destination is important. You may be in a great city but despite your best efforts opportunities to connect will be limited   
(this is how I felt in Siena Italy. I enjoyed it but did not connect with anyone)   
  
2) Embrace despite your best efforts you will be alone and that is not necessarily a bad thing. You might be in a social hostel or a vibrant night market and you do not connect/make friends. Alone and lonely are separate things

Here are the go to methods that I typically use  
  
1) Find language exchanges. It is a great way to meet locals that want to learn and connect with travelers. It is one of my first go to searches when going to a new city. 

2) Check out [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) The number of events can vary greatly. Certain cities like Bangkok, Mexico City and Tokyo are quite active where many cities have few events or ones that are set up as recurring but stopped a long time ago.   
One of the best things that came out of my current trip where I attended a meetup where we met at a night market and I invited another group to join us that told me about a Yoga retreat and I went to that and had a great time. This was something that was far out of my regular choices but I followed the thread.   
Also see the idea about inviting others to join and making connections

(they are a number of alternatives that are more popular in specific locations like Nomeo)   
Pro-level is to plan your own event. I did this in Mexico City for Indian food and Korean BBQ)   
(If you know of any meetup alternatives please share...)

3) Subscribe to the subreddit of the place you are visiting. You may find some more specific to Tourism/travelers. 

4) Facebook groups seem to be more popular outside of the United States. (I am currently in Chiang Mai and I reactivated my Facebook account to access these groups)

5) WhatsApp groups are a popular tool to share information about a specific area on a specific topic  
(same thing goes for Telegram but I do not use that as much)   
Sometimes they are a challenge to find. There used to be one but it looks like it folded

6) Consistently go to the same co-working space and/or coffee shop and/or cafe and strike up conversations. Most people love to share their story. With locals ask for recommendations. 

7) Dating Apps but be careful! I am currently on a hiatus from alcohol so that cuts me off from many dating scams but look them up for the specific location you are going to. 

8) Make it a point to make others feel welcome, included and accepted and that would go back to you.   
Be a better listener. This goes for all aspects of life.

Sil woke late into the day, to the snoring competition going on between Tallah and Vergil. Awoken in the dark, cold sweat broke across her back as a momentary feeling of dislocation had her questioning just where she was. She stopped herself from making a sprite as her eyes began picking details in the semi-dark.

It wasn‚Äôt, after all, Erisa‚Äôs domain. She hadn‚Äôt been carried there by a giant, mutated spider.

Vergil had brought her up the stairs, and from there her own two feet.

*Breathe in. Hold. Breathe out. I am of the many‚Ä¶*

The mantra centred her state of mind and she dropped back into bed, breathing quick, heart still hammering beneath her ribs. Erisa was dead. Her soul buzzed angrily in the gemstone. Sil was‚Ä¶ safe.

She‚Äôd been asleep for too long, she realised with a jolt of shame that pushed her off the bed. People needed her help above. They needed healing and medication. The other healers required support and relief. She couldn‚Äôt spend the day asleep!

With a bitter taste in the back of her throat and a tongue that felt two times too thick for her mouth, Sil crept through the room and dressed in fresh clothes. The bloody mess she left in the wash basin would be dealt with later‚Ä¶ if she could find some lye to wash the things. Blood stained after all.

*Let‚Äôs see about getting a focus,* she thought as she quietly opened the door and then clicked it shut behind herself. With no staff, it was hard to deal with some of the more complex effects. Weaving complex barriers was nearly impossible without a staff concentrating her power.

She could ask to borrow Tallah‚Äôs wand, but the sorceress got‚Ä¶ weird when they did this.

‚ÄúIs there anywhere where I can get some supplies?‚Äù she asked the red-faced tavern master as she descended the stairs. The common room was far quieter than earlier, many of the drinkers now asleep with their heads on tables or leaned one against the other.

The man suppressed a grim smile. ‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no supplies t‚Äô be had. Some adventurers sell their gear t‚Äô th‚Äô soldiers. Few of those left now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing left?‚Äù She sat and studied the board behind the man. There was plenty of beer in casks lined up against the wall, but the food selection boiled down to boiled cabbage or boiled grits. Everything else was crossed out. Bread was on-demand, set at an eye-watering price. So was butter.

Now she wished she would‚Äôve eaten along with Vergil instead of drinking the piss-thin beer.

‚ÄúAny potato vodka?‚Äù she asked.

The man shook his head. ‚ÄúLouts drank it all.‚Äù

*Blast.* She had some alchemy supplies but she lacked any reactive alcohol. Vodka would have been perfect to brew some common usables.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the adventurer selling stuff?‚Äù

‚ÄúHangs around near the sliver. Can‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù He gestured with a spotless mug. ‚ÄúKeep heading towards the mouth of the city and ye‚Äôll find it. Some lass collecting from th‚Äô rest.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt prove hard to find the way to the girl. It was, very much, a child that was hawking wares off by the side of the road. Couldn‚Äôt have been older than‚Ä¶ ten summers? Maybe fifteen, if she were charitable.

Armour scraps. Weapons‚Äîdented and too abused to be useful. Some random enchanted trinkets. And a wooden staff that had seen better days and was in dire need of some bitterleaf oil.

What proved difficult was getting the blasted girl to part with the thing.

‚ÄúHow much do you want for it?‚Äù Sil asked for the fifth time. Her patience had begun fraying around the edges. ‚ÄúI can pay in Valen currency.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, but I can‚Äôt part with it just like that, miss healer. It simply wouldn‚Äôt be proper to sell my family heirloom just to anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you have it out on the street if you don‚Äôt want to sell it?!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I do want to sell it. I need the money,‚Äù the girl said without a hint of self awareness. ‚ÄúTimes are hard in this armpit of a city.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to buy it. How much do you want for it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, y‚Äôsee, it ain‚Äôt that simple a thing. This is me ol‚Äô mum‚Äôs ol‚Äô staff. Hard to put a price on it.‚Äù

*Your mother‚Äôs old staff indeed.* The only true thing in that sentence was that the bloody thing was, indeed, old. One good swing at anything tougher than a stern breeze, and the staff would break in two. Maybe she should just see if any of the healers in the fortress above could lend her theirs‚Ä¶ but nobody lent out their staff.

It wasn‚Äôt terribly hard to guess what the miscreant expected of Sil. If she made an offer, the girl would haggle all the way into Aztroa‚Äôs treasury. If the adventurer made an offer and Sil met it immediately, then there would be no way to haggle for more, even if it would be clear that Sil could afford it. This was the kind of negotiation stalemate she neither had the time nor patience for.

Sil slit open a rent, dug inside for her money pouch, and counted out ten Valen griffons. The heavy gold coins glittered in her palm.

‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm offering you,‚Äù she said simply, making a show of stowing the rest of the jingling money pouch into the rend. She kept the slit open.

The adventurer‚Äôs eyes glittered with the promise of a payout that would exceed their earnings of an entire season. The git shook her head sadly and looked down. ‚ÄúIs a pretty offer, lady healer, but‚Äî‚Äù

Sil chucked two coins into the rent. She picked two more and gave the adventurer a pointed look. ‚ÄúTry again.‚Äù

Money passed hands in silence and Sil went away with her worm-eaten staff. One day she would follow Iliaya‚Äôs example and make her own to suit her needs.

Maybe even now‚Ä¶

Maybe later.

Would there be an announcement of an attack? She should‚Äôve asked Tallah before heading up the wide stairs into the fortress. Well, too late now. She headed up. Maybe she‚Äôd get some more of that horrible coffee and clear her head. Dreams had plagued her again, but not as terrible, exhaustion driving away the worst of it.

*Has the Goddess sent me here to atone?* It didn‚Äôt seem likely.

Christina would call her a silly hen for even considering it. This trip was clearly meant for Tallah, not herself. She‚Äôd had time to think while she cleaned and dressed wounds the previous day. They were now closer to the School of Healing than they would have been anywhere else. Passing the mountains from this side was easier, in theory, than from the north.

The knowledge sat in her memory like a leaden weight. Panacea hadn‚Äôt *sent* instructions on how to reach the School. The coordinates had simply unlocked some time after killing Erisa, positioned in her mind as if they had always been there, and yet never.

Did Panacea know of what was happening here? Or had she hedged on them? She missed the days where she felt unshakeable in her faith. But that had been a lie too, hadn‚Äôt it? Dreea had no real faith, given the things she‚Äôd done.

And Sil wasn‚Äôt a real person, just some thing made out of false memories.

She shook her head in the middle of the courtyard, having people tripping over her on their way to the night‚Äôs duties. *I need to stop thinking on things. It‚Äôs going to get me killed.*

Then again, it wasn‚Äôt a very normal worry to have, not being a person. She laughed as she ascended the stairs to the hospital, then stopped and wondered at how everyone passing would interpret that.

*Yes, trust your life to the crazy woman laughing stupidly out of the blue.*

Kor met her at the entrance to the healing ward. He gave her a long up-and-down look and then stood aside, welcoming her in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get ye a proper apron,‚Äù he said without preamble. ‚ÄúYe should‚Äôve slept more.‚Äù His eyes were kind under the thick caterpillars that were his eyebrows,

‚ÄúHard to sleep in here,‚Äù she lied. ‚ÄúI still have part of my allotment. Do we have more that need it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait for tonight and we will. Save your prayers for then. We‚Äôll need ‚Äôem.‚Äù

Under the overcast sky, the fortress was quieter than she‚Äôd expected. There were the sounds of industrious building and repairing, people carrying up boulders for the engines of war, the hammering of smiths, and the quiet grunts of men training.

But it was a kind of muted noise, like the wind kicking up before a storm broke. It sent her skin into gooseflesh.

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù Kor asked as he led her to a bucket of the dark stuff.

*They brew it in buckets?!* The less she thought of what actually made up the liquid, the happier she‚Äôd be. Kor dipped a metal mug in and handed it to her. By all rights, it should have dissolved.

‚ÄúLooks better than it tastes.‚Äù He smiled the tired smile of one used to raising morale against unfathomable odds.

She nodded, sipped and grimaced. Bitter, and crunchy for some reason.

The ward itself had several soldiers still asleep on their pails. It smelled of fresh soap. Sprites bobbed in the air, the torches too valuable to waste inside.

‚ÄúIs there any alcohol left?‚Äù she asked.

Kor led her around the place, to show her where the surgery ward was, where the linen and bandages were, and where they kept their meagre supply of healing herbs and medicine. The stock was incredibly low.

‚ÄúAye, we got some squirrelled away. What do you need it for?‚Äù he gave her a look over his thick spectacles. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt handing it out for nerves.‚Äù

She cracked a smile and pulled out several bundles from her rend, setting then out on the table. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much on me, but if you get me a few litres of good grade alcohol, I can brew us a fair amount of rotclear. With the excess, I can make some Chort‚Äôs Spirit, though it won‚Äôt be quite as potent. I‚Äôm nearly out of beaster‚Äôs salt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being mighty kind,‚Äù Kor said. Sil caught the errant glimpse that went to her arm. ‚ÄúNot many would volunteer their supplies so readily. Beaster‚Äôs salt ain‚Äôt cheap.‚Äù

Sil shrugged and drained the foul coffee. ‚ÄúI want to help.‚Äù

What she actually wanted was for the dreams to stop. If she didn‚Äôt dream of Erisa and her stinger plunging through her belly, she dreamt of watching people be broken. It was going to drive her insane, and maybe, if she saved enough lives here, she could be free of them in some manner.

It wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

It would never be enough.

*But it‚Äôs a start,* she thought glumly as she pulled up her sleeves and sat at the worn alchemy table and took stock of the tools at her disposal.

Her two helpers from before drifted in later and brought a casket of mirabelle distillation. The smell of it, once they pried off the lid, made her eyes water. Kor had been right to hide this away. Soldiers would kill for it, just so they could drink themselves out of their minds.

Castien stared openly at the scars on her arm, opened her mouth to say something, and got elbowed in the ribs by the other.

‚ÄúStop gawking,‚Äù Adella admonished. ‚ÄúNot yer place t‚Äô ask. See to your job. We‚Äôre all penitents in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like you.‚Äù Sil smiled at this. ‚ÄúAre you serving here? Or just trapped?‚Äù

The girl helped her measure the alcohol and begun preparations for brewing rotclear. It wasn‚Äôt a terribly long process, but it needed careful measuring.

‚ÄúNone of your business, lady Iluna.‚Äù

The girl reminded her acutely of Tallah, though there was no physical resemblance. Sil took a heartbeat to study the chit of a girl. Short of stature, gaunt-faced, wide-eyed and wide-mouthed, she wore her wheat-coloured hair tied in a short and messy ponytail. Her black eyes were spectacular. Sil could sharpen blades on their gaze.

‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù she said finally. ‚ÄúHow much alchemy do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle. Not my area.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what is?‚Äù

The girl readied some other cutting response but swallowed it down. ‚ÄúChildren. Children‚Äôs care.‚Äù

Sil‚Äôs eyebrows shot up at that. ‚ÄúA midwife?‚Äù

‚ÄúAye.‚Äù

Sil had never delivered children. She had the training, same as everyone, but something about childbirth made her skin itch. Midwifery wasn‚Äôt for the fainthearted, and the girl here proved that with aplomb.

‚ÄúI can dress wounds. Sew a soldier‚Äôs guts back in. Treat most burns and animal bites. I can amputate in a pinch and may patient may even survive. That‚Äôs it. Are we done asking questions?‚Äù

*Tallah indeed*. Sil smiled and explained how to prepare her ingredients so she could focus on the process.

By the time darkness dropped outside and the first blasts of the war horn resounded into the night, Sil had a good supply of her brews ready, and more still cooling. They would be ready come the proving moment.

Tallah and Vergil emerged from the city soon after, flanked by squads of soldiers in battered armour, all heading up and out. Vergil stopped by as Tallah and the rest climbed the stairs to the battlements.

‚ÄúFigured you‚Äôd be here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBrought you some food from our reserves. Don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve eaten yet.‚Äù

She accepted the jar of preserve that he brought, and handed it out to her helpers. Their stomachs growled in unison at the sign of the red vegetable paste inside. The acid coffee had made sure Sil didn‚Äôt need any other food for the rest of the night.

‚ÄúTallah says we‚Äôre not going out into the field tonight. We‚Äôre going to hold them at bay from the walls.‚Äù

‚Äú*We,* Vergil?‚Äù

He blushed and looked around the room. Luna peeked over his shoulder, the glitter of its eyes the only indication of its presence.

‚ÄúI offered to help.‚Äù When she aimed the staff at him he shook his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tether me. You‚Äôre more needed here. I‚Äôll manage.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? Safer to be stronger.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù He inclined his head to the roomful of the sick and wounded. ‚ÄúThis is more important. I‚Äôll be close to Tallah.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about.‚Äù

He smiled and drew off his helmet and waved at someone past her shoulder. Sil turned and saw one of her patience struggling to rise to a sitting position.

‚ÄúI owe you,‚Äù the man rasped out, cringing in pain. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forget what you did for me, man. Thank you.‚Äù He held out a trembling hand.

Vergil‚Äôs blush deepened and crept up all the way to the tips of his ears. He looked to her for‚Ä¶ what?

Sil stood aside and waved him in. ‚ÄúNormally, you shake a hand held out to you like that,‚Äù she stage-whispered.

The boy approached the man and clasped the offered hand. The soldier embraced him. ‚ÄúThank you. Thank you for coming. I thought I‚Äôd die out there. I thought I was dead.‚Äù

Luna had dropped to the floor and peered curiously at the entire scene. Sil tapped her heel and the spider disappeared from sight, hidden under the bed. A panic over a spider the size of a man‚Äôs head wasn‚Äôt what the place needed.

Vergil was clapped on the shoulder and the soldier released his arm soon after, dropping back into bed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it right by you. Anything you need, just ask for Miron at the quartermaster‚Äôs office.‚Äù

The boy walked past Sil and out into the night as if in a daze. Luna didn‚Äôt follow. Instead, it approached Sil‚Äôs boot and tapped it with a leg.

‚ÄúMay this one?‚Äù it asked in a whisper, its colour matching the floor.

Sil swallowed a sudden lump in her throat and nodded. If Sil herself wasn‚Äôt real‚Äîand what a mad thought that was to really consider‚Äîthen her terror of spiders wasn‚Äôt real either.

She squeaked when Luna climbed her legs and settled on her back. One of its front legs moved a lock of Sil‚Äôs hair over her shoulder, so the spider could get a better look forward.

‚ÄúI have gone utterly mad,‚Äù she mused as she set back down at her desk to measure alcohol. ‚ÄúI am mad. And this is a nightmare. And I will never wake from it ever again.‚Äù

Outside the war horns blared. Soldiers called out, a riot of defiance. The thick boom of the unleashed catapults and trebuchets throwing their loads over the wall.

Madness had come at the gates.

I was going to post in coffee but the community is massive there so I came here for more niche opinions. I hope this is okay. 

I drink coffee every morning. My parents gifted me a small machine for my boat, an aromaboy. I love how it looks and how simple it is and I use it daily. However, I feel like I want to upgrade but I know nothing about coffee. 

I like to invest in good, quality items for things I use every day. I feel like I have outgrown the aromaboy now. I am from the UK and usually just buy a bag of ground up Union coffee from the supermarket and make a cup each morning. I sometimes have an additional couple of cups in the day if I am fasting but generally it‚Äôs one cup a morning. 

I had seen the Fellow Aiden and the Moccamaster but I don‚Äôt know if they are right for someone like me. 

My question is what is next? Do I need to even upgrade? Is there much of a difference in the tech? From what I gather from my aromaboy, it is simply pouring hot water over the coffee grounds, is that what Fellow Aiden and Moccamaster do? Do they do it better?

I would love any guidance about what to do next, if anything! Also I really enjoyed Sainsbury‚Äôs Italian style ground coffee, do you know of anything similar that? 

TIA!!!

Just when I thought, you work too hard and wondered if I could get a copy of your lifestyle morning routine to get just an inch of that energy - i come on and see we have grown yet again.  There's more documents, open minded discussion, different angles and really don't we all wish we could buy you a coffee - maybe decaffeinated though ;P    Reddit, the official ""unofficially unpaid"" deep dive hivemind is often mined for it's content - because it's entertaining, newsworthy and eloquent - some redditors we love; have all three.   

Just like true crime deepdivers  were OG of Grizzly there is nothing more rewarding and satisfying than seeing a star rise, especially for justice and especially when fighting the meanest of the monsters.  Often people (not friends) say oh true crime is so morbid - I don't know how you could want to know all of the grizly details and upsetting things.   Lady justice is blindfolded so she can see behind artifice, prejudice and bias, and heavy are the arms, that balance the scales.   Safety, not just for domestic violence survivors but for all, man, wife, child, infant - this is who we can protect and do.  Is it perhaps more morbid to forget and rip open presents,  when Libby and Abby, Gannon, Baby Hannah, Christian,  JJ Vallow and sister Tylee, Maddie and the hundreds of grieving loved ones that are wishing they could be there.   This new year of 2025 we will learn the names of more,  and as a community it is a comfort to know that someone out there, in this world of lurking evil is a lighthouse  that guides us to keep safe, keep alert, be kind and if you see something - say something.   We are not freaks,  and we are not weak.   

  Happy New Year Sluthers,  

Its a big year ahead, and I know, there are people not here anymore but they do want justice, they do not want to be forgotten.   Be a lighthouse,  follow your instincts and keep the true, in the crime.

Currently using a Niche Zero and Cafelat Robot ($1500 or less),"What equipment would give me good extraction for medium and light roasts but save me time vs my Cafelat Robot and Niche Zero for iced lattes? I don't often steam milk but would enjoy it more if there was decent auto milk. I've got a so-so electric kettle with 5 degree temp control but no temperature holding. 

I use a Breville standalone milk steamer for when I‚Äôve wanted steamed milk. I make two iced lattes every morning for us and absolutely love the results. No issues dialing in, easy temp control from my kettle. I prefer medium to light specialty beans, or occasionally a dark specialty coffee.

But it takes a long time to measure, grind, dose, tamp, pour, install and extract espresso two times. The results are fantastic and the process is satisfying but if I could get similar results in less time with different equipment that would be amazing.

The kettle takes a while and is fiddly. All the manual transferring steps to prep the puck on a manual espresso machine seems to take the most time. I don't have to preheat anything with the Cafelat. I've tested with and without preheating and there's no benefit I can perceive in the resulting espresso so preheating fiddling isn't part of the longer prep time. 

I‚Äôm tempted by the idea of something like the Breville Barista Touch Impress. I‚Äôm worried that I won‚Äôt be able to get the machine to be consistent despite my expertise with a manual. 

I used to have a Baratza Encore like the burr set in the Touch Impress and it made great espresso grounds though it was louder and messier than my Niche. 

I've thought about the Bambino Plus, but worry it doesn't have enough pressure or hot enough shots to give me good espresso, based on the reviews I've seen.

Been eyeing the Turin Legato V2. I don‚Äôt steam milk often but would be sad about not having the auto milk features of some of the Brevilles.

I thought about the Gaggia Classic Pro E24, since I could mod it sometime and make it almost as good as a Decent, but the Turin Legato gets closer out of the box and saves me work. 

Any other suggestions or ideas? Thank you so much in advance. ",2,1736752159.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Idk where to go from here.,"We broke up 4 months ago and have been NC, but a few days ago I couldn't take it anymore and called him after a night out (.... i know). He responded the next day and hoped I was okay.

He then said I never knew how to answer to my last message where I accused him of a lot of heinous shit. We went back and forth a bit, trying to explain each others position and what we felt went wrong, both of us apologized for some of the things while we needed to drop other things for now because we were going in circles. Then we just caught up on each others lives. We casually texted back and forth for half a day and then spontaneously decided to meet for dinner so we could talk in person.
Catching up went mostly well, I felt there was still a lot of love for each other. We even kissed at the end of the night but left it at that. 

We met again the next day and hung out in the city, went for coffee and took a walk. It was fun and it felt natural. I guess the NC helped us both to work on ourselves.

I don't really know how to go from here though. We are still texting regularly and he seems open to keep meeting. I know there are still things that we need to discuss, especially since I accused him of a lot of things before we went NC and he is obviously still hurt about it and I eventually need to sit down with him and go through all of it.

I'm scared of rushing things and getting my hopes up too early because I was quite anxiously attached in that relationship. I feel way more secure now, but I still don't know how to go about it ",1,1736751987.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1i08fsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i08fsj/aita_for_dumping_my_friend_potentially_getting/,"AITA for dumping my friend, potentially getting her sent to court? ","Today I (17F) unfriended my best friend (18F) of a year and a half (we‚Äôll call her D for simplicity). Please respond with kindness if I misspeak about any of the sort of ‚Äúlegal action‚Äù aspect of this story, I‚Äôm not sure how court cases really work as I haven‚Äôt taken my Government class yet and have never been involved in one myself.

This all began in the sunmer of 2024. My other friend (18M) broke up with D in June (We‚Äôll call him K for simplicity). D took it super hard, but as the three of us were a sort of trio prior to the breakup, the two of them agreed that as long as they didn‚Äôt have to be friends, I could still be friends with them both without issues or jealousy. But, as it all does in high school, things got ugly. In August, D‚Äôs sadness turned into anger towards K. We were driving around a city nearby shopping for homecoming dresses when she mentions that K sexually assaulted E (16F), their mutual friend.

I had not known E whatsoever prior to D mentioning her just then, so I expressed my sympathy and agreed not to ever talk about it to E as it would make her incredibly uncomfortable. D also suggested that I stop talking to K altogether since, in her words ‚Äúhe is a terrible person and trying to manipulate you into thinking he‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù At this comment, the suspicion begins to arise, but I say nothing and agree. Over the next two months, I do not text K. I talk to him in passing, but eventually we drift back together and hang out more, getting coffee during study hall and even signing up for a choir event as a duet. 

We start texting a lot into December, and the topic of past relationships arises as it often does when one is constantly in a drama-filled, teenager-run establishment. He talks about D, I talk about my ex, and then he talks about E. He says that they‚Äôre extremely good friends and that she last came over about a month ago. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny,‚Äù I think to myself, ‚ÄúBecause according to D, you assaulted her 4 months ago.‚Äù I wanted desperately to believe D, because it‚Äôs so important to believe the victim in cases like these, but it would be doing K an injustice if I didn‚Äôt ask him, so I did.

K told me that no such thing had happened. Yes, they had been sexually active at some point in their friendship, but were now just incredibly close friends.

This information K had shared weighed down on me for a month, since I was too scared to even acknowledge the possibility that either K or D could have lied to me, and I seriously did not want to lose a friend to what I, at the time, deemed ‚Äútrivial high school drama‚Äù.
But, something as serious as this can‚Äôt be ignored. One week ago I added E on Snapchat, and worked up the courage to explain all that I knew, tried to create a comfortable space, and just asked her for the truth.

No assault.
No manipulation of any kind.
Just friends.

I thought about it for a week, contemplating if this was worth ending a meaningful friendship over. I decided that if she is going to manipulate my judgement on the character of my friends just because of her opinions on them, she is not someone worthy of my friendship or my love.

Mind you, dear readers, over this year and a half, I had noticed subtle lies told to mutual friends, bigger ones told to parents, and multiple breakings of my boundaries that I deemed too small to really damage a friendship over, but nonetheles, they were dozens of small offenses that led up to the biggest lie that anyone has ever told to my face.

Today, I ended my friendship with her. I really tried to be civil about it, and explained this whole story to her, I let her know that I wanted her to be happy and surround herself with the people who will support her. I just really didn‚Äôt want this to be massive, or awful, or anything.

An hour later, K lets me know that he talked to his parents about the lie that D told. His parents then talked to his uncle, who is a lawyer, and they want to potentially take her to court. This is the kind of lie that can ruin someone‚Äôs life, and I know that. But I‚Äôm scared. I started this whole thing and it‚Äôs all my fault, and my friend can be tried as an adult since she‚Äôs 18. What if she gets sued or sent to court or something because I ended my friendship with her?

Am I the asshole here? Because it sure feels like I am.

When you step into a Walford kitchen, you're not just entering a cooking space; you're experiencing a blend of style, functionality, and warmth that has transformed over the years.

One of the significant trends seen in Walford home kitchen designs is the transition from traditional to modern aesthetics. In earlier decades, kitchens were often designed with heavy wooden cabinets, intricate moldings, and ornate details. Today, the trend has shifted towards clean lines, minimalist designs, and a focus on open spaces. This change has allowed the kitchen to become an integral part of the home, blending seamlessly with living and dining areas.

### Inspiration from Nature

Naturally inspired elements have become prominent in Walford home kitchens. Homeowners increasingly seek designs that incorporate organic materials and color palettes that reflect the outdoors. Here are a few ways nature has influenced these kitchen layouts:

- **Touchless Faucets:** These faucets not only enhance cleanliness but also offer convenience, perfect for busy kitchens.

### Open-Plan Living

The concept of open-plan living has profoundly influenced Walford home kitchen designs. No longer is the kitchen a separate, isolated space. Instead, it‚Äôs now a lively hub where meals are prepared, families gather, and friends converse. You‚Äôll find:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/walford-home-kitchen  
  
- **Kitchen Islands:** These multifunctional spaces serve as meal prep areas, casual dining spots, and social hubs.
- **Seamless Transitions:** Flooring and design choices that create a fluid transition from kitchen to living room encourage interaction among family members.
- **Decorative Functionality:** Decorative elements, such as open shelving, can be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, showcasing beautiful dishware or cookbooks.

### Personalization and Uniqueness

As homeowners look to make their mark, personalization in Walford home kitchens is on the rise. People want their kitchens to reflect their style and tastes. Here are ways to infuse personality into your kitchen:

- **Unique Backsplashes:** Whether you choose colorful tiles, mosaics, or patterned glass, backsplashes can serve as standout focal points.
- **Custom Cabinetry:** Personalized cabinetry that reflects a homeowner's individual style provides character and uniqueness to the space.
- **Art and Decor:** artwork or heirloom decor can introduce warmth and a sense of history to the kitchen.

The shift toward open spaces, the integration of technology, and the influence of nature all contribute to creating kitchens that are not just about cooking but about connecting with family and friends.

Practical Tips for Maximizing Space in Your Walford Home Kitchen
----------------------------------------------------------------

Your Walford home kitchen can be a delightful space for cooking and gathering, but sometimes it can feel cramped. Here are some practical tips to help you maximize space, enhance efficiency, and make your kitchen a more enjoyable area. Follow these simple strategies and transform your kitchen into a functional paradise.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/walford-home-kitchen  
  
### Utilize Vertical Space

One often-overlooked area of your kitchen is the vertical space. You can take advantage of it in several ways:

- **Wall Shelving:** Install shelves above your countertops to store frequently used items. This keeps essentials within reach and adds a decorative touch.
- **Pegboards:** Use pegboards to hang pots, pans, and utensils. This not only saves cabinet space but also makes your cooking tools easily accessible.
- **Hooks and Racks:** Install hooks on the walls or the insides of cabinets for hanging mugs, dish towels, or measuring cups.

### Incorporate Multi-Functional Furniture

Another excellent way to maximize space is by opting for multi-functional furniture:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/walford-home-kitchen  
  
- **Kitchen Islands:** A mobile kitchen island can serve as extra prep space, a dining area, or additional storage.
- **Expandable Tables:** Consider an expandable dining table for your kitchen. You can save space on regular days and expand it for family gatherings.
- **Benches with Storage:** Choose benches that have storage options underneath, allowing you to keep blankets or kitchen supplies hidden away but easily accessible.

### Declutter Regularly

Taking time to declutter your Walford kitchen can make a world of difference. A cluttered kitchen can feel overwhelming and small. Here‚Äôs how to manage the clutter:

- **Assess Your Items:** Regularly go through your kitchen supplies. Donate or discard items you no longer use. If it hasn‚Äôt been used in a year, it might be time to let it go!
- **Organize Drawers:** Use dividers in drawers for utensils, tools, and gadgets. This helps keep everything in its place and makes it easier to find what you need.
- **Label Storage Containers:** Use clear containers and label them for easy identification. This approach encourages you to put things back where they belong.

### Optimize Cabinet Space

Your cabinets can be a treasure trove of storage opportunities. To maximize this space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/walford-home-kitchen  
  
- **Stackable Containers:** Use stackable containers for dry goods in your pantry. They save space and keep your food organized.
- **Lazy Susans:** Incorporate turntables in corner cabinets for easy access to spices and condiments.
- **Adjustable Shelves:** If possible, use adjustable shelves in your cabinets to customize the space based on your needs.

### Make Use of Clear Surfaces Wisely

While it‚Äôs tempting to fill every inch of counter space, keeping clear surfaces can create the illusion of a more spacious kitchen. Here are some tips:

- **Limit Countertop Appliances:** Only keep essential appliances on the counter, such as a coffee maker or toaster. Store others in cabinets or on shelves.
- **Create a Coffee Station:** If you love coffee, designate a small corner for all your coffee supplies. This concentrates your coffee-related items in one space.
- **Use Decorative Trays:** Organize smaller items on a decorative tray to group them while keeping your counters clear.

### Focus on Lighting

Good lighting can create a feeling of space in your Walford kitchen:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/walford-home-kitchen  
  
- **Natural Light:** Open window curtains to let in natural light. This can make your kitchen feel open and airy.
- **Under-Cabinet Lighting:** Install under-cabinet lights to illuminate countertops. This not only helps with cooking but also enhances the aesthetic of your kitchen.
- **Consider Mirrors:** Strategically placed mirrors can reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space.

By implementing these practical strategies, you can maximize space in your Walford home kitchen, making it functional and inviting for you and your guests. Embrace these changes to optimize your kitchen experience!

### Conclusion

The journey of the Walford home kitchen reveals a fascinating blend of evolving designs, practical functionality, and personal touches. Embracing trends like open layouts, eco-friendly materials, and smart technology, these kitchens have become the heart of modern homes. As you explore various inspirations, it‚Äôs essential to remember that your kitchen should reflect your unique style and preferences.

Creating a welcoming space is about more than aesthetics; it also involves making the most of the area you have. Practical tips for maximizing space ‚Äì from utilizing vertical storage solutions to incorporating multifunctional furniture ‚Äì can transform your kitchen from a cluttered zone into an efficient and stylish environment.

3. Anyone recommending long-term supplements that aren't for treating an urgent, temporary medical problem (you can discuss using herbs for infections, pure Iodine for a deficiency, Vit D for a loading dose etc.).
4. Recommending chicken, fish and eggs over ruminant meat and fat. We strongly believe the latter is healthier.  You can eat both but saying that it makes no difference is against the rules as it is false and this is a learning subreddit for newbies.

Everything else -- various food amounts, preferences for particular animals and fat ratios including chicken, rabbit, eating bacon with spices because you have no better choice, **using spices temporarily because you're transitioning**, cheating ocassionally, using tiny amounts of plants because you're healthy and can tolerate it, etc.
2. You can argue about parasites and eating raw (I don't personally eat raw at all), it is not banned.

**3. All posts about eating meat, fat & organs, eggs and seafood.** ***You don't have to be strict carnivore here, but we will always acknowledge that anything outside eating animals is one way or another cheating on the carnivore diet***.

4. Debates about plants, fruit, are fine as long as you acknowledge that they're not part of our natural diet and merely a subsistence food that humans ate sometimes. In terms of health they are completely irrelevant and harmful apart from medicinal and drug use.

5. Honey is harmless in small amounts according to Paleomedicina so I'll allow it. Small amounts =  1 tablespoon in a day max, occasional use. Anyone recommending more than that will be banned or simply reminded of the rules if they're not complete assholes.

6. Paleomedicina also believes that if you are perfectly healthy you can tolerate up to 30% plant food by volume, using traditional local vegetables. This carries absolutely no benefit however. Therefore, recommending that, especially to newbies, is forbidden without the proper context: we can tolerate plants if we are very healthy, but it's a stress on our body.

**Perfect picture of human health**: eating both cooked and raw fat, meat & organs from 4-legged land animals, prefferably grass-eating ones, including cows, sheep, etc. This includes liver, bone marrow, brain and eating pure fat.

This is the basis of this community, if you want to eat fruit go to r/animalbased I've got nothing against you.

P.S. I will also make the mod log public. Apart from this, we can try to run this together (community input) but any deviation from Paleomedicina's teachings will probably always be banned.",1,1736751649.0,realcarnivore,5,1.0,False

Sat Sri Akal, Reddit fam!

So here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm a 31-year-old Punjabi guy who landed in this city in the last week of December for work (read: endless meetings and questionable cafeteria coffee). With Lohri just around the corner, my Punjabi heart is craving dhol beats, giddha vibes, and the sweet embrace of til ke laddoo. Back home, Lohri is a full-blown Bollywood movie scene‚Äîbonfires, bhangra, and endless rounds of food.

But now, I‚Äôm here, staring at my laptop screen and wondering if anyone else in this city is gearing up for Lohri celebrations. I mean, where‚Äôs the fun in clapping solo around a YouTube bonfire, right?

If you‚Äôre also in the city and planning to celebrate, let‚Äôs make it happen! I‚Äôm down for finding a spot with a proper bonfire (bonus points if someone knows how to make good sarson ka saag). Let‚Äôs swap stories, vibes, and maybe even a little bhangra (no judgment if you‚Äôve got two left feet, I‚Äôll teach you).

Also, and I say this with all the respect in the world‚Äîany Punjabi kudiya in town? üòÇ Look, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm here to find my ""Lohri queen,"" but hey, the dhol sounds better with some good company.

Drop a comment or DM if you‚Äôre in! Let‚Äôs light up the city (and not just metaphorically) with some proper Lohri vibes. Who‚Äôs in?

We go to uni together and we usually go to this mall where we have food or we go see a movie and we tend to have a fun time, at least I do and I notice that they do, too, but we are on vacations right now and they rarely message (we tend to speak on a group chat because we are just three) I've told them we should go out someday and they agree or sometimes they even are the ones who make the plans, but they end cancelling them when the day gets close, and they don't even give a good explanation and rarely answer messages. For example one of my friends said ""fine, we should go have a coffee"" but I felt like she wasn't too into it, and my other friend said he couldn't come with us because he doesn't have money for a taxi, but I offered to pay for it and he didn't even acknowledge my message on the group chat, answering another message of a different subject. I know they are geek introverts who prefer spending their time playing videogames online but I still feel hurt because I miss them and I want to see them but it seems the feeling is not mutual (it's been a month since I last saw them and spent time together), I even have some gifts for them from when I went on vacation with my family and I was so excited to give it to them but maybe i'm just being too clingy and they don't care about me the same way I care for them. I feel confused because when we are together we have fun and they seem happy with me and act normal, but when we part and I message them they rarely answer and act distant, I send memes or silly videos sometimes in the group and they rarely see them, that's when I start to feel upset and wondering if I'm being annoying or a toxic friend if I want them to pay a little more attention to me or at least I would appreciate if they are honest and direct about what they feel. I know they don't have a job nor a partner or more friends and neither they go outside of home so they don't tend to be busy, and that's another reason of why I feel upset because I would understand if they were busy, but they aren't and even then I get ignored üò≠ (sorry if english is bad, it's not my first language) ",1,1736751382.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I had been standing behind everyone at the funeral. The time was somewhere around 6pm and the bright sun was shining in the faces of the attendees, making me wonder if the sunglasses were serving a purpose this one time. I didn‚Äôt want to get near the casket. My sister‚Äôs dying face was already etched into my brain. No need to get in there to watch her ‚Äúrest in peace‚Äù with makeup and nice clothes. She wouldn‚Äôt have been wearing whatever clothes my mom had picked, anyway. I had been wanting a nice rainy, depressing day, like those portrayed in movies, where people stand around under their umbrellas crying ‚Äì tears falling away and dissipating into the earth. As it was, though, it was more annoying than sad. The sun burnt my face, and my armpits had started to drip and no matter how much I shuffled around, there didn‚Äôt seem to be any comfortable position. And why hadn‚Äôt anyone thought of bringing some god damned water?

My phone began vibrating in my pocket. I looked at it. It was an incoming call, but I had to unblock it to see who it was. People had begun to glance at me. A woman had made the effort to turn around almost all the way to see what I was doing, wondering, likely, what kind of sister I even was. I put the phone in my pocket, where it vibrated a few more times.¬†

Someone at the front was saying some nice words about my sister and I could hear my mother crying. It irritated me. Somehow, the sun had wrapped around my neck and back, stinging me. My back dripped with sweat and I shuffled some more. I swallowed, trying to get some moisture around my throat, and I sighed. The woman in front of me turned to me again and made a shushing sound. I didn‚Äôt even know who she was. Her ugly face judged me with a frown.¬†

‚ÄúYou shut the fuck up,‚Äù I whispered and walked away.

I didn‚Äôt think about it until later, but the fact that she hadn‚Äôt said anything made me angrier. I couldn‚Äôt even come up with a decent comeback.

I drove home and took a couple of sleeping pills, and drifted off thinking about the hot summer, and the sun, and the dripping sweat.

A loud buzzing started under my pillow ‚Äì my phone vibrating again. I shot upright and blinked. Mark was calling me.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Before Mark could say anything, I noticed the hour on my bedside clock: 1:23AM.

‚ÄúJen! Are you awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up! Are you ready to hear this?‚Äù His voice was giddy and excited.

‚ÄúWhat is happening?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe did it!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked, wondering if I had just asked the same question twice. ‚ÄúYou did what? Are you drunk?‚Äù

‚ÄúJen, you‚Äôre not gonna believe this. We did it. My dad‚Äôs quantum radio‚Äîit‚Äôs actually working! We‚Äôre picking up speech! I‚Äôm at the lab right now and you‚Äôve got to come hear this. I can swing by and grab you, or just get dressed and head over. Seriously, you need to hear this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working?‚Äù I stood up and turned the lights on in my room ‚Äì the adrenaline in my bloodstream picking up steam.

‚ÄúYes! Listen to it, listen!‚Äù

Through the speaker on my phone came a strange, distorted sound. White noise crackled, interspersed with a deeper bubbling noise that reminded me of an old 80s tv show.

‚ÄúDo you hear it?‚Äù He asked me.

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt hear it very well through the phone‚Ä¶ but you want me to come over?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, come over ‚Äî and hey, grab a couple of beers on your way will ya? This is gonna blow your mind.‚Äù

He hung up after I agreed and I stared at the wall in my bedroom, plain white. If what he was telling me was right, the news could be bigger than anyone imagined. Alien speech recorded for the first time. My brain was still unfolding itself from its stupor ‚Äì the sun somehow still burning the small of my back.¬†

I looked at the clock again. It read 01:26. My sister was smiling next to it inside a reflective frame. I smiled back at her.

It was the middle of summer and I drove to Mark‚Äôs lab with open windows. The strong gushes of wind hit my face, sending my pony tail flying in all directions.¬†

The meaning of Mark‚Äôs call had only just settled in. I hadn‚Äôt had the heart to tell him, but I had never thought his work would bring about anything interesting. His father had started before him, many years ago, and even then, as young as I was, I didn‚Äôt think it would work. Or, I guess, I didn‚Äôt think it could work. Aliens? Sounds from distant interstellar events? Maybe, but aliens? I didn‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be any. I thought we were alone.

A smell of a natural spice from a plant or tree came in through the window and I was suddenly without thought. The road was dark and my ears vibrated with the sound of air and the tires on the pavement below. It was quiet, in a sense, devoid of the sounds of the everyday commutes and the city, and the myriad other people running around me like it doesn‚Äôt matter. As if the world hadn‚Äôt just ended, as if we weren‚Äôt living in a now unending nightmare. With the windows open, and the wind rushing in around my face, my tears were thrown away and dissipated, destroyed by the impact. I sped up, making sure to keep my eyes open, drying them out in the moving world. Through the deafening roar around me, my sister‚Äôs voice echoed somewhere in the chaos.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She used to say.

My eyes filled up again, but the world took care of them, scattering my sadness into the back of the car and the road outside. I held in a sob, and I pushed my foot into the accelerator again, gritting my teeth.

I had been to the lab before. Mostly, Mark used me as the proverbial rubber duck ‚Äì just sitting there, sipping on some coffee after another sleepless night. He asked me questions I didn‚Äôt understand and then came up with answers on his own, bouncing ideas off me. I arrived with a six-pack in my hands, forgetting that my eyes must have been swollen like a toad‚Äôs.

‚ÄúHey Jen.‚Äù He hugged me. ‚ÄúAre you doing okay? I‚Äôm sorry I woke you. I should be more‚Ä¶ mindful, you know. I forgot‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ I forgot about your‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Show me the recording again. I couldn‚Äôt hear it well over the phone.‚Äù

Mark paused a bit and looked at me.

‚ÄúOkay yeah! Things are going crazy right now. I‚Äôve called everyone, so others are going to be joining soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome listen to this. Just‚Ä¶ since I‚Äôve called you, I‚Äôve managed to clean up the signal. I don‚Äôt know what happened. I think this must be a freak coincidence. I don‚Äôt think we touched anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ aliens?‚Äù I asked, still not convinced.

‚ÄúJen. What else can this be? We‚Äôre pointing directly at Proxima Centauri. What else can it possibly be? Just‚Ä¶ shh! Listen.‚Äù

He grabbed my hand and pulled me to a speaker in the middle of a hundred different devices. I almost knew them by name. The waveguide, directing waves to who knows where; the spectrum analyzer, doing whatever spectrum analyzers do; the cryogenic cooler, sitting there like it had nothing better to freeze; and a bunch of other whirring, pulsing, shiny things.

Mark turned a knob.

‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt stopped‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs getting clearer.‚Äù

The recording began again. A white noise crackled through the speaker, and then the voices began. The odd bubbling sound had been transformed into a dull mumbling. We were listening to new sounds, unheard anywhere this side of the galaxy. My heart started racing.

‚ÄúMark!‚Äù I gasped.

The recording continued. Two different voices mumbled our way from another star. Mark looked at me with a stupid, wide grin. I grinned too, stupidly.

‚ÄúThat!‚Äù a chubby guy walking into the room said, pointing to me and Mark and the speaker, to which we stupidly grinned. ‚ÄúThat is human speech.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo fucking way.‚Äù Mark said. ‚ÄúHow do you know that? Do you know where we‚Äôre listening? I triple checked already. I checked it many times.‚Äù

The chubby guy sat down at a desk and put on some headphones, listening to the live signal as it came in through the quantum radio. With his hand in the air, he waved us away.

Minutes dragged. I learned that the chubby guy was Gary, and he was a linguistics expert. Mark‚Äôs and my excitement had died down since Gary had pointed out the cadence and rhythm of the sounds we were hearing. He had distorted recordings of random people talking off of YouTube in a similar way to what we were hearing on the quantum radio. I had sat down, now wearing headphones, not interested anymore, making time until the sun rose and I could head back home and feel like crap the rest of the day, as the lord intended. My phone‚Äôs screen didn‚Äôt seem to glow right, though, and my eyes kept blinking and squinting as I adjusted the brightness and scrolled through photos of my dead sister.¬†

A couple of others had come to the lab but had left soon after when they learned we‚Äôd been listening to human voices. Gary stayed, though, intrigued by the matter of the origin of the recordings.¬†

I closed my eyes and listened to my music ‚Äì some old school Britney Spears never hurt anyone, and I drifted through the minutes half asleep, half dreaming. Delilah popped up in my mind‚Äôs eye. Her image consumed me, forming among the blotches of darkness as I drifted, her memory haunting my waking mind. A particular conversation was playing on repeat.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna forget me, are you?‚Äù I had asked her as she lay in bed, bald now, and very thin.

The question hadn‚Äôt made sense. It‚Äôs as if I wanted her to ask me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget you.‚Äù¬†

I had smiled at her, frustrated. I had been sitting by her side that day for hours and I didn‚Äôt know what else to say.

‚ÄúWhy do you have to die?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhy do you have to live?‚Äù

I think she was joking, giving me a response to a question without one. She died the following night. I‚Äôm not sure if I did, though. I might have.

‚ÄúMark!‚Äù Gary‚Äôs voice was strained. ‚ÄúCome here!‚Äù

I took my headphones off and watched as Mark joined Gary.

‚ÄúLook!‚Äù Gary said again, ‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs my grandma in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs my grandma‚Äôs voice. I swear, she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs talking to me!‚Äù He wiped his eyes, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard her in years, but it‚Äôs her, I know it. She‚Äôs saying‚Ä¶ things she used to say, things no one else would know.‚Äù

I walked closer to them.

‚ÄúGive it to me,‚Äù said Mark, and placed the headphones on his head.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Gary whispered, his eyes red and teary.

Mark made a shushing sound and closed his eyes, as if trying to listen to a sound coming from a remote, distant place.

‚ÄúWhat are you listening to?‚Äù asked Mark, as he checked settings on a computer screen.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the quantum radio, man,‚Äù Gary said. ‚ÄúThe source has been moving, look. I‚Äôve been adjusting it.‚Äù

Mark turned to me with wide eyes. I wasn‚Äôt sure what his face meant. With the look of a frightened puppy, or some kind of deer in headlights, he held my gaze as he listened in on the signal.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whispered, but his eyes didn‚Äôt move, lost, focused on some image beyond me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said again, loud.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my dad,‚Äù he said, and turned back to the monitors.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your dad?‚Äù I screamed.¬†

‚ÄúMy dad isn‚Äôt dead, listen. Listen!‚Äù

He disconnected the headphones on his head and the signal blared from a speaker on the side of the quantum radio.

*‚Äò‚Ä¶ we had wanted to stay in the cabin, and the weather was good, but we kept finding‚Ä¶‚Äô*

The signal came and went.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is happening!‚Äù Mark bent over the controls of the quantum radio.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say. It had been at least 10 years since I‚Äôd listened to Mark‚Äôs father.

‚ÄúMark? This could just be a recording, right?‚Äù But he didn‚Äôt hear me. Mark had gotten busy attaching a bunch of cables from one plastic box to another, grunting and making a mess of the place.

‚ÄúMark, what are you doing?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt even react to me.

‚ÄúMark, what the fuck are you doing!‚Äù He turned to me and grabbed me by my shoulders.

‚ÄúThe source is moving, Jen. If we don‚Äôt go now, it‚Äôll be blocked by the mountain here in just a few minutes. We can‚Äôt lose it. Help me!‚Äù

He handed me heavy batteries and cables and he began pulling plugs from the wall, disconnecting the quantum radio from its usual position. I grabbed my backpack and stuffed it with whatever it was he was handing me.¬†

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to go up!‚Äù

Mark carried a backpack and the quantum radio in his arms. Disconnected from the monitoring devices, it seemed small.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù He said and pointed with his head towards the exit.¬†

We crammed everything into his truck outside, and he leapt into the passenger side.¬†

‚ÄúYou drive.‚Äù He said.

I jumped into the driver‚Äôs seat and accelerated out of the parking lot. The sound from the quantum radio now mostly static.

‚ÄúWhere? Where are we going?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere! Here, make a right. Up the mountain, Jen. As high as you can.‚Äù

The radio immediately began.

*‚Äò..love those summer nights when the fireflies would come out. We‚Äôd sit on the porch, and the sky would stretch on forever.*¬†

*I remember one night, must‚Äôve been eight or nine‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I went outside. Just sat on the steps, watching those fireflies blinking in the dark. No one else around. It was quiet.*

*It felt like the world was waiting for something. I didn‚Äôt know what, but I remember thinking if I sat there long enough, I might see something‚Ä¶ at the edge of the forest.*

*It‚Äôs funny, you never think those nights mean anything. Just another summer evening. But they stick with you‚Ä¶*‚Äò

The radio broke up again, and I turned to Mark as I drove up a winding road.

‚ÄúWhat is this, Mark?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my dad, Jen. It‚Äôs him. He‚Äôs talking to me.‚Äù

Suddenly, a flash illuminated the world. For an instant, the midnight darkness was replaced with daylight. We looked outside to the sky. It was the stars. The dim twinkling of the stars, the usual sight of my recent sleepless nights, was changing. They were pulsing slowly, building in intensity again.

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù I said. My heart raced, and I opened my eyes wide, trying to adjust to darkness and daylight. Order was disappearing. The world had somehow changed before me, probably as I sat bored listening to oops, i did it again.

We caught up to the signal.

*‚Äò‚Ä¶ can you hear me? It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ been so long‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶is not what you think. I‚Äôve been watching you‚Ä¶‚Äô*

I was sure then, as I heard the voice coming from the radio. It was Mark‚Äôs father. I turned to him, sitting in the passenger seat, holding on to the radio with his ear pressed against it.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt lose the signal, Jen.‚Äù

If Mark‚Äôs father was out there, and Gary‚Äôs grandma was out there. Was Delilah out there, too? A sudden swelling grew in my throat. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I wanted to swallow, but couldn‚Äôt. Tears filled my open eyes, and the world became a blur. The stars swelled with me, building up again until a tremendous flash filled the sky, exploding in a bright blue light. Mark sat next to me as we drove up, in the middle of the undoing of the world, absorbed by the voices coming from the radio. Outside, the road was barely visible. With my foot heavy on the pedal, we sped up the mountain, turning here and there and running over logs and stones and teetering on the edges of cliffs. I couldn‚Äôt think, neither of us could.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening, Mark?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the flashing of the sky? What did you do?‚Äù As I said that, the sky above us shifted. Strange dim shapes popped in and out of existence.

Mark looked at me ‚Äì his eyes glowing with the blooming starlight. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do anything. I don‚Äôt know either‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is your dad on the quantum radio? Didn‚Äôt he die? Didn‚Äôt you bury him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you know? What the fuck is going on? Where are we going?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything, Jen! Just drive! We were looking for audio from other star systems. Maybe we found audio from somewhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean? Somewhere else?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fucking dad, Jen! What do you want me to say? I have to know what this is. Just drive.‚Äù He went silent for a moment and then half whispered, ‚ÄúYou should want to know, too.‚Äù

Wind from the outside rushed as the truck‚Äôs engine roared. Again, the world blew away my sadness ‚Äì stored it somewhere in the darkness, and left with me a strange determination. The radio was dead again. White noise spilled out of its speaker and Mark watched me drive in silence. I wanted to yell at him. I wanted to scream. I didn‚Äôt though, and under the brief respite of the blooming sky, under the veil of darkness, I breathed ‚Äì in and out, in and out. I breathed in again. Up ahead, the road was coming to an end. I breathed in again and again, my lungs filled. I sped up. The engine screamed. Mark‚Äôs eyes glowed, reflecting the swelling stars.

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Someone whispered, and I stopped.

We ran up a wooden set of stairs that led to a lookout on the mountain‚Äôs top. As we hurried, the city in the distance seemed to have erupted into chaos. Red lights flooded the streets.¬†

‚ÄúJen.‚Äù Mark paused after saying my name. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

He pointed to the sky where the stars were building up again. Oddly, right above our heads, a vast patch of the sky was devoid of light. The radio, which had been dead since the drive up, came alive again, loud.

‚Äú*I‚Äôm coming, Mark. I have been searching for you. The ultimate transition‚Ä¶ We were apart. We‚Äôll be together now‚Ä¶ Ready yourself for transport‚Ä¶*‚Äù

‚ÄúMark, what the fuck?‚Äù I said. My heart was racing.

The sky erupted with light, searing our eyes, forcing us to look away.

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù I screamed, but Mark didn‚Äôt reply.

Still blinded by the flash, I felt the air around me, searching for him. I didn‚Äôt want to move, afraid I might step on the stairs we had just climbed and tumble to my death.¬†

‚ÄúMark!‚Äù

I looked up to find the void above us had widened, stars being extinguished as it grew. As the remaining stars bloomed, I closed my eyes, only to see through my eyelids that the world had begun to unravel. The stars were pulsating, and the time between each explosion of light was decreasing with every passing second.

Nature around us had gone wild. Thousands upon thousands of birds had taken to the sky, screaming and flapping with no direction. Somewhere nearby, coyotes were cackling. The sky had so sped up its pulsing that it now seemed to effect on the land a stroboscopic nightmare. Thunder roared.

I opened my eyes. Mark had run up another short flight of stairs and he yelled at something beyond my vision. My own movements slowed down by the incessant flashing of the world. He had left the quantum radio behind and it spat out the words of a mad crowd ‚Äì unintelligible, urgent words.

I opened my mouth to scream, but nothing came out. My heart was beating fast, entranced by the pulsing stars and a shot of adrenaline my brain had decided to dose me with. I coughed, hyperventilating.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I wanted to say. I wanted to tell Mark to come get me, to bring me along with him to whatever it was he was seeing. I wanted to see, too.

From the sky, a giant hand emerged, its shape slowly materializing through the flashing chaos, fingers curling toward us like it had been waiting. It descended in deliberate, agonizing slowness, cutting through the air, enormous and overwhelming. My breath hitched, my body frozen in place as the ground seemed to shudder beneath me.

The hand wrapped around Mark, enclosing him completely. He didn‚Äôt scream, didn‚Äôt try to fight it. He just let it take him. I reached out instinctively, but it was too late and he was too far. It lifted him into the void, disappearing into the darkness above.

I had wanted to scream, to shout his name, but all I could do was stand there, trembling. Why had he left me here, alone? Why hadn‚Äôt he run? Why hadn‚Äôt he let me use the radio? Why hadn‚Äôt he let me talk to my sister?

When they disappeared again into the hole above us, the stars stopped flashing, the quantum radio stopped talking, and there, under the veil of the returned darkness, I cried.

I grabbed the silent radio.

She lives in the same city talked about normal stuffs. I like to do my things systematically so I have a checklist of the questions to be asked. The girl seemed to be interested in talking & where asking questions herself the conversation were flowing good & there was definitely a chemistry. We had different opinion around some things but nothing deal breaking as such or atleast I thought it to be deal breaker.

She complimented me on few of my achievements & I never felt she is off or not interested or giving lack luster replies she was typing big paragraphs & girls usually don't type long paras until & unless they are invested in the chat.

We talked for about a week & I was thinking to take her out on coffee on the weekend but suddenly she stopped mid way & then she never replied it's been 4 days now there is no contact after that.

I did asked her about her past relationships & she tried to deflect the question but that was like 3 days earlier & I never pushed on to that question. 

I am just clueless & kind of hurt. I again went through the conversation to find out the obvious sign of disagreement or where I said something disrespectful that changed the tone of the conversation but found nothing. it's was all good untill it's just died, like a heart attack.

Before fighting the anti-viruses, a loading screen with text that reads, ""Virus is moving to intercept..."" is seen. Now, you probably know where I'm going with this, but what if the message was actually talking about D-Co 9? It would have been really cool foreshadowing with the context of the text changing after knowing what happens. The reason why I'm saying this is a missed opportunity is because after defeating a virus it says, ""The virus has been purged,"" which is clearly referring to the anti-virus we fought.

(24F) (26M),"A month after my ex and I (24F) broke up from our long term relationship, I decided to get out of my apartment and meet new people. I spent the entire month rotting in bed, crying and extremely depressed. I was done feeling sorry for myself, I wanted to feel good again. I was not seeking sex or a relationship, just fun. I decided to go to a nearby club and drink and dance the night away. When I was there, I met a really nice guy (26M) who I ended up drinking and dancing with. We stayed there until the club closed and he asked for my number. Although I was very drunk, I remember smiling the entire night. I texted him the next morning to catch up for coffee. Our first date was spent hungover, drinking coffee and talking about the previous night. We got on so well we scheduled even more dates. After a week of seeing each other every day, I invited him over to my apartment for sex. It was so passionate and amazing. He spent the entire day and night at my home that day. It has now been 5 months since I met him and we made it official last week. I really love him, and he loves me. I feel like we are so compatible in so many ways.

She went to the ER with a bad back and UTI and we were all shell-shocked to arrive here.

She doesn't look or act much different than pre-diagnosis, which is confusing- not only to us as her family- but her, because other than being unable to drive due to her vision and reflexes, she looks the same as she did a decade ago. Sadly, she was/is addicted to pain pills which masked her pain / symptoms until they were overwhelming. I moved in with her a few years ago and although my mother and her sister are the ones who are primarily handling the situation, I've found the hospice staff is mainly looking at me, since I reside here and watch over her as best I can.

Because she's an addict (norco) and that's what she's been prescribed, she immediately wants to take more than I've been told to give her, but I know the nurses will count how many pills she has left. Will this be an issue at all? Do I let the hopsice staff know the situation? I have no idea how this works. Do I just give my grandmother what she's asking for?

She had been taking 3 norco a day (her chief complain is back pain), but when the hospice nurse visited, she said she could take 4 max daily. Immediately, my grandmother's eyes lit up- she was ecstatic to take more. But that night, she told me she wanted more than 4 a day. I said what the hospice nurse told me, ""If you need more than 4 norco a day, I'm supposed to start giving you the morphine they provided."" She didn't like that answer, became verbally abusive, then assured me we'd stick to what the hospice nurse told all of us, but by that next morning, she had taken 3 norco in 3 hours.

We called the hospice staff who said to stick to the plan and let her take 1 more norco in the evening, but to start with the morphine if the pain got worse (they also said if her pain is growing at that rapid pace, they might need to ""reassess her""),  so I did. She seemed to get drowsy and I decided to make a run to the grocery store during that time (my uncle is also here, although he has cognitive difficulties and limited in what he can do as far as checking on her well-being) and put gas in my car, along with get some coffee. When I returned about 1.5 hours later, my grandmother had clearly searched for the morphine and when she didn't find it, opened the comfort package stored in the refrigerator and was attempting to take that herself. She grew angry and berated me for putting it back and informing her that she could take it again, but at such-and-such time, when I was told to give it to her. She demanded I called the hospice staff, who said the same.

The issue with the morphine is that I've noticed she gets up more and walks around without a cane or walker and if she falls and has to go to the ER, she falls off hospice status. My aunt, who helped find pharmacies for her when she was drug-seeking, is pro-give-her-whatever-she wants. She's also very focused on getting my grandmother's POA and access to her financials. My mom is very much against that and more by the book and ""do exactly as the hospice staff instructs.""

I'm really new at this and regardless of what my mother and aunt say to my her while they're here at the house for a nice, brief visit, it's not the same experience that I get, as I live here and know what it's like when it's just us. Do I let her be verbally abusive to me because she's at the end of her life? Do I tell hospice staff when they come for their next visit?

1i07ykb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i07ykb/i_f22_reached_out_to_my_friend_after_3_years_of/,I (F22) reached out to my friend after 3 years of not talking (M23) and I'm not sure what he wants to do,"To start off, we were friends for roughly 2 to 3 years and really good friends for the final year we were in contact. We bonded over our backgrounds, upbringing, and how out of place we felt in our dead-end high school and town. He was a year older than me, he gave me a lot of academic support and advice, and I appreciated and admired him for that.

When he was around 19 or 20, he began asking women out on dates. I was with him the entire time, I was supportive, harbored no secret jealousy of the women, and never tried to sabotage his efforts. After every date, he would report back sad and frustrated. He was frustrated with their response or lack of response and because he felt insulted by them at times, he would insult them. Some of the things he said made sense, other things made me uncomfortable. I can't really give any examples since it's been so long. He also made misogynistic comments towards his one particular female friend who also started dating. I don't remember how I responded to him, but I don't think my responses really made him think about what he said.

Finally, what really got me was how he repeatedly made jokes about us dating and asked why we weren't dating. They didn't bother me at first, but I gradually I began thinking, ""wow, I am really a joke to him"" and it began to bother me. The next time he made the same ""why aren't we dating"" joke, I got fed up and told him in a hurtful/playful tone that 1) he was too mean to me, 2) he only liked certain women and 3) he has made weird comments about women. He was very hurt by that because he hung up and ignored me for a whole week. He tried to talk to me again and pretend that nothing happened, but I told him I needed to talk about it with him if we were still going to be friends. He said yes, but it happened over text and I didn't feel like anything really changed.

Afterwards, I decided to cut him off since I was really bothered by his statements towards women and how scared he was to have a serious conversation with me. I sent him a short note and blocked him. He emailed me a few days after telling me how I was wrong, how he was good friends with women, and how I was hypocritical due to my (one) dating history. He wrote the email as if I liked him and that I was hurt by how he rejected me, which made me mad because I never thought he liked me and I never hit on him. He ended it with how he wants me to reach out and how he hopes we can fix things between us. I did not reach out because I didn't know just how much of our friendship could be recovered and I didn't trust that he would be better even if we had a discussion. Although our town is small, I went to an out of state university so I did not have any issues running into him.

During those 3 years of not talking, he followed me on a social media platform that I didn't block him on, and I never reached out to him. Finally, after graduating and going back to my hometown, I decided to reach out to him because I miss our friendship (the majority of it was good), I wanted to see how much he's grown, and ultimately apologize for the manner in which I cut him off. I texted him to get a coffee, and he said he felt uncomfortable and that he hopes I can understand. I told him I didn't because he was following me, looking at my stories (and liked one of them), and that if he never wanted to talk, he should make it clear. He left me on seen, still follows me, and still views my stories. That happened in the fall. I was hopeful that he meant he would reach out when he's ready, but now I'm thinking the no response was his way to say he never wants to talk.

Does it mean anything that he's still following me?

TL;DR my friend of 2 years started going into the dating scene and his comments towards women began bothering me, he also made jokes about why we weren't dating that I didn't like. I cut him off after he refused to have a discussion and he sent me an email telling me how I was wrong and that I liked him and he wanted to spare my feelings. I reached out to him after 3 years, but he doesn't want to talk, except still follows me and views my stories. What does this mean?",2,1736749904.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

About two years ago, I had a life-changing experience during sleep paralysis. By then, I had already studied a lot about astral projection (AP) and knew it could be triggered from sleep paralysis if I stayed calm and relaxed. Instead of trying to wake up like I usually did, I decided to use this opportunity to attempt AP.

At the time, I had strong feelings for someone I‚Äôd been talking to for years. She lived overseas, on another continent, and I deeply wanted to connect with her on a more personal level. My intention during this AP was to see her and express how I felt.

Before starting, I called upon my guardian angels for protection, then focused on separating my astral body from my physical body. I visualized myself rising, and after a few moments, I felt an intense energy‚Äîlike static‚Äîsurrounding me. Suddenly, I was in a dark tunnel that seemed to stretch infinitely across the universe.

I intensified my intention, focusing entirely on her. The tunnel moved quickly, and in no time, I found myself in an old house filled with mirrors. I tried to see my reflection but it was blurry. When I looked at my hands, they appeared distorted and bubbly‚Äîan unmistakable sign I was astral projecting.

I knew I was close. Eventually, I found her trying on shoes. I approached her and managed to speak. I told her I wanted to get to know her better and asked if she‚Äôd like to grab a coffee sometime, keeping things respectful since I knew she had a boyfriend. To my surprise, we ended up hugging and even kissing. I felt it was time to return, so I asked my spirit guides to guide me back. Slowly, I re-entered my body, fully aware that I‚Äôd just had an extraordinary AP experience.

The real shock came a few hours later. While going about my day, I received a voice message from her. Normally, it would take her days or even weeks to reply due to her busy schedule. But this time, she told me she was in my country visiting her family‚Äîsomething she hadn‚Äôt mentioned before and hadn‚Äôt posted about on social media. What blew my mind even more was when she said: ‚ÄúMaybe we could grab a coffee?‚Äù üò±

We ended up meeting in person for coffee after a couple of weeks (we were in different states so I had to arrange a travel plan).

I‚Äôve had other AP experiences since then, but nothing has matched the magic of that first one.


---

TL;DR: I astral-projected to visit my crush who lived overseas. I asked her during the AP if she‚Äôd like to grab coffee. The next day, she sent me a voice message saying she was in my country and invited me for coffee. ",14,1736749832.0,AstralProjection,3,0.94,False

I am an early 20's femme in a STEM field at an R1. I am a full-time instructor and on a promotion track - I am not adjunct. I mostly teach graduate courses. I graduated from this university in a program similar to the one I am teaching (and I recognize some of my students.) 

I am really, really struggling to make friends. I feel that my situation is pretty unique for my age, and I've looked in a lot of areas at my own University to find other young professors (with no luck). In the past (through COVID, graduate school, etc.), I've used apps, events, or other friends to meet new people. My problem now is that: 

1. I am terrified of apps because of the connotation with them, and I am scared of the risk of matching with an undergraduate student by accident (or a future graduate student!) Whether you've used apps before or not is irrelevant - I have, I've made great friends, I am scared to use them now. I would have to set my search age a few years above my own to feel any sort of comfortable using one again.

2. I am scared of running into a student at an event. I do not want rumors of what I do at night to go around the department because the places I would go are places people my age are at (the singular gay bar, for example) 

3. My friends all recently graduated too, and all have moved back home.

4. I am the youngest in my department by quite a bit. In grad school, I had my peers. Now.... I have my partner and our three cats. University coffee hours, bookclubs, club-clubs, etc: everyone is much older. 

I don't want to sound like I hate my job: I love it. I feel incredibly blessed to be this age and have this position. I am excelling in all other aspects. I also have older friends, but I cannot relate to many of them in the way I am seeking. 

I didn't forsee the fear of socialization that would come with it, though. I fear this is something that will get better with time, but I am hoping there is at least one other early 20's, full-time instructor (of some kind) out here that's felt similar and can tell me I'm worried about nothing. I'd still like to hear from you if you can't relate to everything, too  :) ",4,1736749757.0,Professors,3,0.75,False

Need some advice here
25M, been married for 5 months with my wife and dated her for 3 years prior.
She‚Äôs currently a few months pregnant as well.
Ever since we‚Äôve gotten married she has been extremely tough on me going out with my friends even for a coffee or for drinks on a Friday-Saturday night.
I always bring her out with me when I do go for drinks with them because I feel bad to leave her home.
She doesn‚Äôt work and stays at home Monday-Friday
It‚Äôs become a growing issue between us where she feels that I can‚Äôt leave to hang out with my friends without her being present- yet she also does not want to go out.
I feel as if I‚Äôm being locked in a box.
I try to talk to her about this but she says she is pregnant and that I should stay at home as a result.
I get her point, I really do, but I‚Äôm the breadwinner of the house and she really hasn‚Äôt been as active of a homemaker lately- which is fine considering she‚Äôs pregnant. 
I don‚Äôt like feeling controlled especially when I give my all in terms of effort to my partner.
Whenever I say ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs go hang out with my friends‚Äù it‚Äôs always ‚ÄúOh your buddies are so important to you, you should have married them‚Äù etc.
It‚Äôs getting to a point where all I do on the weekends is just stay inside and feel trapped.
This also causes a lot of arguments between us where she often ends up ignoring me for hours.

I‚Äôm worried that this is going to become a growing issue.
I do it all for her and my future daughter yet I feel like I am constantly getting the short end of the stick.

While dropping them off she would meet up with the rest of the PTA moms to catch up on things. It was usually gossip or what the next fundraiser goal would be and who would be baking what.

¬†

‚ÄúBy the way Suzie.‚Äù Her childhood friend Helen spoke up getting her attention since she had been zoning out during the whole conversation that always seemed to leave her out every time.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Susan cleared her throat and looked up from her thermos of now cold coffee.

‚ÄúWell, my next-door neighbor the one with the tesla. She offered for us to join their book club. Apparently, they found this book that has never been released to the public before.‚Äù Helen twirled a blond curl around her index finger as she spoke looking at each one of them trying to see if anyone was interested but they declined.

¬†

Susan frowned seeing the disappointment on her friends face and placed a hand on her shoulder ‚ÄúI‚Äôll join it with. I have some free time when Tom comes home from work so he can watch the kids for at least a little while.‚Äù

¬†

Helen‚Äôs bright eyes light up ‚ÄúThank you Suzie. I knew I could count on you.‚Äù

¬†

She nodded and proceeded to leave the school and head home for the day. Susan went about her day doing her daily chores and planning out what to make for dinners that week since she usually packed leftovers for lunches. When Tom came home with the kids, she walked up to him giving him a big hug and asking how his day went.

¬†

He gave her a tired nod and his usual *it was work* response. Susan smiled and held his hand for a short while before he went to go shower and sit down to dinner with his family. During that time, she would bring up the book club.

¬†

‚ÄúHelen asked if I would join a book club with her.‚Äù Susan casually brought up poking her fork into the green beans on her plate. Tom tilted his head to the side chewing a bit of meatloaf before responding ‚ÄúThe blond? I honestly didn‚Äôt think she had ever picked up a book before.‚Äù

¬†

The children snickered and his wife pouted ‚ÄúThomas.‚Äù She scolded and he shrugged taking another bite before sipping his drink. He always disliked Helen ever since they had met back in high school when she had introduced Tom as her boyfriend back then. Tom told Susan that Helen was clingy and always got her into some type of trouble.

¬†

‚ÄúIf you want to go, I don‚Äôt mind watching the kids for a while.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

¬†

Tom nodded and finished his meal gathering up the empty plates to wash them in the kitchen. The following day Susan met up with Helen to walk over to her next-door neighbor‚Äôs house. A woman with dark slicked back hair tied into high ponytail answered the door ‚ÄúHelen it‚Äôs so good to see you.‚Äù She greeted with a smiled and it faded when she looked at Susan ‚ÄúOh you brought a friend with you.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIs that okay? I‚Äôm sorry I should have asked.‚Äù Helen pouted and the woman brushed it off.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *perfectly* fine the more the merrier.‚Äù The woman muttered and looked at Susan with a forced smile ‚ÄúWelcome to the book club.‚Äù Susan shuddered at the look this woman was giving her and knew that she defiantly did not want her here. Helen gave her a reassuring look and led the way inside where they joined a few other women in the living room.

¬†

‚ÄúEveryone this is Helen an-‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSusan Grayson.‚Äù

¬†

The woman sighed and rolled her eyes ‚ÄúMrs. Grayson.‚Äù

¬†

Some greeted her while others ignored her and put their attention on Helen. Susan was used to being ignored but this felt off. Yeah, she was used Helen getting all the attention wherever they went but they seemed obsessed with her for some reason. Could this book club be some sort of guise to cover up a cult?

¬†

‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs begin reading from the book.‚Äù the leader of the book club began taking out a leather-bound tome. The front was scarred and cracked a lock on its surface long broken and forgotten. When she opened it the tomes pages were yellowed and brittle filling the room with scents of dust and decay.

¬†

She sat upright with a smile on her face reading aloud in an unknown language. It didn‚Äôt appear to be *latin* nor anything she had ever heard before. A few of the other women clapped their hands and saying something which was probably roughly similar to an *amen.* Helen tilted her head and clapped along with them before speaking up.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the translation?‚Äù

¬†

The woman looked up from the book in her hands to the blond and smiled ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a translation to know what the words mean Helen. If you close your eyes and open your heart you can feel them. You can hear *his* voice speaking directly to your mind.‚Äù She smiled and her eyes locked on Helen‚Äôs.

¬†

‚ÄúWho is he? You said that you can hear *his* voice.‚Äù Susan spoke up causing the others to look at her. The woman closed the book, and a look of disgust spread across her face ‚ÄúYou have just joined us and yet you dare as what his name is? First you must prove yourself before we will ever allow you to utter his name.‚Äù

¬†

*Prove myself? We just joined today‚Ä¶* Susan though to herself raising an eyebrow inquisitively.

¬†

The woman held her head high and looked away from her eyes settling on the group.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dismissed for today. Please return next weekend for another reading.‚Äù

¬†

As Helen and Susan left together and out of ear shot, she spoke up ‚ÄúThere is something wrong with that book club.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre just imagining things.‚Äù Helen brushed her off with a sigh.

¬†

‚ÄúHelen, I‚Äôm telling you those people are a cult.‚Äù

¬†

The blond stood in her tracks looking at her childhood friend ‚ÄúSusan.‚Äù Her voice was stern, and her arms crossed in front of her ‚ÄúIf you keep saying such things weird rumors will start to spread and innocent people will get hurt. So why don‚Äôt you keep it to yourself.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBut Helen‚Ä¶I‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúEnough Susan!‚Äù

¬†

The blond turned on her heel ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you next weekend.‚Äù

¬†

Without another word she went inside her house leaving Susan completely alone. She needed to stop this but how could she? Helen didn‚Äôt believe her. She thought that it was just some gimmick to get people to join the book club. How could she prove that they bad people?

¬†

Susan could just leave Helen alone with those people and quit but her conscious wouldn‚Äôt allow her to do so. She would just have to continue to attend and find proof of what is going on between the lines that Helen is too oblivious to see. When the weekend rolled around Susan was running a bit behind and arrived late at the club meeting. She reached out a hand to knock on the door only to find it slightly ajar.

¬†

Curious Susan pushed the door open with her foot and stepped inside. The entrance was dimly lit and void of any life. Gently shutting the door behind her she continued further inside squinting her eyes to see better in the darkness.

¬†

*Thump‚Ä¶scrrape‚Ä¶thump*

¬†

Was that sound from the basement? Next to the stairs was an open door with a red light spilling out across the floor and walls. Taking a deep breath Susan exhaled slowly taking her time walking down the stairs where she found herself in an open room with a sacrificial altar in the middle. On top of it was Helen dressed in white robes with her eyes closed. She slowly made her way over gently shaking her childhood friend.

¬†

‚ÄúHelen!‚Äù Susan spoke in an intense whisper glancing around them.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late Mrs. Grayson.‚Äù

¬†

Susan turned seeing the woman with the slicked back dark hair in a high bun. She turned to face her brows knitting in a furrowed expression. Susan clenched her hands into fists down at her sides. What had they done to Helen?

¬†

‚ÄúWhat did you do to her?!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMy Mrs. Grayson I didn‚Äôt know you were cable of such anger. I thought we were doing you a favor.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúDoing me a favor? Helen is my best friend why would I want anything to happen to her?‚Äù

¬†

The woman tsk‚Äôd and walked up to the altar ‚ÄúEither way you‚Äôre too late. She won‚Äôt wake up until the ritual is over. Why don‚Äôt you *finish* it for us?‚Äù she turned to Susan handing over a yellowed page ‚ÄúAll you have to do is read the words on the page.‚Äù

She held the page in her hand looking at the ancient dialect before her. Finish it? No Susan wasn‚Äôt going to do that was she? Before she knew it her lips moved on their own speaking out loud the words which were foreign to her. Helen began to cough her eyes opening their usual light color turning pitch black completely engulfing even the sclera. The coughing became worse and then the gargling started as Helen spat up blood.

¬†

The sound of bone and flesh being torn and cracked filled the air and when Susan looked down, she gasped almost bumping into one of the members who held her by the shoulders.

¬†

‚ÄúWatch with us Susan and gaze upon *his* arrival!‚Äù the woman raised her arms in the air.

¬†

They chanted a name something which came out in gibberish when it was spoken.

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

Just in the world was ~~Volgroan~~? As Susan questioned this she watched as a creature crawled its way out of Helen‚Äôs broken open rib cage. It moved and writhed its blood drenched body out of the broken body under it. She looked up at it frozen in fear.

¬†

The creature‚Äôs body was a blend of corded muscle and jagged bloodstone. Its eyes burned like molten embers flickering like fire. Hooked horns curve downwards from its skull, its clawed hands drip with blood. When it roared the sound was a symphony of death itself echoing off the walls.

¬†

Whatever this *thing* was filled Susan with dread and now she had released it onto the world.",3,1736749284.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

On top of it was Helen dressed in white robes with her eyes closed. She slowly made her way over gently shaking her childhood friend.

¬†

‚ÄúHelen!‚Äù Susan spoke in an intense whisper glancing around them.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late Mrs. Grayson.‚Äù

¬†

Susan turned seeing the woman with the slicked back dark hair in a high bun. She turned to face her brows knitting in a furrowed expression. Susan clenched her hands into fists down at her sides. What had they done to Helen?

¬†

‚ÄúWhat did you do to her?!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMy Mrs. Grayson I didn‚Äôt know you were cable of such anger. I thought we were doing you a favor.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúDoing me a favor? Helen is my best friend why would I want anything to happen to her?‚Äù

¬†

The woman tsk‚Äôd and walked up to the altar ‚ÄúEither way you‚Äôre too late. She won‚Äôt wake up until the ritual is over. Why don‚Äôt you *finish* it for us?‚Äù she turned to Susan handing over a yellowed page ‚ÄúAll you have to do is read the words on the page.‚Äù

She held the page in her hand looking at the ancient dialect before her. Finish it? No Susan wasn‚Äôt going to do that was she? Before she knew it her lips moved on their own speaking out loud the words which were foreign to her. Helen began to cough her eyes opening their usual light color turning pitch black completely engulfing even the sclera. The coughing became worse and then the gargling started as Helen spat up blood.

¬†

The sound of bone and flesh being torn and cracked filled the air and when Susan looked down, she gasped almost bumping into one of the members who held her by the shoulders.

¬†

‚ÄúWatch with us Susan and gaze upon *his* arrival!‚Äù the woman raised her arms in the air.

¬†

They chanted a name something which came out in gibberish when it was spoken.

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú~~Volgroan~~‚Äù

¬†

Just in the world was ~~Volgroan~~? As Susan questioned this she watched as a creature crawled its way out of Helen‚Äôs broken open rib cage. It moved and writhed its blood drenched body out of the broken body under it. She looked up at it frozen in fear.

¬†

The creature‚Äôs body was a blend of corded muscle and jagged bloodstone. Its eyes burned like molten embers flickering like fire. Hooked horns curve downwards from its skull, its clawed hands drip with blood. When it roared the sound was a symphony of death itself echoing off the walls.

¬†

Whatever this *thing* was filled Susan with dread and now she had released it onto the world.",3,1736749102.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
