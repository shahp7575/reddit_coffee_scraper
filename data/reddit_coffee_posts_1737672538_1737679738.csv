I‚Äôm interested in making tea lattes at home (and possibly on a larger scale in the future), which require strong tea shots. I‚Äôve noticed that some bubble tea shops, like Chi Cha San Chen, use machines specifically designed for tea extraction, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to use a standard coffee espresso machine instead.

Here are my main questions:
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone successfully used a coffee espresso machine to brew tea shots? How did you adjust the temperature and timing for the tea type?
	‚Ä¢	Are there risks of damaging a machine designed for coffee when brewing tea (e.g., clogging or wear and tear)?
	‚Ä¢	Would it be better to invest in a tea-specific machine, and are there any affordable options you‚Äôd recommend?

I‚Äôm looking for clarity because I don‚Äôt want to invest in an expensive machine without being sure it will work for tea shots. I‚Äôd love to hear any advice, tips, or experiences!

Thanks so much!",1,1737679663.0,tea,0,1.0,False

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England. And yes, I made a dating site for myself.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

I‚Äôve been featured on the news here in the area.

I would think you should do dates at least 1-2 times before getting intimate. 

He said he wants to meet in public and go for a walk, maybe go to a Starbucks as we aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious. But I wanted to go to a nice restaurant too which he refused. 

He says he just wants me to go to his and he can ‚Äúcook for me‚Äù like that‚Äôs gross I don‚Äôt even know him and I don‚Äôt eat strangers foods who knows what he can put in there

1i8iyhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Botdog/comments/1i8iyhu/your_linkedin_content_strategy_to_drive_sales_in/,Your LinkedIn content strategy to drive sales in 2025 (what's working for our top Botdog users),"Hey r/Botdog users!

I've been chatting with a lot of you recently, as well as following some of you on LinkedIn and looking at your strategies. I also read all 123 pages of [Richard Van Der Blom's LinkedIn Algorithm Report](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardvanderblom_algorithm-insights-2024-report-v10-activity-7160527422398844928-VnlE/) (if you're serious about LinkedIn, it's worth the read - most numbers in this post come from there). Thought I'd share what I've learned, because it's mostly always the same basic advice again and again (it's also inspired from one of our [recent blog posts](https://www.botdog.co/blog-posts/how-to-generate-more-leads-on-linkedin-in-2025-a-complete-guide))

In 2025, if you're in B2B (and increasingly B2C), you're dead without a LinkedIn strategy. It doesn't mean that LinkedIn will drive all your revenue, but you need to have a strategy. Then the results will be proportionate to your effort: if you invest $100/month in tools (cost of LinkedIn Sales Navigator + Botdog) and a few hours here and there, you'll get a few results (mostly the low hanging fruits). Maybe a 10X return on your investment, maybe a few deals per month. 

If you spend 10 hours per week, you'll see a bigger return.

After all, sales is competitive and most big opportunities are immediately arbitraged away :) 

Anyway, here's what actually works to drive sales on LinkedIn:

**Get a paid LinkedIn subscription** (premium or sales navigator) and **max out your weekly connections** (\~150 per week). 

* You can do this manually, or use a LinkedIn automation tool like Botdog (or one of our competitors). Do this, and you'll get an additional 4,000 connections by the end of the year. No quick hack, just slowly building out a valuable asset. Remember: your invitation quote doesn't roll over, so every week that you don't send invites and it's lost forever. 

**Write content to nurture your connections.** 

* Think of it as a newsletter that they didn't even know they subscribed to. Don't aim for viral posts. The people driving actual sales write long-form (1,800-2,000 characters) that solve real problems. Quick heads up: LinkedIn's algorithm hates ChatGPT content. We see 30% reach drops when people just copy-paste. People probably hate it too tbh. Focus on adding value to your audience, and display your expertise. 
* Start with 1-2 posts a week, maybe on stuff you've experienced with your clients. Ideal frequency is 5+ per week. 
* You can use Lead Magnets (Comment ""Interested"" to receive my document!), they're super annoying but it works to drive engagement
* Add images occasionally: +20% reach, but no more than 3 image posts in a row
* Just Connecting's report shows prospects are 70% more likely to see your future content after they've replied to a message, so consistently messaging your prospects (NOT PUSHING YOUR PRODUCT, don't be too insistant) while make you stay top of mind.

**Start conversations.**

* When someone engages with your post, reach out to them. Thank them, ask them questions, engage in a conversation. You can do this manually, or automate. 
* Same thing in the comments section, try and start a conversation. Ask people to share their opinions.
* Comment on 5-10 relevant posts when your post your own (15+ words, avoid ""great post!"", it's filtered out by the algorithm), this will increase your reach

**Take your time and stop overthinking**

* This is very counter-intuitive, but people who see the best results from Botdog are those who take their time. If you're connecting with a person and immediately try to close them on a call, you'll lose them. You first have to start a conversation, get familiar with them. It doesn't mean waiting for 3 years, sometimes a few weeks is all it takes. 
* Forget ""best times to post"" - think about YOUR prospects. Are they (like most people) checking LinkedIn during morning coffee or Lunch break? Then this is when you should post.
* It's not about going viral. It's about becoming a familiar face in your prospects' feed. When they see your content regularly, cold calls turn warm naturally.
* Try to constantly optimize and improve, every week. Small, marginal gains. Try to get a new profile picture, that looks more legit (about that: most AI-generated pictures look very weird and uncanny, it's probably best to use a simple iPhone picture that looks natural). Play with a few different headlines. Improve your profile description. Just: you don't have to do this from the start. 
* The beauty of LinkedIn is that you can measure everything (and use Botdog to measure what's missing in LinkedIn, like connection rate). Look at your post analytics, see which headlines get more clicks, which topics drive more engagement. Your month 3 content will be way better than month 1, and that's the point.
* Fun fact: only 7.1% of LinkedIn's billion users post quarterly. Just doing the basics puts you ahead.

She and I are both regulars at a coffee shop. Every day, we get coffee together and we chat with each other when waiting in line. 

I (30M) was always shy and nervous when talking to women. I never asked anyone out. I decided that one day, I need to get over my fear of rejection and just do it. I need to get over my fears and shyness. I knew she already had a boyfriend because I see him waiting for her outside the shop sometimes. But she never mentioned a boyfriend to me, so (I think) she doesn't know that I know.

A few days ago, I asked her out and she rejected me. She told me that she already had a boyfriend. I said ok and moved on with my life. I told some friends and coworkers about this. Some of them were supportive, but others were telling me that I'm an asshole for asking. I made her reject me and put her in an uncomfortable situation. They also talk about women who are murdered for rejecting men, and they said that I made her fear for her life.

I don't think that's reasonable. Even though I got rejected, I still think this is a huge accomplishment for me because at least I overcame my shyness and asked a woman out. I don't think that merely asking is an assholeish thing to do. Yes, women do get murdered for rejecting men. But you can't just assume the worst from everyone. ",1,1737679437.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1i8ik4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1i8ik4e/how_is_he_poisoning_us/,How is he poisoning us?,"We‚Äôve been trapped in a living nightmare. My flatmate and I are convinced one of our other flatmates has been tampering with our food. It‚Äôs impossible to prove, though I‚Äôve caught him lurking around my things before. When we tried reporting it to the police, they brushed us off like it wasn‚Äôt serious.

The signs started stacking up. I found mouldy bread shoved into my fridge section‚Äîrock solid and covered in green, even though I‚Äôd recently cleaned everything and replaced it with fresh food. Then, there were spices hidden at the back of my shelf, infested with worms. These weren‚Äôt even mine; they appeared out of nowhere, as if planted there. And something was in our coffee.. We did our best to avoid eating at home or to carefully check everything, but it was impossible do all the time.

Our health spiralled. I had stomach pain so sharp it felt like swallowing razors. I lost weight, my nails started breaking, my tongue constantly burned, and I completely lost my appetite. My hormones are a mess‚Äîsomething‚Äôs not right. My flatmate had it worse: rapid weight loss, no energy, no mood, and he literally lost teeth. It got so bad he ended up in hospital‚Äîvomiting uncontrollably, dehydrated to the point of collapse. The doctors said he had food poisoning so severe it caused internal bleeding.

What makes it worse is the guy‚Äôs smugness about it all. He‚Äôd laugh, make comments like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so skinny, you should eat more,‚Äù with this creepy grin. Before I moved in, he isolated my flatmate completely‚Äîspread rumours, made him doubt everything.

We even tried setting up cameras to protect ourselves, but he retaliated by putting up his own, with sound recording. The pressure of being watched all the time forced us to take ours down. It feels like he‚Äôs always one step ahead, playing mind games.

We‚Äôre moving out soon, planning full blood tests and detoxing, but we can‚Äôt shake the question: what the hell did this guy do to us?",0,1737678337.0,badroommates,3,0.5,False

1i8ie2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/1i8ie2u/headed_for_a_confrontation_with_my_mom/,Headed for a confrontation with my mom,"First off, a quick update.

I posted here back before Christmas that I was terrified of going to my cousins' place for the holiday because I thought I'd lose my temper.  I went anyway.  It ended up being probably one of the most enjoyable, emotional holidays ever.  I found out that this was the first time EVER that we were all at the same house for Christmas.

My cousin did show up in a Trump t-shirt that said ""Daddy's Home"" just to irk me, but we just had a quick laugh and that was it.  I bit my tongue the rest of the trip.

  
My mom has been buying me precious metals and survival supplies for years.  She took me to an Evangelical church from the age of 5.  I stopped going in my mid-twenties, but still practice privately.  Over the years we grew apart politically, and I'm now very much a liberal.  She understands this, and as a result of some heated phone calls in the past, we don't discuss politics any more.

The last time I was at her house (other side of the country) I noticed a copy of the Epoch Times on her coffee table.  She also gets her news from Fox News, The Blaze, and I think Newsmax.  I've noticed her opinions and general mood getting steadily more and more ""out there"".  Just today she texted me a video from Rumble.

Recently, on a phone call, she asked me to take cash out of the bank, and keep extra non-perishables on hand.  She thinks the economy is going to collapse, and food will be difficult to find for a while.

What I think is happening is, whoever she's listening to, is getting her ready to accept the collapse that will be caused by Trump's tariffs and deportations, and conditioning her to blame it on anyone BUT him.  It's very sinister, and I'm tempted to get her on the phone to have maybe one more political conversation.  List off everything Trump has done in just the last few days, tell here where I think this is headed, and how concerned I am about her mental state and where she gets her info from.

My stepdad is even further gone than her, and I'm sure her friends at church aren't helping.  It just feels like something I need to let out for some closure.  She's being led down a dark path, and I don't want to be saying there's more I could have done.

Just looking for advice on how to do that, or if I even should.  Every time we've talked politics in the past, it's devolved into shouting, but I THINK I can keep myself centered.  Especially knowing that she's probably a lost cause anyway.",2,1737677864.0,QAnonCasualties,3,1.0,False

1i8i9rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1i8i9rq/dpdr_made_me_a_better_person/,DPDR made me a better person,"This is mainly for those with weed-induced dpdr...but I'm sure others could maybe find it helpful too!

Whoever's going through this, I know it's genuinely the scariest thing ever and there is light at the end of the tunnel. You probably look at yourself in the mirror at night and don't recognize the face staring back. You probably look at your world distorted and can't seem to stop. You've realized what a bizarre experience life is. It genuinely destroyed my life, but brought me back as a better self with a better life. 

I got it about a year ago from a bad weed trip and I was in pure agony for the many months to follow. It would get so bad that sometimes I would debate just going insane and screaming in the street. I mean this truly made me realize why people go insane. I could hardly look at myself. Everything was distorted. I would stare at things like trees in pure horror. I would think about peoples insides and look at everyone like wild animals. Crows would scare the shit out of me. I went to therapy for it that ended up making it worse, I got on medication that didn't work, I tried finding God, and listening to podcasts, I tried getting into the gym, I tried everything to get rid of this horrible horrible thing. I could barely do anything at all other than lie in bed under my sheets in fear. I could hardly pay attention without thinking about how nothing matters and how we're all on a rock in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't have fun without being in total fear.

Then I watched this video with a guy saying that you just need to forget about this crap and live your life. I'll try to link it in the comments. This is when I started finding new hobbies that made me happy. I started not giving a fuck because the only thing feeding your fears is your mind's blind response to trouble that literally isn't there. I stopped doing things because I had to, and started doing things because I wanted to. I got into EMDR therapy and realized that the root of all of this was anxiety and trauma...and EMDR really fucking works. A big part of it for me that I was dealing with was transitions and the idea of something never being the same again. Or something being worse than it was. Simple things like driving in the car, walking from point a to b, flying on planes, falling asleep, any major or minor life change, etc. Would freak me the hell out.That transition from who I was and who I am on my bad weed trip freaks me out. The idea of aging and dying freaks me out.

Truth of the matter was this weed trip didn't change me, I was always this way...I was just keeping it locked up and avoiding it. It all spilled out and I had to face who I was and I didn't like what I saw. I started doing art like I used to when I was younger, drinking less, cooking, focusing on me rather than trying to make others happy, doing pilates, trying new things everyday, daily journaling, building legos, getting of this subreddit, taking vitamins and getting on a good diet. I even became a vegetarian! It really is an exciting time despite the scariness of it...it's almost like being a kid again in an unfamiliar land and having to relearn a bunch of stuff. But you get to decide who you want to be now! You don't have to copy the stuff old you used to like! It's good to stay in tune with old you, but keep the great stuff and remove the garbage. It's such a fertile period of discovery and growth, and it's pretty fun the more you get into it.

Something that also really helped me was getting into tune with my spirituality. I always have had trouble believing in religion because of what I've been through...but researching scientists who are religious helped me a lot. Realizing that science is just as unknown as everything else in the universe helped me a lot. Fact of the matter is, we don't know what's going on. And it doesn't really matter because we won't know. Fact of the matter is, we're stuck here and that is that. What are you gonna do about it? You can't do anything. I like to tell myself that this is all just magic, and frankly I got a pretty incredible deal as a human rather than a squirrel or something.

It was certainly a process. But I'm a better, more full human being because of all of the work I did. You have And although I'm still getting through the hopefully near end of this (no it isn't bad, you just have to know how to turn it off), I respect the person I am now much more than the person I was before the weed trip. Frankly, I was a mess waiting to happen and I'm glad a shitty weed trip made me realize that.

So get off this subreddit and start living! You're gonna be okay! Just put in the work towards making yourself better than you were before this mess. Listen to what you want and what you want to make out of your life! You're still the same person you have always been. You're just traumatized and need to heal. Remember where you are in the present. You're not crazy, and you're real. If you were crazy, you wouldn't know. Just breathe. It isn't serious.

Also some pro tips that helped me: cut out the coffee, and switch to tea. If you get fearful, take a strong mint.",1,1737677524.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

At first I thought it was a personality trait or something I do but it is so consistent and frequent that I'm pretty sure it's just ocd!
I can only explain it with an example: Say you ask me to grab you a spoon. Very straight-forward task. I will diligently look for the spoon on the cupboards, drawers and sink; and if I can't find a spoon there I will tell you, sincerely, that we have no spoons. Thing is, there might be 9364 spoons sitting at the table the whole time I'm in the kitchen looking for spoons, but my brain will simply ignore them because that's not a spoon place!
I work in a coffee shop/bookstore, and I am a MENACE at work because someone will ask me for the blender and I will be so confused because we lost the blender, only for someone to point out it's just be slightly to the right of where I'm used to.

I'm a woman in my early 30's and moved to San Marcos a few months ago. I knew it was a college town before moving, but I'm still struggling to find my scene.

I like alternative music, coffee, yoga, video games, reading, pickleball, and spooky shit. I also work a job that's got me passed out by 8:30 every night on weekdays (I see a lot of cool stuff on the calendar at the Porch/Taproom, but uhhh I'm old and sleepy). I've hit up Triple 6 a few times, Wake the Dead, and Wild Rice. One of my friends' band played at The Porch last weekend, so I've been exploring a few locations, but I'm definitely open to more suggestions. 

Anyway, anyone who has any similar interests or just wants to make friends, please reach out! Or use this post as a way to share your interests and find someone you can jam with. ",7,1737677502.0,sanmarcos,4,1.0,False

Things have been great. He loves me, he is kind, always finds time for me etc etc. Anyway we started college a few months ago and he told me that he met a girl who was part of his rock climbing club. Normaly when he tells me stuff like this i get really sad because I'm honestly an insecure girl and I compare myself to every girl my BF talks with. But anyway after a few minutes I calmed myself and told myself ""ok calm down he's loyal, it doesnt matter that she is prettier or more athletic, he chose YOU"". Anyway after some time i forgot about that girl until yesterday. My bf out of nowhere told me that he had something ""funny"" to tell me. He told me that he met this girl again infront of their college building after finishing their midterms and they were talking about their classes. After finishing talking my BF asked her to go out on a coffee some day with him. When he told me this I was so confused because before starting college he said that he doesnt want female friends and would never go out with a female alone. This was all so random. I asked him ""wait, YOU asked her to go out for a coffee?"" And he was like ""Yeah but ofc in a friendly manner"". By this point I was already getting uneasy. Then he told me he texted her THE SAME DAY they were talking about going out. But apperantly she left him on delivered and didnt bother to respond. Then he laughed and said ""Can you imagine she left me on read?"" 
Ok so there are a few things that bother me about this. 
Firstly, the only person in the whole college who he asked to go for a coffee was this girl. For the record he has male collegues, who he talks to EVERYDAY, yet never went out with them, but still had the courage to ask this girl out who he only talked to like 2 times.
Secondly, he has told me time and time again how he wouldnt go out of the way to find female friends, now he decides to do a 180 for a person he spoke to twice? 
Thirdly, he admitted he didnt want to tell me about the encounter because he knew I was goong to be sad. That made me feel the lowest to be honest.
I told him if he is developing feelings for this girl he should tell me and then he started saying how im the kindest girl in the world and how I only make him feel safe. But, what if she's like that also? Also she is much more prettier than me. He also has a history of developing feelings for girls quickly. He also told me the only girl he would ever go out alone is with a girl who he is attracted to...
I really dont know how to process this or wether im being dramatic. Any advice?",1,1737677496.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

If I make it more course and try and down to 30 seconds is it just natural that the double shot will be a lot more water than as if it was 10 seconds? I get it that more water is pouring for longer I'm just worried that it will be excessive water in the coffee and the flavour won't be as strong.

In fact the primary source of it's unique metabolic effects is 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, typically found in higher quantities in fenugreek than trigonelline, and is unique to fenugreek (unlike trigonelline which is found in larger quantities in certain types of coffee beans).

I hear that it's likely that unless specifically removed a standardization to trigonelline is likely to keep a proportional amount of 4-Hydroxyisoleucine (which is typically present in a range of 1/1 to 4/1 ratio 4-Hydroxyisoleucine/trigonelline in fenugreek seeds), but with ND's lab it should be verifiable.

I don't have a way to prove it, but my intuition says this is just as important if not more important to fenugreeks effects as compared to trigonelline if the ratio is maintained in the extract (apparently quite probable) I think it would also be quite amusing for trigonelline to mask 4-Hydroxyisoleucine through being associated with stronger extracts.

I have been in Love once, it didn‚Äôt work out and no I‚Äôm not still longing for THAT relationship, but the feelings were love at the time, let‚Äôs call him Steve. Steve turned out to be a total Narc hence I don‚Äôt want to rekindle although I did love him, sadly. Towards the end of that relationship, I met (or he met me) a guy at work who took a real liking to me and we went for a movies and coffee date in 2022 - let‚Äôs call him Dave. I had and still have nothing negative to say about Dave but I was honest with him that I felt it was just friends. He took it well etc we moved on. 

Few weeks ago I get a happy new year I been thinking of you since then message from Dave and I reply politely, but with nothing to spark an ongoing chat. He replies anyways and few weeks on we met and he basically paid for dinner etc and I feel he wanted to make it very clear that for him, it was a date. He also made it very clear he takes me very seriously for marriage and said he wouldn‚Äôt expect sex while exploring this possibility. He is smart, he is clean and well dressed, he has real businesses start up plans for next year and already has a good paying job. He is from a country the men pay for house. End of - he also made that very clear while knowing and being encouraging of my ambitions (I make good money myself). You all know it‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶.i just don‚Äôt FEEL anything. Nothing.

I‚Äôm reflecting on the night now and the things I was saying to him while he was basically declaring his love for me‚Ä¶.remind me of how men keep women on the back burner until he meets the woman he really wants. I said how would you feel if I still networked with other men during the get to know you period? Like not shagging people, just chatting üòÜü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è then I said right now I‚Äôm not sure ü§î how would you feel if in 3 months I‚Äôm just not feeling it? Etc because these are my genuine questions right now.  I genuinely like being single and like I said make good money, I have no need or want to use a man to better myself or help me out.

He can go a whole day or two without talking to me** ,I don‚Äôt need him to talk to me all day. I just atleast want a goodnight and good morning text. And the thing is sometimes, he dosent even do both of those and can go a whole 24 hours.

Went to buy a bunch of construction equipment i.e. pressure washers, paint sprayers, etc. from a local company going out of business today. My total was at $1700 and while I was leaving saw a rack with audio equipment and offered $300 to my bill and they accepted. Got everything pictured. Main items im excited about is the SX-1250, and the Hitachi turntable. Might keep the Energy C7's as well. My current setup is a Voice of Music 815 console amp w/ matching tube preamp [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/KK1RjyL) , 1960's Pioneer PAT-38X 15"" Triaxials [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/TEJqauf) in EV Regency style cabs and a Phillips 312 turntable with AT95 cart. I plan on restoring the SX-1250. I have seen the rave for the SX-1250 on ebay and auidokarma but never heard one in person. I have restored many tube based audio but never solid state.

Questions:

\-Is there a specific restoration ""kit"" online that anyone recommends?

\-Any guides or tips for the SX-1250?

\-What are your opinions on the Hitachi vs the Phillips? Which one would you keep?

Thanks!

We talked, we laughed, and she gave me some advice about things I‚Äôve been struggling with regarding our babies. LilZ was happy too, she made imaginary coffee for Grauntie and we played imaginary picnic and invited her Stitch plushie. This is a game LilZ love and I love playing it with her too.

Out of nowhere, LilZ asked me where her other sister was, and it caught me off guard. I told her BabyZ was right there, but she said, ‚ÄúNo, my other.‚Äù It‚Äôs true, we had told her she was going to have two sisters. Every day, she would say good morning and night-night twice to my belly, sometimes she would also kiss my belly twice. She picked two plushies for her sisters. Now, she questioned where the other one was. It‚Äôs a very valid concern.

I told her Adria is in heaven, but that she‚Äôs still her sister, along with BabyZ. She just said ‚Äúoh‚Äù and got visibly sad. She asked, in her own way, if Adria was happy, and I told her yes, she‚Äôs happy in heaven. Grauntie said the same and told her she can talk to her if she wants and she‚Äôd listen. We kept playing, and that was all. It would be a lie to say I didn‚Äôt spent the rest of the time with a weight on my chest. I texted hubby because idk it was deep and he called me, we talked for a few minutes. 

Now that Grauntie is gone and BabyZ is napping, LilZ‚Äôs question really got to me, it hit me hard and I can‚Äôt stop crying. I left her watching Cats, the stage recording (her new obsession), and now I‚Äôm just crying my eyes out. I just want to cry, I can‚Äôt really stop.  I don‚Äôt know what to do or what to say to her if LilZ sees me like this. I know she will be calling me or coming in a few minutes, I‚Äôm not even hiding from her, I just stood up and came to the kitchen because I couldn‚Äôt hold it. I can‚Äôt be out of her sight because she gets scared and it really stresses her out.

And I‚Äôm talking to my baby in heaven, apologizing again because I couldn‚Äôt protect her, telling her that I love her and miss her so very much. Aunties didn‚Äôt believe me, but I did meet my baby. I remember her smell, her tiny hands, and I just miss her.

I thought about coming to my internet aunties because you all are the only friends I have, it seems.

**‚Ä¶Restarting Transcription**

‚Äú-nd I says to the guy, who the fuck do you think you are? And we‚Äôre right sizing each other up, in each other‚Äôs faces, and I just fucking deck him-‚Äú Ollie emphasizes his sentence by throwing a wild overhand into the air, then chugs the rest of his beer held in the other. ‚Äú-*WAM.* Right down to the ground, unconscious.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, really?‚Äù Dan chuckles. ‚ÄúAll, what, 60 kilos of you? Knocked him out cold, just like that?‚Äù

I laugh too, throwing another piece of wood into the fire. The days here are hot, hot beyond belief, but the nights still get quite cold. The blaze crackles and pops in its pit, flames dancing in the evening air. We just got back from a patrol south of Baudouinville, making sure the roads were clear of Loyalists so that the Mining company could send their trucks through unharmed. Patrolling the bush in a hot African summer is not exactly a vacation, but the day's work is over now. Now all that‚Äôs left to do is crack a couple of beers and shoot the shit with the rest of the ragtag group Falques has assembled.

The night is loud with wind, bugs, and wildlife. A reversed facsimile of a city, with all its hustle and bustle.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYes, I fucking did too. What, you don‚Äôt think I can throw a punch?‚Äù Ollie faints a swing at Dan, causing the latter to flinch slightly and raise his guard. Ollie laughs hard until Dan scoops up another can and chucks it at his head. It dings off with a hearty thump, but Ollie just starts laughing again.¬†

The Belgian and the Englishman had been the closest people I had to friends since I took up the contract here. Translating Dutch and English to Afrikaans and back again is harder than I would have thought, but we make it work, enough to break each other's balls anyway. I finish my own beer in turn, placing the can onto the carefully made stack by my feet. I‚Äôd managed to get six of them standing on top of each other, and Dan and Ollie both stop laughing for a second, watching in silence as I go for a seventh. I take a deep breath, exhale it, then slowly reach my hand out towards the tower, gently sliding the can onto the top. As soon as it‚Äôs placed there, I rip my hand back, and wait with baited breath.

One count, two count, three count, and it holds! I pump my fist in the air, the other two nodding in approval. ‚ÄúI told ya I could do it, na? Shoulda not taken that bet, boets. Both of ya, pay up, on the double.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh fuck you, fine, here you go-‚Äú Ollie fishes out a small stone from his flak jacket, and tosses it to me; it‚Äôs a diamond. Probably mined out of some pit by some slave labourers and used to fund some conflict for some warlord or another, and now it‚Äôs here, in my hands. Most of the other mercenaries don‚Äôt bat an eye when it comes to these stones, they don‚Äôt care about what people had to go through to get them, they just care about how much liquor and how many prostitutes it can net them. But for some reason, every time I see one, I pause and have to think about it. Those thoughts, about the suffering that had to happen to get this diamond in my possession, they haunt me. Dan does say my heart is too big to work as a gun-for-hire, but I‚Äôm here anyway. A diamond like this would probably cost you thousands in some big city in America, or England, but good luck getting market price here with how many have flooded the market.

‚ÄúHere, Seb, take it-‚Äú Dan tosses a wad of Katangese franc into my hands. There‚Äôs probably almost a hundred wrapped up with twine. That‚Äôs a cold round of beers when we get to a proper pub, so I nod my head in thanks and shove it into my bag beside me.¬†

We trade money between ourselves, in these stupid little bets. Anything to try and fight the boredom that drives you half-mad. Can you shoot that branch off that tree, can you balance those cans, can you run to the other side of camp in twenty seconds, that sort of thing. We‚Äôre here for money, yes, but more so for adrenaline. We‚Äôre all junkies, trying to get bigger and bigger thrills, and people like us have a hard time sitting down and shutting up.¬†

Speaking of not being able to sit down, those beers are making themselves known. ‚ÄúYa, thanks you two. I be back in a sec, need to piss.‚Äù

They both nod, and go back to jostling with each other. I stand up, grabbing my things just in case, and walk off into the bush. No toilets out here, in fact, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a toilet since Elisabethville, never mind some decent toilet paper.

Lighting the oil lantern in my hand, I make sure to follow the footpath carefully, lest I sprain or twist an ankle. The leaves on the ground make a satisfying crunch as I walk over them, down a small hill away from camp. Way out in the bush, we are. I don‚Äôt need to find an ultra-secluded spot, I‚Äôm not too worried about anyone stumbling across me.¬†

And then I see something.

It‚Äôs a light, deeper into the forest.

Immediately I draw my SLR off my shoulder; the UN usually doesn‚Äôt patrol this deep, but you can never be too careful. I think about doubling back to grab the others, but curiosity gets the better of me, and I slowly move towards the patrol, crouching low to stay hidden. I snuff the lamp too, no point in letting them see me that easily. I‚Äôm not long in the tooth, but I still know how to control my breathing, control my heartrate, keep my hands steady. Mostly steady, the pop-can tab sight sways just a tad with each heartbeat.

One foot in front of the other. Quiet, calm, collected.

As I get closer the light resolves into several smaller ones, looking just like searching flashlights tearing through the vegetation. I drop to one knee, and watch as the‚Ä¶

That is not a patrol.

Oh *bliksem*, what in the *fuck*.

It‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ helicopter? A plane of some kind? I can‚Äôt see any rotors or engines. The fucking thing doesn‚Äôt look like any plane I‚Äôve seen before, and that whining noise‚Ä¶ What the hell is that?

¬†It floats eerily through the tree line, knocking aside the trees in its path as it moves to the south, strafing to the side in front of me. It‚Äôs about maybe‚Ä¶ fifty meters long, and twenty or so meters wide. Quite boxy, with giant outcropping legs jutting out of the bottom. Those legs flex hard as it settles down onto the ground, the whining noise starting to taper off as it lands and seemingly starts to shut down. I aim my SLR at the ramp that unfolds, opening up to what looks like a cargo bay; I can see boxes and other industrial-esque things inside.¬†

I don‚Äôt need to piss anymore.

¬†I really should have gotten more sleep last night. Those aren‚Äôt Humans walking out, they can‚Äôt be. What looks like‚Ä¶ dogs? They cautiously advance down the ramp onto the ground, walking on their hind legs. The group numbers five, with the two on point carrying what resembles firearms, the other three struggling to lug out a variety of equipment. They‚Äôre followed by a pair of squid things, one armed with a rifle, and the whole group starts to set up a perimeter, and their equipment. Boxes, miniature radar dishes, fucking whatever the hell *that* is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not actually seeing this, I don‚Äôt think, I can‚Äôt be, this can‚Äôt be fucking real‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

I think one of them saw me.¬†

‚Ä¶

I duck down lower, trying to hide in the brush as my heart beats out of my chest.¬†

‚Ä¶

I close my eyes, face down in the dirt, trying to stay as low as possible, and as flat as possible.¬†

‚Ä¶

They sure aren‚Äôt speaking English, Dutch, French, or anything I can even hope to try and understand. I glance up, heart pounding, trying to get a bead on if they‚Äôve found me or not. They‚Äôve started to move towards the ridge that I‚Äôm up on but I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs because they actually know if I‚Äôm here, or my luck is just shit.

‚Ä¶

***VWOOMP***

YEP YEP THEY FAKKEN SAW ME SHIT SHIT SHIT-

A bright glob of something takes a tree behind me and splits it in half, the upper part slamming into the ground with a resounding crash. The ones carrying equipment quickly drop it, taking their weapons from the slings on their backs. I sprint to the side, dodging more fire as I dive behind a solid-looking rock for cover. Those aren‚Äôt bullets exiting their ‚Äòguns‚Äô, more like blobs of napalm, or bright goo, not important. What is important is they‚Äôre slow, really slow, and when I pop up next I get almost six shots off before the next glob hits the rock, *and completely disintegrates it.*

¬†*bliksem bliksem bliksem BILKSEM BILKSEM BLERRIE NAAIERS.*

My fire has scattered the group, but they‚Äôre still stuck in the clearing from their craft‚Äôs exhaust. I get to rotate through the brush, ducking into a small depression and returning more fire. I miss a couple of times, bullets kicking up plumes of dirt, before I send a round straight through the head of one of the dog-things. It explodes in a wave of blue, illuminated by the lights behind it, as the body drops to the ground like a sack of rocks.

Not human.

They screech at each other in two distinct languages, probably one for the squid-things and one for the dog-things, as I disappear again and double back to my old spot. I lie down beside the bubbling remains of the rock, training my sights on one of the squids. I get it right through the‚Ä¶ hip, I think, sending it to the ground spinning as it leaks purple fluid onto the forest floor. The rest return fire, eviscerating what was left of the rock, but I‚Äôm already moving to the right.

Shoot and scoot, shoot and scoot. They can‚Äôt get a bead on me, probably can‚Äôt actually see me at all, they‚Äôre just shooting at my muzzle flashes. One of the ones still on the vessel finally wisens up, shutting off the lights that were exposing their friends. The sudden darkness throws me off, but I can still see the moonlight reflected off of their silver retardant suits. Two more go down in quick succession, one of the poor things twitching and crying on the ground. I put my life on the line to pop up and put it out of its misery. Three left, one squid, two dogs.

I sprint to the left, diving behind another tree. I shakily peak out, putting three rounds into the last squid. The dogs light the area around the tree up, one of the rounds just catching my arm as I start to run. I can hear the skin sizzle and bubble, more than feel it, the nerves in my arm are probably fried to the point that they can‚Äôt even get a signal to my brain to feel agony. I think that‚Äôs a fourth-degree burn, and looking down at the now-exposed bone I almost puke.¬†

More globs impact around me, forcing my attention back onto the firefight. I lock open the bolt, shoving two ten-round stripper clips into the mag in quick succession. My left arm moves weirdly, moves awkwardly; I think some important muscle or another got burned away.

Dropping the bolt, I keep running around their perimeter, ducking into another depression. One of the dogs is taking cover relative to my old position, exposed to my new one, and I light it up liberally, snapping its small torso in half with half a dozen 7.62 rounds. The last one drops it‚Äôs weapon, running for safety up the ramp into the craft. I snag it in the foot, blowing one clean off with my third shot, the other two ricocheting off the ramp. It falls to the floor, and I shoot liberally, making sure it won‚Äôt get up.

I now have a choice, I could go back to camp, and get reinforcements, or I could try and clear the craft out myself. The smart choice is to go back to camp, easily, but the wound on my arm isn‚Äôt cauterized completely, and it‚Äôs starting to bleed something fierce.

If they have a sci-fi craft, sci-fi weapons, and are sci-fi creatures, I really hope they have sci-fi medicine, because I think they got my leg too, and I don‚Äôt think I can make it back to camp.¬†

Limping, dragging the bum leg behind me, I crash out of the brush and into the clearing, making my way towards the ramp. I can hear more voices inside, and the sounds of weapons cocking, but my heart is pounding so loudly that I can‚Äôt take a moment to think it over. I‚Äôm losing too much blood, my clothes are sticking to my skin.¬†

I think I might die here.

I enter the cargo bay, making my way past the crates and towards the door(?) at the back. There‚Äôs no handle, but as soon as I get close it opens up automatically, followed by a veritable wave of more bright globs. I have to scramble backward, back out of the doorway and into cover. They‚Äôve fortified the hallway leading deeper into the craft, and as the door closes again it starts to glow red hot, beginning to melt. There‚Äôs a crate in my way between me and the entrance and ramp, so I‚Äôll need to gamble on the door holding whatever the hell they shoot back because otherwise, they‚Äôll get me in my back if I run for it. Although I don‚Äôt think I can run right now at all.

I swear loudly and decide to make a terrible decision, it‚Äôs not like I have much time left anyway.

I pull the pin on one of the Mills bombs, taken from my pouch. I reach my good arm with the grenade out until the door opens, then hurl the frag as deep as I can. I wait for a five-count, the bang followed by the sounds of shrapnel ricocheting all about the hallway, then push into it, throwing down suppressing fire as quickly as I can work the trigger, down the funnel towards their hasty barricade. Running dry, I pull out another couple of stripper clips and jam their rounds down into the mag, then push out to whatever‚Äôs left.

Their position is unoccupied, one wounded and two dead left in various states of attempting to flee behind it. One‚Äôs screaming, the first thing my brain thinks of is someone stepping on a squeaky toy. I put it out of its misery.¬†

CQC is terrifying, this situation is terrifying, I‚Äôm terrified, but everything is getting a bit woozy as I leak all over the vessel. There's puddles of red oozing out of wherever I step, the blood running down my leg, onto my boots, and down to the ground. I smack my face, trying to wake myself up, but I can visibly see my life slipping away onto the floor. Limping past the bodies, gambling with a right turn as the hallway branches into two different paths. Everything is sterile, blank, and white, and it‚Äôs all made of a material I‚Äôve never seen before.¬†

What the fuck is this thing, where the fuck did it come from, who the fuck am I fighting.

Questions, questions that‚Äôll never be answered, because I feel a sting in the back of my neck, and my vision starts to go blurry. My rifle drops to the floor, and my legs give out, as more alien voices drift to my ears from behind.¬†

I think I had a good run.

However, I want to set a little more aside in either an emergency fund or fun fund. Just throw a few dollars in every day that I don‚Äôt treat myself or something. 

And I WANT it to be blind. I miss my piggy bank. I miss the surprise and feeling of good fortune. It almost feels like winning at gambling to me, except it‚Äôs my money I saved. I might even put it back into the stock market once I crack it open. Or have something put aside for a random massive expenditure so it doesn‚Äôt hit so hard. 

However, we live in a pretty cashless society. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of withdrawing $60 to put somewhere and then ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the slush fund paid off for x amount of time.‚Äù I want to throw in ‚Äúa cup of coffee‚Äù or ‚Äúavocado toast‚Äù (LOL) at a time. Especially because, with those larger amounts, my brain naturally starts tracking the numbers. 

Are there any apps or banks or anything that do this kind of blind account saving? 

And I don‚Äôt care if you think this is silly. It gives me a tiny spark of joy to save $5 for future me. Just let me have this. ",1,1737676189.0,Money,3,0.67,False

1i8hlrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1i8hlrf/trip_review_disney_dream_5_night_western/,Trip Review - Disney Dream 5 night Western Caribbean 1/18/25,"This was our 8th Disney cruise overall but our first on the Dream.  We started cruising in 2004 but our most recent cruise was 9 years ago.  That most recent cruise was on the Fantasy but all prior cruises were on the Wonder or Magic.  Since we hadn't been on a cruise in a while and no longer had young kids we weren't quite sure what we'd think about cruising Disney again.  We booked this last minute (November 2024) because a family that we had done most of our prior cruises with had booked so we figured we'd give it another go.

STATEROOM OVERVIEW

Disney Dream Stateroom 7540 - Sleeps 3 (queen bed, sofa bed). Note there is NO pull down berth above the sofa in this room. Starboard side, slightly aft of the forward elevators. Standard verandah with two chairs and one small round table. Connecting room with 7538.   

This stateroom was a 10/10. The only ding I could give the fit and finishes was that the small oval table in front of the sofa had a very scratched surface. Otherwise the room (including the bathrooms) was in great condition. I loved the location - starboard and just slightly aft of the forward elevators. 

We did not have a dock view of Castaway Cay because the ship backed in which meant our gangway was the farthest walk to get off the boat. We did have a dock view at Cozumel (don't know if that would be the same for all future dockings there though). Only one of the night tables by the bed has a power outlet. The only other power outlets we could find (2 of them) were at the desk. The desk also had a 3rd outlet specifically fitted for the hair dryer that Disney provides. There are no outlets in either of the bathroom rooms. There is a shaver outlet in the ceiling of the room with the tub. 

Speaking of the hair dryer, the hair dryer that came with the room was our only real problem. It had a retractable cord that wouldn't stay extended. So every time I tried to move it around my head the cord would retract back into the dryer basically making it impossible to use. I went to Guest Services and later someone delivered a hair dryer that didn't have this issue. While the hair dryer was powerful enough to dry my hair, it definitely isn't as good as the one I use at home so in the future I'd go back to bringing my own.  

We were 4 flights up to Quite Cove where we spent a lot of time. 3 flights down to Buena Vista theater or the upper level of the Walt Disney theater. The room had no maintenance issues and was in great condition. We heard no disruptive noises at all. The shower tub drained completely fine so we were never in standing water. Also, this is a connecting room but we barely heard the family in that room. 

We had 3 adults in this room (me, my husband and our 24 year old daughter). My husband and I each brought a medium size checked bag. My daughter brought a carry-on. We had no problems storing all of our clothes either in the closets or in the various drawers around the room. We did use all the hangers though. We also brought an over-the-door shoe holder that we hung on the door to the shower room. I used this to store my shoes, hats, sunscreen and other random things so that the stateroom didn't feel as cluttered. The ""hallway"" from the entrance door to the bed area is very narrow and it's hard for two people to pass by each other if one is entering the room and the other is trying to go to the bathroom for example. But otherwise, we were very comfortable with fitting 3 average-sized adults in the room. 

We had a wonderful stateroom host - Made. One night after dinner me, my husband and our 24 year old daughter (who was in our stateroom with us) came back after dinner to find the bed made with two towel swans and rose petals. I'm not sure what Made thought might be happening in the room that night given our daughter was with us but it gave us a good laugh. Would I stay in this stateroom again? Absolutely!!!!

EMBARKATION

We are gold Castaway Club members.  I checked-in at exactly midnight 30 days before our sail date and was able to get an 11:30 am port arrival time.  Closer to our sail date that actually changed to 11:15.  We flew in the day before and stayed at the Renaissance Marina hotel in Fort Lauderdale.  We took a Lyft to the port (about $22 with tip).  Our Lyft arrived early so we departed the hotel earlier than we thought.  We got to the port shortly after 11 but we were still allowed to go to check-in.  We did see another family get turned away (not sure what port arrival time they had).

We didn't wait at all to check-in or to go through security.  We were boarding group 5.  Friends we were traveling with were trying to upgrade their room so we actually didn't end up boarding until boarding group 7 but we were still on the ship a little before noon.

The gold Castaway Club ""gift"" waiting for us in our stateroom was a zippered tote bag with a wet/dry pouch.  I actually really liked this compared to prior tote bags and gifts we received (which we never really used after the cruise).  We took it with us to our dune buggy/snorkeling excursion and the wet/dry pouch was really useful.  I expect I'll keep this one and probably use it in the future.

DINING

Our dining rotation was AP/AP/EG/RP/AP and we had the late seating (which is a first, all prior cruises when our kids were young we had the early seating). And in real life we still tend to eat on the early side even though our kids are grown and out of the house.  We ate in the main dining rooms every night except for the Enchanted Garden night.  But we typically had what we called a pre-dinner up on deck 11 around 5 pm or so.

I found the food in the dining rooms to be a very mixed bag and I would say worse than I remember from prior cruises.  Generally the desserts were above average to excellent.  But the appetizers and main courses were hit or miss.  One night I got a chilled lobster and shrimp appetizer that had literally 3 shrimp and one half-dollar sized piece of lobster that was about 1/4"" thick.  That portion size was incredibly disappointing.

Our main server was above average compared to all past servers we've had - she really enjoyed giving us riddles and brain-teasers which our table appreciated.  The only thing I didn't like is that she made a point the last night of talking about the survey and how nothing counts except an ""excellent"" rating.  This was done right after I had finished filling out the survey where one of the questions was whether we had felt any pressure to give only excellent ratings.

Our assistant server was actually pretty bad.  The first night two of us asked for decaf coffee and it never came.  Another night she never came by to refill the water.  This feedback was shared with the head server and service did improve after that.  

Outside of the main restaurants, we ate at Cabanas and the fast-service stands on Deck 11.  As always, the DCL chicken tenders DO NOT DISAPPOINT.  Burgers were fine. Pizza is sub-par.   I did enjoy the new taco stand and think that is a great addition. Also appreciated the Minute Maid Zero Sugar Lemonade at the beverage stations which I don't recall from prior cruises.   This was the first cruise I realized that you could order custom eggs (either an omelette or just basic eggs over easy) at Cabanas on all mornings except debarkation.  The Mickey Churro waffles did not disappoint.  But you know what did disappoint - their donuts.  In the past they offered what we were pretty sure were Krispy Kreme donuts.  The donuts they offer now are totally not worth the calories - just bland and a sort of dense texture.  Also wasn't a fan of the prepared scrambled eggs - they had a bit of an artificial taste.  But the hash browns were darn tasty.  

We did the sit down breakfast in Royal Palace one morning and it was fine.  Nothing amazing but was a nice change of pace from Cabanas.  I ordered the sliced fruit starter that said it came with mango, papaya, canteloupe, strawberries and blueberries.  I literally had 2 blueberries and 2 strawberry slices on my plate.  But the other fruit was ripe and tasty.

A random disappointing experience was when I ordered a soft pretzel from Pub 687.  It arrived and it literally did not have a single grain of salt on it.  Where's the salt Walt?

Disney also provides flavored, edible straws which was not something I'd seen before.  I was offered a lime one with a gin and tonic, a strawberry one with a Pina colada and a coffee one with a speciality coffee at Cove Cafe.

Speaking of Cove Cafe, my daughter and I visited there 3 mornings and each ordered a coffee.  Using the rewards card they provide (why are they still using physical rewards cards that need to be stamped when they have an app????) we were able to get our 6th drink for free.  One morning I asked for an iced latte but it was made as a hot latte.  Rather than remaking it from scratch, the barista/bartended just poured half of it out and added ice.  I should have asked her to remake it.

ENTERTAINMENT

We really enjoyed doing the decades-oriented music trivia events in Evolution at 7:45 pm right before our dinner.  McKenna, the activities person leading this event, was fun.  We also spent 3 nights in Pub 687 watching various football games.  We really liked the vibe in there.  We saw Mufasa, the new Lion King movie, in the Buena Vista theater one cloudy day.  But other than that we didn't attend a lot of the standard fare (Sail Away Party, Pirates Night, etc.) because we had ""been there, done that"" when the kids were little.

We also enjoyed watching the on-demand Disney movies in our stateroom while we were relaxing before our evening activities.

PORTS OF CALL - COZUMEL

We did a dune buggy/snorkeling excursion at Cozumel.  It was $104 per person and scheduled for 8:30 am but you were requested to meet up at 8:15 am.  We met up in Enchanted Garden where towels were provided.  Our tour guide, Edison, was waiting for us off the ship.  We walked through the mall right at the port entrance where we signed waivers and Edison reviewed how the dune buggy driving would go.  

Typically it is 4 people to a buggy.  My family was a family of 3 and our friends were a family of 3.  Initially 12 people signed up so they were allowing 3 buggies total. My friend's family was split up and their son was assigned to our buggy and they would have 2 strangers sharing their buggy with them.  We didn't realize this was a possibility.  But fortunately a 13th person signed up so we had to use 4 buggies.  As a result, my family and my friend's family each got their own buggies.  You are provided with helmets to wear.

You drive out of the port area for about half an hour or so to the actual ""off-roading"" location.  it's hard to describe the area you are driving through.  Some of it is jungle-like, some of it seems like a quarry type of site.  It was raining/had recently rained and the jungle-like part was a single track with lots of rocks and exposed tree routes.  It was a bit more ""daring"" than I expected and there were parts where I could see the possibility of getting stuck was very real but it ended up  being very fun.  The guide makes a point of stopping so that you can switch drivers if you want.  

The dune buggy generates a lot of heat which you feel through the floor.  It is also very rumbly/vibrating.  And there are some fumes.  I think the combination of all of these resulted in my stomach feeling a bit unsettled.  

After the off-roading, you then drive the dune buggies about 30 min to the snorkeling location.  There is a restaurant there as well as some shops and you can order lunch (not included in the price of the excursion) and it will be ready when you get out of the water.  You do get chips/salsa included as part of the excursion.They provide all the snorkeling supplies and instruct you on how to use them.  

Important note - to protect the reef you are not supposed to wear sunscreen unless it is specifically the kind that is safe for reefs/sea-life.  

The guide then takes you into the water, helps you get your fins on and cleans your mask if needed to make sure it is not fogged up.  He then basically just swims around looking for interesting things to show you.  We saw an eel, a conch, a skate, lots of blue tangs and other pretty standard tropical fish.  But otherwise, the snorkeling was just ok.  We were out for less than 45 minutes but our guide said the current was pretty strong.  My husband tried to do it but after getting in the water just didn't feel comfortable and there isn't enough time for the guide to sort of cater to individuals who may need more assistance than others.  So he ended up just sitting in chairs by the beach while the rest of us snorkeled. 

There is a bathroom where you can change out of your suit to eat lunch if you ordered it.  After lunch you drive the buggies back to the port location. All in all the excursions was a lot of fun - my daughter really enjoyed driving the dune buggy through the off-roading area.  I felt it was worth the $104 per person cost (we also tipped the guide $30 for our group of 3).

PORTS OF CALL - CASTAWAY CAY

It was overcast when we debarked at around 10:10 am to go to Serenity Bay, the adult beach.  We had never been before since all prior cruises were when our kids were under 18.  We took the tram to the second stop where we then had to get off and wait for another tram to take us to Serenity Bay.  So it actually takes a while to get to Serenity Bay.

The actual beach at Serenity Bay is not flat.  The beach slopes upward from the water and as a result a lot of the loungers are inclined which is not comfortable to sit on for an extended period of time.  We actually moved ours forward to the flattest part of the beach we could find.  We had no problems getting loungers under umbrellas but the weather could have kept some people on the ship.  In fact it did rain for about 25 minutes.  But we toughed it out and were blessed with a few beautiful sunny hours on the beach.

The lunch fare was pretty standard in terms of being what is served at the family beaches.  But again I was pretty disappointed in the overall quality.  The corn on the cob had no corn flavor, no salt flavor and no butter flavor. The cheeseburger was pretty dry.  The potato salad and Cole slaw were yummy though.

All in all,I would definitely not waste time going to Serenity Bay again and would just go to the family beach.  While it certainly was peaceful at Serenity Bay given there were no kids, the downsides of it weren't worth it to me.  

DEBARKATION

We did express walk-off.  We went to Cabanas for breakfast around 7:00 am.   We went back to our stateroom and took our luggage down to deck 3 around 7:40 am.  I think we missed the announcement that opened up debarkation so I'm not sure how early we could have gotten off.

 We were probably exiting the port after going through customs a bit before 8 am.  So it was a very quick process.  You need to show your key to the world card before you walk off the ship and then in the terminal if you have a passport line you can just walk up to a facial recognition device to clear customs.  We did not have anything to declare so just walked out of the terminal after that.

We were heading back to Fort Lauderdale airport.  My daughter had an 11 am flight and we had a 12:11 pm flight.  Rather than an Uber/Lyft, we just took a taxi.  There was no wait and we had arrived at the airport in about 15 minutes.  We printed out our bag tags, dropped them off and went through the TSA Pre-Check line in Terminal 3 without having to wait very long.  

OVERALL

The Disney Dream is in fantastic shape and is a beautiful ship. We were very pleased with our stateroom.  While I had hoped to one day to hit the Platinum level for Castaway Club (only need 2 more cruises), I'm not sure I see us doing any more Disney cruises.  Maybe if we get grandchildren some day we'll come back.  I'm probably the most into the Disney aspect of it compared to the rest of my family. But even for me, the overall disappointing food given the premium price we are paying is what would have me looking for other ways to spend our vacation budget.",6,1737675675.0,dcl,2,0.88,False

Her:
Well, we can see about grabbing a drink sometime, though I‚Äôm currently avoiding casual alcohol.
And I‚Äôm not really aiming to give the matchmaker any gossip.

Me:
Yeah, you know what I mean ‚Äî I just find the idea of a third-wheeling fan of ours in the background funny.
So does that mean alcohol only professionally now, or are you doing Dry January?

Her:
If we both know that he‚Äôs built an illusion, then maybe :)
Alcohol only professionally sounds good hahaha
Yeah, should just be reduced to the most necessary events.

Okay, no, I didn't want that. I‚Äôm also happy to meet casually without romantic intentions, but I also talk about dates with my supervisor, idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Me: If I haven't screwed up yet, what do u think about getting coffee?

Her: I'm out of town over the weekend anyways, we could see afterwards


I can't tell if I'm making her uncomfortable and she is just avoiding a direct reject because we may run into each other on campus again, or if she is still unenthusiastically, mildly interested and just wants to take things slow. 

I'm so used to getting ghosted on dating apps that I usually assume the girl is interested as long as she answers. But this may be different since she may feel obligated because she gave me her number when I asked etc.

Should I just wish her a good time home and ignore her, not take her up on that suggestion to ""see afterwards"" and let her re-initiate?",3,1737675079.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

I was excited to explore the city and meet a traditional Filipina girl. The first few days were amazing going on dates and exploring the city‚Äîbut I noticed that Filipino guys would give me a lot of attitude and were aggressive towards me.

I was walking around when I met this Filipina at a coffee shop and got her number. We arranged a date, and we went to Jollibee. Afterward, we went back to my condo, and we hooked up. We continued talking, and then these two Filipino guys walked in and robbed the place. I tried to stop them, but they beat me up, and the girl ran off.

After this incident, I called the police, but they were of no help. Two days later, I got mugged on my way back from a night of partying uptown. Yet again, the police were of no help, even though I lost my iPhone and 10,000 pesos in cash.

I want to warn every guy who wants to visit Cebu to be careful, as it‚Äôs very dangerous. I‚Äôve spoken to other foreigners while here, and they‚Äôve shared similar experiences. I think it‚Äôs safer to search for traditional women in other places and not dangerous places like Cebu.

It‚Äôs like having a thoughtful, supportive friend in your pocket who helps you tackle cravings, stay motivated, and see the bigger picture.

I setup the assistant to use proven techniques like mindfulness, visualization, and even little motivational nudges that kept me on track when I felt tempted.

Quitting can be such a lonely and tough journey, but having the right support makes all the difference.

I live with my sister (23) and my dad (51); my mom passed away coming up on 9 years in a couple of weeks. This timing is not very ideal as I am just still not good with my mom‚Äôs death day and as a result I didn‚Äôt enjoy my birthday for a few years, no big deal. However, a couple of years ago I adopted a cat who actually shares my birthday, and it‚Äôs made it very fun thinking of celebrating him instead of weird thoughts I won‚Äôt get into on this post. 


My dad is not a fan of holidays or birthdays or any ‚Äúassigned celebration‚Äù. He believes that these things should be spontaneous (I think he mainly thinks that the gift giving should be spontaneous as that is his gripe with Christmas). My sister and I have gotten over this and explained to him many times that while he doesn‚Äôt like these things, we do, and he does not need to be included if he feels he doesn‚Äôt want to for any reason. 


For several years now my sister and I have spent our birthdays together doing something, or doing what we want to do on our day. Mine usually surrounds Bea since ours fall on the same day and he is the one who made me enjoy my birthday again without the sad feelings. 


However, on my sisters birthday in 2024, he wasn‚Äôt home for reasons I don‚Äôt want to talk about, and when he finally got home he said he felt really bad he missed her birthday. We both had no idea he felt that way as he has missed many birthdays before that one. To ‚Äúmake up for it‚Äù he bought her an extremely expensive coffee machine; my dad really enjoys coffee, my sister not so much. She told him this, in a very nice way and he said he wants to do something else with her. 

Back to current day:

A few days ago my sister asked what I felt like doing on my birthday and we planned some easy stuff at home that I‚Äôm really looking forward to doing with her, my two cats, and my dad as well. She told my dad this and he said that he wanted to go out and do something with my family, something that he has had planned for a while now. Now, I don‚Äôt especially like surprises, and he won‚Äôt tell her what this activity entails, only that it will be happening on my birthday and we will be out for the day. 


I told my dad that though I appreciate his gesture, I don‚Äôt want to spend my birthday with my family I barely talk to doing an unknown activity. He said that he just thought he could do something nice for his daughters since he wasn‚Äôt here for my sisters birthday, but he seemed very angry and walked away from me and he won‚Äôt really talk to me, just short answers. AITJ for this? 


Should I just apologize and go out with him even though I don‚Äôt want to? I can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs trying to make up for my sisters birthday by combining our birthdays together, and, as immature as this may sound, I don‚Äôt want to share my day with any one other than my cat.

Hey all,

Recently upped my dose from 30mg to 60mg once a day.   
  
The other medications I take are Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and Adderall 10mg IR in the afternoon (Both Generic Brands). In the morning, I also take 1000mcg of Vitamin B12, and 50mcg of Vitamin D3.

About an hour before sleep I take 360mg of Magnesium Glycinate. 

I've taken these vitamins/adderall daily-ish for about 6 months; however, I started taking Cymbalta in late November at 30mg. Just upped to 60mg January 10, so I'm about two weeks in.

Upon starting Cymbalta at 30mg, I noticed a bit more shaking than I usually would have, especially after waking and having coffee and breakfast. I didn't have this issue before starting Cymbalta but it wasn't enough for me to raise too much concern, I know that getting used to meds can be turbulent at times. Upping to 60mg amplified this side-effect though. I'm currently studying Graphic Design, so that means working with my hands a lot and drawing at times, and I've noticed my shaky hands having an impact on my ability. 

I'm curious if anyone else has had this experience. I know that coffee and obviously stress have a great impact on shakiness, but it's never been noticeable like this. I've been on Prozac and Lexapro before and they never caused this effect before. It sucks because other than that I've been doing pretty solid on this SNRI! Apart from sexual side-effects, which I hope will subside with time like they did with Prozac and Lexapro. Anyways, I'm going to bring this up with my psych next time we meet in a couple weeks, but just wanted to ask you folks as well.

thanks all

I recently started a new job that has a better title at a big company for a mediocre offer.

I‚Äôm finishing up my first week and I‚Äôm starting to think that I may have made a huge mistake in terms of finances. Here are my reasonings; 

Old job;

Pros: Decent pay, good benefits, free lunch and coffee, 401k matching, and tuition reimbursement for a career in working on towards, only 15 mins away from where I live 
Cons: No upward progression in my department, my supervisor has favorites and also a b!tch, my coworkers were so mean I cried in the bathroom for too many times that I have lost count. 

New job;

Pros: Respectable title, could have an upward mobility after like 2 years, people seems professional 
Cons: they lowballed my offer when I have a 3 year experience in this industry, no free lunch, no 401k matching, no tuition reimbursement on the career I‚Äôm working towards, the commute is FAR 

I feel depressed because I feel like I made such harsh decision just to escape my old toxic jobs and now I barely have any benefits at all and even spending MORE money on just commuting. I will not be eligible for their bonus as I just started. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Life on campus was a mix of stress, excitement, and confusion. Like many guys my age, I spent more time chasing dreams (and occasionally fantasies) than actually understanding what I wanted out of life. Then, I met Brenda.

Brenda wasn‚Äôt a student. She was a 36-year-old single mom who worked in one of the nearby caf√©s. She had this calm confidence that made her seem untouchable. Her laughter was loud and genuine, her eyes carried a warmth that felt both maternal and intimidating, and her body‚Äîwell, she was breathtaking. She didn‚Äôt try to hide her curves or dress younger than her age. Brenda was comfortable being Brenda, and that alone was magnetic.

We started talking casually when I‚Äôd drop by the caf√© to study or grab coffee. She‚Äôd tease me about how serious I always looked, calling me ""mister philosopher."" Over time, our chats turned into conversations about life, relationships, and even some deeper topics I hadn‚Äôt expected to discuss with anyone. She was easy to talk to and even easier to trust.

One evening, after a particularly long day, she invited me over for dinner. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt live off noodles and mandazi forever,‚Äù she joked. I hesitated but agreed. Her apartment was cozy, decorated with little trinkets her son had made. He was staying with his grandparents for the weekend, so it was just the two of us.

The night started with dinner and wine‚Äîtoo much wine, honestly. We laughed about everything and nothing. I was nervous but trying not to show it. She must have noticed because, at one point, she leaned over and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too young to take life so seriously. Relax.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when everything shifted.

I won‚Äôt dive into the explicit details, but it wasn‚Äôt rushed or awkward like I‚Äôd always imagined it would be. She was patient, guiding me without making me feel small or inexperienced. It wasn‚Äôt just about physical intimacy; it felt like she was teaching me something deeper about connection and trust. It wasn‚Äôt a fling or some reckless act‚Äîit was human, raw, and surprisingly tender.

Afterward, I expected things to be awkward, but Brenda was as relaxed as ever. Over the next few weeks, she continued to treat me like a friend, sometimes teasing, sometimes offering advice about life and relationships. She never pressured me into anything or made me feel like I owed her.

Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúlosing my virginity.‚Äù Brenda taught me to be present, to appreciate moments for what they are, and to stop overthinking everything. It wasn‚Äôt love, but it was something important‚Äîsomething I‚Äôll always remember with gratitude",2,1737674062.0,Kenya,8,0.75,False

I will be moving to Des Moines in April and have two apartment options which are a bit different from each other in terms of location and building/complex size: The Parker at Seventh (near Downtown Des Moines?) and Windsor Square by Broadmoor (West Des Moines).

My husband and I (30s) are looking for a 2-bedroom or 1-bedroom that is spacious. It's important for us to live in a quiet, safe building/complex with good management, and to access coffee shops, farmer's markets, and parks by car or bike. We have a budget of $1200 before utilities.

Have you ever lived or know people currently living in either of those places? Which one do you think would be best for us?

My parents and I arrived home late at night, probably around midnight, after visiting my grandma. Once we came home, I changed into my pajamas and went to bed. Me and my parents share the same room but have separate beds since they didn't want me to be in a separate room just yet, afterall we didn't have enough money to build one. So....

Around 2 a.m., I couldn't sleep and was still wide awake because I had coffee earlier that day. My bed is next to a plywood wall, and as I was scrolling on my phone, I suddenly heard a knock‚Äîright beside me, coming from the other side of the wall. That wall faces a hallway leading to the kitchen.

It was just the three of us in the house, along with our dog, all in the same room. My parents were sound asleep, and my dad was snoring loudly at the time, so it was just me awake. All lights in the room was off too btw.

Then it happened: three knocks on the wall, followed by a sudden screech. The sound startled me so much that my heart started racing. I froze, trying to make sense of what just happened. I don‚Äôt remember now exactly how the screech sounded, but it was terrifying. I didn't even move after it happend. I was just staring into my phone, scared to see what will happen if i did.

I thought, at first, it might have been my dad. But he doesn‚Äôt make sounds like that in his sleep‚Äîhe just kept snoring as usual. Trying to calm down, I ignored what that was and refused to respond to whatever it was. The sound also came from beside me, not where my parents where, and it couldn't be my dog because my dog dont make noise like that.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep after that. Instead, I played YouTube videos at a low volume to distract myself, careful not to wake my parents. But the incident kept replaying in my mind. I kept glancing at the dark corners of the room, paranoid that I might see something. Every noises that i hear startles me. Even though my parents were in the room with me, the thought of being alone in my bed scared me.

‚ÄúWhat if I open my eyes and see someone there?‚Äù

Thankfully, nothing else happened that night. I felt relieved but still uneasy.

I am someone who you can call a skeptic whenever something ghost happened but i do somewhat believe in them. I also wouldn‚Äôt call our house haunted‚Äîat least not in the sense of seeing objects move or actual ghosts. But it does feel creepy at times. We have a closet that belonged to my great-grandmother, dating back to World War II. That history alone makes me uncomfortable, and i have a few incidents where i feel like someone is watching me . Sometimes, my dog would bark at that dark hallway, when there was nothing there.... but I always shrugged it off, not acknowledging anything scared that if i do, it might happen frequently and that just creeps me out.

This scares the living S out of me, now im scared to even stay awake around that time.not wanting that to happen again.",2,1737673529.0,TrueScaryStories,15,1.0,False

If anyone from the coming classes has any questions, please let me know!! I'll try adding more as I think of them in edits.

* Coffee at the cafe here is good (like a Starbucks) and FREE
* Breakfast here is good and yes they have to-go containers available if you want to take it with you or take some leftovers for later. The hotel also provides cute little snacks in the lobby like hot chocolate, juice, and cookies all day. There are also super affordable and fresh options for purchase like salads, wraps, etc that the kitchen makes daily
* The hotel and training center are beautiful and super new - right next to each other and also connected on the third floor of the hotel (there is a bridge you can walk across)
* The instructors are all amazing and so thorough and will help you with literally anything you need
* There is a laundry basket in each room and a free 24/7 laundry room
* The gym and pilates room are also 24/7 and super nice. A diverse amount of equipment and quite a few treadmills. They even have two peletons!
* The Meijer is huge and has anything you could possibly need (although I find the groceries there a tad expensive). There is a free hotel shuttle that can take you to and from on Tuesdays + Thursdays and sometimes other days if it is allowed, but I personally just walked because it's like less than a 10 minute walk there
* It is A LOT of information and days are indeed long but instructors make it so that we are not exceeding 10 hours of class in a day
* You can wear sneakers of ANY color (not just B/W/Republic colors), they obviously just shouldn‚Äôt look crazy or torn up or inappropriate
* They do indeed do compliance checks first day so make sure you have everything you need, INCLUDING your compliant FA shoes
* Be prepared to have a lot of fun and meet some incredible people, but study and work hard for what you want to achieve!",5,1737673479.0,cabincrewcareers,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

* On the Gemini app it just didn't work, it said it couldn't do that with no explanation.
* On the AI Studio it gave me a pretty solid, albeit long, response with no issues.

What was weird is on the AI Studio it put an alert saying that the video has potential risk for NSFW content but it was low. I assume that's why the Gemini app didn't work for it.

I really hope Google doesn't kill the utility of their app by being overly conservative. So far AI Studios experience, a free one, is better than the paid Gemini experience.

I'd like to share a recent experience with you all, and hope you can offer some suggestions on how to respond.

**TLDR: I had two verbal agreements, a start date to move forward, setup in their benefits platform, and onboarding meeting invites with a consulting gig and they ghosted me.** 

I'm a 20+ year business development leader (the last 10 in wellness) and have been looking for a new job for the past 10 months. During some of these months I was lucky enough to pick up a few consulting/fractional work gigs.

Late Nov/early Dec. I became engaged with a startup fintech platform we'll call ""Fitch"", who focuses on wellness clients, through a new ""friend"" I met at a very well known wellness brand during some of my ongoing ""coffee chats"" to network with peers in the industry. This new friend suggested I should connect with them, as many of my former employers and/or clients were on their target list.

Always happy to help, and you never know what might happen....I had a call with their sole sales person and said I'd see what I could do. Within a week I secured 4 warm introductions - which caught the eye of the Fitch CEO. She suggested we hop on a call.

During an hour long call I shared industry knowledge (she has zero), targets, trends ,etc. She said she'd like to bring me on in a 6 month temporary contract position to prove the role and if it proved itself she would happily make it full-time. I suggested I create a doc detailing all we spoke about: scope, terms, targets, outcomes, etc. etc. Days later I finally heard back that she was so sorry but she must have misunderstood our conversation and what they were really looking for was a 3 month consulting job.

Okay, so that's not what we verbally agreed to, but ok. So we pivoted, and on New Years Eve we had a call to discuss the new 3 month consulting gig. We talked about the new scope, terms, etc and agreed upon my hourly rate ($175) at 20 hrs/wk. We also agreed I would start Jan. 13th! Great :) I updated the doc and then began the process of again waiting for her to reply.

I didn't receive anything until the Thursday before the Monday start - some onboarding call invites, invitation to get set up for payment in their benefits platform, and an NDA....no agreement. I pinged her twice about the agreement before Monday and didn't receive anything until Sunday night. It was a pathetic agreement without any provisions included on our terms and my pay. I shared revisions with her and never heard back.

I showed up to the first onboarding call Monday and asked if she received my revisions. She said she had no idea. We agreed to hold off on starting until Jan. 20th.

Here's what you're waiting for....she never contacted me again. We had two verbal agreements, I turned down other offers, and she can't find the professional courtesy to send something?

Would you send an email letting her know your professional thoughts? Wait to see if she emails? Do I let the industry friends I initially connected them with know I can't sign-off on this company?

Thank you!

Edit: The Fitch CEO replied very soon after I posted - 9 days after ghosting me, 2 days after our 2nd planned start date.

Thank you so much for this and for your continued patience.

As much as it pains me, the fact that I haven‚Äôt had the capacity to get your contract ironed out tells me that it‚Äôs unlikely I will have the capacity in the next several weeks to set you up for success.¬†¬†Given that, I‚Äôd like to hold off on entering into our consulting agreement.

I don‚Äôt take changing our plans lightly, and I've¬†been looking forward to working together, but I‚Äôd be doing both of us a disservice by bringing you on without the proper resources to support you.¬†¬†If you‚Äôre still interested, I‚Äôd love to touch base in a month to see if a collaboration at that time makes sense for both of us.",10,1737672910.0,consulting,2,0.78,False
1i8gjee,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1i8gjee/advice_for_cold_messaging_normal_designers_on/,Advice for cold messaging normal designers on LinkedIn,"Since joining a classic Silicon Valley tech company last year, I've been getting way more cold outreach messages and emails than I did when I worked at smaller companies. My usual habit of responding to everyone quickly disintegrated when my inbox started receiving 1 message/connection request every few days. To keep my sanity while still paying it forward to designers, I have to be extremely picky with my time and effort in helping people apply to a role at my company. Here are a few tips I wish I could drill into everyone's head when messaging normal, mid-to-senior level designers (not recruiters or managers):

1. Be nice and courteous but please try to be normal. Maybe it's just the overuse of ChatGPT and translation software, but I've been receiving some overly flowery and dramatic messages as if I'm the CEO of my company
2. Don't list your title and YOE. I'm not a recruiter
3. Send a link to your portfolio. If your work is impressive, then I will be more inclined to respond. You can also frame it around ""I'm interested in your company and I'd love your advice on how I could improve my portfolio before I apply"". Resumes are not necessary because I can see your experience on LinkedIn. again, I'm not a recruiter
4. Don't send reminders/nudges to respond to your outreach message within 72 hours. I've gotten multiple messages within 24 hours trying to prompt me into responding to their initial message. It's just too much. Idk how to even describe why this isn't polite even though it's not outright rude
5. Speaking of rude, please don't be entitled or demanding. It's good to get to the point and ask for a referral, but not without chatting first. Think about it like you're meeting me at a conference; you can't just jump straight into thrusting your resume into my hands and asking for a referral
6. Have a prompt of what you want me to actually do. Saying ""chat about your company"" is super vague and, especially as a designer, it doesn't show good storytelling skills. Here are some examples of requests:
   1. Give feedback on portfolio
   2. Ask about a specific thing in relation to the company and your experience, like work-life balance, the team or role that I'm on (and make sure it's not someone else's team)
   3. Connect over coffee about design in general, if we're in the same area. This is especially useful if you're a junior designer. I'm much more likely to create a mentor relationship with someone because I feel like it's more impactful than helping someone more senior than me apply to a role they don't even care about
7. Doesn't hurt to recognize that you understand that this may be a big ask of someone's time! It shows empathy and emotional maturity and unfortunately that is somehow rare in many of the people I've connected with

I think that's all I can think of right now. Here's an example of a good baseline cold message:

""Hey! I came across your profile because I'm interested in X role at your company and we have \_\_\_\_ as a mutual! How do you know them? Would love to connect and, if you have the time, I'd be grateful to get a referral. Please let me know if you have 15 minutes to call or meet in the next few weeks. Here's my portfolio: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ""

1i8gh7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1i8gh7y/can_i_use_a_coffee_espresso_machine_to_brew_tea/,Can I Use a Coffee Espresso Machine to Brew Tea?,"I‚Äôm curious about whether a standard espresso machine designed for coffee can be used to brew teas? I want to get a strong concentrated tea shot to make tea lattes. I understand that tea brewing requires specific water temperatures and steeping times depending on the type of tea (e.g., green, black, oolong, etc.), and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to adjust the settings on a coffee espresso machine to suit these requirements.

For example:
	‚Ä¢	Would the pressure-based extraction method still produce a good cup of tea, or would it negatively affect the flavor?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any risks of damaging the machine when using loose-leaf tea or tea bags instead of coffee grounds?

I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone has tried this or if it‚Äôs better to invest in a machine specifically designed for tea.

Thanks in advance for your insights!
