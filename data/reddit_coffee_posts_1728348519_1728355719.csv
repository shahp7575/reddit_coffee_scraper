I thought (for a moment) that I should move to a super-automatic machine just for ease, but I reconsidered, and it is time to move from the Barista Pro to a set of grinders and an espresso machine. 

  
As I mentioned before, my wife and I are heavy American drinkers, 3 or 4 cups per day each. 

I have narrowed some options to (unfortunately I am in Mexico, and not every option is available in my country :()

Baratza Sette 270 vs DF64 II (both are at the same price point in Mexico, 9200 vs 9100 MXN). 

Bambino Plus vs. Profitec Go: I know a huge gap exists between both. I read great comments about Profitec Go, but my only concern is that brewing coffee in profitec requires a little more attention, which my wife and I usually do not have. 

  
While I understand Bambino Plus, I need to press a button and brew coffee according to pre-programmed settings.

Anyway, I was just sneaking out with my bag when my wife mentions that I need to pick up some s‚Äômores stuff from the store while I‚Äôm out since we‚Äôre going to have a backyard camp out.  In any case, I run by the local Giant Eagle and grab everything the minute they open at 7. And since it was right when it opened it took forever to check out as the scanners were booting up and the registers didn‚Äôt have their drawers. Anyway, now I‚Äôm cutting it close. I pull up to the bag drop and get out and then it hits me- a chilly, wet, awful gust and I‚Äôm just wearing a thin-ish q-zip. I don‚Äôt have time to drive home and get another layer. It‚Äôs gonna be a cold round.  I decided to just say fuckit and play. Checking in I realize my tee time is in 5 minutes. No time to warm up. I‚Äôm feeling totally frazzled. I decided to get a coffee at the snack bar to try to keep warm, but decided against it based on my nerves. So I got a hot chocolate. I took a walk outside to drop off my wallet and lock the car, and then I realized I had a whole bag of marshmallows. I grabbed the bag, locked the car, and hopped into my cart. I walk up, ice cold (both athletically and temperature-wise) and proceed to slash the worst hozzlerocket known to man. It skids completely sideways, hitting a yawning cart boy at the return who was just minding his business. And I hit him in the nuts. Now I‚Äôm really frazzled. I manage to granny-swing a jizzy little poot of a drive about 175 yards. The round gets worse. I‚Äôm cold and in my anxious state forgot about the cocoa. So i, in my frustration, grabbed the styrofoam cup, and tore the bag of marshmallows open with my teeth, bit one out of the hole, then made to shake a few into my now open cocoa cup. 

Then disaster struck. Halfway down the fairway on 4 I hit an uneven patch of concrete cart path and my cart jumped and I spilled hot chocolate on my dick. This made me swerve the cart, spilling it, and me onto the fairway.

I was so embarrassed that I lifted the cart upright by myself, picked up my scattered clubs, cocoa cup, marshmallow bag, and my pride- and called it quits for the day! I think I cleaned up all the marshmallows and stuff but like I said I was pretty out of it.

I'm moving into an old 2-floor townhouse unit that was previously occupied by a family that heavily lived on Indian cooking for many years. The first time I stepped into that unit the Indian spice/curry smell was very heavy, to the point of it literally lingered in my throat for the day and gave me tears. This is because they've moved out about half a year prior and the unit windows were kept shut. But the landlord has since then completely redone the entire wooden flooring and double layer painted all the walls but **without washing them first**! The landlord did not replace all of the kitchen cupboards, stove and range hood but has hired someone to deep clean them. Even though, the smell of the cupboards was at first strong regardless due to inactivity and concealment.

This is what I've done to the place since I got the keys to the unit:

* Sprayed all kitchen cupboards and stove inside and out, range hood, fridge and kitchen walls/ceiling with 50% white vinegar 50% water solution, then wiped them all. Did this whole process **twice in a week.** The curry smell emitting from the cupboards was drastically reduced.
* Hand washed the **entire** unit's walls and doors, both floors with 33% clear dish soap, 33% white vinegar and 33% water solution. Did not wash most of the ceilings as it's got popcorn ceiling.
* Placed bowls of white vinegar in just about every room to soak up the smell.
* Placed two air purifiers working almost around the clock on the first floor where the smell is the strongest, while kept second floor windows open for days for air flow.

Now the unit, upon walking in, just smells like a mix of a bit of bitterness and vinegar, ""sour curry"", so to speak, but the smell is nowhere near as strong as before. With the problem of walls being re-pained **without washing them first,** I think my only resort is to keep cooking and masking the curry odor by various means. Unfortunately, redoing paint again or ozone machines are out of the question in my situation. I don't know if ozone machines would even work when some curry odor is trapped under the new paint and would constantly re-emit into the room through the new paint. So my question is, what methods are good for masking the smell of my new unit? I'm thinking about placing bowls of coffee grounds and probably light up incense around the home daily. Would spraying peppermint oil and water mix on the walIs be helpful? Just want to introduce a new type of smell to get trapped into the walls to finally cover up the curry smell.",0,1728354581.0,HomeImprovement,0,0.43,False
1fypi6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo50/comments/1fypi6a/some_help_for_ninpek/,Some help for Ninpek,"Ninpek is my fifth win. I'm aware that there are many games tougher than it in this collection, but I found this title to be particularly agonizing. It's fair, but it demands a lot of coordination and memory from the player, two skills I am lacking in. However, I have some tips worth sharing, some I don't see being talked about on this subreddit. I actually followed some poor advice about this game that ended up making the whole thing a lot harder than it should've been. So here is some pointers for anyone struggling.

The basics: Just hold the shoot button the whole time. You can press down B to drop down to lower levels. You acquire shurikens to raise your rate of fire, you can upgrade this twice..

Sandwich spawning: Sandwiches work much in the same way as coffees do in Campenlla. You need to place your character in a specific spot in order for them to spawn. You need three sandwiches to get the gift, but also they supply 500 points which is essential to success in this game. You need to memorize these spawns. There's a sandwich for about every minute of gameplay. While you don't need to get all of them, you do need to try and get as many as you can, and create a system for which ones you can get consistently every run. Why? 

Extra life spawning: Extra lives spawn based on your score, they do not spawn randomly. The first extra life you get spawns at the same spot every time, but the rest all come at certain points scored. The extra lives spawn at 3,000, 7,000, 12,000, 18,000 and so on. This is why the sandwiches are so important, they act as a quick shortcut to getting more lives. Maximizing score is essential to beating Ninpek and getting the cherry.

Be aggressive: Other tips I see online say to be conservative, to play it safe. Screw that, collect them points, don't leave money on the table. Try to maximize your kills especially at the start when things are at their chilliest. Learn what enemies drop extra points and get familiar with killing them and collecting their points. The purple bouncy umbrella things will often drop crowns if killed near the edge of the screen which will reward you with a ton points. Hopefully you can get enough lives so that you can survive the few minutes of the game which I found to be brutal.

Now sit back and read all about me and who I am and see if this is something you‚Äôre into: 

* To begin I‚Äôm going to share a selfie. Why? Because while I agree with the sentiment ‚Äúlooks fade, personality is forever‚Äù I still believe attraction is very important. https://imgur.com/a/5pVAcTj I am on the thicker side.

* So onto my biggest hobby, I love the gym. The gym is my happy place. I‚Äôm there 4-5 times a week. Often at 4:30 am. So I‚Äôm up early for all the early birds out there. (Or those in different time zones). It‚Äôs my happy place. 

* Music is one of my biggest ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so me‚Äù things when I see a meme about concerts. I love all types of music, I‚Äôve been to over to 200 concerts. Before you ask favorites it‚Äôs obviously DCFC, peep the name üòú However in all seriousness I love live music. I‚Äôd love to hear about a concert you‚Äôve absolutely loved and why. 

* Coffee to start my day, beer or wine to end it. I love beer and wine. I love iced coffee. I love trying new IPAs but I‚Äôll order a Budweiser anytime I‚Äôm at the dive bar.

* Speaking of dive bars, I love them. I think that‚Äôs gives an idea of who I am. Think of the girl who looks nice - almost too nice - for the dive bar, but the old people love her, bartenders don‚Äôt mind her, she‚Äôs been going there since she was 10 how could they not? (Ask me that story if you want feel good about childhood ) She reads the vibe and plays the touch tunes accordingly, she has a pitcher of bud to herself and she minds her own. Are you a dive bar person? That will tell me a lot. 

* I love sports. NFL/MLB mainly - my teams are an ode to my dad, but also just an ode to a lot of good memories I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôd love to hear about your love of sports. Your dedication to a team. Your own past playing. 

* I am a YAPPER. You‚Äôll learn I love texting, I love talking, I love learning, I love loving and I love living. I may drive you crazy and I‚Äôm sorry in advance. But I‚Äôm a great girl. With a big heart.

Would appreciate any suggestions and also advice on what to wear in each location.

We're going for 4 nights:

# Thusday

**Landing at 9 AM**

* Pick up the rental car and head to **Stanley Park** to explore, and maybe check out **Lions Gate Bridge**.
* Thinking of renting e-bikes (maybe from **Yes Cycle** or on Denman Street) and just biking around looking out for some of the sights in the park

**Hotel check-in at 3 PM** (staying near Coal Harbor), freshen up, then off to **Granville Island**.

**Granville Island**

Not quite sure what to do on Granville Island other than eat! Reddit recommends:

* **Chai tea** from Granville Island Tea Company
* **Duck prosciutto** from Oyama Sausage
* **Brie** from Benton Brothers
* **Pad Thai** from Sen Pad Thai
* **Oysters** from Lobster Man
* **Lee‚Äôs Donuts**
* Any other must-try spots or hidden gems here? Worth visiting the public market? Would appreciate food/activity recs or cool places to check out nearby!

# Friday

* **Capilano Suspension Bridge** (10 AM - 12 PM)
* **Ferry to Bowen Island** for the afternoon‚Äîplanning to rent e-bikes, explore the cove, and maybe hike. Any must-sees or local spots to check out? So far we're thinking:
   * Enjoy the trail walks near the cove, with a salmon ladder and waterfall to the right.
   * Visit memorial benches and hike up a bluff for views of Deep Bay.
   * Walk around **Killarney Lake** (\~40 mins), and check out the scenic bridge in the wetlands via Meadow Trail.
   * Rent e-bikes near the ferry terminal.
   * Hike to **Dorman Point**.
   * Explore **Snug Cove**, which has cool shops and restaurants like **Tell Your Friends Cafe**, **Elixr Coffee**, **Branch 01** (for tacos), and **Earnest Ice Cream**.
   * **Artisan Square** - more shops, including **Cocoa West** for amazing hot chocolate, and **Artisan Eats Cafe** for sausage rolls.

# Saturday

**Sea to Sky Gondola**, then heading to Whistler:

* **Superfly Ziplines**
* **Scandinave Spa** to unwind
* Finishing the night with **Vallea Lumina** before driving back to the hotel.
* Is this too ambitious for one day? We've booked a lot but I think we can do it all plus we'll get to chill at the spa for a few hours.

# Sunday

* **VanDusen Botanical Garden** in the morning.
* Considering a **ferry to Sunshine Coast** for a relaxed day trip but open to suggestions.
* Id probably want something more chill on this day given Saturday

# Monday

Chill day before catching our 2 PM flight. Any small activities or cool places near Coal Harbor we could explore before heading to the airport?

**General Questions:**

1. **What‚Äôs the weather like in Vancouver this time of year?** We‚Äôre thinking of wearing sweaters and waterproof coats, but don't want to overheat if it‚Äôs warm. Is layering the way to go?
2. **Is anything on our itinerary not worth it?** Any spots we should swap out for something better?
3. Any **packing tips**? We're trying to keep it light but practical.

1fypa8i,https://i.redd.it/rses9a8ezftd1.jpeg,Noob snake owner- want to make a jungle gym for my 1 year old kingsnake for him to hang out in for enrichment on handling days- advice? ,"So the basic idea is I think it‚Äôd be cool to have a centerpiece for our coffee table/dining table that‚Äôs like a little jungle gym that we can let our snake ‚Äúplay‚Äù around on and explore on with supervision on handling days. Just an open terrarium for the table where he can climb while we‚Äôre playing dnd or board games or something. He generally does very well with handling and he does like to explore and burrow too. I figure it gives him a small environment to hide in or observe from in a change of scenery if he‚Äôs not wanting to be handled, and maybe will help us do some choice handling training from. 

General idea is like a wooden sandbox with play sand on the bottom with his coconut fibre substrate over that and a little hide on top, with then a couple platforms going up above it for some verticality. Will probably add some fake plants and leaves and stuff too to pretty it up. Unsure on if it makes sense to give a water dish or not too.

My big questions are:

-is this a dumb idea or a good idea health-wise for our kingsnake? 

-Should I treat or not treat the wood a certain way so it‚Äôs nontoxic to him? 


- Dows the wood need to be sanded a special way or anything too? 

-Should I avoid painting the wood at all? 

-Are there glues I should definitely use or avoid, like hot glue gun glue vs gorilla wood glue? 

-Should I have something between the wood and the substrate to make it easier to clean, and if so any ideas on what? 

-Is there another material that would be better than wood? Considering if 3D printing one would be better and safer. 

Any other ideas or feedback is welcome! ",3,1728353862.0,snakes,3,1.0,False

I'm tired of being affected by their problems that they refuse to address. A month ago I was sitting in the kitchen at 2am having some coffee when my dad came out of the bedroom with all of his pistols and proceeded to hide them. He didn't even say anything to me, I had to ask. He then told me that my mom is cheating again and that he's going to file for divorce (third time around). The hiding of the guns was because he was afraid she might try to kill herself..she lost her father to suicide and has made threats before. But I just sat there stone faced as my dad told me everything because it's nothing new. The last time this happened he hid all of the knives because he was afraid she might try to stab him in his sleep. He slept in the garage because of it. Upon being served the first time she told him she hopes he burns to death in a car accident. He backed out of the divorce and then it was as if nothing ever happened. 

Fast forward to now.. for the past several weeks I've watched my parents go from not even looking at each other to cuddling on the couch like nothing  happened. Again. And I'm supposed to go along with it. I'll say one thing that has given me a smidge of respect for them is that they both admitted they never should have gotten married nor had kids and that they're sorry. I appreciated that. Still want nothing to do with them. The other side of the planet isn't far away enough honestly ",4,1728353798.0,areweinhell,1,1.0,False
1fyp80o,https://www.reddit.com/r/rusted_satellite/comments/1fyp80o/opinion_shapeshifting_ufo_spotted_over_bogot√°/,"""Opinion: Shape-shifting UFO spotted over Bogot√°""","[This image of a UFO was captured April 12, 2015 over the city of Bogot√°, Colombia](https://preview.redd.it/i7dzzfk5yftd1.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=86437dea2682cfdc0f48deec03578d6a70c77019)

As the Director and Editor-in-chief of Colombia‚Äôs English language newspaper, The City Paper, I take journalistic ethics very seriously. I also worked as a photojournalist for the Black Star photo agency in New York for over 10 years, covering conflicts in Colombia and Angola, photo essays across Asia and South and Central America.

I have had the honor of having my work published in prestigious publications such as TIME, Der Spiegel, Stern, Marie Claire,¬†*The New York Times*¬†and many others. I do not manipulate my images.

On Sunday, April 12, I stepped out onto my balcony, which faces east and is located in the Rosales neighborhood of Bogot√°. As is a bad habit, I enjoy a morning coffee with a cigarette. It was a grey, Sunday morning, the streets were empty, and washed with a light drizzle from the night, which had passed.

As I looked up and beyond the red walls of my¬†*barrio,*¬†I saw a black round object rise vertically into the sky, from behind a ridge of the¬†*Cerros Orientales*. At a possible distance of 5 kms, the shape was rounded and appeared like a spot against the uniformity of grey, which was blanketing¬†this capital of eight million.

As a frustrated commercial airline pilot, I also know my plane configurations. Up close or from great distances. I know how to distinguish the sound of an Airbus A 340 to a Boeing 777. I have studied flight maps, flight routes and Flightaware. I understand these machines. I admire them. There was no fuselage, no winglets, no sound. This was no plane.

[This image of a UFO was captured over the eastern mountains in Bogota, Colombia. \(Richard Emblin\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hctp52cyftd1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b743b22b4554047ce762b5d544fce414ca87037)

The black dot began to unravel itself. It stopped under the melancholic canopy of cloud and darted south, where it shifted on its side. I abandoned the cigarette for my connected iPhone. It said 7:55 am. I tried to look for the object in the sky. It was¬†hovering West and moving between altitudes, over the Chapinero neighborhood of Bogot√° and which sits at 2,600 meters above sea level.

The spot was not visible on the screen of my iPhone. I tried to look for it again with my eyes, but the black object had shifted in the sky above my building. I thought it might head towards the airport, so I grabbed my Nikon 300s and tried to remember where I keep a 500 mm lens, which I use only when there is a full moon. And not even.

I mounted the lens and went towards my kitchen which faces East, and with an uninspired view of the SENA tower. There it was, and now moving in a bizarre, erratic manner.

I tried to focus (had forgotten this vital skill with a 500 mm, fixed f.8) and pointed my lens towards the other side of Bogot√°. The object was not one, but two it seemed.

As it stopped for a fleeting moment over the Camp√≠n area of town, an Avianca Airbus A320 had just taken off and was doing its mandatory right bank over the Calle 68. The plane was possibly heading to Cali. The pilots of the flight and Air Traffic Control Tower of El Dorado might have seen the object if I could from my kitchen.

It was very evident to me that this was an Unidentified Flying Object ‚Äì UFO. No Drone. No Sunday morning balloon flight over a capital in which only official helicopters (Police and Army) can patrol. No small planes are allowed to cross the Colombian capital, expect with a very special permit handed down from the Aeronautica Civil (Civil Aviation Authority).

All small aircraft must depart from Guaymaral and circumnavigate Bogot√°, allowing space for commercial jets to do their difficult take off procedure from the West to East, and at a high altitude, and with a mountain range facing the airport‚Äôs main, two runways, just 8 kms away.

[The UFO appeared to change shape and color while flying higher in the sky above Bogota. \(Richard Emblin\)](https://preview.redd.it/4lbzq1zhyftd1.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3e80396dbc0676c2df91ebccaf6a485858585a)

My photography skills are rusty. I take few pictures these days:¬†mostly portraits and stills for the pages of my newspaper. I could discern that the object shifted its shape. Could rise and fall quickly, and zip from one end of the city in a matter of seconds.

The rising Airbus as it headed to southern shores seemed heavy and lethargic by comparison. The black dot seemed to have rings. It then tilted, shifted to one side, and disappeared.

I left the kitchen and connected the Compact Flash card to my Mac. I opened Photoshop CS and zoomed in on my UFO. At times, it was black and rounded, then two rings were evident. With a closer look, the rings were golden.

The pictures are as they were captured, with shaky hands and guarded¬†breath. I cropped several of them to examine the shape against the grey sky. Make your own conclusions. I am not here to convince you. That is not my objective. Just that this wet Sunday in Bogot√°, something mysterious was seen over Bogot√° and for which I have no answers.

We installed it in our kitchen b/c we didn't want to worry about porous natural stone and we liked the clean look of it (we got a finish that doesn't have a fake look the way quartz often does). It also doesn't use silica in it's manufacturing, which is a major bonus.

However, within a few months of living with it, three areas have chipped off the edges, just from putting coffee mugs down near the edges. The Lapitec manufacturer says it 100% should not have chipped and it's the fabricator's fault. They're saying the fabricator did a poor job mitering the edges (it's a \~3/4"" slab with 1.5"" built up edges). Normally you'd find chipping in high-use areas like around the sink edges, but our sink edge is 100% intact, possibly because the sink edge is the 3/4"" slab and there's no miter on that edge. So maybe it truly is something with the fabrication of the edges...The fabricator has disappeared. But the stone company who sourced it for us is willing to give us a credit for new countertops, and our contractor is going to comp the demo and install of the new countertops. Which is incredibly generous and we're so grateful.

And now we're left with the decision - risk Lapitec again or do something totally different? Does anyone have experience with Lapitec in your kitchen or a high use area? I love the look of it, it cleans so well, you can put hot pans on it - it's truly perfect but for the chipped edges on ours. If the chipping is truly a fabricator issue then we could just get a slab and not build up the edges (which led to the mitered edge). But I feel stupid even contemplating getting Lapitec again. Our architect is advising against it just to be on the safe side.

If anyone has any Lapitec advice/experience I'm all ears!

This is the beginning of a great journey that will hopefully use technology to ACTUALLY connect people!! It's one I've been on for some time, but today is the day of the first reddit post, meaning we're going live with it! The app is called chit chat and and it connects you to other people nearby using bluetooth. This way, if you're at a coffee shop or a concert, you'll be able to get notified if someone nearby is in the same community and you can meet right away to make a new friend! The beautiful part is you get to go back to focusing on you normal life and let the app build your friend group by making introducitons, instead of you having to constantly cold approach people in new situations. It can also be used to break down old social barriers at places that are uncommon for people to meet like parks, coffee shops, libraires, etc. Imagine being able to make friends and meet people some where other than a bar (I would personally love this). I think my ideal customer is someone sitting in a coffee shop wanting to make friends in a new city, and wishing there was a way it could just happen more naturally as he moved through his normal daily routine.

1fyp0xz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyp0xz,Great results after 2 months - some guidance needed. ,"36M keto survivor - A bit over two months ago my LDL came in at 190  and my blood pressure was quite elevated - my primary care doctor said I'd likely need to go on medication, but gave me a couple months to try do lifestyle changes. 

After some changes in diet and exercise, I got back some encouraging results. LDL came down to 146, while HDL moved higher.

Dr was happy and said to keep up the progress. However I noticed that my VLDL and triglycerides both went from normal to out of range. I wonder if this is a normal part of reducing LDL or if I should focus on something special going forward? 

In terms of diet: 

- Went from almost no carbs (keto) to a meaningful amount of carbs to get my fiber intake up (daily oats and berries, lots of beans, lentils, quinoa, high fiber cereal, seeded bread, high fiber pasta, and supplementing with psyllium). 
- Went from red meat 4-5 times a week to once every two weeks. 
- Went from 2 eggs almost every day to 1-2 eggs a week. 
- Stopped drinking alcohol completely (from 5-10 drinks a week). 
- Went from 3 coffees a day to 1 coffee a week, some tea here and there (mainly for blood pressure). 
- Salad for lunch 2-3 times a week. Sushi/sashimi 2 times a week. 
- Avoided saturated fat (butter, cheese, pastries, coconut oil, fried stuff). 

Tracked intake closely until I was able to get a good handle of nutrition content- got fiber up to 30-50gr per day and saturated fat down to 10-15g per day. 

Have a lot of weight to lose (currently 97kg, ideally should be closer to 72kg). Started very easy the last couple of months by walking 30-40 minutes on weekdays and longer walks on weekends - plan to focus on caloric restriction/high intensity exercise going forward.

This is the beginning of a great journey that will hopefully use technology to ACTUALLY connect people!! It's one I've been on for some time, but today is the day of the first reddit post, meaning we're going live with it! The app is called chit chat and and it connects you to other people nearby using bluetooth. This way, if you're at a coffee shop or a concert, you'll be able to get notified if someone nearby is in the same community and you can meet right away to make a new friend! The beautiful part is you get to go back to focusing on you normal life and let the app build your friend group by making introducitons, instead of you having to constantly cold approach people in new situations. It can also be used to break down old social barriers at places that are uncommon for people to meet like parks, coffee shops, libraires, etc. Imagine being able to make friends and meet people some where other than a bar (I would personally love this). I think my ideal customer is someone sitting in a coffee shop wanting to make friends in a new city, and wishing there was a way it could just happen more naturally as he moved through his normal daily routine.

I almost never visit him and it weighs heavily on me that we don't see each other much and that we don't have much of a relationship. But there are many reasons for this. I'll try not to give my life story here and instead just give the Cole's notes. I am 34M, dad is 70, stepmom is 64.

* Some of my earliest memories as a child are my dad yelling/being gruff and unfriendly. I was scared of him
* Parents split up when I was very young. I have memories of biweekly visitation as a child and being bored out of my mind because dad didn't really do anything with me when I visited
* around age 8 or 9 I decided I didn't want to visit my dad on weekends anymore, mom didn't force me
* Went a few years without seeing him, don't remember any calls on my birthday or holidays. He was just absent
* Age 11 I feel regret that I never see my dad, start biking to his house occasionally to visit him. Visits generally go nowhere but I try
* Summer of my 12th year dad invites me to a family+friends backyard BBQ. he gets drunk, hurts me on purpose, I hit him in retaliation, he beats me up. I don't see him again until age 15 or 16
* Age 16 I start visiting my dad again (again, I made the effort) out of a feeling of regret for no relationship. Things seem to be going okay and my relationship with my mom isn't great due 100% to my teen angst. Move in with dad for a few months, but ultimately move back in with mom because relationship deteriorates over the course of 6 months. Probably a lot of fault on my end. When I was 16 I was an angsty, dumb, selfish kid
* Years go by, only spotty contact with dad. Age 22, mom suddenly dies. Dad is actually surprisingly there for me, helps me through it a bit, relationship improves. But by the time I'm 25, relationship has really fizzled out again
* Age 28, dad and step-mom seal the deal and actually get married. I'm in the wedding party, but mainly treated like a servant. Dad puts constant demands on me to do this and that for his wedding, generally acts like a jerk
* Age 29, step-mom gets really drunk and punches me at Easter dinner over a very stupid squabble between me and step-sister. I leave indignant, dad takes step-mom's side. covid hits, literally don't see him & stepmom for like 2 years
* Post-covid, try to visit some times. Hate step-mom's guts because she's a drunk and a bitch on so many levels, but I pretend to love her for my dad's sake because she's his whole world and despite our difficult relationship I still want to show respect for him. But relationship is totally stagnant. We don't get invites even for family dinners on holidays for the most part anymore

This is a really rough timeline and leaves a lot out.

Whenever my partner and I visit my dad, we can barely get a word out of him. He sits and watches sports and mainly just gives 1-3 word answers to anything we say. Can almost never engage in an actual conversation with him. He smokes inside so my partner and I end up smelling horrible if we visit for more than a few minutes. We're never invited to stay for dinner. Not that we are entitled to that, but still, we're family. If I try to tell him what's going on in my life, usually the most I get is ""Well, that's good for you, \_\_\_\_"" (not giving my name here, rather stay anon). If I call him and try to talk, same thing. Pointless conversation.

A few years ago I gifted a very large and slightly older big screen TV to a nephew of mine (son of one of my step-sisters). It was in great condition but one of these super heavy models. He wanted me to drive it to his house (30 km over in the next town) and I said no, I needed help to move it, I would hurt myself if I tried to move it alone. Or, I said they could pay me for the gas to deliver it and I would get someone to help me. I thought that was fair since I was giving it away for free. Dad got angry but reluctantly agreed to just come pick it up. When he showed up he refused to even stay for a coffee.

He has literally never come to visit me and my partner. He lives in the next town over and won't visit us. I don't invite him because I suspect he wouldn't come and it would hurt too much to actually give an invite and have it rejected.

I have three stepsisters who are a few years older than me. Despite growing up around them, they all ignore my existence and didn't even invite me to their weddings. They don't hate me, they chat me up whenever I'm at a family function and they refer to me as their 'brother'. They don't actually include me in their lives at all and never have. And I don't want to include them in mine, because I don't really like any of them. Plus one of them made racist remarks to my partner, who is not white, and her partner is an overt racist. So I have no feelings of closeness with them.

Dad treats all the stepsisters like his own. He parented them and loves them to bits. Has pictures of them and their kids in the house, sees them regularly, and they love him back just as much. They're a big happy family that I don't feel included in.

Dad and stepmom have zero pictures of me in the house and have never asked for one. I feel pathetic offering them a picture of me and my partner to keep in the house. Why bother?

Last year at Christmas we got invited for dinner, but I had to give up my car due to cost of living. I asked dad if he would come pick us up and I'd cab home. He said no, because then he couldn't drink.

Despite the fact that my dad is completely emotionally unavailable to me, always has been, doesn't visit, doesn't invite me to much of anything, and doesn't show any care for me while having a thriving familial relationship with all my stepsisters, he still occasionally lectures me that I need to visit more often and implies that our difficult relationship is my fault. Some times I wonder if I'm a bad son. Maybe I should be making more of an effort. Maybe I should just show up more often and accept that I'm the black sheep that no one really cares about and sit there while he smokes and says nothing and just accept that that is our relationship.

My partner reluctantly told me that if/when we have kids, she doesn't want them around my dad and stepmom, because she sees how much their entire world is all about my stepsisters and their kids and that they obviously don't care about me, and she doesn't want our kids to go to family dinners or holidays and feel excluded by their grandparents. She doesn't really want my dad and stepmom in the lives of our future children. And I wasn't even mad at her for saying that. I agree with her.

I  have a coworker who told me today that his fridge is totally stocked with food because his dad came to visit him on the weekend. It made me feel terrible. I'm happy for my friend who has a good family. I feel sad that I don't and that my dad would never show up and bring me food. Not when I was 20 and in college, not now, not ever. I can't help wonder what fault I have that has caused this.

This is super long. If you actually read, thanks.

Maybe you wanted the masseuse's hands to drift toward intimate parts of your body.

Maybe you enjoy someone else using toys on your private areas.

But it never happened... So, the idea of having someone put all their attention on you sexually like this is what you crave.

With time, patience and attention we can together have a life-changing erotic experience. Nothing is sexier than a woman who is open-minded and in-tune with her body. I enjoy giving an erotic massage to this type of woman. Let's just say that I have a very special set of skills.

We can start by chatting and then meeting for coffee to talk about your desires. Your comfort will come easy as you notice that I am a pure gentleman and that I am trustworthy. I'm a very a clean-cut Italian man with a warm smile and soft yet firm hands. We discuss desire and comforts about what you like and how the massage would proceed.

I know that sometimes having an orgasm takes a lot of work and that sometimes a woman focuses a long-time in order to orgasm. I don't want you to stress or try to concentrate so hard on not losing your focus. Let me help.

I would start with a caring gentle massage, absolutely relaxing your body. Then, my hands will start exploring the places you would always want a masseuse to explore. You're lying on your stomach while I work your legs and getting close to your upper thighs nearing your sweet spot. My soft hands work your inner thighs, teasing and playing. You shift your body so that my hands would get the message and see you getting wet.

I want you to think about this as orgasm therapy of the most erotic kind!

I want you to orgasm with intense pleasure like you feel an entire waterfall going down your body!

I want you to have a feeling of sublime and total pleasure!

Maybe you want more, so I turn you over and start massaging your breasts. You crave more and are now putty in my hands. You close your eyes and wait for my fingers to drift towards your breasts and nipples. My soft fingers are making your nipples hard. I am rubbing and then gently suck on each nipple by taking my time to devour them. My breast and nipple play is intense and builds up over a while. You get even wetter and then suddenly you are on fire. Your sensitive nipples are going to setup for another orgasm to rush through your body.

It's hard to think of anything that feels better than a man's hands, fingers and kisses all over your body. You think about this relaxed and cozy orgasm. Then, you start to think about how you could've come again and again. The whole time you are happy and smiling and in awe of your own naughtiness.

So, if you're interested then please message me and tell me all about yourself by sharing your age, location, ethnicity and what you look like. Thanks!",1,1728352117.0,MassageNearMe,0,1.0,False

Recently I had an intensely stressful period of a few weeks dealing with an unexpected family issue. The issue is currently being managed but I‚Äôve been struggling with mental health after the emotional blow. It has manifested in severe morning depression‚Äîwake up with a deep sense of dread and negativity, can‚Äôt get out of bed, and this depression doesn‚Äôt go away until around noon or early afternoon. The rest of the day and evening is better. 

Also while dealing with the stressful situation I was pretty much running on adrenaline/cortisol, I think‚Äînow that the most difficult period has passed, I thought I would feel better but instead feeling more exhausted and depressed. I wonder if it‚Äôs an adrenaline crash. 

I am not really keen on upping my meds because of the loading period of Prozac (6-8 weeks for me when I first started) and don‚Äôt think I can cope with feeling extra shitty in my current emotionally exhausted state. I try to get 8 hours of sleep and only take 1 cup of coffee after lunch. 

Anyway, just wanted to know if anyone has had similar experiences with morning depression after a stressful hit and how long it took to go back to normal/baseline, and anything that helped you.",1,1728351904.0,mentalhealth,4,1.0,False

I received my provisional pass today. I genuinely don't think I would have even achieved this without the community here. Thank you all!

**Resources that I used:**

* **Andrew Ramdayal's Udemy course** - This was a great base to start with. His delivery is very thorough and straightforward. He goes over everything you need to know.
* **PM Prep Simplified - Book by AR**. Very dense. I started to read it and about 1/3 of the way through, I learned this wasn't my learning style. I did use this later on while studying to refer to the 49-process chart visual, but I don't think I needed to buy this.
* **PM Illustrated by Mike Griffiths** - I have an iPad, and my Amazon Prime account gave me 3 free months of Kindle Unlimited (Check if you have a free trial too! The book is expensive to buy). I was able to download this for free with that trial. The website does have a lot of great info even without the book. The book helped me A LOT. The way things are explained is the way I personally need things explained for me to understand.
* **David McLachlan 200, 150, 100, and drag-and-drop question videos** - This man is a legend. His positivity and encouragement really helped me push through.
* **PMI Study Hall** - I'm glad I did this so I could get comfortable with the exam-style questions and format.
* **ChatGPT** - If I didn't understand a concept, I would ask it to explain XYZ to me ""simplified"" or in a real-life example.
* **PMI Pocket Prep** - I used the free version here and there. Waiting in line at the grocery store, when I'd wake up and knew I should study but didn't want to get out of bed yet, etc. I liked this app a lot!
* **ThirdRock notes** - They're great, but I don't think they suited my learning style. I ended up writing out all of my own notes. I did print these though and would flip through occasionally, but I don't feel I got the full value from them as others do.

**My Study Hall scores:**

They were kind of all over the place. I did one full mock and received a 72%. My practice exams ranged between 50ish%-80ish%.

**Tips for exam day:**

* **Get plenty of sleep the night before** - If you think you can pound back an energy drink or coffee during your breaks and not have biological needs during the exam, I admire you. The exam made me SLEEPY. The room was warm, silent, and you can't really move around much to keep yourself stimulated.
* **Take your breaks** - They go by in the blink of an eye, but taking a few sips of water and stretching my back helped me a lot.
* **Brain dump** on your paper or whiteboard right when you start - I wrote down my formulas, 49-process mnemonics, and a schedule of what time I should be at for each set of questions.
* **Do a drive-by** before exam day - My testing center was on a massive college campus. I am so glad I went to find where I was going before test day. I had to park in a specific garage and walk quite a bit to the building.
* **Can confirm, the mindset is key.**

**My thoughts on the exam:**

* The questions were extremely similar to Study Hall. My test seemed to get more difficult with each section. The 3rd set of questions seemed way harder than the first set, but I was also starting to get mentally fatigued, which did not help.
* I had 3 drag-and-drop and 2 formula-related questions, but nothing I had to solve. It was more about understanding what the numbers meant and how I would solve the situational issue based on the numbers.
* Sitting in that exam chair answering questions for 4 straight hours was challenging for me. Once you understand the mindset, the questions won't give you any trouble and you'll be cruising really. I rate my test medium difficulty.
* In my exam center, everyone was sitting really close to each other. It was distracting for me because the other folks would be mumbling, tapping, etc. Someone had on really strong perfume that started to hurt my head. New level of forced focus unlocked after this, that's for sure!

**My background is Creative Project Management.** I took AR's course a few months ago, but officially started buckling down 4 weeks ago. I studied 4-5 hours every evening and 6-8+ hours each day of the weekend.

1fyol9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seneca/comments/1fyol9t/organizationcommunication_problems/,Organization/Communication problems,"Hello, so I'm in my 3rd semester of the law clerk program and need to vent a bit about how poorly organized the field placement is.

Today I had an interview at a law firm for my field placement. They've taken approximately 3 weeks to get several students (including myself) in contact with a firm, some students haven't even been in contact yet. The field placement coordinators already had an idea of who would pass/fail since one of the profs taught 2 of our classes last semester. In addition, they needed us to get our unofficial transcripts FROM Seneca. I'll repeat that:

The people with access to our transcripts needed us to download and send them the transcripts that they have access to...They could have literally just requested the transcripts themselves (or have it automated based on enrollment).

During the interview, the Lawyer had not been made aware of the fact that this was for a field placement position as the college basically sent him my resume with a ""will you look at this?"" type email. He was under the impression that I had already graduated and was looking for full time work.  He also pointed out how having a student in 1-2 days a week is a waste because with that limited amount of time; not much progress will be made on a legal case (and I have to admit that I completely agree with him on that, like what am I actually expected to do? fetch dry cleaning? make coffee? sit behind the guy and read his emails over the shoulder?).

I'm also not the only one having problems, 4 other students that I know of and speak to regularly have either not been contacted at all or have been ghosted entirely by the hosts.

This isn't the first time I've been enrolled in a program with a co-op/field placement. The last one I was enrolled in was at Georgian College and their program is so organized that it's basically clockwork. The students are given access to a list of placements that the college has worked with in the past and have room for students, then the students contact the employer, interview and make all of the necessary arrangements in order to work full time at the placement. The school basically does all of the work in the background. This all gets set up and arranged about a month in advance of the actual start time of the placement. The start of the placement is after all of the academic classes have been completed, meaning that you're in school, take your classes, do a co-op placement and then are basically transitioning into the workplace.

Seneca on the opposite end of the spectrum, the students have to do all of the work that should be done in the background, sending the admin files and documents while Seneca finds possible hosts and then the student will randomly get an email (or phone call in my case) from a possible placement seemingly out of nowhere. Students have no idea if it's a real job or their placement because there's no context given. Seneca also tries to organize this to once a week as though it was a class. What potential employer wants someone in once a week?!

In reality, Seneca should have the possible placements already on hand before the semester starts, then put the students into contact with those placements (based on relative proximity/preference), once they're in contact, the student then should be the ones to make the arrangements (treat it like what it is, a real job), setting up interviews and contacting firms, and all after the academic side of things have been completed. Learn, practice, then put it all into action.

-------------------------------

Field placement has just been the most recent issue. Between semester 2 and 3, nearly the entirety of the Law Clerk program was nearly left in the dust because none of us were made aware of the deposit that was required for the fall term. This led to many of us having that notorious issue a few weeks ago where our classes were full and had to be manually inserted into classes. We all received those ""here's your top 5"" spam emails every week, but was there a single mention of important dates to pay money by? Nope! I get email after email about joining clubs or other opportunities, but when it comes time for the opportunity to give Seneca a necessary payment? well informing students would be too much effort. My class wanted to give the college our money, but holy crap they didn't seem to want to inform us that they wanted it!

-----------------

It all just seems so back-ass-wards, the lack of communication when it's important, the over communication for things that aren't important. How no one seems to be able to give anyone a straight answer, how every issue seems to only have a solution of ""contact your student advisor"". Even then, when you try to contact someone, you cannot physically pick up the phone to call, it has to be over a shitty web client so that they can open up a customer service ticket and take several weeks to reply with an email that takes less than 30 seconds to compose. Hell, even the classes pretty much boil down to the profs reading verbatim off of slides without really adding anything of substance.",1,1728351723.0,Seneca,0,1.0,False

(Lost 9.8lbs in one week),"I've been dieting and working out since mid-January so it's been 9 months and I'm down 122lbs and I've taken 6-8 inches off my waist.  I've been following a Keto, Paleo style diet.  I'm eating high protein, low carb, healthy fats and try to get plenty of fiber.  I also have been using intermittent fasting which has become more like OMAD 'One Meal A Day' with long 22-24 hour fasting in between.  Anyway, recently my GF went away on a cruise with her sister for a week.  We live together, are super duper very much in love and spend every minute together that we can.  So when she went on this cruise, I was bored, lonely and had zero appetite.  I barely ate one meal each day.  I just didn't feel like eating at all.  The day she left, I had a small breakfast burrito and coffee for breakfast and nothing else.  The next day I didn't eat until dinner nearly 32 hours from the breakfast that I had the day before and dinner was salmon, broccoli and milk.  I know the next day I only ate lunch where I had three hardboiled eggs and an avocado and nothing else.  Anyway, I lost 9.8lbs that week a far cry from the usual 2-3.  Eating that little isn't the best long term of course and when I workout I definitely eat more.  I'll have more on workout days and definitely sprinkle some carbs into the mix but I'll only eat them earlier in the day and avoid them later in the day.

Officer Orion Blake sat in his cruiser, sipping his coffee, as the crackling of his police radio filled the silence. It was an ordinary evening, one of those peaceful ones where nothing seemed out of place. It should have made him feel at ease, but a knot of tension sat heavy in his chest.

He glanced down at his files‚Äîit was the worse part of his job. His daughter, Sarah, had been at school all day, probably still working on the Homecoming decorations with her friends. It was hard to believe she was almost done with high school, growing up faster than he was ready for. Mila Weston and Talon Payne were in her grade‚Äîkids Orion knew all too well from the various patrols around town, but Sarah always seemed to stay out of trouble. She had her mother‚Äôs sense, he always said.

A familiar voice crackled through his radio, interrupting his thoughts. Rylan stein, his old friend and colleague, was on the other end, checking in as usual.

""All quiet over there, Orion?"" Rylan‚Äôs voice held that soft humor Orion had come to rely on. 

""Yeah,"" Orion replied, trying to shake the unease from his voice. ""Too quiet, maybe.""

""Better quiet than chaos,"" Rylan chuckled. ""Heading over to check on mila, make sure everything‚Äôs okay with her. I don‚Äôt trust these prank calls that have been going around."" 

Orion frowned, fingers tightening on the steering wheel. ""You think there‚Äôs more to them?""

Rylan paused. ""Don‚Äôt know. Probably just some kids messing around. Still, keep an eye out.""

""Will do."" Orion clicked off the radio, but that strange sense of foreboding lingered. He couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling something was brewing beneath Woodsboro‚Äôs quiet surface. Something wrong.

He took another swig of his now lukewarm coffee, eyes drifting to the dashboard photo of Sarah. Her smile lit up the frame, carefree and full of life. The thought of anything happening to her was unimaginable, but the nagging feeling in his gut wouldn‚Äôt go away.

That night, when he returned home, Sarah was already fast asleep. He stood in the doorway of her room for a moment, watching her breathe. A peaceful moment. It wasn‚Äôt often he got home early enough to see her these days, the job pulling him in every direction.

""Love you, kid,"" he whispered before closing the door gently behind him.

","Nottingham can be a miserable place. It seems like you're someone who they allow to be happy because you do their work, or they go out of their way to kill you. I don't know at what point the sherriff of Nottingham seemed to win the battle, but it seems to have been long before I was born. Now they make us believe they're helping us, when they're the people who pushed us into the gutter. They take everything from us. Anything that makes us happy. They create bass music to hypnotise us into killing each other. Do you know why we get hypnotised by bass? It's the only sound we hear in the womb. All the voices you hear, all the sounds from the world, get translated into vibrations that feed into our eardrum whilst our bodies are forming. It means that as we get older, if you're someone who they want to torture, you'll gravitate towards bass heavy music because of your sumbliminal want to escape the world that they've built for us. If you go back through music history, you'll find hip hop was similar to punk. They were both an expression of people who were telling their story of their oppression. Grandmaster Flash's ""The Message"" is a prime example. During the nineties they seemed to manipulate that message. They didn't want music that told people who was holding people back and why. They wanted us to hear stories about how we should make money off killing each other. They did the same with punk and ska in the UK. They were expressions of the UK's working class coming together with political messages about the lack of care that had been bestowed among us. They manipulated the punk scene by changing it's audience into being about racism. They couldn't have the people they were trying to oppress and keep separate coming together to vocalise their disdain about the people who oppress us. Look at what's happening with Diddy. His dad was in the military. The people backing Biggies rise were fbi informants. They took the position they'd put people into and manipulated their pain into something they could use to have us all murder each other and glorify it. The term ""ghetto comes from back in the 1500's and was used to describe areas where there was a large Jewish population. During the 1800's, it began to describe largely over populated, impoverished areas. They realised they did not need to put people behind bars. If they could shove everybody they didn't like into one area, deprive them of money and ways of farming, they would kill each other to survive, or sell their soul to the other side to escape the hell they'd been put into. Over time, through the experiments in nazi Germany and the US they realised that if they combined this with programming and drugs, it tightened their grip. Now they give us stars and stories who they don't have to manipulate. They give you a working class hero and all they have to do is have that person describe life as they saw it. If you're surrounded by drug dealers making money, people being glorified who kill people, they just let that play out. It makes it so that the people coming through idolise these people and the atrocities they talk about. If you are tortured by your surroundings, your family life is non existent, you look to your programming. Music, tv, film. When all you see is people that look and sound like you murdering their own people, it makes it easier for them to divide and conquer.

Take what's going on in my home town. Minority report after minority report. There seems to be a movement, that I'm sure has existed for decades at least which is growing stronger and stronger. They identify children as potential issues or having screws that are easy to turn whilst their as young as five. Talking back to teachers, being from a different area, going against the grain, an unconventional home life. It can be as simple as having a hair cut they don't like. Over time, they know those children will gravitate towards programming that is discussing crime, criminals being manipulated to be the alternative to the law, who are in fact working for the law. They know that these kids will more than likely seek assistance from voices which have been predestined to attempt to ruin their lives further. If the mind constraints and poisoning of the areas they have attempted to ruin doesn't work, and communities come together to help their own, they manipulate the programming. They manipulate the medication. They know the health service serves all around the world to murder, not to help. Take the medication they tried to put me on earlier this year. ""Mirtazerpine"". I said to my doctor when he gave it to me, ""this sounds like mi - military intelligence, tazer - an electronic weapon used to stun, pine = of the pineal gland, something used to refer to your third eye, or your minds eye. If you are hardwired not to trust the government, you go to drug dealers. You hear rappers and singers talking about weed positively. Weed, something that grows in your garden that strangles all the other plants or cocaine, (c.o.= covert operative, Caine = the brother who killed able or ability). I'm not saying that all of these substances are bad taken in moderation. If you eat red meat once every so often it can do wonders for you. If you eat it every meal every day it does not. They poison our water supply and they feed us fast food with no nutritional value. We seek the energy we should have naturally because they poison everything to dull us down. We seek the effects of weed because our bodies aren't tired enough to sleep deeply because we're too lazy from the poison to want to be active. If you combine a want to heal your mind from the surroundings you're faced with and you start to use drugs as I did, as an escape, you end up escaping from seeing the war in front of your eyes. When you use drugs combined with bass heavy hypnotic music that is telling you to kill everyone around you, you end up with areas in the UK filled with people who's only escape into riches and happiness comes from murdering those around them. It changes the neuro chemistry by releasing serotonin that was deprived from not having basic needs and requirements met. If whole communities of people got together and instead of pissing all their money up the wall began to invest in people or business ideas started from people in their own areas they would no longer need to sustain themselves with those who seek to poison them. And they can't have that. Instead, we give our money to dealers who will end up in prison or working for them. All that money going straight back to the police, either being lifted as black cash or taken straight into evidence. When we do not help our own areas, they use our own poverty that they have created to drive down the property value. They put us in debt through loans, credit cards, mortgages and they turn screws so that we cannot afford to pay them so that they can buy the property up for cheap and then they rent it back to us. Here's an example of how they push us out of work;

I started working at somewhere called ""shoes"" a couple of years ago. I'm going to forgo the fucking story telling and try to keep it factual. I compiled a 10,000 document whilst working there that I presented to HR and two general managers and they pushed me out of the company, so they quite clearly know everything I saw and don't give a fuck. shoes is a pharmaceutical company started in the late 1800's in Nottingham, by a man who wanted to provide affordable healthcare for the people of Nottingham. He saw that the people around him were getting infections, injuries, diseases etc that they could not afford to heal. He used his ability in business to procure deals that meant he could help them live a better life. This business was passed onto his son and somewhere in the 60's they created a medication which is still widely used all around the world on a daily basis, in both daily life and in hospitals. Shoes is no longer owned by people that want to help the people. It was bought out by ceilingblue around ten years ago. ceilingblue are a company who were fined $10.7 billion for their part in incorrectly prescribing opiates to the US population. This was a drop in the ocean to them in comparison to what they had made off the murder of the people they had prescribed it to, so they have continued operating in the same way that they did before. The ceo of shoes, was best friends with one of our recent tory prime ministers. If you look at what the tories did to the NHS, it seemed like all of a sudden, every service was over run. They couldn't get you in for an appointment. Hospital waiting rooms over run. Paramedics stretched. Nurses leaving in droves. They positioned tories in every place they could to apply strain on every sector over the years they were in power. They used ""quiet firing"" tactics to push people out of work, so that they would look to be supported by private health care systems. Whilst working at shoes, I saw that they were ready to roll out their own private health care systems, with their own doctors and their own ability to prescribe medication en masse. Look at that however you want but you should make it simple; tories in power, NHS starts going down and it's understaffed in all departments. tories take over pharmaceutical company in a run down town that started with the sole intention of providing affordable healthcare for the people in said town. Said tory starts to roll out their idea for their own private healthcare system. Get the fuck out of here. Whilst I was working there I started to break down what I was seeing. They pull a load of people in over xmas for their busy period. This starts in around October. They mainly use the unemployment register to pull people through. They intentionally pick people with spotty employment histories, knowing that they can push them out easily. They would turn screws using everything at hand. Punishing people for going one minute over a break time. Punishing people for going to the toilet outside of breaktimes, which would sometimes be three hours a part. Finding out if people had mental health issues, getting them to open up about it, sharing it amongst their ""leadership team"" and having those people go and take their coffee breaks near someone and discussing their mental health openly around them but using a different name, something they could use to insult them. They would allow people they'd promoted to spend their days turning up late, spending all day in the smoking area and talking shit all day gossiping so that it would further enrage the people they would bully. Why do they do all of this? If you do not have the required amount of people on the phones taking calls to service your products, you receive a huge fine. So what they do is they get a huge influx of people through in winter. They barely train them, so they are anxious on the phones and they do not have the required skill set to deal with the issues. Even if you do have the required skill set, they were using software that was about fifteen years old and a tech team that could barely use excel so that your system would crash trying to switch to another screen. If the customer was to complain, more often than not, after spending an hour on the phone holding, they would then get transferred three times between over worked staff members who would then tell them that they would have to speak to a directors complaint department. The directors complaint department was completely swamped dealing with medication issues so the backlog would be huge. They would promise they would get back to the customers within 72 hours, but that would mean is some automated email saying they were looking into it. By this point most people have just fucked off the complaint, so have paid for a faulty product, spent a bunch of time trying to get through to someone and then have received trash service. They knew that after January, the calls would die down again and they would only need the amount of people they had prior to October in order to not receive a fine. So lets make this simple; a company that has made the majority of it's money off selling heroin to people with bruises who support a political organisation who's motto is fuck the poor, use people who are out of work and looking for work who they pick to make sure they have mental health issues, so that they can bully them out of work as soon as they're in a position to not receive a fine any longer. I questioned the manager of the floor about this. He replied with ""you're very clever you are"" and gave me a promotion. I saw single mothers having their addictions used as black mail. I saw racism cascaded out like it was nothing. I took a phone call from someone saying they were getting bullied by their pharmacist over their cancer medication. They told me they wanted to commit suicide. At the end of the call I was told my call times were too long. They don't give a fuck about us. They use these systems so they can get us to rack up debt, fire us, and have us fuck up our repayments causing us to look worse in the eyes of society. Driving down the prices of our towns, so they can swoop in and gentrify it all. Look at what's happening in the US. These same people flood middle class areas with homeless people and addicts who can't afford health care to drive down the housing prices by making it so that people don't want to use to the businesses in those areas. They buy up all the property, redevelop it all into high price flats and housing and they move the homeless and the addicts down the road to somewhere else where they make it near enough legal to do drugs in the street, starting the cycle again. If we don't start taking care of our own communities they're going to do this all over, again and again and again. We need to take our communities back. We need people in power who don't want to shag the poor for a fiver so they can get a pat on the head from their master. If you are working in one of these businesses and you are from a middle class or working class background, they are making an uncle tom out of you. They are paying you fuck all so you go out and kill your own for them. They don't give a fuck about you. They want you drinking and smoking. They want you racking up debts and contracts to repay. They want to give you just enough money to survive so that you don't want to lose it all and they want to do it whilst they laugh in your face that you're killing your own for pieces of paper.

They force us out of work en masse so they can destroy our areas. Your area plays a part in your credit score. If they can make your credit score matter to you, they can make it so that you want to move out of there if you become successful. They want the people on benefits to struggle. If they're struggling with addiction, they don't want to help you. They're going to send you to ""homeless charities"" which are run by police or churches. They want to deprive you of food, then they want to see what you do to get your fix. When they have something they believe they can hold over your head, they want to get you to do illegal acts the police can't carry out. They lie to people and use trigger points from their life that they've extracted through ""counselling"" and sometimes get them to go as far as murder. After you've become a confidential informant, they'll give you bits of petty cash they've robbed from criminals they've gotten to work for them, and they'll have you thank them for it. They'll have you believe that they're the ones saving your life, when they're the ones who destroyed it. They'll have you give up everything that could have made you happy and they know your serotonin is shot out from the drug abuse they led you into, making it easier for them to tell you life is bleak and the key to understanding life is misery. They kidnap, murder and torture your parents. Then they drug, rape and abuse you. Then they have you go running back to them for help and they have you believe they're the ones saving you. They are fucking scum. They are manipulating my words and meaning because of shit like this. They want people who don't have it bad to keep the charade up because they know they will fall if this all falls. They are making you believe you're weak when they made you weak. They want to tell you it's victim culture. If I take a kid, steal it's parents and start having it's doctor prescribe it heroin, kick it in the head repeatedly, rape it, starve it amongst a bunch of other things, that kid should talk. They tell you it's victim shit to talk about it to trick you into keeping your mouth shut. How do you feel now you know they're laughing at you. How do you feel now you know they set it up to put you in this place. They do not care about you. Everything they're dishing out to you in small quantities was yours by right of birth. They do not want to help you get back on your feet. They want to give you just enough to keep you on the hook. Take the hook out, and piss on it. When your bodies can't take it anymore, they're going to leave you to rot. I've seen the places they leave you to rot. You will be tortured further by no longer having a body or mind to do anything about it. You will decompose and they won't give a fuck because they'll be too busy starting the cycle with the next generation.

They are trying to make out being on the right wing is a key to freedom. Then why do they only allow us to own small businesses? If it becomes medium sized, they will make an offer and if you decline they will destroy the business. They want a glass ceiling. They want to murder the poor, not take us out of that mindset so we can become rich. They are trying to make out I have a problem with shoes because i'm helping people that sell drugs illegally to get a foot hold. They both work for the same master and it is a master who wants to see us burned and murdered in every way they can. They are not your friend. They are not your saviour. They should not be your advisor. I am not trying to get you on my side. I am not trying to get you to do anything other than see what they are doing to us. Open your eyes.

Hello Everyone,

I am on a weight loss journey but do not understand how my body is reacting the way it does. I recently started a diet where I focus solely on protein intake and stop ALL calorie consumption after 8pm. I do not have the luxury of tracking macros, weighing food and meal prepping. 

For your reference I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 25 years old and 200pounds. I weight-lift 3-4 times a week and perform 20-30 mins of cardio 3/4 times a week as well.

My average diet over the last 2 weeks is as follows:

12PM: 8oz coffee with 4oz oat milk and 3 sugars

1:30PM: Lunch

-Grilled chicken Caesar salad with croutons and lite dressing.
-12oz protein shake (oat milk base, dates, chocolate protein, peanut butter, cinnamon and banana)


4/5: Sometimes I drink that C4 energy (10 calories) before my workouts


6:30/7: Random meal (I am usually bloated at this point but I can tell I am hungry!)

These meals could either be:
-Tuna salad with a slice of bread (80% of the tin)
-Some form of rice and meat (decently sized portion: not overkill)
-Burger and hotdog off the grill with a handful of fries (not diet friendly I know but convenient)

7:50PM: 26gm protein core power shake

8PM: begin fast

Now I know it is very disorganized and I am lacking a lot of info for you guys to make an accurate judgment, but the reason why I am concerned is because my Apple Watch tells me that my cardio and weight lifting burns 900-1100 calories, and I am fairly certain I am at a caloric deficit but I‚Äôm STILL GAINING WEIGHT!

Here‚Äôs my results:
September 23: 198.0 lbs
September 30: 196.4 lbs
October 7: 201 lbs

My questions for you all is this ‚Äúdiet‚Äù feasible? Could this do with my weight lifting and muscle gain? Is this an adjustment period my body is going through? Are there any best practices you recommend for me to adjust? Any advice would be appreciated!

I recently made a post asking for advice regarding the height of a mirror I just hung up and have received a lot of feedback which opened my eyes to other issues with the current layout of my living room (thanks again to those who commented)!

I decided to make another post showing the entire room and open up the debate to the whole layout and overall decor instead of limiting the discussion to the mirror height.

Some context:
- I rent, so I cannot make any renovations or structural changes to the home.
- I just moved which is why there aren‚Äôt any personal items or pictures up yet!
- This is not my forever home so I‚Äôd really like to work with the bigger pieces I have if possible (blue couch, orange chair + ottoman, console table, lamp, desk, piano, and bar cart).
- Open to swapping out the rug and coffee table, and definitely would like to find a better substitute for the bookshelf next to the chair.
- Would love to make the mirror work in this space but I‚Äôm open to moving it to another room if need be.
- Minor note: I‚Äôm in the process of knitting a rust/orange blanket which will replace the pink one that‚Äôs currently on the couch.

1fyobgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1fyobgw/cathartic_management_and_iconic_audacity_an/,"Cathartic Management and Iconic Audacity, an interaction","TL/DR: I got to enact managerial banishment on a rude, entitled customer and didn‚Äôt panic, cry or even raise my voice. It was cathartic after working under managers who refused to defend service staff for years. 

Context: My sister and I are business partners. I‚Äôve been in the service industry for 25 years, first as a barista, then server, then bartender, and now as an owner. She was a medical biller for 10 years before we bought this business. One of the departments is a very popular coffee shop, and it shares space with a retail department and also a craftsmanship department. We both grew up in extreme religious abuse and I fled a severe DV marriage 4.5 years ago. Learning to handle conflict has been difficult. 

The following is a true story that happened today, not embellished and nearly 100% verbatim. 

If you think I should have handled this differently, oh well I guess. 
My sister leaves every day at 3 for school pickup. On Mondays I stay until 5. We have a homeschool club in from 3-4 to fold origami so I was helping them set up when my sister left. They were sitting in the front picture window. Today I didn‚Äôt get to go to the bathroom until 320, leaving both sides of the store to our barista to manage for 3-5 min. When I stepped back out, she had a small cluster of people at the coffee bar so I took the final customer‚Äôs order. As I rang the customer up, another customer on the retail side stepped through the shared doorway and gestured angrily at me, so I told her I‚Äôd be right there and wrapped up really fast. 

I walked, quickly because I‚Äôm not a dick but I‚Äôm not running for $10, to the art side and as I greeted her this conversation ensued:

Me (read my comments with general goodwill but zero tolerance for bullshit. This is nearly verbatim and not paraphrased): I‚Äôm sorry. If you‚Äôre ever waiting again you can go to the coffee side and the barista can help since it‚Äôs all the same business entity. *indicating signage*

Her (read all her comments with huffs of entitlement, this is not an exaggeration in spite of my desire for it to be): I never come in here unless I absolutely have to. 

Me: ‚Ä¶ok. I‚Äôm sorry for the wait, I needed to use the restroom. 

Her: I can‚Äôt believe how you‚Äôve run this place into the ground. 

Me: excuse me? You mean, since we bought the store in the last year?

Her, unable to disguise her shock that I was the owner and also the *new* owner, engages in actual hair flip: Yes!! (Eyes me up and down with actual disgust)

Me: do you have constructive criticism for me or angry criticism for me?

Her, gesturing at the displays: I‚Äôm so unhappy with your selection of ‚Äî- supplies. (Indicates gift section) You can buy *this* shit anywhere. 

Me: oh, you mean the selection, 90% of which has been here since I bought the store in October of last year?

Her: YES. 

Me: you‚Äôre welcome to take your business elsewhere. Your total is $8.88 (no lie). 

Her, disappointed I was already holding her cash: attempts to grab it as I placed it in the drawer

Me: I‚Äôm so sorry I have human needs and had to use the restroom when you got here. $11.12 is your change. Goodbye.

Then the door handle from ~1910 foiled her attempt to yank/slam out of my building, forcing her to open it slowly and with no theatrics. 

Sigh. So cathartic.

First of all, everything seems to check out that this is in fact mold (went through the wiki).

So the real question is, what am I possibly doing wrong?

Recipe for attempt #2:

2 liters sweet tea from tap water that's been boiled for 15 minutes. 4 green tea and 4 black tea bags steeped for 5 min. Sugar until desired OG is reached.

1 liter unpasteurized, unflavored store-bought kombucha. Added when tea cools down to 30¬∞C (86¬∞F).

Final solution volume 3 liters, sugar concentration 9%, pH 4.3.

(Note: I'm very confident in my measurements. I've been homebrewing for a while before attempting kombucha.)

Mixture poured into glass fermentation vessel, topped with a coffee filter and a rubber band. Vessel placed in a dark, fairly warm, ventilated area.

Every single tool and vessel used was sanitized using freshly diluted StarSan.

The only thing I changed from attempt #1 was that I used a different brand of store-bought kombucha.

3 days in, went to check on the batch and it looked like this. Batch #1 took 5 days to show signs of mold.

Any clue what I could be doing wrong? I would really appreciate any help, and I'll answer any questions. Just really want to get into kombucha. Cheers!",2,1728350677.0,Kombucha,16,1.0,False

Background info: we are both ex chefs from Chicago (endless free, high quality caffeine) that now work in labor outdoor jobs in Maui expecting first child. We have regressed into an unfortunate set up of cuisinart programmable pots of coffee that my husband fills with Folgers. 

Wants/use: While I like shots of espresso, a house made latte will bring me the warm and fuzzies. I am not looking to invest a thousand dollars, and ideally just a couple hundred. Something that is 10 steps above my current cup of joe, but that you very proficient espresso connoisseurs may have turned your nose at once you tasted the extra good life. I will enjoy one sweet cup and my husband will undoubtedly end up brewing four before leaving for work. 

I generally wouldn't mind grinding beans separately, but we are looking at newborn life, so semi automatic? Open to advice. We have a sort of buffet cabinet to set up on, so plenty of room.

Also, not particularly worried about the steamer. Just the ease of getting a better drink that's consistent, maybe not outrageously loud if that's a factor.

There are so many threads on Breville and De Longhe I just can't pick a route to explore. Brain is fried and fertilized. Someone recommended just hitting up a kitchenaid one as well. Experts please descend and kindly share your extremely easy recommendations

It‚Äôs clear some have a hard on for Chris and Brandy so clearly there trying to add unnecessary bullshit to the story. Idk why yall don‚Äôt like them. I really don‚Äôt care. But the witch hunt is annoying. 

Let‚Äôs focus here. This is Slots sub. Let us keep the attention on her. But let‚Äôs just call it like it is. Feel free to argue if necessary. I‚Äôm all ears if anyone has anything intelligent to add. 

Chris and Brandy said they were going to speak to an investigator. Yes. You can make appointments with an investigator. Especially if you have evidence to show that will take time. You can also just show up and ask to speak to an officer, they can take a complaint card and have you come back to speak to the person that will be assigned to the case. This isn‚Äôt rocket science. This can also be confirmed by calling your local sheriffs office. (I did it to confirm what I thought to be true) I had a lawn mower stole once so I remember the process. 

Also, we ALL damn well know slot is still very much on tiktok and very much on this sub as well. Let‚Äôs say Chris and Brandy are telling the truth. They went to the investigator. Is that investigator really going to allow them to continue talking about the case that he or she is going to have to try to build? If you are playing poker and your tryin to build a strong hand to win said poker game, you seriously gonna tell people what‚Äôs in your hand so they can build a stronger hand than yours? Hell no ya ain‚Äôt. You gonna keep ur head down, build ur hand, and stick it to em. If this investigator is actually going to build a case, they aren‚Äôt going to tell people what‚Äôs in their hand so those people can run and tell everyone else at the table. This is Sherlock Holmes 101 shit. Yall, be real. 

And if I‚Äôm wrong, all side witch hunts still have nothing to do with slot. They just muddy the waters. And brandy and Chris have a shit ton of cash app receipts. Those and two dollars will buy you a nice cup of coffee. See what I did there? ü§£Don‚Äôt be all salty that u don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in the case. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. At this point id be worried if they were running back to the app bc they‚Äôd be blowing anything that they might have. Use ur brains people. Watch some Matlock. Hell these mysteries are so elementary you can probably find what you need to educate yourselves by watching scooby doo. Rock on, snarkers. ",12,1728350493.0,slotmachinequeen,7,0.81,False
1fyo60x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/1fyo60x/sa_from_a_community_leader/,SA from a community leader,"This happened awhile ago, a few years. The thing is, the person in question is getting quite a reputation (getting more well known) as a leader and organizer in social justice circles., or at least I see his name a lot more it seems like from where I live. When this happened I was in my third year of college, one of my Professors had us attend some seminars and workshops, things like that, for class credit. One was put on by this person,¬†there were opportunities for break out sessions and during one of them he (the seminar facilitator) came around to our small group and spent a lot of time with us. I thought he was informative and gave us a lot to think about, and he spent extra time talking to me and asking for my perspective on things. He seemed interested in what I had to say and we talked about a paper I was working on.¬†(I identify as NB and was in the process of coming out at the time; my paper was on SJ themes and feminism) He offered to read my draft and give me advice of where I could go with it. I didn‚Äôt think anything was off about it because he seemed interested. He proceeded to invite me after to meet and asked me to bring my draft.

So we met (in the student lounge area) and had coffee ... it was a busy public place. Then things got very weird.¬†He was sitting close, like on the side of the table instead of across like usual, and while we were talking often touched my hand, shoulder, etc; at first I thought it was unintentional, just natural sort of, but then it got more frequent. He talked about his kids and seemed to be a regular family-type of man, and it kept also occuring to me he might be gay (I felt like I was getting mixed messages), and because he was so much older than me I was thinking it must all be innocent and he couldn‚Äôt be interested in me in other then a friendly way‚Äì just doubting my instincts I guess. ¬†I should say here I am the first person in my family ever to go to college, first generation, and so just being there, looking back I can see I was very na√Øve.¬† I think in one aspect I was flattered that a man at his level would be interested in me and the ideas that I was talking about in my paper.¬†But at the same time I felt very uncomfortable in such an interpersonal situation.¬† Well things took another strange turn after that, because after awhile he straight up put his hand on my thigh under the table, like he leaned in to say something, but then just left it there. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, but tried to ignore it and was way too unsure of myself to say anything or try to stop him....looking back I can't believe it but that's what he did. He just went on so smooth and seemed very casual, and said everything right and I wanted to trust him and it felt in a way like he \*wanted me to trust him.  I remember everything in my body was saying I should get out of the situation quickly because it felt like there was pressure and definitely a sexual vibe.I wasn‚Äôt sure really if he had an interest in me or not (reading this now again, for sure VERY naive)... so I just wasn't sure but I left as politely and quickly as I could.  But unfortunately we had exchanged phone numbers earlier (another thing I look back on that was a dumb mistake).¬†That same night he started calling me , constantly.¬† I did not answer any of the calls, being away from the situation I finally concluded the whole thing was too weird and I wouldn‚Äôt know what to say anyway.¬† He only left one message but I remember it was creepy, I don't remember exactly how it was said but something about us getting together and making a good couple.  He probably called at least ten more times the next couple days but no more messages so then just gave up I guess, and I was very glad.

I didn‚Äôt even think about doing something about it because there was really nothing I could do that would matter - I had a lot of other stresses in my life at the time and I needed to move on‚Ä¶ ¬† I have been thinking about it and realize how awful that scenario was, how his white male entitlement exercised over my body made me feel lesser, helpless. But now I am seeing his name more, he is more or less well known as an advocator - organizer and it seems important to warn others or maybe to try to prevent it from happening to another naive girl. I wondered whether I should post this in Social Justice forum to sort of get the word out somehow, but then I wasn't sure if that was the right thing either. So much time has passed I don‚Äôt think anything could really be done and, I can‚Äôt help feel it‚Äôs not the right time and probably wouldn't want to get into it all again anyway.  So I don't know if I need advice (but any comments or advice is welcome) - and I know for a fact now it \*was SA / SH so there is no question there  But I'm glad I took the time to just get it down in writing.

I work 11 hr shifts that start at 7 am -6 pm and have a scheduled lunch at 12. I have the flexibility to move that around based on what I am required to do during each shift but I can‚Äôt take my lunch past 3 pm when working day shift. Rules. 

My gf works as a bartender and works nights. So this week we were on opposite shift. We don‚Äôt live together so when on opposite shifts it‚Äôs a challenge to see one another. 

This week she got sick and I took her to a walk-in clinic where she was diagnosed with a chest infection and give antibiotics as well as a steroid to ease her breathing. 

Last Thursday I started my day shift and she started her night shift. When I got off work I went to her work for a beer and mentioned if she was interested I could bring my work clothes over to her place and spend the evening together when she finished work. She told me that she didn‚Äôt expect to be home till near midnight because she had to close the bar and I had to be at work for 7 am so it didn‚Äôt make much sense. I agreed. 

She then suggested I come by on my lunch break and she could make me lunch. I said sure but reminded her my lunch was as noon. She told me she wanted to go to the gym because she hadn‚Äôt been there for a while due to her illness and we could do lunch, she would hit the gym after and then she would go to work. Sounded great. 

So, come Friday I am looking forward to lunch. Noon comes and not text. I adjust  my work load and push lunch to 1 pm. Again no text, I look up her instagram profile and see she was online during the hour. I push lunch back to 2pm. Again no text indicating she was up. 

3 pm comes and the window for me to have lunch has passed. She wakes up shortly after 3 because she has to get ready for work and texts that she felt horrible and just wanted to sleep. 

I believed her. I don‚Äôt go to the bar Friday. Saturday comes and she wakes up and asks if I want to come by for coffee and I said yes. She tells me she wants to go to the gym and will text when back. She has to start work at 6 pm and she texts me 5 minutes before 5 pm she is home. I go over and she makes me a coffee. I sit on the balcony where we usually sit and talk and she doesn‚Äôt come out. I had finished my coffee and go in to find her making her dinner for work and then she says she wanted to take a quick shower. I look at the clock and see I need to get back to my work base to book off for 6 and tell her I am leaving. 

Later she asks me what‚Äôs wrong and I tell her that I wasn‚Äôt happy about our lunch plans. She explains she wasn‚Äôt feeling well and needed to sleep. I tell her I am ok with that but it would have been nice if she texted me and told me the change in plans so I could at least gone to get food during my 11 hr shift. I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day because I had been waiting for her. 

She got upset and said she had slept all day and didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to say anything. I point out that she was on instagram a couple times and that she was awake and all she had to do was send me a quick text so I knew was that as going on. 

This caused a huge problem. I told her it was simple consideration and a quick text would have solved the entire issue. 

I had no idea she wasn‚Äôt feeling well until zero hour and because of it I went the entire day without a single thing to eat. Had I known I could have gotten something.

","It‚Äôs that time of year when we subconsciously start to postpone our goals until the next year: January 1st. Fresh start. New Year, New Me. You know the drill.

The fact that we still have 1/4 of the year left somehow doesn‚Äôt register.

I want to share the framework that helps me not to fall for this whisper to procrastinate till January.

The first time I truly experienced this was when my husband and I travelled to Europe for our honeymoon in September 2018. It was freaking awesome. No crowds. Clean streets. Still good weather. Cheaper accommodations. Better availability for great restaurants. Amazing level of service.

Since then, travelling off-season has become our new norm.

I then decided to apply this concept to other areas of my life:

* Grocery shopping in the mornings.¬†
* Having time off in the middle of the week and working on the weekends.
* Going to the gym during lunch hour vs. before or after work.
* Trying out new restaurants during lunch vs. dinner.
* Going for a nice meal after Valentine‚Äôs Day.

It saves so much time, energy, and money when you don‚Äôt follow the same schedule as everyone else.

Apart from the financial savings,¬†**there is just far less hysteria and marketing pressure when you do things not according to the commonly held schedule**.¬†

# Applying This to Goal-Setting

I took this concept further. What if I set my New Year‚Äôs resolutions in November or even October?

I‚Äôll be ahead of everyone come January 1st.  
**I won‚Äôt be subjected to all the goal-setting madness that comes on January 1st**.  
I‚Äôll already be deep in my new routine, so I won‚Äôt be triggered by all the advertising.  
I‚Äôll get my first results and be motivated to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing.

It‚Äôs like leaving home early so that you can avoid the stress of the rush hour. You‚Äôll be enjoying a cup of coffee in a nice caf√© near your destination while everyone else will be stuck in traffic.

#  The benefits of starting on your yearly goals early

It‚Äôs been a few years since I‚Äôve started embarking on new adventures in October and November instead of January. These are some benefits that I‚Äôve noticed:

1. **I can get the resources I need at a reasonable price**¬†before the holiday peak. Buying running shoes, a gym membership, coaching, courses, and pretty much anything else will be cheaper if I do it ahead of the peak holiday season. And there are no crowds at the mall yet.
2. I can calmly reflect on my life and choose the goals and projects that make sense for my life.¬†**I am not influenced by anyone else‚Äôs resolutions and goals.**¬†It makes for a lot fewer regrets down the road when you follow the path you carefully chose, not the path you were led to choose.
3. By the time January rolls around,¬†**I‚Äôm already ahead**¬†of everyone else.
4. I get to do a **practice month** and tailor my goals. One of the reasons that people give up on their New Year‚Äôs resolutions is that something about their goals does not work with their life. Instead of simply tailoring their goal a little bit, they give up on the entire thing. When I set my goals in October or November, I get to do a practice month without outside pressure to ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù stick to the plan. After a month, I can tailor the goal and proceed with a goal that is a much better fit for my life.
5. As a **recovering perfectionist**, this is one of the ways I‚Äôm teaching my brain that it‚Äôs okay to start at odd times of the year. In fact, there are a lot of benefits to doing so. Slowly but surely, it learns that it‚Äôs okay to let go of these rigid boundaries and constraints on how things ought to be done. It leads to a happier and less uptight life.

A friend & I were chatting about the best apartment set-up & we'd love the feedback not only for ourselves, but also for some friends as well as an elderly neighbor who also have been wondering about this.

After research, we believe we've come up with the ideal set-up for us folks who live in small apartments with curbside pickup, but would love your thoughts. Note: We‚Äôve also included some options for folks we know who have mobility issues/disabilities.

**Ideal Small Apt Setup with Curbside Pickup**

1. A steel countertop bin with a filter that allows airflow. The 1.3 gallon EPICA Countertop Bin Kitchen is highly rated & well reviewed by a few publications. It‚Äôs also on sale for just $28 right now.

2. Don‚Äôt use compostable liners in the countertop bin since composting agencies have noted these are actually removed. 

3. Don't use a plastic inner bucket liner as they can leach chemicals into the compost. (This is not specific to composting. It is supposition based on the fact that recent studies have shown recycled plastic contains toxic chemicals & it makes sense that this could then leach into the compost.)

4. Include anything you can eat or grow + eggshells, coffee grounds, bones, greasy uncoated paper plates, & pizza boxes. [Note: Specific to NYC as some other locations don‚Äôt allow animal products.]

5. To reduce smells & ensure no flies, dump the countertop bin into the curbside compost bin every 2-3 days.

6. Wash the bin by hand or in the dishwasher once a month.

**Options for Those with Mobility Issues and/or Disabilities**

For those who can‚Äôt dump their bins that often & worry about fruit flies, mice, or the smell in a tiny apartment:

1. If you have room in your freezer, store in bags there instead.

2. Ask your neighbor or super to bring down for you when they bring theirs down. (As your neighbor, I‚Äôm happy to volunteer!)

3. Skip adding meat, dairy, oil, or fat which can make the bin smellier. [NYC allows these in curbside composting. Other places may not.]

4. Limit liquids (and/or strain wet foods, if you can) as liquids can make the bin smellier.

5. Get the Mill, a trash compactor/grinder. $999 to buy it or $29.99/mo to rent, but you can get $200 off either with an affiliate link. Uses 0.7kWh of electricity/day on average. To use less energy, you can limit liquids and/or strain wet foods. [Note: We know there are some here who hate this option, but for my friend who has a disability, a small freezer, a small apt, & sometimes a mouse problem, something like this could be a game changer if the other options don‚Äôt work for her. Same with the elderly neighbor, who doesn't seem to have money issues, but does have very painful arthritis.]

My typical purchase is a half-sweet vanilla latte. Some coffee shops I can skip the flavoring and really enjoy it. I would not describe myself as a coffee snob at all, my daily drink is pretty week drip coffee I make in a Mr. Coffee. It doesn't taste amazing, but it's what I have. At about 5 dollars a drink and with the help of a recent bonus, I'm thinking of getting an at-home setup to save money in the long run and treat myself to nicer drinks in the morning. I don't see myself getting super into coffee as a hobby, this is more of a stop-paying-money-all-the-time-for-a-drink. At $550 spent and a latte a little over once a week, the buy-back period is generously < 3 years even with the cost of coffee included. I l would make 1 drink or less a day, and currently have enough countertop space although it is a squeeze.

The options: 

1) The Breville Barista Express is currently on sale for \~$550 and seems to have everything a beginner/non-dedicated coffee hobbyist needs to make pretty good lattes. 

2) For \~$800, I could get the Breville Bambino Plus, a hand grinder, and all the necessary accessories. I'm thinking something like the 1ZPresso J or Kingrinder K6 at $130.

3) Something else that you find folks suggest.

4) Continue buying out because I'm clearly not dedicated enough to be a home espresso maker kind of person.

Twitch was sitting at an old, battered coffee table which was in turn resting on piles of books to give it height.  He was dressed in the most eclectic collection of clothes, in an array of clashing colors. Frankly, he looked like the rainbow fairy had flown up and puked on him. He was barefoot, feet kicking idly at the rungs of the large stool he sat on, looking through papers scattered all over the surface of the table in haphazard piles.

He took a page that looked suspiciously like an expense report and folded it with deft, sure movements.

He tossed the finished paper airplane across the room, where it landed in a pile with several dozen other airplanes.

‚ÄúUuugh‚Ä¶ I hate paperwork,‚Äù he whined, thumping his head against the table. 

Twitch stood to his full six foot height, raking a hand through his disheveled blonde hair. He shuffled to the mini-fridge which was humming a cool little tune contentedly to itself and pulled out a flask.

‚ÄúNothing like a quick, mid morning pick-me-up to get the day started,‚Äù he said as he took a pull of the flask, his voice a strange holding a strange sing-song cadence that was generally the domain of the mentally unstable. 

He wasn't crazy, oh no. He would tell you he was cerebrally quirky. Perhaps he played fast and loose with the rules of reality.

He was in the basement of the Saint Mackle Home for Terminally Wayward Children, an orphanage he had run for a long time now. St. Mackle's wasn't a state run orphanage, it relied on donations from private sources, and Twitch used many of his connections to ensure it was running as smoothly as possible.

The basement door opened, and a teenaged girl poked her head in.

‚ÄúTwitch? We've got something.‚Äù

Twitch turned to look at the child, and smiled broadly.

‚ÄúAh, yes, yes. A thing we have, and a thing we will examine,‚Äù he said, shuffling over to look at the sheaf of papers held in the teen's hand. ‚ÄúThank you, Almira. It is always a pleasure to have you bring me something to divert myself with.‚Äù

He ruffled her hair, which she bore with stoic familiarity, and wandered back unsteadily to his table as the girl withdrew.

He swept his arm over the table, sending the papers on it into a fluttering heap, and plopped the newest pile in the center.

The papers, a dossier on a runaway child, were spread out into a mess, some upside down, some backwards, and Twitch hmm'd and cackled randomly as he looked then over.

He really wasn't so much looking, as he was sensing the underlying patterns the words made. In his mind, concepts and ideas spun through thoughts that might best be described as ‚Äúspaghetti‚Äù, and a story emerged. 

A boy, perhaps ten years old, cast out from home and found by those who wished him harm. And harm him they did. His thoughts provided a story of pain and suffering,  brought about by those indifferent to his plight. He caught a whiff of Power, poorly formed, but there nonetheless. Running to escape the pain, and dogs sent to hunt him down.

That sealed it. The boy needed help. He needed a safe place to heal, and learn to control himself. Twitch was, due to long experience, uniquely qualified to offer that help and healing. 

He got up and made his way upstairs. Upon reaching the dining hall, he clapped his hands twice, his voice falling into that harmless, raspy, song-song cadence.

‚ÄúChildren. Attend, please,‚Äù he called out, causing several dozen kids of various ages to stop what they were doing and move to him. ‚ÄúI must leave for a while. Please do me the honor of behaving and prepare a new bed for my return. Ensure that there is a hot meal ready, if you would be so kind.‚Äù

He started walking toward the door of the building, stripping his multicolored outer robe to reveal close fitting dark gray clothes underneath.

‚ÄúI will need drone overwatch and a rolling comms blackout. Route traffic away from our wayward soul, and kill the cameras in a two block radius.‚Äù

He turned and smiled at the kids. ‚ÄúWe protect our own.‚Äù

The children repeated his words with a soft tone, fervently.

‚ÄúWe protect our own.‚Äù

They scattered, off to their self appointed tasks, and Twitch stepped into the night of the city of Glass.

Neon light pushed back the darkness, an almost overwhelming assortment of advertisements assaulting the senses. It was raining, causing some of the holographic ads to fuzz slightly as the raindrops scattered light as they passed. Everywhere he looked were people. 

Shouting to attract attention to their stalls. Groups of young people, obviously in a gang, flirting with each other. Ground effect vehicles roaring by at high speed.

Across the street, music thumped from a nightclub. Fans cheered as their team score a point in a Crashball match in the bar next door. 

In the distance, sirens wailed and gunshots echoed.

The audio-visual assault did more than simply try to overwhelm the senses. It hid things in the corners of neon and chrome.

In an alley, a drug deal was going down. Under a fire escape, a man struggled, held down by a group. Children with too wise eyes stared at him, clearly doing the mental math to decide if he was worth robbing or not. Every ecosystem had predators, even if the jungle was duracrete and neon, instead of forest and rain.

Twitch put in some earbuds, stuffed his hands in his pockets and slouched into the river of life on the sidewalk, just another face in the crowd.

He walked for an hour, never hurrying. As he neared the edge of the market district, however, a strange thing began happening. Within a hundred meters of him, cameras began powering down, and comm devices flashed the dreaded ‚ÄúNo Signal‚Äù icon as they were forcibly disconnected. Vehicle traffic grew less and less as automated traffic control routed vehicles away.

Drones hummed by on whisper drives, spreading into a chaotic seeming mess that was actually a carefully plotted path to keep an electronic eye out. Then his earpiece, actually a two way transmitter, crackled.

‚ÄúCloak, online,‚Äù came a soft, feminine voice.

‚ÄúDagger, standing by,‚Äù said a deeper, male voice.

Twitch didn't answer save to pull out a hand and wave it seemingly at random. 

He paused at the loading door for a large warehouse, waiting a few moments for the drones to see him, then stepped inside. 

It was large inside, as expected. Dark, too, especially compared to the brightness outside. His dark gray clothes served him well, as he seemed to just vanished against the industrial gray walls of the warehouse.

He began weaving as he walked, seemingly nothing more than a harmless drunk, and.began humming an old song to himself. 

‚Äú...lovely bunch of coconuts..,‚Äù he sang in an off key tenor, each movement coincidentally checking more and more of the warehouse. In the distance, he could just hear voices. One was high pitched and young, another much deeper and demanding.

‚ÄúMaking contact shortly. Make sure there aren't any runners, yeah?‚Äù 

His voice was a quiet interruption to his singing, and he resumed once he received a double click of a response. 

In the back of the warehouse was an office. This office was exactly like any other office, save for one thing.

There was a boy cowering in the corner, dressed in a blue jumpsuit, with scars visible on his arms, and four guys in tactical armor, faces hidden by helmets, weapons pointed at the boy.

One man stood closer to the boy than the others, ordering to get up in a heavily synthesized voice.

The boy whimpered. 

‚ÄúPlease,  just let me go. I don't want to hurt you.  Please,‚Äù the boy begged, doing everything he could to turn into a tiny ball.

Silly boy, Twitch thought to himself, giggling. You can‚Äôt turn into a ball, you have too many bones!

The man growled and reached out a hand, preparing to slap the child.

Twitch chose that moment, as the man‚Äôs hand was raised up to slap, to throw open the door and ‚Äúdrunkenly‚Äù stumble through, slurring out a ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small world‚Ä¶‚Äù He stopped, seeming surprised to see people inside, then looked at the door before returning his bleary gaze at the men. ‚ÄúFunny. This doesn‚Äôt look like a bathroom.‚Äù

One of the men raised a hand to his helmet, speaking, ‚ÄúSir. We‚Äôve been compromised. Please advise.‚Äù

There was silence.
‚ÄúSir? Sir, come in,‚Äù the man repeated, concern coloring his tone.

Twitch slowly and calmly shut the door.

‚ÄúSay‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a good look, what you‚Äôve got going on here. What consenting adults do between themselves is no one‚Äôs business but their own, but this little lad barely looks old enough to have hair starting to grow in his b-‚Äù Twitch broke off, striking a pose with a finger extended into the air before continuing. ‚ÄúLegs.‚Äù

Two of the men turned and aimed rifles at Twitch, shouting, ‚ÄúGet down, get down on the ground now!‚Äù

Twitch wagged his upraised finger at them. ‚ÄúUh uh, that is no way to treat a guest. I see you have brought with you party favors. However, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the kind of party favors I would enjoy. So, please, keep them to yourself. I will otherwise have to chastise you most soundly.‚Äù

One of the men stepped forward, swinging his rifle to strike Twitch with the butt. When the motion was completed, Twitch was just half an inch outside of the swing of the weapon, holding a very disappointed look on his face.

‚ÄúNaughty. Very naughty. Seeing naughty children is bad enough, but naughty adults. That, I say, flies right in the very face of the way things should be.‚Äù

The second man fired his rifle, and Twitch made a step to the side and a dip, the shot missing. He straightened, and two knives seemed to appear in his hands. His expression changed, going from faintly vapid and silly goofy, to focused. His voice was quiet and intense as he spoke.

‚ÄúChild. Lay down on the ground and close your eyes.‚Äù

The boy complied, trying to become as flat as possible, and Twitch smiled.

‚ÄúI suppose the show is over.‚Äù

His hand was suddenly extended at the man who had shot him, and the man gurgled, a blade embedded in his throat. Twitch calmly reached down and pulled out another knife and stepped forward.

The men fired wildly, emptying their magazines in a panicked rush. The rounds sparked off the door and walls, Twitch moving as if the bullets were traveling slow enough to simply avoid. Each motion, however, brought him closer to the shooters, and all too soon, there was a wonderful sound.

Click

As each reloaded, they died, Twitch‚Äôs blades finding soft flesh in the seams of armor. The last one, the one who had been about to strike the boy, died screaming into his helmet for backup that would never arrive.

Twitch looked himself over, noting the tears in his clothes from dodges taken too close to the bullets, then shrugged as he walked to the boy.

‚ÄúChild, you can open your eyes now. They won‚Äôt bother you anymore,‚Äù he said, squatting down in such a way as to block line of sight with the bodies. His tone was soft and open, and he placed a hand on the boy‚Äôs head, ruffling his hair. ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù

The boy sat up, getting out from Twitch‚Äôs hand and tried to look past Twitch to the carnage. Twitch just leaned a little to block the attempt. 

‚ÄúUh, Liam, sir.‚Äù Liam said, staring directly at Twitch‚Äôs nose, refusing to meet his eyes.

‚ÄúGood to meet you, Liam. I am Twitch. Do you have parents? They‚Äôre probably wondering where you are and are looking for you.‚Äù

Liam shook his head, ‚ÄúNot anymore, sir. My parents, they‚Ä¶ they sold me to something called Phoenix. They said I ate too much, and they told me they regretted having me.‚Äù

Twitch stared at him, carefully keeping his expression neutral to hide the rage he felt at Liam‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúWell. That is unfortunate. What isn‚Äôt unfortunate, however, is that I know of some people who are already delighted to meet you.‚Äù

He reached down, scooping Liam up and heading toward the door. Liam just clung on, the tears he had been holding back finally spilling over as he realized he was actually safe.

‚ÄúSir, Twitch. I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt go with you. I‚Äôm dangerous. I‚Äôm a monster. My parents said so.‚Äù

Exiting the room and closing the door, Twitch put Liam down and knelt to be face to face with him, his expression serious. 

‚ÄúLiam. I don‚Äôt really care what you are. You are a child. You deserve to be protected and loved. If you‚Äôll allow me, I will make sure you get both.‚Äù

Liam just started crying, and threw himself into Twitch‚Äôs arms, who simply stood up and started walking.

 ‚ÄúTell me, Liam.  Have you ever heard of Saint Mackle‚Äôs?

my life has unraveled in September and my brother took off across the country and moved states. 

we were in Texas and my brother had a job as a server. I wanted to help him out by finding a better job to show my gratitude for him signing an apartment lease with me as its difficult for me to live on  my own, and at the end of August, he took my recommendation to apply at a nice coffee shop and he got hired. 

He was so sure of himself that he quit his old sever job that he had for over a year prior, and 2 weeks later he gets fired at the coffee shop. He doesn't tell me for days, but when I find out, I ask him to look for jobs again. Little did I know he was already planning on bailing. 

Come October, I find out that he canceled his lease on our apartment unit and I had to go talk to management and explain everything. He tried to intimidate me and take the car (its in my name but he drives it) and called the police on me. I showed them the documents and that was that, but now he has gotten a plane ticket from my mom and moved states. 

He has no job, is threatening to not pay the car loan, and left me with the possibility of getting thrown out of my apartment. 

Im at a complete loss of what to do and I cant believe my brother would betray me like this. 

I have been applying for jobs since I found out he was fired 2 weeks ago, but I am disabled and it's difficult for me to get hired and keep employment for any meaningful time. 

My mom has been enabling his behavior the entire time and I just don't know what to do. 

In the last month my mom has given him $1500 for an apartment he flaked on and canceled the lease early, then he tried to steal my car to drive to Oregon and when that wouldn't work he called the police to intimidate me. None of that worked, so my mom bought him a plane ticket to Redmond and has now given him $3200 for a craigslist car so my mom has given my brother over 5 grand to muck about and ruin my life and he gets bailed out.

Start pa ng first week of September, nag-apply ako sa position and malaki ang salary range nila nasa $1,500 to $2,000 monthly. Then after a week, nag-initial interview ako and grabe umasa ako nang malala kasi sinabi sakin na mas gusto niya daw ako kaysa sa mga candidates na for final interview. So syempre sino bang hindi aasa sa ganung statement diba?

Then eto na ang nakakaloka, naka-hanggang FOURTH INTERVIEW ako at first time kong maranasan sa buong career ko na umbot more than 3 interviews. Then tanong sila nang tanong sakin kung may iba daw akong active applications and ang sabi ko wala. Akala ko tapos na, pero nag-follow up ulit ako sa status ko last week and sabi nila may COFFEE CHAT daw silang ise-schedule samin between the CEO. So technically FIFTH INTERVIEW na to. So ako naman, naisip ko na baka for formality lang at sasabihin na sakin na hired ako.

So kanina lang, kakatapos ko lang sa ‚Äúcoffee chat‚Äù with the CEO. Guess what? Ginawa lang yung call para sabihin sakin na may hinire na sila LAST WEEK pa. Gusto daw niya akong kausapin thru video call kasi email is not enough daw kasi nahirapan talaga silang mag-decide. Inamin niya sakin na kaya hinire nila yung isang candidate kasi may experience daw sa isang software na ginagamit nila, at ako wala naging honest naman ako dun.

So in total, more than a month yung application process na akala mo singing contest na daming rounds. Only to know na I wasn‚Äôt going to be hired. Yung CEO naman nagsabi sakin na okay lang ba daw na i-keep nila records ko kasi pag nag-open silang position in a few months, gusto nila akong kunin.

Pero yeah, I guess masakit talaga umasa. ",2,1728348957.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False

Just doing my duty as a muso & passing this on. Seen Ben put endless, soul-crushing mahi, physical & financial investment into maintaining our singular city metal hub(also bass/hip-hop/trance etc, but I feel these scenes are more widely engaged with in general live music), one of the very few left in the country too after a regular in Christchurch was forced to close up last year I believe. Valhalla had some faltering times in the ‚Äòvid heavy years, but that legend pushed through & held strong for the community. 


And I get it: I live near a bar and another semi-active rave venue (& have for 5 years) and the thump-thump & drunk-yelling will never get any less grating. We don‚Äôt always have a choice as to where we have available to call home just to keep a roof over our head (hence the 5yrs here lol), but for the love of all things holy to our ear holes, *that call-in you make can massively contribute to an existing dent in some people‚Äôs lives & livelihoods* 

Venues are doing all they can to ensure adherence to code practice, e.g. sound insulation, event timing etc, though unfortunately this cannot always extend to the self-responsibility of drunk-yellers (outside of cutting off their supply‚Äîand from my experience of the culture at Valhalla specifically, if you start rarking up too hard, there are plenty of gig-goers all to willing to jump on that problem you‚Äôre instigating). In fact, the *one* call to noise control I‚Äôve made across 5-years was due to street behaviour and not the venue or additional bars nearby in terms of music-noise. 

Try earplugs for a few bucks‚Äîthey make them to cater from sleepy folks to gig-goers & musicians themselves. Bluetooth headphones, white noise machines (I have an app with nature sounds & white noise capabilities, can even listen to both at the same time), call the venue directly even, not like they can tell you to ‚Äúf off you‚Äôre ruining the vibe‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre more than likely to take your feedback into account & adjust as any other community member should, because like I said, for some this is their entire lives & livelihood. Just consider any & all constructive possibilities before hitting up council noise control, please. 


Thank you for reading & chur to The Post for highlighting challenges that *all* small businesses face, far beyond the few hundred coffee shops & eateries.

(Check the rules and [this](https://time.is/UTC) if you don't believe me.)

Anyway, I have this coworker who I've talked to sometimes. We greet each other when we see each other, and when we work next to each other, we have animated conversations and we have great chemistry. I really felt like we could totally be friends. So today I asked if she wanted to exchange phone numbers. She said, ""I don't give my phone number to coworkers. Sorry."" I said, ""Oh. Okay. It's fine."" But I'm not gonna bother talking to her anymore (except to be polite when she talks to me first). I mean, what benefit is there to talking to her now? She doesn't want to be friends. Because of the nature of our job, we don't actually need to directly work together. Why should I waste my time talking to her? I honestly think her boundary of not sharing her phone number with coworkers, period, is stupid. Work is a great opportunity to make friends as an adult! Why would you pass up an opportunity to be friends with someone who you really click with just because you met them at work?! Thinking back, I kinda have a pattern of reacting this way to people telling me they don't want to be friends outside of the specific context in which we met (usually work). A list:

* At a previous job, there was this guy who I felt like I was becoming friends with at work and then he said he didn't want to make friends at work. (This was because he'd made friends with someone at his last job and then things went south and it got really awkward.) I got really upset and I actually cried right then and there and I was kinda rude to him about it. (I wasn't doing well at the time. Very stressful job.) But we ended up continuing to talk just because he kept talking to me. He's an extroverted autistic guy and he's often really anxious and apparently I was good at calming him down.
* At that same job, there was this coworker who I had a crush on. I talked to her a lot and I often bought her her favorite coffee, which she really appreciated. One day I bought her a $10 neck fan because she was often complaining about being hot. She refused to accept it. So I stopped talking to her except when I had to for work. And then she apparently decided that I'm not a very nice person, since she later told me that the real reason why management was threatening to fire me wasn't because of poor performance like they told me but because I was always causing issues with people and trying to get them in trouble, but I honestly have no idea what she was even talking about????? (Then again, maybe I was subconsciously trying to get her in trouble without realizing that was my motivation or something... There was this one girl at Job Corps who I thought I was friends with but apparently she felt like I wasn't giving her any time to herself. Eventually someone else told me to leave her alone. And then she felt like I was trying to get her in trouble all the time, but that wasn't how I saw it. How I saw it, she had done something wrong that was causing problems for other people and it needed to be addressed. That's not the same as trying to get someone in trouble. That's trying to get a problem addressed.)
* Also at the same job, there was this one other coworker who I actually did exchange phone numbers with. I'd also asked her if she wanted to go to the local amusement park together. She said she was too busy because she was a caregiver for a disabled family member. Then she changed her phone number. At first she said she'd give it to me later, but when I reminded her, she said she'd decided not to share her phone number with coworkers anymore. I was like, ""Wait, you don't want to be friends? Why didn't you say so when I invited you to go to \[local amusement park\]?"" She said she thought I meant as coworkers. (Of course that's not what I meant???) I was really upset and kinda mad at her and I started crying and told her I wasn't gonna talk to her anymore. (Another stressful time at that job. My manager was extremely unpleasant.)
* This was over 10 years ago, but one time when I was 15, I had this roommate in the hospital and we had so much in common and we were always hanging out together in the hospital. Then she said she didn't want to be friends with anyone she'd met in the hospital once she got released. So I said I didn't want to talk to her anymore. And I was super angry and I randomly threw a book at her and I thought about doing something REALLY awful to her and I was so terrified that I'd actually do it that I asked to be moved to a different room. Thank GOODNESS I'm not that messed up anymore.

Oddly, I didn't react that way to this one other coworker who I really clicked with not wanting to exchange phone numbers at another job.
