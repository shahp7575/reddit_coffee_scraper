Hey there reddit! 

Some days can be hard and stressful, and it's always to nice to have someone to chat with to unwind! Hopefully, we can do that together!

Gustong-gusto na niya magka-girlfriend at date to marry kaya seryoso at hindi short term ang hanap. Kwento niya saken marami siya failed dates at rejections. Until last week meron siya bago kinakausap ulit na naka-match niya sa Bumble then nag-tatanong siya saken nang mga tips kaya shinare ko naman yung alam ko na pwede mag-work sa kanya sa abot ng aking makakaya. Last time, I told him na subukan niya padalhan ng coffee kaya tinuruan ko siya kung pano at pati format ng chat. Sabi ko copy paste mo to tapos i-chat mo sa kanya ayun it works! Binigay pa kamo ang address, so I told him ""see? wala ka kasi bilib saken lagi ka may doubts dapat lagi ka malakas ang loob at di pang-hihinaan babae yan ikaw ang lalake ikaw ang mag-aadjust you need mahabang patience since pinasok mo ang dating"". Every time na may convo tapos nahihirapan siya at di niya alam gagawin ayun papaturo siya saken and it turns out good naman"". Ngayon ang kinaiinisan ko sa kanya is he's always asking me ""Do you think gusto niya ako? Interested ba siya saken?"" things like that. Sabi ko naman sa kanya ""Di naman yan magic na magkakagusto agad sayo syempre pag-hihirapan mo, You need patience and effort kung gusto mo talaga siya i-pursue. Buti nga binigay saten ang address eh kaya napadalhan mo ng Starbucks coffee through Grab di ba?"". Tapos siya naman panay doubts at overthinking pa rin. Parang gusto niya instant agad tulad nung last time since binigay address it means interested sayo na kikilanin ka. Kung ako nga sa kanya since may address na siya dapat siya kamo personal nag-dala ng coffee para masabi seryoso ka at least tapos pagkakataon mo na yun. Problema kasi sa kanya ang hina ng loob, may kotse na nga siya tapos well-off naman siya. He has advantages and ideals na hanap ng babae ngayon kaso wala kasi patience at tiyaga.

Many coworkers who have witnessed these interactions think I'm being mistreated and other coworkers have all been mistreated by these three people. Theres three people I cannot get a long with in the workplace. One is a coworker named Nancy, One is my boss Bryan, and one is my coworker named Shannon. I will begin with Nancy

Nancy complains a lot about me and other coworkers and I mean a lot. She hardly works and stands behind people bossing them despite just being a coworker and not in a position of authority. She hates talking and wants everything quiet all the time. She overloads work onto others especially my coworker Fran. She overloaded Fran and I with tons of laundry. I had several bins of laundry to fold and Fran had tons of laundry to deliver. She and I were both overwhelmed and she asked for help but sadly I was so overwhelmed that I only helped her at the last minute. The next time I saw Nancy she scolded me in front of everyone and said I was a terrible coworker who hates teamwork because I helped Fran at the last minute. She then told me everyone over the weekend said I talk all the time and need to shut up so I went to the bathroom to cry only to find out later that no one said that. 

I'm going to also list off all her complaints: She demands that I clean the dryer vats once every 2-3 loads, demands that I don't load the dryers at the end of the day or leave them loaded which contradicts with what the boss says and he says the polar opposite, demands I don't roll up the fitted sheets, demands that the largest assisted living clothes go first with the smallest going last, demands  that I only have one earbud in for my music instead of two, favors another coworker over me, demands I speed up, has ignored me multiple times when I have spoken to her, talked crap about me behind my back, demands that only certain tables are for folding and certain ones are for storage, complains that I sip my coffee too much and wants me to put my coffee and stuff in a specific spot, calls me tapping on my phone to change a song or etc as ""playing on my phone instead of working"" and the list of complaints and demands goes on and on and on. She also got into an intense argument with Fran and tried to get me involved. She complains all the time that no one does work but her but it's actually the opposite 

Shannon steals and told the boss that I don't do my work and take excessive breaks constantly which is bullcrap

Bryan gave me a verbal warning and said I was a lazy person who flaunted not wanting to work because I needed a 
bathroom break once after pizza and ice cream cake was being served during lunch, demands I am only allowed to go to the bathroom at certain times for whatever reason and I don't go to the bathroom excessively in fact I only go to the bathroom at least twice during an eight hour shift, gets on my ass for not doing work for like 2 seconds, his demands often contradict with Nancies, he demands that I clock in and out  EXACTLY at the same time because he hates even just one minute of overtime, blames me for not knowing things I haven't been taught, demands I speed up, yells a lot, and brags constantly on Nancy although she barely works.",1,1746759569.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The role that I agreed to take on in *January* requires a lot of responsibility and preparedness. 

I’m literally one of 4 people responsible for coordinating the first 72 hours of an emergency shelter being set up. The chapter I’m in consists of 11 counties in a state where forest fires aren’t an *IF*, they’re a *WHEN*.

My supervisor has barely spoken to me this entire time. We had one in person meeting and there was a lot of explaining how things work and what we “need to do”. He is an extremely busy person and I understand that. I did email him a couple months ago to ask where we were at because it’s almost fire  season and he’s given me absolutely nothing to do.

It isn’t a matter of me not knowing what we need to do, it’s that there’s no tasks specifically he’s having me do. I will ask questions and he will do his best to answer them but it never ends with him instructing me or even giving me a basic list of things I need to do!

So we did another meeting online this time about 4-6 weeks ago and he gave me a list of 12 volunteers to reach out to. Okay, cool. I did that. I’m not quite sure how that helps us prepare.

I recently got invited to another online meeting with another person with his title but further north of us and someone they found to help in that area. I was expecting this to be an initial meeting with a clear plan and that this other volunteer would be as clueless as I was.

But nope, I was totally blindsided. The other person with my supervisor’s title gave her an entire plan and a spreadsheet to work off of and she had already started what I should have at least 2 months ago. 

Not only that, I kept trying to get answers on what the role actually entails since I’ve felt totally out of the loop. When asked what I had been working on I told them that I called the volunteers like I was asked. Then radio silence.

Once the role was explained a little more clearly they started to say “make it your own” but then any idea I suggested was shot down and IMO it was because they know something I don’t know. 

My direct supervisor doesn’t strike me as someone who is rude or vindictive but definitely doesn’t have great communication and also sucks at delegation. Now I’m left feeling like this is either a personal issue between him and I or something else is amiss. 

How do you deal with supervisors like this?! It’s driving me crazy. The role is very prestigious and I’m more than capable of doing whatever it is that they need me to do. 

I have 1 year of service volunteering there, I have 7 years of administrative experience, 2 years of experience in telecom customer service, and I got my master’s in library and information science in 2017. Not to mention I’ve brought our volunteer base together socially with coffee meetups.

I’m just scared that my reputation is at risk if I’m not being provided with the guidance and tools I need to get going on this. Whatever “this” is!!! Because if something gets fucked up you know I’m the one getting the blame.",2,1746759494.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

What does your drink of choice say about your lifestyle?,"Let's get this out of the way first, I'm not talking about Starbucks culture. I think that overpriced, oversweet drinks are for just for sugar enthusiasts, not coffee/tea enthusiasts. I'm referring to traditional coffee and tea.

Is there actually some truth behind the fact that what you traditionally drink defines your lifestyle?

\- In my opinion, coffee drinkers are those who require fuel for their day. Coffee is their ""go juice"" that gets them through long hours of work or powers them through that big presentation. I think of high energy performers and high-stress environments.

\- Tea drinkers to me always felt like they had their life together, were a little more happy, and took things more slowly like they were savoring their day. They also often came off as more introverted???

\- Additionally, I think those who drink matcha are much more calm, traditional, and minimalistic, and health-conscious. It might just be my impression from the Japanese background, but my friends here in the states also give off that vibe and they love making matcha tea every day.

We rush through our days, often on autopilot, missing the subtle beauty and important details that surround us. Cultivating awareness is about intentionally slowing down, paying attention, and engaging with our senses. It's about noticing the small things – the warmth of the sun on your skin, the sound of birdsong, the taste of your morning coffee.

Awareness extends beyond our immediate surroundings. It involves understanding our own thoughts and emotions, recognizing our biases, and acknowledging the perspectives of others. This deeper self-awareness allows us to make more conscious choices and respond to situations with greater clarity and compassion.

1ki8cci,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenday/comments/1ki8cci/billie_joe_armstrongs_favorite_songs_updated/,Billie Joe Armstrong's Favorite Songs - UPDATED APRIL 2024,"I’m not very active in the Green Day fan community anymore, but I wanted to share a playlist project I started back in 2020. It’s a collection of Billie Joe Armstrong’s favorite songs—or at least the ones he’s shared, covered, or mentioned over the years. At the time, Billie was my favorite artist, and creating this playlist became a way for me to explore the music that inspired him.

I originally started it during the pandemic, when Billie was doing his No Fun Mondays cover series. Now that was five years ago, and I’ve recently updated the playlist to reflect that milestone. I’ve added some new tracks, including covers from the early 90s to late 2010s that I found through setlist.fm. I also added songs mentioned on [Welcome to My Panic](https://youtu.be/1groDjC6PvU?si=sIG-23BTYY84F4kb) and [20th Anniversary: American Idiot - documentary](https://link.tubi.tv/gycZOgmBdTb) (if you do not want to pay the Peacock subscription it is free on Tubi as well as Heart Like a Hand Grenade). If Billie has posted or covered any new songs recently on his story or other means, feel free to let me know—I haven’t been keeping up as closely with the band and hardly active on social media anymore.

The playlist pulls from various sources:

Old Coverups, Del Gatos, and Upside Downers setlists

Oakland Coffee’s Playlist / Punk Bunny Radio

Livestreams, interviews, and Billie’s Instagram (both professional and Longshot accounts)


Whenever he shared a song, I tried to find the same version on Spotify or YouTube so it would reflect the sound he was hearing. My goal was to build something that fans—or anyone curious—could use to discover new music and dive into Billie’s influences.

Over the past five years, working on this playlist helped me discover so many bands I never would have known otherwise. It gave me a new appreciation for the punk, garage rock, and alternative scenes Billie’s a part of—and how those influences shape his sound.

If this playlist helps you find something new or brings back a memory, I hope you enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed making it.

1ki8b4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1ki8b4m/it_was_real/,IT WAS REAL,"I was chosen. I chose her. I was a good partner.  I gave real love.  I mattered.  We mattered.

What we had wasn’t a fantasy. It wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t just potential. It was lived, embodied, messy, beautiful, and real.

She loved a good grilled cheese and I made a great one. Might have been her favorite. If she was working from home and I was there, I’d bring her lunch - cook for her, make her coffee or go get it, whatever she needed. I loved doing it.

Saturday or Sunday mornings were my favorite. If we weren't lingering in bed, I’d wake up before everyone and walk the dog, feed her, and start breakfast with some gentle classical music just loud enough not to wake anyone. I knew how she liked her eggs - over medium with sprinkled cheese and hot sauce. I kept trying to perfect it.
Breakfast usually included pancakes, bacon, potatoes, avocadoes,  toast, fresh fruit, smoothies - and ALWAYS coffee. It was joy. It was love.

I went to the store at least once a week and stocked that house with care.  Everything her son loved.  Everything she loved. I planned our meals. I cooked for us. I washed the dishes.  Made tea before bed. I made our home feel full. I got her whatever feminine products she needed. I bought beer even when I was concerned about how often she drank - because I cared, and I wanted her to feel supported, not judged.

I helped her move out of her old place. Really helped. Packed, cleaned, hauled, took out all the garbage. She wanted to give up at one point, but I pushed us through. Finished it all myself when she had to work on Monday. Not because I wanted something from her. Because I loved her. Because I believed in what we were building.

I bought a couch, an air purifier, a dryer, a huge TV, matching furniture, mood lighting, mattresses, shoe racks (which were dominated with her shoes), dog gates, dog beds (all of which got chewed), toys, treats, harnesses, a crate, dry and wet food. I built our home, piece by piece and she made her loving and complementary contributions. We made it warm. We made it beautiful. It was ours. Often messy but full of love and life.

I supported her when she decided to start a new career. I encouraged her when she went back to school. I bought her a new computer. I believed in her. In us.

I loved her son. We connected right away - I’m good with kids and I'm a dad's dad through and through. I wasn't a replacement, I was a healthy supplement. It wasn’t always easy. He was wild and demanding. She couldn’t set boundaries. But I stayed the course. I showed up. I loved him.  Even when his father tried to poison the well. 

When he needed a new bed, I bought  one. Hauled out the old mattress. Set up the frame. Did it all happily with care and diligence.

We were a family.

We sang karaoke at home, just the two of us. One night she suggested we sing ""Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now"" it felt like magic. I believed every word. We smiled and kissed and felt unstoppable. I think I even sounded good.

She recorded songs for me. Wrote me loving notes. Sent me sexy videos full of fire and vulnerability. Shared her body with me in sacred, intimate, wild, beautiful ways. I knew her. I listened. I took my time. She let go with me. She trusted me. And I loved every inch of her.

She loved nipple play. I loved her small, beautiful breasts and the way her nipples responded to pressure, teasing, licking, and twisting. She gave herself to me and I honored every bit of it. Her shaking, breathless orgasms meant everything to me. I felt proud, connected, alive.

We made love more times than I can count. I craved her. I didn’t need anything else. I didn’t love her for performance. I loved her for her.

I bought her little gifts just because. I wanted to see her smile. That was enough reason.

When both my parents died she stood next to me. No hesitation. She held me in grief. She was there. And I’ll never forget that.

We went to New Orleans. Did a ghost tour, danced, drank, held hands in the streets. She had a jealousy flareup. I stayed calm and talked her down. Later she suggested going to a strip club! I was unsure, watching her reactions, wanting to avoid triggering her again. But then something happened - as we walked past a stage, some men from a bachelor party looked at her instead of the dancer. Stared her down.  Without thinking, I said loud and proud - “Did you enjoy the show?” I was drunk on love. The men followed us outside, and she feared it would escalate, but I stayed calm, grounded, and steady. Smoothed it over. Protected us. That night, I truly felt what it meant to love like a man.

We stayed out all night even after Bourbon Street went dark. Drank, laughed, kissed, ate. We befriended a homeless man and I bought dinner for him and his dog. My heart was full.

She asked if I wanted to adopt a dog. Of course I said yes. That was us building a life. A family.

When she needed something, anything, I was there. I showed up.

In the end as she was running away I gave her one more gift, extremely personal and significant. A refinement of a symbol of what I thought we were building, what we were meant to be. Her dream that became mine too. A vision of something sacred, eternal, and loving. A seed planted with tenderness and foresight.  I gave it to her with my entire heart in it. With a message of love, hope, belief, and gratitude. The gift was real, as well as the meaning behind it.

And then the end came.

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t walk away. I didn’t give up.

She did.

And maybe she’ll pretend it didn’t matter. Maybe she has rewritten the story. Buried it in dark silence. And somehow she smiles through her shame.

But I know the truth - she’s ashamed. She has to be. Because no one walks away from this kind of love without consequence. You don’t destroy something sacred and stay untouched, unaccountable, unaffected.

Maybe she’ll never say it. Maybe no one else will ever be able to understand. But I do.

Because I was there. I was co-creating it alongside her. I gave everything. And it was real.

She can bury it. Deny it. Rewrite it. But I lived it. I remember.

And I am proud of myself.

I was a good partner.

I gave real authentic love.

I mattered.

I was chosen.

How to Manage Prostate Problems in Kerala — A Friendly Guide for Men’s Health

Let’s be real — most men in Kerala don’t talk about prostate issues until it starts affecting their daily life. Frequent trips to the bathroom? Weak urine stream? Feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely? These are signs your prostate is asking for attention.

So, [how to manage prostate problems in Kerala](https://sdcprostatecentre.com/how-to-manage-prostate-problems-in-kerala/) without stressing yourself out? Good news: it’s not as complicated as it sounds. This guide will walk you through simple steps — from diet to doctor visits — that can help you stay on top of your prostate health. Plus, we’ll talk about how places like SDC PROSTATE RESEARCH & TRAINING CENTRE in Thrissur are changing the game with advanced care.

Understanding the Prostate: What, Why, and How

The prostate is a walnut-sized gland just below the bladder. It plays a role in semen production. But as men age — especially over 50 — the gland can enlarge, causing a condition called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This can lead to troubling urinary symptoms.

Whether you’re dealing with BPH, prostatitis, or early signs of prostate trouble, it’s essential to know how to manage prostate problems in Kerala in a smart, health-conscious way.

Recognizing the Common Symptoms

* Trouble starting urination
* A weak or interrupted flow
* Frequent urge to pee, especially at night
* Pain or burning sensation
* Feeling that the bladder doesn’t empty

How to Manage Prostate Problems in Kerala the Right Way

Here are some proven strategies that men across Kerala can adopt to ease prostate-related symptoms and improve life quality:

🥗 Eat the Right Foods

Managing your prostate starts with your plate. Foods rich in antioxidants, omega-3s, and lycopene can promote better prostate health.

Include:

* Tomatoes (lycopene-rich)
* Green leafy vegetables
* Pumpkin seeds
* Fish like sardines or mackerel
* Zinc-rich foods like cashews

Avoid:

* Spicy foods
* Excess caffeine
* Alcohol
* Processed meat

Want to know how to manage prostate problems in Kerala with food? Stick to a “plant-leaning Kerala-style diet” with lots of vegetables, fish, and local superfoods.

🚶 Stay Physically Active

Daily walks, yoga, or even light cycling can improve bladder control and overall prostate function. Just 30 minutes a day helps. Plus, staying active also helps manage weight — a key factor in prostate health.

🧘 Control Stress

Prostate symptoms can get worse when you’re stressed. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or even taking short breaks during the day help ease your body and your bladder.

💧 Smart Fluid Management

Drink plenty of water, but reduce intake after 7 PM. Curb the urge to drink tea or coffee in the evenings — they act as diuretics.

🏋️‍♂️ Try Kegels (Yes, Men Too!)

Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles improves urinary control. These exercises are discreet and effective. Perfect for managing symptoms of BPH.

When to Seek Medical Help

Sometimes, despite doing everything right, the symptoms persist. That’s when you need to consult a urologist.

If you’re wondering how to manage prostate problems in Kerala medically, the best option is to visit a reputed center like SDC PROSTATE RESEARCH & TRAINING CENTRE, Thrissur.

What Makes SDC PROSTATE RESEARCH & TRAINING CENTRE a Top Choice?

* Advanced diagnostic tools
* Minimally invasive options like Rezum therapy, UroLift, and Laser Prostate Surgery (HoLEP, ThuFLEP)

1ki8a2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsentLoveLetters1st/comments/1ki8a2a/it_was_real/,IT WAS REAL,"I was chosen. I chose her. I was a good partner.  I gave real love.  I mattered.  We mattered.

What we had wasn’t a fantasy. It wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t just potential. It was lived, embodied, messy, beautiful, and real.

She loved a good grilled cheese and I made a great one. Might have been her favorite. If she was working from home and I was there, I’d bring her lunch - cook for her, make her coffee or go get it, whatever she needed. I loved doing it.

Saturday or Sunday mornings were my favorite. If we weren't lingering in bed, I’d wake up before everyone and walk the dog, feed her, and start breakfast with some gentle classical music just loud enough not to wake anyone. I knew how she liked her eggs - over medium with sprinkled cheese and hot sauce. I kept trying to perfect it.
Breakfast usually included pancakes, bacon, potatoes, avocadoes,  toast, fresh fruit, smoothies - and ALWAYS coffee. It was joy. It was love.

I went to the store at least once a week and stocked that house with care.  Everything her son loved.  Everything she loved. I planned our meals. I cooked for us. I washed the dishes.  Made tea before bed. I made our home feel full. I got her whatever feminine products she needed. I bought beer even when I was concerned about how often she drank - because I cared, and I wanted her to feel supported, not judged.

I helped her move out of her old place. Really helped. Packed, cleaned, hauled, took out all the garbage. She wanted to give up at one point, but I pushed us through. Finished it all myself when she had to work on Monday. Not because I wanted something from her. Because I loved her. Because I believed in what we were building.

I bought a couch, an air purifier, a dryer, a huge TV, matching furniture, mood lighting, mattresses, shoe racks (which were dominated with her shoes), dog gates, dog beds (all of which got chewed), toys, treats, harnesses, a crate, dry and wet food. I built our home, piece by piece and she made her loving and complementary contributions. We made it warm. We made it beautiful. It was ours. Often messy but full of love and life.

I supported her when she decided to start a new career. I encouraged her when she went back to school. I bought her a new computer. I believed in her. In us.

I loved her son. We connected right away - I’m good with kids and I'm a dad's dad through and through. I wasn't a replacement, I was a healthy supplement. It wasn’t always easy. He was wild and demanding. She couldn’t set boundaries. But I stayed the course. I showed up. I loved him.  Even when his father tried to poison the well. 

When he needed a new bed, I bought  one. Hauled out the old mattress. Set up the frame. Did it all happily with care and diligence.

We were a family.

We sang karaoke at home, just the two of us. One night she suggested we sing ""Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now"" it felt like magic. I believed every word. We smiled and kissed and felt unstoppable. I think I even sounded good.

She recorded songs for me. Wrote me loving notes. Sent me sexy videos full of fire and vulnerability. Shared her body with me in sacred, intimate, wild, beautiful ways. I knew her. I listened. I took my time. She let go with me. She trusted me. And I loved every inch of her.

She loved nipple play. I loved her small, beautiful breasts and the way her nipples responded to pressure, teasing, licking, and twisting. She gave herself to me and I honored every bit of it. Her shaking, breathless orgasms meant everything to me. I felt proud, connected, alive.

We made love more times than I can count. I craved her. I didn’t need anything else. I didn’t love her for performance. I loved her for her.

I bought her little gifts just because. I wanted to see her smile. That was enough reason.

When both my parents died she stood next to me. No hesitation. She held me in grief. She was there. And I’ll never forget that.

We went to New Orleans. Did a ghost tour, danced, drank, held hands in the streets. She had a jealousy flareup. I stayed calm and talked her down. Later she suggested going to a strip club! I was unsure, watching her reactions, wanting to avoid triggering her again. But then something happened - as we walked past a stage, some men from a bachelor party looked at her instead of the dancer. Stared her down.  Without thinking, I said loud and proud - “Did you enjoy the show?” I was drunk on love. The men followed us outside, and she feared it would escalate, but I stayed calm, grounded, and steady. Smoothed it over. Protected us. That night, I truly felt what it meant to love like a man.

We stayed out all night even after Bourbon Street went dark. Drank, laughed, kissed, ate. We befriended a homeless man and I bought dinner for him and his dog. My heart was full.

She asked if I wanted to adopt a dog. Of course I said yes. That was us building a life. A family.

When she needed something, anything, I was there. I showed up.

In the end as she was running away I gave her one more gift, extremely personal and significant. A refinement of a symbol of what I thought we were building, what we were meant to be. Her dream that became mine too. A vision of something sacred, eternal, and loving. A seed planted with tenderness and foresight.  I gave it to her with my entire heart in it. With a message of love, hope, belief, and gratitude. The gift was real, as well as the meaning behind it.

And then the end came.

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t walk away. I didn’t give up.

She did.

And maybe she’ll pretend it didn’t matter. Maybe she has rewritten the story. Buried it in dark silence. And somehow she smiles through her shame.

But I know the truth - she’s ashamed. She has to be. Because no one walks away from this kind of love without consequence. You don’t destroy something sacred and stay untouched, unaccountable, unaffected.

Maybe she’ll never say it. Maybe no one else will ever be able to understand. But I do.

Because I was there. I was co-creating it alongside her. I gave everything. And it was real.

She can bury it. Deny it. Rewrite it. But I lived it. I remember.

And I am proud of myself.

I was a good partner.

I gave real authentic love.

I mattered.

I was chosen.

And I chose.

And I will not be silenced. ",1,1746758997.0,unsentLoveLetters1st,0,1.0,False

Life here is a bit of a quiet adventure – juggling a remote job, chipping away at studies, and finding comfort in a simple, intentional routine. My ideal evening usually involves diving deep into a sci-fi universe (current obsessions include The Expanse, Silo, Star Trek, Stargate, Foundation), exploring fascinating documentaries, or getting lost in a perfectly curated soundtrack. If you can discuss the theoretical physics of warp drive or the political structures of The Last Kingdom, we're probably off to a great start!

I'm not someone who thrives on constant external stimulation. I find joy in the quiet moments, the intellectual rabbit holes, and the comfort of routine. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs – my vices extend to perhaps too much fruit juice and an unwavering loyalty to tea (if you're a coffee person, we can agree to disagree peacefully!).

I believe relationships flourish on mutual reciprocity, consistent effort, and knowing you have a reliable teammate by your side. I value loyalty, emotional honesty, and showing up consistently when it counts. I guess you could say I value closeness and connection deeply.

I dream of a cozy home (maybe a cat or two?), perhaps a bit of quiet countryside eventually, and definitely exploring the world side by side. I'm working towards starting my own company, driven by that desire for a stable, shared future.

This isn't a search for fleeting moments. I'm serious about finding my person for a long-term, deeply connected life.

I write for aerospace. At our company, it is customary to involve our team about two months before a new product launches to production. I started with the company in April '22 and in August that year, my boss assigned me to create a Rev:Initial Component Maintenance Manual for a new unit.

Again: we get involved two months before launch. 

I started attending meetings, taking notes, developing what I could. All the while, the PM kept saying, ""We are two months away from launch."" August became September, which became October. Program manager changed. Still, every week, the new PM kept saying we were two months from launch. Fast forward to October 23: another new PM and we're still two months away. October 24: still two months away.  Every engineer originally involved has left the company or handed the program off to someone else. I'm now the longest serving member of the project team.

Today, friends. TODAY. In the year of something or other 2025. Thirty-three months and four PMs later. Today, I finally drafted that document. It's like this weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

Tell me a bit about yourself – where you are in the world, your age, time zone, and what part of my rambling struck a chord. Low-effort messages tend to get lost in the digital ether; I'm looking for someone ready to put a little mutual energy in from the start.

Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup was, by all accounts, an unremarkable man. He had a job in accounts (the irony wasn't lost on him, though he rarely mentioned it), a slightly lopsided houseplant he'd named Susan (after an ex who also leaned a bit), and a digestive system that could charitably be described as… expressive.

The fateful Tuesday began like any other. Barty had consumed his usual breakfast: a bowl of ""Fiber Fiesta"" cereal (the box promised a party in his colon, a promise it always kept with gusto) and a lukewarm cup of instant coffee that tasted vaguely of burnt toast and regret. The morning commute was a symphony of honking horns and Barty's own internal rumbles, a percussive prelude to the day's main event.

It happened at precisely 11:03 AM.

Barty was hunched over his ergonomic keyboard, wrestling with a spreadsheet that seemed to have a personal vendetta against him. He'd been holding it in, a familiar pressure building, a gaseous grumbling that had been his constant companion since the Fiber Fiesta. He’d tried shifting in his chair, clenching, even humming the national anthem under his breath (a trick his grandma swore by, though its efficacy was dubious).

But this one… this one was different. It wasn't just a casual toot, a fleeting whisper of wind. This was the Moby Dick of farts, the Big Kahuna, the one you tell your grandkids about, assuming your grandkids aren't too horrified to listen.

He felt it coming like a runaway freight train, a seismic event brewing in his lower intestine. There was no stopping it. He squeezed his eyes shut, braced his hands on his desk, and surrendered.

The sound that ripped from him was… monumental. It wasn't a sharp crack, nor a bubbly squeak. It was a deep, resonant, baritone BROOOOOOOM that seemed to vibrate the very fillings in his teeth. The office, a typically bustling hive of keyboard clicks and hushed phone calls, fell silent. Utterly, completely silent.

Barty’s face burned hotter than a thousand suns. He dared to crack an eye open. Brenda from HR, a woman whose face was perpetually set in an expression of mild disapproval, was staring at him, her mouth agape, a half-eaten custard cream frozen halfway to her lips. Kevin from IT, who usually communicated only in grunts and binary code, had actually swiveled his chair around, his eyes wide with something akin to awe, or possibly terror. Even Mr. Grumbles, the perpetually grumpy office manager whose office door was always closed, had poked his head out, his comb-over slightly askew.

Time seemed to stretch, each second a tiny, agonizing eternity. Barty wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole, or at least for his ergonomic chair to develop a sudden, powerful ejector seat.

Then, the smell hit.

It was… indescribable. Imagine, if you will, the unholy union of a forgotten gym sock, a family of badgers who’d taken up competitive cheese-eating, and the lingering aroma of a science experiment gone terribly, terribly wrong. It was a smell that didn't just offend the nostrils; it assaulted them, took them hostage, and then performed unspeakable acts upon their delicate sensibilities.

Brenda made a small, choked sound and fumbled for her emergency can of air freshener, the one labeled ""Ocean Breeze"" which, in this context, felt like a cruel, ironic joke. Kevin actually gagged. Mr. Grumbles slammed his door shut with a force that rattled the motivational posters on the wall.

Barty, meanwhile, was trying to become one with his chair. He wished he could retract his head into his torso like a terrified turtle. ""Excuse me,"" he mumbled, his voice a strangled whisper.

But it wasn't over. Oh no, it was just beginning.

As the initial shockwave of the scent began to (theoretically) dissipate – though ""mutate"" might have been a more accurate term – something strange happened. The fluorescent lights above Barty's desk flickered. Once, twice, then went out completely, plunging his little cubicle into semi-darkness.

""Great,"" Barty muttered, ""Now I've broken the lights.""

He jiggled the switch. Nothing. He was about to call for Kevin, who despite his current state of olfactory shock was usually good with these things, when he noticed it.

The air around his desk, where the epicenter of the… event… had been, seemed… thicker. The potent aroma hadn't just lingered; it seemed to be congealing. Patches of the air shimmered, like heat haze on asphalt, but with a sickly, greenish-brown tint. The light from the hallway seemed to bend and warp as it passed through these patches.

Barty stared, his earlier embarrassment momentarily forgotten, replaced by a creeping, icy tendril of unease. ""What in the…""

The shimmering patches began to coalesce, drawing together like malevolent droplets of oil on water. The smell intensified again, but now it carried a new note, something acrid and almost… hungry. Slowly, a visible form began to take shape in the dim light of his cubicle. It was roughly spherical, about the size of a beach ball, and it pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence that was a nauseating blend of swamp gas and old cheese. It was, unmistakably, the fart. His fart. And it was looking at him. Or at least, it gave that distinct impression.

A low, guttural gurgle emanated from the cloud, a sound like air escaping a long-sealed tomb, or perhaps just very, very bad indigestion amplified a thousand times. It bobbed in the air, then drifted slowly, purposefully, out of his cubicle and into the main office area.

Brenda, who had just managed to take a shaky sip of water, saw it first. Her eyes widened, her face turned a shade paler than her custard cream, and she let out a shriek that could curdle milk. The cloud, Barty's monstrous, sentient fart-cloud, seemed to quiver at the sound, almost like it was pleased.

It then drifted towards Kevin's workstation. Kevin, still looking a bit green around the gills, was trying to reboot his computer. The cloud enveloped his monitor, and the screen instantly fizzled, emitting a shower of sparks before going completely black. Kevin yelped and scrambled back, tripping over his chair.

The cloud let out another wet, gurgling sound, which Barty was beginning to interpret as a chuckle.

His life, Barty suddenly realized with a chilling certainty that had nothing to do with residual flatulence, would never, ever be the same. And as his airborne abomination began to slowly drift towards Mr. Grumbles' closed door, pulsing with noxious intent, Barty had a sinking feeling that ""different"" was going to involve a lot more than just office apologies. This wasn't just a bad smell; it was a bad omen, a gaseous demon he'd unwittingly unleashed upon his unsuspecting colleagues.



Chapter 2: The Brown Note



The sentient fart cloud, which Barty was starting to think of as ""The Aftermath,"" didn't bother with the niceties of knocking. It simply seeped under Mr. Grumbles' office door, a noxious tendril of greenish-brown vapor leading the charge. A moment later, a muffled yelp echoed from within, followed by a series of increasingly frantic thumps and a sound like a walrus gargling gravel.

Barty, Brenda, and Kevin exchanged horrified glances. Brenda was clutching her ""Ocean Breeze"" can like a holy relic, though its power seemed woefully inadequate against this particular brand of evil. Kevin, ever the pragmatist, was already halfway under his desk, muttering about network protocols and the sudden, inexplicable urge to invest in a gas mask.

Then, from Mr. Grumbles' office, came a new sound. It was a low, continuous rumble, like a distant thunderstorm, but somehow… wetter. The rumble grew in intensity, punctuated by strained groans and the distinct creak of an office chair under immense pressure.

""What's it doing to him?"" Brenda whispered, her voice trembling.

Barty didn't want to know. He really, really didn't. But a morbid curiosity, mixed with a dawning sense of responsibility (it was his fart, after all), kept him rooted to the spot.

The rumbling reached a crescendo, a truly earth-shattering (or perhaps trouser-shattering) roar that made the previous BROOOOOOOM sound like a polite cough. It was followed by a series of smaller, sputtering pops, then a long, drawn-out, deflating hiss. And then… silence. A heavy, ominous silence that was somehow worse than the cacophony that had preceded it.

The Aftermath oozed back out from under Mr. Grumbles' door. It seemed… larger. And somehow, smugger. It pulsed with a triumphant, sickly green light, and the gurgling sound it emitted now had a distinctly satisfied, almost purring quality.

It drifted slowly towards Brenda.

""No,"" she whimpered, backing away, spraying a desperate cloud of Ocean Breeze in its path. The Aftermath seemed to inhale the floral scent, and for a terrifying moment, Barty thought it might actually smile. Or whatever the gaseous equivalent of a smile was. Instead, it let out a sound like a wet balloon animal being twisted into an obscene shape, and the Ocean Breeze scent was instantly overpowered by its own signature stench, now somehow even more potent.

Brenda stumbled, her eyes wide with terror. The Aftermath enveloped her.

What happened next was both horrifying and deeply, deeply undignified. Brenda, a woman who prided herself on her composure and her meticulously organized spice rack, began to… well, she began to fart. Not just one or two, but a continuous, unrelenting barrage, each one more violent and explosive than the last. Her face contorted, first in shock, then in agony, then in a strange, gassy ecstasy. She clutched her stomach, her body convulsing with each internal detonation. The air around her thickened with a new, uniquely Brenda-esque aroma that mingled tragically with The Aftermath's own foulness.

""It's… it's making her…"" Kevin stammered from under his desk, his voice muffled.

""Fart herself to death?"" Barty finished, his own stomach churning. It was absurd. It was grotesque. It was also, undeniably, happening.

Brenda's eyes rolled back in her head. A final, monumental eruption escaped her, a sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of the building, and then she collapsed, a faint plume of her own making rising from her still form. The Aftermath pulsed again, absorbing the essence of Brenda's final, fatal flatulence, growing slightly larger, its greenish hue deepening.

It turned its attention to Kevin's desk.

""No, no, no, no!"" Kevin shrieked, scrambling further under his desk, which offered about as much protection as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. ""I'm just IT! I fix things! I don't… I don't do this!""

The Aftermath, however, was not interested in his job description. It seeped around the desk, its tendrils exploring, seeking. Barty knew he had to do something. This was his creation, his monstrous, gaseous offspring. He couldn't just stand by and watch it decimate the entire accounts department.

But what could he do? You couldn't punch a fart. You couldn't reason with it. Could you… apologize to it?

""Look,"" Barty began, his voice surprisingly steady, ""I'm… I'm sorry. That was me. My fault. Fiber Fiesta, you know? Maybe we can talk about this?""

The Aftermath paused in its pursuit of Kevin. It swiveled its bulk (if a cloud can be said to have bulk) towards Barty. It emitted a low, questioning gurgle.

Barty took a hesitant step forward. ""You don't have to do this. They're innocent! Well, mostly innocent. Mr. Grumbles did steal my stapler once, but…""

The Aftermath let out an impatient, bubbling hiss. It clearly wasn't interested in office politics or petty theft. It wanted… something else. And as it began to drift towards Barty, its sickly green light pulsing with a predatory hunger, Barty had a terrible, sinking feeling he knew exactly what that was. It had come from him. And it seemed determined to make everyone else experience the same explosive fate.

His life, he thought with a fresh wave of horror, was not only never going to be the same, it might also be very, very short.



Chapter 3: The Cycle



The Aftermath loomed, a pulsating sphere of noxious intent, its sickly green light casting an unnatural pallor on Barty's already pale face. It had consumed the essence of Mr. Grumbles and Brenda, growing stronger, more potent, its low gurgle now carrying a distinct, almost musical quality that was deeply unsettling. Kevin remained frozen under his desk, a muffled whimper occasionally escaping his hiding spot.

""Okay, look,"" Barty said again, backing away slowly, his hands held up defensively. ""This is… unexpected. For both of us, I assume? I mean, I didn't plan this. It just… happened. Spicy Fiber Fiesta, maybe? They added ghost peppers this season, I think.""

The Aftermath didn't respond with words, but its gurgling intensified, sounding less like a chuckle and more like a hungry growl. It drifted closer, the air around Barty becoming thick and cloying, filled with the concentrated aroma of his own digestive failure, now amplified to cosmic proportions.

He could feel it now, a strange resonance. It was like standing too close to a powerful speaker, the bass vibrating in his chest, but this vibration was deeper, centered in his gut, a mirror image of the rumbling he’d felt moments before the ""Big One.""

The cloud reached him, enveloping him in its foul embrace. Barty squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the inevitable, explosive, undignified end that had befallen Brenda and, presumably, Mr. Grumbles. He waited for the internal detonations, the uncontrollable release, the final, fatal fart.

But it didn't come.

Instead, the cloud seemed to… settle around him. The intense smell remained, overwhelming his senses, but it didn't trigger the violent expulsion he expected. It was more like being submerged in warm, incredibly putrid bathwater.

Then, the vibration intensified. It wasn't just in his chest now; it was everywhere, coursing through his veins, his bones, the very core of his being. It felt like his internal organs were being gently but firmly massaged by a thousand tiny, gassy hands.

And then, he felt it. A faint, almost imperceptible tugging sensation. It was coming from the cloud, and it was directed inward, towards him.

It was trying to pull him in.

Not physically, not like a vacuum, but something deeper, more fundamental. It was like his own essence, his very being, was being drawn out, absorbed into the gaseous form that had originated within him.

Panic flared, hot and sharp, cutting through the thick fog of the smell. He thrashed instinctively, trying to push the cloud away, but his hands passed through it as if it were just smoke, albeit incredibly foul-smelling smoke.

The tugging grew stronger. He could feel his energy draining, his thoughts becoming sluggish. Images flickered in his mind – the Fiber Fiesta box, Susan the lopsided plant, the spreadsheet that had started it all, Brenda's horrified face, Kevin's panicked scramble. Fragments of his unremarkable life, being pulled away.

A new sensation bloomed in his gut, not the painful pressure that preceded the Big One, but a strange, empty ache, like a void was forming inside him. The Aftermath pulsed with a brighter, more vibrant green light, its gurgling taking on a triumphant, almost joyous tone.

Barty realized, with a sickening certainty, what was happening. His creation wasn't just killing others with flatulence; it was consuming their essence, adding their gassy remains to its own mass. And now, it was returning to its source, not to destroy him, but to reintegrate. To absorb the very person from whom it had sprung.

He was being reabsorbed by his own fart.

The thought was so utterly bizarre, so profoundly humiliating, that it almost overshadowed the terror. He, Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup, was being assimilated by an airborne abomination of his own making. His legacy wouldn't be his accounts work or his slightly sad houseplant, but this… this monstrous cloud of digestive byproduct.

His vision began to dim, the office around him fading into a swirling vortex of greenish-brown. The gurgling sound seemed to fill his head, echoing in the newfound emptiness within him. He could feel himself shrinking, his form dissolving, becoming one with the pungent cloud.

His last coherent thought, before his consciousness dissolved entirely into the collective gaseous consciousness of The Aftermath, was a faint, resigned sigh.

Kevin, still cowering under his desk, finally dared to peek out. The large, pulsating green cloud hovered where Barty had stood moments before. It seemed different now, larger, its light more intense, its gurgling sound a complex symphony of past meals and departed souls. It slowly drifted away from Barty's empty chair, towards the next cubicle, towards the unsuspecting occupants of the floor above, ready to continue its cycle of absorption and expansion.

Bartholomew Buttercup was gone. Only The Aftermath remained, a monument to a truly epic case of indigestion and the unexpected, terrifying consequences of a Fiber Fiesta gone wrong. The age of Barty was over. The age of The Aftermath had just begun.",1,1746758583.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

My wife left me at the end of January (obviously not the exciting part), and most of my furniture conveniently left me with her. Basically, I was left with the bedroom set. That's it. But I have a daughter who lives with her mother primarily, and she needed some semblance of a normal home, so I had to buy some furniture. To be fair, I bought a TV at Walmart and a couch, love seat, and full size bedroom set for her from a local furniture store, but that still left a lot of gaps to fill. Especially after I agreed to split the rent with a friend who also needed bedroom furniture for her daughters.

HOWEVER, thanks to Temu shopping, this house is about to be a home again. In the past few weeks, we've ordered a full size mattress for my daughter, two twin size beds AND mattresses for her daughters, a dresser for her girls, and an entertainment center with matching lift-top coffee table, and our total combined out-of-pocket cost is only $559.40.

Once things arrive, my house will start to feel normal for the first time in months, and I'm also getting the opportunity to help a friend get on her feet and provide a normal life for her girls.

I’m planning to start a bike shop that’s more than just a retail space — I want it to be a hub for the cycling community. Think: bike shop + coffee shop + chill spot for riders to hang out, get repairs, and connect.

Before I get deep into planning, I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* What’s your opinion on the current bike scene and market?  
* How would you feel about a café-style bike shop — would you hang out there?  
* What do you feel is missing in today’s bike shops or bike communities?  
* If you could design your ideal local bike shop, what would it have?
* What brands, gear, or services do you wish more local shops offered?  
* And where (city or neighborhood) would you love to see something like this pop up?  

Any thoughts — big or small — are appreciated.   
  
Thanks in advance and ride safe!

If you search hard enough, you will find FUD on coins like Shib and Pepe back when they were at very low marketcaps like 50m or some shit. Even more recently with SPX they were dead for over a year before overnight picking up and running it up to nearly a billion.

I've actually found a Pepe fudder from way before it really took off, and if this account shown in the links below held a decent bag from this tweet, they would currently be in possession of generational wealth.

[https:\/\/x.com\/AltcoinDailyio\/status\/1654893606292062209](https://preview.redd.it/np9mrcu63oze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a51e555f1a22613208224dad11c68f4b77c9f7f)

  
What this means is you never want to pay attention to anything people are saying about something (yes I know this is kind of contradictory to this whole post but stay with me here). Even if someone says that Kendu is cooked or whatever, just do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now (which we've just broken out of today, see: [legendary comeback on the charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1khjdkl/kendu_just_brokeout_nothing_is_stopping_this_now/)) but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to a little lower from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot straight back up to 50-100 milly, which is probably what is going to happen from here seeing the massive reversal in the wider market today.

Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

Look at the past Shiba Inu profit chart from release to ATH's:

[shib chart before and after mooning](https://preview.redd.it/pgzcfuz83oze1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf284c733594dc2990ae5267702f4062afdb8e1)

And what is KENDU you may ask? Well let me explain...

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

How do you guys do it? 

After going through a tough breakup last year, last month I decided that I'm feeling good and ready to try dating again. I started getting matches and talking to some great women, but slowly the unmatching and the ghosting started. I then matched with someone and we really hit it off, we spoke for a few weeks, and then met for a coffee date - it went amazing, I felt extremely happy- especially when she told me that she felt the same way. We continued to chat though text for a few days, but then it started to fade. The 24 hour responses, the lack of effort in her responses. I asked if she'd like to attend an event with me next week, but she said she was busy, and didn't offer any alternative plan. So I'm assuming that's the end of that. I'm now feeling similar to how I felt during the breakup - lost and mentally exhausted (but not as bad as the breakup).

The other day one of our coworkers made a homophobic comment about Vin Diesel “ruining” Fast & Furious. He didn’t laugh or agree. He just stood there quietly and changed the topic to other movies Vin Diesel was in. Didn’t say anything weird, just moved on.

He also offered me his old shirt and gloves when I didn’t have proper gear and when I was cold. He also frequently buys me coffee during lunch, which he offers. We talk a lot, mostly about random stuff like video games and movies, but it’s always easy. He actually listens, makes eye contact, and it feels kinda good being around him.

I literally can’t stop thinking about him. His smile, the way his abs show when he reaches up on the scaffolding or takes off his sweater, the sound of his voice. It’s bad. I know I’m being delusional but I can’t help it. 

It’s just me and him tomorrow, with our boss supervising. He’s driving me to the next job site in his car, and I kinda wanna bring up something to get a read on how he feels about gay people. Just to get a sense of where he stands, you know?

But maybe that’s dumb. I don’t really know what I’m doing here. I have basically no experience with this stuff and I’m just kinda winging it at this point.

Slight TW for talks of body size/image. 

So I just did my first gestational diabetes test… and failed. Miserably. I expected it somewhat, partially due to family history of GD and the fact that I went to a birthday party the night before and indulged in a big desert. I was dehydrated, and didn’t eat that morning and only had coffee. So of course, I scored above where I should’ve been. I cried when I found out and had a borderline panic attack; probably overreacted, but the pregnancy emotions hit out of NOWHERE. 

For context, I am someone who has always been overweight. I have done diet after diet and worked with dietitians, bariatric specialists, and therapists for years to work on losing weight. I lost 40 lbs before getting pregnant (unexpectedly), but was still considered morbidly obese. My doctors haven’t said anything about it for the last 27 weeks, since I’m healthy, strong, active and have a decent diet. Women in my family have always been larger, and regardless of my diet my genetics have always won. 

Now that I’ve failed the first GD test? Suddenly, I am high risk, should plan for c-section or induction, and have to change EVERYTHING I’ve been doing. I am regularly low carb/sugar anyway, but I spent 45 mins on the phone with an RN today who clearly expressed her perception of my body and weight as being the result of sugary drinks and indulging in whatever I want every minute of the day. It was pointed out to me several times that women of my size should “carefully consider taking on another pregnancy before losing more weight.” I was also told that I shouldn’t exceed a 20lb weight gain (first time hearing anything about my weight gain after six months of pregnancy), and I am already at 18lbs gained, so I might as well consent to the c-section now.

I spoke to my regular OB after this conversation and she was appalled by what happened, but unfortunately the RN is someone I can’t get rid of, as she works directly with the physician delivering baby. So now I have two appts weekly to monitor me, 45 mins from home and work, with my schedule only accommodating one of those appointments, so I will exhaust my PTO before he’s born.

Over the past couple weeks I have been collecting data on how coffee tastes with different Aeropress recipes to build a model. But obviously this is slow going.

I am wondering if people are interested in the idea of filling out a survey for Aeropress coffee they have made, capturing recipe parameters (mass of coffee, brew water volume, temperature of water, etc.) and results (overall taste, bitterness, strength, etc.). I would set up the survey and probably try to get feedback on the most common and easiest things to capture. And I would of course share the results with the subreddit.

The background here is that you can train models to take inputs like this and evaluate how important different parameters are or make predictions of where different formulations may end up in terms of taste. You just get a better model if you get 100s to 1000s of data points vs. the handful I am collecting. In the future you could potentially use this general model as a basis to build an individual model that would have your own input and would adjust for specific tastes. And I would probably use it as a basis to generate new recipes for me to try and I would grade them, in a sort of “active learning” loop. Maybe even pull in tasting notes from the coffees or the country of origin. One thing I am personally interested is trying to make a cup of dark roasted coffee that I enjoy as much as some of my light roasts and had started logging some recipes for that anyway. I am really doing this as a fun way to learn some coding and apply some machine learning that my colleagues do at work and thought that Aeropress coffee was a fun system but there are at least 8 or 10 variables you can control for when you make a cup of coffee. 

At this point I am just interested in feedback, like does this sound cool and fun? Or tedious and too nerdy? I appreciate there is an art to making coffee and I am not trying to say I’m trying to have the robot overlords “make the best coffee.” I really don’t want to suck the fun out of Aeropress for anyone.

# What’s All the Buzz About Allison’s SPX Lotto Pins Formula?

If you’ve been hanging out in the trading world lately, chances are you’ve heard some serious hype around **Simpler Trading - Get Allison’s New SPX Lotto Pins Formula - Pro Package**. But what’s it all about? In a nutshell, this course is all about learning how to trade SPX same-day options—those spicy, high-reward “lotto” trades that can potentially turn a small $150 position into an 887% gain. Yes, you read that right—887% in under 40 minutes. Crazy, right?

# Who Is This Strategy For?

Short answer: anyone who wants big potential profits with small capital risk. Allison’s strategy is perfect for traders who are into high-intensity, last-hour setups and want to avoid overnight exposure. If you're the kind of person who checks charts at lunch and wants to be done by dinner, this could be your jam. New traders will appreciate the simplicity Allison brings to the complex world of butterflies and vertical spreads, while experienced traders will find value in her real-time live sessions and deeper insights.

# Why This Formula Works (Especially in This Volatile Market)

So why is this **SPX Lotto Pins** method so effective right now? Well, since the S&P 500 (SPX) started offering **zero days till expiration** (0DTE) options, volatility has created some *massive* end-of-day price swings—often over 100 points. Allison saw the opportunity and built her “bargain butterfly” setups to capitalize on those last-minute moves without holding anything overnight.

That’s huge. No stress sleeping on a trade, no waiting games—just smart risk-reward setups using a tight budget. $150 or less to enter, but targeting triple-digit returns. Efficient, tactical, and aggressive (in a good way).

# Where Do You Learn It All?

The **Simpler Trading - Get Allison’s New SPX Lotto Pins Formula - Pro Package** comes fully loaded. You get:

* A **Live Strategy Class** with Allison breaking down her setups.
* **Two Bonus Classes** for deeper dives.
* **Two Days of Live Trading**, where you watch Allison do her thing in real-time.
* A **Bonus Vertical Spreads Guide**, because understanding spreads is key to mastering butterflies.
* And the **Options Chain Class**, where Allison demystifies one of the most misunderstood tools in options trading.

It’s all online, so you can learn from anywhere—coffee shop, couch, trading dungeon, whatever works for you.

# When Is the Right Time to Use This Strategy?

This setup is perfect for volatile days and high-momentum environments—especially during that chaotic last hour of the market. Allison focuses on “same-day” trades, so timing is tight and tactical. The system thrives when SPX is swinging wildly in either direction, which, let’s face it, happens a lot these days.

You’ll be targeting trades that are lightning-fast. No babysitting positions overnight. Just in and out—clean.

# How Does It Actually Help You Grow?

Here’s the deal: if you’re tired of “almost” trades and second-guessing your entries, Allison’s process gives you structure. It’s not just about taking random swings. It’s about learning how to build risk-controlled setups using tools like vertical spreads and butterflies. Plus, watching her live lets you *really* see how a pro thinks through fast-moving trades.

And let’s not ignore the value of her teaching style. Traders consistently say Allison makes the complex easy and the intimidating… actually fun.

In conclusion, **Simpler Trading - Get Allison’s New SPX Lotto Pins Formula - Pro Package** isn’t just another course—it’s a masterclass in controlled, high-reward trading during the most exciting time of the market day.

If you truly love starbucks, I'm happy for you! I've never really wanted this. It was a job to pay the bills while I tried to find work in my preferred field. (A Venti/Trenta size rant)

My anxiety has SHOT UP with this job. Especially during peak times and I'm on Drive thru with everyone yelling in my ear on the headset (plus a few co workers who think its funny to blow into the mic when its finally quiet. Ive seen people on this thread saying they either are on Drive thru order or window. For us its just one position. SOMETIMES if its really busy and we have enough partners on the floor, someone will do orders for me. Im very slow on bar and good with customers so im always stuck to DT. 

Thank THE SIREN I'm leaving. I just put in my two weeks. My SSV just informed me today that we are apparently now responsible for pulling weeds, gathering trash and scraping gum off the oavement in our drive thru. We make BARELY above min wage. I do not get paid enough to do this. I even made a passing comment to my SM about it. We're here to make coffee. I understand keeping our store clean, but oulling weeds is not my job. (He wasnt happy that i said that but oh well. I pit in my 2 weeks the next day)

The new dress code is absolutely ridiculous. We already lost one partner who was going to be a SSV because of the piercings rule. One of my SSV has a whole bunch of nose piercings and a tooth gem that would have to surgically be removed. Shes been a partner for like 3 years. 

Our store specifically was built when our town was much smaller. It just off a major highway. Its hard if you have more than 3 partners on the floor because then youre stepping on each other and in the way of each other to get literally anything. We now have the new standard that stickers for ALL drinks are all coming out of one machine which is INCREDIBLY STUPID. It slows us down and we dont end up pulling the stickers for drive thru because we dont want to pull the mobile/delivery order stickers yet. 

Our back room is also TINNNY. Im pretty sure it violates some health and food safety. Our garbage bin is right next to the pastry cart since theres no where else for either to go. I will say in the past 6 months its been better than it was when i started. The old SM kept a bunch of random things in the back, including broken appliances. She made everyone anxious when she walked in. She wouldnt take responsibility for her own mistakes and blame others. For example someone would order an iced latte. She would make it hot by accident. When told its supposed to be iced she would say ""it wasnt on the sticker"" when in fact, it was on the sticker. She would always coach us on making sure we're reading the sticker or listening to the order but shes the one that would mess up. Our new store manager has done major improvements. But he did them slowly to not overhwlem us. But then hes getting shit from the DM for things not being up to standard. 

Some of this may be just a me thing. Ive never worked in the food industry. I've worked tons of retail jobs though. I dont mind my job sometimes. If its slow and i can take my time, i enjoy bar. I love baking so it reminds me alot of baking.
I'm sorry for the trenta sized rant. I needed to get this out with people that would understand. I'll definitely miss the chill mornings where we would make breakfast and some sort of new drink to try.  But otherwise 3705 signing out 🫡 ",5,1746756009.0,starbucksbaristas,2,0.86,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of paper tea cups hinge on several key features that directly impact their performance and usability.

**Material Composition:** The type of paper used considerably influences the cup's durability and heat resistance.

Paper tea cups are typically made from paperboard, which is a thicker, sturdier form of paper. The quality of the paperboard determines how well the cup can hold hot liquids without becoming soggy or leaking. Some cups feature a polyethylene (PE) lining on the inside, which acts as a moisture barrier and prevents the paper from absorbing the liquid. Others may use a more eco-amiable polylactic acid (PLA) lining, derived from renewable resources like corn starch. The coating type affects the cup's recyclability and compostability.

**size and Capacity:** Choosing the appropriate size is crucial for serving different types of tea and controlling portion sizes.

Paper tea cups come in a range of sizes,typically measured in ounces (oz). Common sizes include 8 oz, 12 oz, and 16 oz. Smaller cups, such as 8 oz, are ideal for espresso-based drinks or smaller servings of tea. Medium-sized cups, like 12 oz, are versatile and suitable for a variety of beverages. Larger cups, such as 16 oz, are best for iced teas, lattes, or beverages with a large amount of foam. The cup's capacity should match the intended use and the preferences of the consumers.

**Insulation and Heat Resistance:** Adequate insulation is essential for keeping hot drinks at the right temperature and protecting hands from burns.

Many paper tea cups have a double-wall or triple-wall construction to provide enhanced insulation. These cups have an extra layer of paper or air between the inner and outer walls, which helps to slow down the transfer of heat. Some cups also have a corrugated exterior, which creates an air gap and provides a better grip while also insulating the hand. The choice of insulation depends on the type of beverages served and the desired level of heat protection.

**Lid Compatibility:** A secure and well-fitting lid is essential for preventing spills and maintaining the beverage's temperature.

Paper tea cups are frequently enough used with lids, especially for takeaway orders or events where people are moving around. Lids can be made from plastic (such as polystyrene or polypropylene) or from paper. Plastic lids are generally more durable and offer a tighter seal, but they are less environmentally friendly. Paper lids are a more sustainable option but may not be as resistant to leaks. The lid should fit securely on the cup without being to tight or too loose.

**Printability and Customization:** Many businesses choose paper tea cups that can be printed with logos or branding.

Paper tea cups offer an excellent surface for printing logos, designs, or promotional messages.The print quality should be high and the ink should be durable enough to withstand handling and exposure to heat. The surface of the cup should be smooth and free of imperfections to ensure a crisp and clear print. Customization can help to reinforce brand identity and create a more professional image.

**Environmental Friendliness:** With increasing environmental awareness, the sustainability aspects have become a major consideration.Paper tea cups can be made from recycled paper,and some are compostable or biodegradable.Cups with PLA linings are generally more environmentally friendly than those with PE linings. Choosing cups made from sustainable materials can help to reduce the environmental impact of your business or event. Look for certifications such as the forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to ensure that the paper is sourced responsibly.

Their light weight also makes them easier to handle, especially when carrying multiple cups at once. This convenience contributes significantly to customer satisfaction.**Hygiene and Safety:** Single-use paper tea cups ensure a clean and hygienic drinking experience, minimizing the risk of contamination.

Unlike shared mugs or glasses, paper tea cups are used only once, reducing the potential for spreading germs and bacteria.This is especially important in public settings such as offices, hospitals, and food service establishments. single-use cups provide peace of mind for both customers and staff, ensuring a safe and sanitary drinking experience.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** paper tea cups are a budget-friendly option compared to reusable cups, especially for large events or high-volume businesses.

Although the initial cost of a reusable cup may seem lower, the long-term expense of washing, storing, and replacing them can add up. Paper tea cups eliminate these costs, making them a more economical choice for businesses that serve a large number of beverages. Bulk purchasing can further reduce the cost per cup, making them an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about paper tea cups helps consumers make informed decisions.

**Are paper tea cups recyclable?**
The recyclability of paper tea cups depends on the type of lining and the capabilities of the local recycling facilities. Cups with PE linings are generally not recyclable because the plastic lining is difficult to separate from the paper. However, cups with PLA linings are compostable in industrial composting facilities.It's important to check with your local recycling center to determine whether they accept paper tea cups.

**Can paper tea cups be used for hot beverages?**
Yes, paper tea cups are designed to hold hot beverages.However, it's important to choose cups that are specifically designed for hot drinks and that have adequate insulation to protect your hands from the heat.Double-wall or triple-wall cups are the best option for hot beverages, as they provide better insulation and prevent the cup from becoming too hot to handle.

**Are paper tea cups environmentally friendly?**
The environmental impact of paper tea cups depends on the materials used and the disposal method. Cups made from recycled paper and lined with PLA are generally considered to be more environmentally friendly than cups made from virgin paper and lined with PE. Composting paper tea cups is the most sustainable disposal method, as it allows the paper to break down naturally and return to the earth. Recycling is another good option, but it's important to ensure that the cups are accepted by your local recycling center. You should also consider the manufacturing process, as cups produced with sustainable practices have a lower environmental footprint.

With ingredients like green tea extract, cayenne pepper, and caffeine anhydrous, PrimeShred is perfect for men looking to increase fat-burning during workouts.

# How to Choose the Best Fat Burner for You

When selecting the best fat burner, it’s important to consider your individual goals and needs. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Ingredients:** Look for natural ingredients like caffeine, green tea extract, or cayenne pepper that have proven fat-burning benefits.
2. **Caffeine Sensitivity:** If you’re sensitive to stimulants, opt for a caffeine-free or low-stimulant option like Leanbean.
3. **Workout Regimen:** Some fat burners, like PrimeShred, are designed to boost fat burning during workouts, so if you’re hitting the gym hard, they may be ideal for you.
4. **Health Considerations:** Always check with your doctor before starting any supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.

Their 2025 AI investment shortlist has been revealed, with one core message: turning 40 hours of work into 40 minutes! Your internet correspondent pulled an all-nighter to break down the key points and help you understand this workplace revolution 👇

💡Wave One: AI Takes Over Repetitive Tasks From contract reviews to data analysis, AI is consuming all ""copy-paste"" type work! YC-backed companies are all building automated workflow tools. For instance, one team uses AI to process financial reports - what used to take accountants a week can now be completed with analysis and recommendations in the time it takes to drink a coffee ☕

🚀Wave Two: Vertical Industry Boom Healthcare/Legal/Education sectors are where the real action is! One AI legal assistant can speed-read 300-page case files and automatically generate litigation strategies; another education AI reduces teachers' lesson prep time from 20 hours to 1 hour, and they're reportedly already working with Ivy League institutions 📚

🤖The Most Disruptive Trend: Human-AI Collaboration Instead of replacing humans, it's about making experts 10x more efficient! For example, designers using AI tools can create 50 logo variations in 30 minutes, while doctors using AI-assisted diagnostic systems can review scans 8x faster with automatic flagging of suspicious areas 👩

⚕️ (Between us) I've spotted a pattern among the funded companies: they're all focused on deep integration of \[Data + Real Scenarios\], training models with actual industry data rather than just talking about theoretical tech concepts 💻

If you don't want to become obsolete, better start learning to use AI tools! Which sector do you most look forward to seeing transformed by AI? Drop your predictions in the comments below ⬇",1,1746755506.0,u_kinpoe_ray,0,1.0,False

this trend continued until my sophomore year of college, but then i realized hey, i kinda don't like this! none of the friendships i formed felt very meaningful because i was always the ""black sheep,"" i didn't like going out, i'm a relatively quiet person, and i am overall very reserved. i am a high masking person, so when i saw people in my old friend groups being loud and social, i followed along and thought that this was just something i had to do to be liked.

i am slowly unlearning this habit and trying to be comfortable with my true self, but it is still kind of a strange feeling. conversations, even casual ones, are VERY mentally draining for me because all my focus is directed towards masking and trying not to be ""weird"" in the eyes of the other person i am talking to.

my college roommate constantly made fun of me for being an introvert and not having many friends. she would invite me to clubs, to which i would politely decline, and she would make fun of me for having no life, having ""strange interests,"" and not wanting to ""live it up."" she is a very social person with many friends, which is fine! i am not a social person, and i have very little friends, which is also fine. i think my constant masking in early childhood and adolescence has completely eradicated the desire for me to make friends, i was wondering if anyone felt this as well.

on the contrary, i have been extremely depressed and suicidal in the past because of the fact that i do not have many friends and at times feel very alone. being made fun of by my roommate has made me feel alone because she would constantly boast about how many friends she has and how much she goes out, and how i need to take my college experience to the fullest so i don't regret it. i also just feel like all the friends that i've had in the past had some kind of sense that i was autistic, but didn't truly understand why i acted in these ways, and just thought it was something i can change about myself to be more neurotypical and ""likable."" prior to my assessment (i am still in the process of it!!!!!!!), i would talk to my friends about believing that i am autistic, and they would kind of laugh at me for feeling and behaving in this way?

i desire being alone and prefer few people in my life, but this feeling of not having many people in my life also creeps up on me from time to time, and my feelings of loneliness are almost weaponized against me by my brain in a sense.",3,1746755107.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False

For a little while now, I've been dealing with strange atypical neurological issues. Randomly seeing a clump of circles that just stays in my left field of vision (but disappears when I close my left eye and kind of at that point turns into an eyelid spasm), but then comes back. I went to an eye doctor and my eyes were fine, they had no concerns and thought it could just be floaters. I have a history of migraines, some atypical, and have had auras in my migraines that are similar to these but the classic migraine auras I've experienced are different. Along with this, I've had muscle spasms in various places like my face, arms, and back. I've also experienced episodes of brain fog and I feel like my memory is a lot worse than it used to be. Especially when I'm dealing with brain fog, I can barely remember things from a conversation. And I'm finding it harder to remember certain events I've experienced recently which really hadn't been an issue before maybe just a few years ago.  I also experience almost what seem like short brain jolts that come from the back of my head but are sort of like internal if that makes sense. 

Here's what I know - I've had two brain MRIs, both were normal. The brain fog and issues potentially are triggered or made worse by being in hot temperatures and drinking coffee. I also have noticed stomach discomfort during the periods of the eye things. Probiotics also seem to make me feel a bit better. I do have a history of anxiety and depression and acid reflux. I rarely drink now and don't smoke. I have been on a low dose of an antidepressant since I was about 9. I was on PPIs from 2021 to just a couple months ago. Glad I got off that and wonder if some of the coming off of that has worsened all of this. I am still on famotidine for reflux. I also take Zyrtec as I do have a history of food allergies and potentially food intolerances. I've also had covid a few times in the past too which I am aware can contribute to things like this. Oh, and I was negative for the Lyme antibody in at least one test. I might be leaving things out but this is the general gist. I have a history of higher bp too and was on amlodipine for a brief period last year that also gave me migraine and side effect issues so I came off of that. My bp is still a bit elevated and will spike but is more controlled now. 

  
Just would love to know if there's anything concerning going on here, or any further tests you may recommend. My PCP thought it can't hurt to get a spinal MRI to rule out MS, but my neurologist kind of pushed back on that saying that I'd have different symptoms and that it's rare to have MS with a normal brain MRI. But things just seem strange. I'd love to feel normal again and get my memory back. There are some days where I feel very great. I think cardio seems to help me a lot, but the good feelings never seem to be permanent. If you think this is all just run of the mill stuff and nothing to worry about and things I'll just get through, that would be great too. ",1,1746755048.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

About a year ago, I joined a Fortune 500 global ingredients/commodities company located in a high cost-of-living area. I left a stable tech sales role where I had been for several years. That role paid well, my average on-target earnings were between $120–125K, with a base of $95K plus commission. I took a significant pay cut to join this new role, dropping down to $63K, because I was excited about the industry and had a family connection (a cousin works here). The sales cycle was also less stressful compared to software, and there are only a few companies that can do what we do, so I saw it as a strategic move long term.

I was hired as a trainee with the understanding that I’d be in the training phase for approximately six months. After that, I was told I’d receive a territory, a promotion, and a raise into the low six-figure range. The position doesn’t include commission, but there is an annual bonus.

Just three weeks in, one team member left and another went on maternity leave, so I was assigned a territory early. The structured training was essentially dropped, but I stepped up and delivered. Despite starting as a trainee, I finished 4th out of 8 on the team last year with $28 million in sales over just six months.

Throughout the year, I asked multiple times about the promotion I was promised and was told it was coming. I later found out through colleagues (not in management) that the lowest salary among the reps is $111K, with others in the $130K range. Our company struggled in 4 of 6 business units, but our category, coffee, performed extremely well. Even so, I was told I would no longer be eligible for a prorated bonus (which was verbally promised during hiring) due to my “trainee” status, which was disappointing. 

Fast-forward to this year: I’m currently at 108% of quota with over $56 million sold, and our team is only five months in. Of the seven other salespeople, only one is above 70% to quota. My efforts alone have generated over $1.1 million in profit for the company so far this year.

I finally had the promotion conversation, and the offer came back at $80K. I was devastated. That’s not only far below what was discussed during the hiring process, but also well below what others on the team are making despite having equal quotas. I responded with a thoughtful email outlining my performance, taking a territory months early, the original expectations, my current results, and the broader market standards. Their reply? That the job market has changed, and the offer reflects current conditions. No willingness to negotiate.

Now I’m torn. I love the industry, and I enjoy working with my team. The work is easier than software sales, and the environment is far less stressful. But I also feel significantly misled, underpaid, and undervalued.

I grew up in government housing and understand how fortunate I am. Part of me feels guilty for even questioning this opportunity, but I also know I’m not being treated fairly.

Would you start looking elsewhere and bring in a competing offer to see if they’ll match, or would you walk away completely?
What would you consider a fair salary, given my performance, the quota, and the profit margin I’ve generated?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

If you've ever wished dating came with an instruction manual, **""La méthode (French) (NEW) - Nicolas Dolteau (coachseductionfr)""** might just be the next best thing. This course, created by one of France's most well-known seduction coaches, Nicolas Dolteau, lays out a complete framework for meeting and attracting women—step by step, from the very first eye contact to the bedroom. No fluff, no guesswork. Just a tested, field-proven method that’s helped thousands of guys.

# Who Should Check This Out?

This one’s for the fellas who want to feel more confident around women, especially those who feel lost when it comes to dating.

The course has been refined over 10 years and is based on real-life coaching results—guys who’ve found relationships, even gotten married, using what they learned.

# Why Is This Method Getting Attention?

Simple: because it works. Dolteau’s method isn’t some vague pep talk—it’s actionable, detailed, and easy to follow. You’ll learn exactly what to do and say during a daytime approach (yes, even in a coffee shop or park), how to navigate interactions at night, and how to carry yourself with natural confidence. No more winging it. With **La méthode (French) (NEW) - Nicolas Dolteau (coachseductionfr)**, you get a full playbook for real-life situations.

# Where Can You Use This Stuff?

That’s the beauty of it. This isn’t about nightclub tricks or social media flirting—Dolteau’s training is all about **real-world encounters**. Think street, bar, café, even the grocery store. Wherever life happens, this method applies. It’s about developing everyday social confidence so you’re always ready, no matter where or when you meet someone interesting.

# When Should You Start?

Right now. No seriously—this is an on-demand course. As soon as you buy it, you get **instant access** through your account. No waiting, no scheduling. You can binge it tonight or study it slowly over time. And there’s **no time limit** and no viewing restrictions. Rewatch it as often as you need, especially before going out!

# How Does It Actually Help?

It’s not just about what to say—it’s about how to think, behave, and act naturally attractive. Dolteau covers everything from mindset and body language to conversation flow and follow-ups.

1ki6w18,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1ki6w18/i_think_i_fumbled_a_situation_with_a_guy_i_really/,I think I fumbled a situation with a guy I really liked after he told me he had CP. Want to know if I handled it wrong.,"
Hi everyone, 

Hope it’s okay for me to post here. I’m not disabled myself, but I’m looking for some perspective - especially from people who’ve dated while living with a disability. I think I may have fumbled a situation with someone I really liked, and I want to understand if I handled it poorly, or if it’s just not my move anymore.

Grab snacks, I’m a verbose writer, this is a long one. 

So I (28F) have been on dating apps for a few months , mostly for fun. I’ve had serious relationships before, but lately dating has felt kind of like a game I know how to play, no real spark, just something to pass the time.

Then I met this dude called Felix. 

He’s smart, attractive, dry sense of humor. He’s the founder of a machine learning startup, I’m a journalist, and our jobs ended up being a cool connection point, we’d talk about tech, privacy, shady companies, journalism ethics etc etc. We started video calling pretty much every night. I stopped messaging anyone else. It just felt easy and exciting in a way I hadn’t felt in years.

Eventually, we made plans to meet for coffee. 11am, a spot 10 minutes from both of us . I messaged the night before to confirm, no reply, which was weird. But I figured we were still on.

He didn’t show.

I waited. Called. Nothing. After an hour I left and sent a message asking what the hell happened.

Two days later, he replied.

He told me he has a disability called cerebral palsy (had no idea what that was but now I’ve done so much damn research) and that dating has been really hard for him. People either ghost when he tells them, or leave when they see him. 

He said it’s not obvious over a video call so he just hid it and then, he just… panicked. He didn’t want me to see him and feel sorry for him. He said I was ‘out of his league’ - which is such a bullshit concept- and he made a joke about his walker frame thing and his hands not working properly, but the message was vulnerable and really honest. He said he really really liked me and didn’t know how to deal with the idea of losing that.

I didn’t respond for a few days. I was hurt that he stood me up. And also, yeah..I was thrown. I’ve never dated someone with a disability. I didn’t know what that would mean? I didn’t want to say the wrong thing or act like I was cool with it when I wasn’t sure how I felt yet? 

But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I liked him before I knew about his disability, and knowing about it shouldn’t change anything. He was still objectively hot, smart, funny - whole package . 

So I messaged him. I said I was upset he didn’t show, but that I still wanted to meet. I suggested dinner at a nice steak house close to my apartment. 

Then panicked again. What if it’s not accessible? What if he can’t cut the fucking steak and I seem like an arse for even suggesting steak. I didn’t even check if there was a ramp into the place . What if he needs a ramp? What if I made things awkward without meaning to? 

So I sent another message saying maybe he should choose the place instead, and that I didn’t really know what he needed, but I wanted to be respectful and not assume anything. I told him I was leaving it up to him.

That was days ago. No reply.

Now I’m confused. Did I say too much? Not enough? Did I scare him even more by being overly cautious? I really don’t know. I don’t usually chase anyone, but this feels different and I don’t want to get it wrong.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear your take. Did I fumble this? Or is it just not my move anymore?

Thanks for reading. ",24,1746754522.0,disability,10,1.0,False
1ki6vy2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ki6vy2,Decided to make a coffee table after finding a skillsaw at a yardsale for three bucks,"Materials cost about $120. My gf found plans for it online. It was a really fun experience and we’re super proud of it.

Thinking to sand and stain it, probably like a golden pine color.

Glued and drilled everything.

One thing I’ll say that made the top turn out really well, was that we flipped it over and drilled every screw bottom up. That way, the top of the table has no screw holes and is just clean solid wood. 

The hardest cut i had to make was ripping down a 2x6 to be 2x3 cause we mis-measured. Its hard to tell but the bottom shelf board on the far right side is narrower than the rest.

I built an adirondack chair years ago in shop class, but it’s been a while since I’ve done any woodworking. 

Regardless i’d call it a success!",110,1746754515.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,9,1.0,False

1ki6rlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/1ki6rlh/yes_this_is_another_tragic_love_story/,Yes this is another tragic love story:,"Hi everyone, let me preface and say that I am looking for mindful opinions and advice. 

I met a wonderful guy on Hinge. When we met for the first time for coffee it felt like it was just him and I in that room. The connection was felt by both of us right away. We didn’t want to end the night so we went driving around in his car. We talked some more and all the conditions felt right for a kiss. It turned out I was his first kiss ever. He hasn’t ever been in a relationship. He’s a really shy guy and so he recently worked the nerves to give the dating world a try. Our connection was great and we felt love for each other, I know it may sound crazy but it is one of those rare moments of when you know you know. I could write about so much but I don’t want to make this post long. Anyways we formed a really deep connection, everything about us just made sense. After seeing each other more, we admitted that we loved each other. I am a sensible guy and I am one of those people that wait to say I love you until a special moment. But this felt like that special moment. I told him that we needed to hold off on the boyfriend’s thing until I tell him my life story. At this point we’ve only been kissing. I take us out on a picnic and I tell him everything, from my past traumas, addiction, and then diagnosis. At the mention of my diagnosis he starts to cry, so we pack up and go back to his place. I was going to spent the night but he asks me not to. He cries on the way home and inside his apartment. And I knew it’s because he loves me but this is hard for him and scary. We seem to end things then but the next day we agree to meet up and talk more about it. So we do and I mention to him all information on how our relationship could still be safe and possible. But he says he is still scared and can’t change his mind. This drives a wedge between us. At the same time he says he doesn’t want to lose me and wants to stay in contact.I know he loves me and I love him. Maybe now he might be putting a distance to protect his feelings I’m not sure. But I feel so much love for him that I want to win him over. But at the same time I’m conflicted because I love him and so I want to respect his decision. And just to add an icing to the cake, I have been mentioning to all my friends about him and how he’ll be at my birthday party. And so I wouldn’t feel embarrassed I asked him if he could still come and pretend that we’re “dating”. Which he has agreed to. 

So now this is where I would really appreciate your thoughts and opinions or advice. I think that perhaps if I give him space and talk to him again about the safety, I could win him. ",3,1746754125.0,hivaids,3,0.81,False

**Sat 4/5/2025 / Sun 4/6/2025 Rome**

Took a flight from US to Rome (left Saturday afternoon and landed Sunday afternoon), then took a cab to our Airbnb in the Monti neighborhood. Cab driver was very annoyed that I wanted to pay with my card, and bugged me to give him a cash tip. Welcome to Italy? The first thing I noticed was the smell of woodsmoke in the air (pizza ovens?) and the gentle din of people socializing in public spaces. Lots of cool graffiti/street art. 

While my husband stayed back for a nap, the kid and I went out and stocked up on food for breakfasts, then got gelato at Grezzo (gluten free, vegan, raw - and actually fantastic). For dinner we went to Cimarra 4.

**Mon 4/7/2025 Rome**

Had breakfast in our Airbnb, then started off the day with a guided tour with Crown Tours (via GetYourGuide) for the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and Roman Forum. Our guide Ambra was fantastic, and the whole operation was very professionally run - not some fly-by-night sketchy situation. We paid extra for the “Arena Floor” option. Pricey, but I think this was probably worth it due to how much less crowded the arena floor was than the upper levels. The Forum was cool, but SO crowded, and the guide didn’t spend as much time with us there. I enjoyed Palatine Hill best - it was less crowded, and bright green with grass and wildflowers and blooming trees. 

After the tour, we got lunch at a little salumeria run by an older couple. Felt like a nice authentic experience, and the lady was so sweet. The afternoon held a surprise for us - King Charles and Camilla had arrived from England, so the Red Arrows and the Frecce Tricolori (England and Italy’s equivalent of the Blue Angels) did multiple flybys right over our Airbnb! 

Went to Grezzo for gelato again and then did a little walk past Trajan’s column/forum, Victor Emmanuel monument, Basilica di Santa Maria in Aracoeli (great view/sunset spot!), and Piazza del Campidoglio. A lot of the area was under construction (especially Piazza del Campidoglio and Piazza Venezia), so don’t expect amazing photographs, but it was cool to see anyway!

**Tues 4/8/2025 Rome**

Had a laid back morning and breakfast at the airbnb, then went for a wander in the direction of Villa Borghese for a 3pm tour of the gallery. Along the way we strolled through Centro Storico and hit up a few of the major “there it is” sights - Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps mainly. Trevi fountain was packed (of course) so we skipped waiting in line to get pictures right in front of it. Had lunch at a salumeria called Il Salumaio. Husband and kid’s sandwiches looked incredible. I’m GF so I just got a plate of prosciutto, fresh moz, tomatoes, and basil.

Got to Borghese Gallery just in time for our tour. I had booked it with some company called “Roots in Rome” via Viator, and it ended up being a scalper ticket. I had expected a custom guided tour of the gallery + gardens, but they just sent me tickets for the in-house guided tour. Plus, I had paid for an English tour but they gave me Italian tour tickets. I didn’t realize till I got there but thankfully the Gallery staff were super nice and put us on an English tour. They just kind of rolled their eyes – it was clear this wasn’t the first time this had happened. So, all’s well that ends well. The tour itself was great (it didn’t go into the gardens at all) and of course the art was phenomenal!

After the tour our kid chased pigeons around with their camera – it was this day they really latched onto a pigeon obsession which kept them busy throughout the whole trip. I highly recommend nudging your kid toward something like this so they have a way to stay busy & engaged during travels! Credit to my husband for coming up with this. 

On the walk back we got gelato at Fragola Roma which was best gelato I had on this trip. We ate it on the steps next to the shop, while enjoying watching a seagull patiently waiting outside a shop with a giant picture of bread on the entrance wall. It’s clear he knew what was up. Bread Gull was a source of delight to all who passed by. 

**Weds 4/9/2025 Rome**

In the morning we had a really fun golf cart tour of Appian Way (aqueducts, Baths of Caracalla, St. Sebastian catacombs). We booked it with Biga Tours (via GetYourGuide) and I highly recommend it, even though we didn’t get as much time at the Baths or aqueducts as I’d expected. Riding in the golf carts in downtown Rome traffic was thrilling! Our guide Gaia was super engaging and knowledgeable. The catacomb tour was with an in-house guide and was fascinating. (It didn’t allow photos/videos.) Appian Way was gorgeous.

After the tour we walked over to the Pantheon - it was a mob scene of course. We hadn’t bought tickets in advance so we just took a look from the outside. Had lunch at an amazing restaurant right next to it called Pantha Rei.

After lunch my husband wanted to go to the Capuchin crypt, so we headed up that way again. On the way we randomly found ourselves in a crowd waiting for King Charles and Camilla to drive by?! We decided to stick around because why not. Kind of exciting and definitely not something that had been on my bucket list. 

The Capuchin museum was interesting - learned all about the Capuchin monks. They kind of make you go through it before going to the crypt, I think to make people a bit more reverent/respectful once they get to the crypt. The crypt was quite intense. I was expecting artfully arranged bones, but I was not expecting mummies. Definitely a fascinating experience, but also pretty creepy. Our 10 year old was cool with it but YMMV depending on how sensitive you are.

Wandered back sort of towards our Airbnb, back down the Spanish Steps, and then crossed over the Tiber River just because we hadn’t gone to the river yet. Turned around and headed back toward home because we were exhausted.

**Thurs 4/10/2025 Rome -> Orvieto**

Checked out of our airbnb and took a taxi to Termini Station to pick up our car rental from Sixt. The process was relatively painless but very expensive (picking up and dropping off at different locations added a huge surcharge). Drove to Orvieto - it wasn’t too terrifying, especially once we got out of Rome, since I had my husband to help with detailed navigation.

Got to Orvieto, checked into our hotel (our room was available early!), got our car parked (the hotel had a parking lot - not sure how this would’ve worked otherwise). Had lunch at a little salumeria. Checked out the duomo facade (magnificent!) and got last minute tickets for the Underground tour, which was very cool. After the tour we got tickets for the duomo and spent some time looking at the inside (we did Rick Steve’s tour from his “Best of Italy” guidebook) - which was stunningly gorgeous. Wandered around a bit in the shopping area of Orvieto, bought some nice leather stuff from Arte de Cuoio. Ended up at Trattoria La Grotta for dinner then got gelato at Gelateria Il Gelato Di Pasqualetti.

**Fri 4/11/2025 Orvieto / Civita di Bagnoregio**

Had breakfast at our hotel, then drove to Civita di Bagnoregio. Beautiful drive! Parked, paid for parking, and then walked down to the ticket office, stopping for some scenic viewpoints on the way. Bought our tickets and then walked the rest of the way into the town. It was pretty touristy but not insanely crowded thankfully. It was gorgeous and really unique. Had lunch at Antico Frantoio, randomly, because it was there and didn’t seem to have a wait. I just discovered it’s very badly reviewed, oops. We had a fine experience: warm & friendly service, nice table outside.

When we got back to Orvieto, I went out for a solo wander: had an afternoon coffee, checked out the west end of the city, and wandered around the medieval streets, pet some kitties (Orvieto had so many feral cats!), did some shopping. Went back to the hotel to grab my husband and kid, and we went to Il Malandrino Bistrot. It was one of our best meals on the trip! We didn’t have a reservation so we had to sit outside, which was chilly but we survived.

**Sat 4/12/2025 Orvieto -> Siena -> Florence**

Had another hotel breakfast and then checked out and drove to Florence, returning the rental car at the train station. We were originally going to have an afternoon in Siena on the way, but rain was forecast for our entire time in Florence and I wanted to see Boboli Gardens before it hit. Turned out to be a good call to skip Siena, because our landing in Florence was pretty rough with the crowds and long taxi lines. We’d planned on calling a cab from the Florence train station but FreeNow had a blackout in the area, and the taxi line was incredibly long. We walked a bit towards our apartment, and then hailed a cab. The streets were so crowded with people it felt like driving through Disneyland (driver had to honk constantly to get people to make way for us).

We stayed in the Santa Croce area. Had lunch at a little deli (?) called Giuliano Gastronomia & Alimentari - because it was there and easy. The guy was very nice helping me pick out GF hot food items and some meat & cheese! It also was a small grocery store so we were able to pick up breakfast food items for the next day. Our apartment had a washer/dryer - I’d planned for this so we wouldn't have to waste a day at the laundromat - so we started some much-needed laundry. 

After lunch & laundry & getting settled, we walked to Boboli Gardens. Had to stand in a long line to get in - it felt like forever but I think it was only 20 or 30 minutes. The gardens were fine but honestly not super amazing - still, it was nice to be outside around plants. We were going to go to Piazzale Michelangelo for an evening view of the city skyline, but we could see from a distance that it was packed to the gills so we decided to skip it. Got gelato and wandered down Via di S. Niccolo back toward our apartment. Had dinner at a place that ended up being a tourist trap but we lived to tell the tale.

**Sun 4/13/2025 Florence**

This was our most taxing day, hands down. Due to the availability of tickets and the fact that the Uffizi and Accadamia are both closed on Mondays, we ended up doing both in one day - starting with a very early (for us) timed entry spot at the Accademia at 8:30am. As a family, we tend to not enjoy strict schedules or early mornings, but this ended up being worth it. Had a quick breakfast in our apartment, walked to the Accademia, and were able to breeze right in. Super easy process. Michelangelo’s David is absolutely stunning in person; I was brought to tears by how beautiful it was. The rest of the museum was pretty cool too! Lots of medieval art. 

Stopped at a legit-seeming leather store (Prestigio) on the way back to our apartment and ended up buying a leather jacket and purse. Still not sure how legit it was, but I do like the items I bought! 

Along the way back we happened upon some sort of Catholic pageantry at the Duomo. I mean, of course, we could’ve predicted that, given that it was Palm Sunday! It was neat to watch but the campanile bells ringing were incredibly loud and there was a huge crowd outside watching the people in their fancy Catholic garb walk into the church. The kid and I were fine but the cacophony of the bells and the chaos of the people quickly overloaded my sound-sensitive husband, so we had to get out of there. We continued back to the apartment and I got a sandwich at Sgrano for lunch (100% gf restaurant!!). 

Then it was time to go back out for a timed entry to the Uffizi galleries. We got there at 1:30 (the beginning of our entry slot) and learned we should’ve shown up earlier because there was a huge line for our cohort to pass through security. Thankfully we were in a covered space because the rain had started coming down pretty heavily. It took maybe 30-45 minutes to get through the security line. The gallery was, of course, amazing. We spent too much time in the main hall looking at statues - we should’ve gone straight for the side rooms with the paintings. My favorites were the Boticellis; my husband loved the Caravaggio room. We kept our kid entertained by asking them to count how many birds they could find in the art. We managed to get by with only one child meltdown. We didn’t get to see everything we wanted but honestly by the end of it (\~2 hours?) my feet were ready to call it quits anyway. Save time for the gift shop; it’s truly epic. They have a massive bookstore and all kinds of cool stuff. 

Got back to the apartment, rested for a bit, and then went to Sgrano’s ristorante for dinner. I mistakenly got the lampredotto pasta. I had heard about lampredotto in my pre-trip research and decided I wasn’t that adventurous, but then I forgot about it and I guess the universe had different plans for me. I ate it anyway and - ok, it was pretty good - but I was not a big fan of the texture (or the concept). Later, I had a conversation with a local who said his grandfather always told him that when it comes to lampredotto, “eat with your heart, not your eyes”. Amazing. Anyway, the food was pretty good, though I liked their lunch/sandwiches better. My kid got gelato at Gelateria dei Neri which was apparently very good.

**Mon 4/14/2025 Florence**

This day ended up being a slower one for most of the family. Originally I had planned on us spending the morning / lunch at Boboli and Bardini gardens, but we went to Boboli on Saturday already, in deference to the rain. I still really wanted to see Bardini Gardens since I knew the wisteria was in full bloom. My kid and husband were toast and there was rain in the forecast so they stayed back. I got out of the apartment as early as possible since the rain was supposed to start around 11am. I really enjoyed my solo walk that morning. I used the timed entry tix I’d bought (probably entirely unnecessary) to enter at Via Di St Niccolo, and then traversed up the switchbacks to the top of the gardens. It was beautifully quiet, due to the early hour and threatening skies. (Hilariously, though, I could see that Piazzale Michelangelo was still absurdly packed. The overtourism is real.) The wisteria tunnel & view of Florence was of course stunning, and I even got a few shots of the tunnel with no other humans in it! I enjoyed a latte and the view at the cafe in the gardens. A group of preschoolers showed up with their teachers, and it was the cutest thing. (We saw a lot of school field trip groups during our time in Italy, and I really appreciated it - can’t explain why.) The rain started so I headed back down the hill. 

On my way back I wandered past Santa Croce cathedral, where some sort of large event was being set up (I’m sure for Holy Week / Easter) so it was perhaps less scenic than it might’ve been otherwise. Made a quick stop at our apartment to check on the fam, then went back out on an errand run. First I walked to Kodak Express (up by the Accademia) to drop off the rolls of film I’d shot. Then I wandered around desperately trying to find a cheap, non-leather, collapsible bag to carry our dirty laundry in since we were quickly filling our suitcases with souvenirs & gifts! That proved to be a challenge. Eventually I ended up settling for a $40 duffel from Champion - way more than I wanted to spend but still less than anything else I’d found.

At this point I was quite soaked and bedraggled so I went back to the apartment. Rested at the apartment for a while and then went back out again for more shopping because I’d gotten some ideas for Christmas gifts. I ended up at I Medici which seems to be a legitimate (and not too expensive) Italian brand. The store had some beautiful items, though not all of them were I Medici brand, which was a little confusing.

Finally got the family out of the apartment for dinner at La Buchetta. Wandered across the river to Cantina del Gelato. Enjoyed our gelatos overlooking the river at blue hour - highly recommended. Wandered back across Ponte Vecchio (most stalls were closed, sadly), and then back through the touristy shopping area. Our kid pulled us into Captain Candy which was exactly as ridiculous as you might expect, but it made them happy!

**Tues 4/15/2025 Florence**

We had 10:30am tickets to climb the Duomo, so we walked over there and got in line. The security line moved pretty quickly. The climb was pretty neat. I definitely struggled a bit with claustrophobia and fear of heights, but I was able to overcome it. It was cool seeing the frescoes inside the dome up close. The inside of the church was otherwise underwhelming (Orvieto’s was far more stunning) so we decided not to come back and spend more time later, especially given the length of the line to get in. The top of the dome had spectacular 360 views of Florence, and we really lucked out with the rain giving us a break - especially since thunderstorms had been in the forecast. We saw lots of lightning rods and copper grounding wires so it only felt slightly stupid to be up there. After taking in the view (and trying to not be anxious about how slippery the wet marble floor of the balcony was) we headed back down to firm ground. Phew!

We headed back to the apartment and got sandwiches at (you guessed it) Sgrano for the last time. After lunch, we walked to the Leonardo da Vinci Interactive Museum where we had timed entry tickets. This was primarily for the kid, who had learned all about da Vinci and the Renaissance at school. They really enjoyed it - and I thought it was pretty cool being able to work all the machines. I can’t say I would necessarily recommend this for someone without kids though. Neat, but not mind blowing.

Thankfully, the rain seemed to be done for the day. We walked over to Santa Croce to see about getting some gelato at Vivoli, because my mom and her sisters had gone there in the early 70’s. Apparently it was famous even back then! But of course the line was over a block long so we decided to skip it and go somewhere more chill. We ended up at Don Nino on the Duomo piazza. Since we were in the area we went to Codice 1992 because my husband wanted a leather jacket and the fine folks of reddit had recommended it. Beautiful items - and they had a fancy certificate showing that they were 100% Italian sourced and made.

After a couple of hours of relaxing & decompressing back at the apartment, we went back out for dinner at Mister Pizza. Guys, this was the best gluten free pizza of my life. My husband and kid were extremely happy with their non-GF pizzas too.

I wanted to catch blue hour over the Arno again, this time with my film camera, so we walked back across Ponte Vecchio and managed to get moody photos of some very dramatic clouds under the most electric blue sky, contrasted by the oranges & pinks of the bridge & lights reflecting off the water. A+. The river was roaring from all the rain. We also stopped at Cantina del Gelato again because I needed my daily gelato and it was our last evening in Florence.

**Weds 4/16/2025 Florence -> Bologna -> Venice**

Travel day! We had asked our apartment hosts to book a cab for us, which worked extremely well for getting to the train station with plenty of time to catch our train. Caught the high speed train (Italo) to Bologna and stashed our bags at KiPoint luggage storage in the train station. 

Walked 20 min to the restaurant I’d made a reservation at - La Capriata. This was recommended by someone here on reddit as “the best gluten free meal I’ve ever had!”. It was absolutely worth it to stop in Bologna for 3 hours in order to taste real Bolognese ragu! The walk through Bologna was a little weird; we ended up being under covered walkways through what felt like a giant outdoor mall, but I guess it was just the shopping district. We didn’t see much of the historic buildings - didn’t have time to wander before it was time to head back to catch our train to Venice.

The train ride was uneventful and quite pleasant. Stepping out of the station and into Venice, we were immediately blown away with how cool this place is. Even my (generally stoic) husband was gushing. We’d had our Venice airbnb host book us a water taxi, which was extremely expensive (I suspect it included a generous tourist tax) but also saved us so much heartache trying to navigate the streets of Venice at the end of the day, in the rain, with a 10 year old, and hauling our now-bulging suitcases. We absolutely loved being on the water. It felt like being in a movie. 

We got to our Airbnb in San Polo and got settled in. I was very happy with our top-floor apartment with a huge terrace overlooking terracotta rooftops. Husband and kid collapsed for a bit while I went out on a grocery acquisition adventure. Fortunately there was a little market less than a block away and I was mostly able to stock up on breakfast foods.

Did a bit of a wander to a restaurant for dinner, then walked to the only gelato place we could find that was open so my kid could have their daily gelato. Walking around Venice at night is truly magical! That evening we were treated to an epic thunderstorm - thankfully after we were safe and cozy back in our apartment.

**Thurs 4/17/2025 Venice/Murano**

Time to go to our final scheduled event: a glass blowing demo on Murano! I’ve since learned that these are typically free, so in retrospect I probably wouldn’t have spent money on it. We walked across the city to the Fondamenta Nova vaporetto stop and caught the vaporetto to Murano. Again - being on the water was so exhilarating, even though the vaporetto was packed to the gills! Murano itself is incredibly picturesque.

The glassblowing demo at Gino Mazzuccato Factory was very cool (we even got to try blowing some glass ourselves). It did seem like the demo was a tool for getting people through the door to buy their stuff. They tried to sell us some gorgeous but insanely expensive pieces, which we declined. On our way out, we bought some small trinkets instead, which were still not cheap. I was a little disappointed to realize that most of the shops in Murano sell similar/identical trinkets (for much cheaper), which made me wonder if what we’d bought was actually made in-house. I can’t really know, but at least I do still like the trinkets. I also bought a glass which I love and was definitely hand blown based on post hoc research I did to try to make myself feel better about it all. But - word to the wise - wander ALL the shops before purchasing, be wary of trinkets (many are actually imported!), and look for certificates of authenticity. I wish I’d known this in advance. We even found higher end pieces at other shops that were similar to the supposedly unique pieces we saw at the first shop, but for a much cheaper price. (Still out of our budget though.) I ended up buying another blown glass at a shop called Antica and a small lampworked cuttlefish by Dario Frare from a different shop, both of which provided authenticity certificates.

After we’d had our fill of trying to not get scammed at Murano glass shops, and a mediocre lunch, we took the vaporetto back to Venice. It was a cold day so we stopped in at Cupido Venezia by the F.te Nova stop for hot cocoa and a bathroom break. Cozy little spot with such friendly staff! Then we took a leisurely wander back toward our airbnb in San Polo. Open-ended wandering with a vague destination feels like the best way to explore Venice. There’s so much to see around every corner! We happened upon a street market, many shops, walked over the Rialto bridge, and even ended up in a random tiny contemporary art gallery (San Polo Art Gallery) because we were drawn to the large scale Lego minifigs rendered in beautiful marble that they had on display.

By the time we got back to the apartment, our kid was cooked. We made sure they were able to get a hold of us using their ipad, and then left them at the apartment and went on a little walk in search of Aperol spritzes. We landed at La Loggia Bistro on Campo San Pantalon. It was nice to get some grown-ups only time – we wished we’d thought to do it earlier in the trip! The spritzes were obscenely strong so we nursed them for a leisurely couple of hours while people-watching. After retrieving the kid, we went back out to get dinner and of course gelato.

**Fri 4/18/2025 Venice**

Our last full day in Italy! :( We were blissfully unscheduled, so we went out to explore Venice. We wandered toward San Marco and were solicited by a gondolier. Since I was sick of scheduling things, I had hoped a gondola ride might fall into our lap, so we eagerly took him up on the ride. He took us across the grand canal and through some tiny side canals on the San Marco side, while telling us the history and answering my many questions. I don’t know what I expected gondoliers to be like, but it seems like many of them are strapping young lads with lots of tattoos, which surprised (and delighted) me. I realized there’s probably a whole gondolier social scene.

In the San Marco area, we wandered down the couture alley – not sure what it’s actually called, but I’d never seen so many luxury brands crammed in such a small space. It felt like walking through the pages of a Vogue magazine: Versace, Gucci, Balenciaga, Prada, Fendi, Bvlgari, Valentino, Hermes, Dior, Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent… and those are just the ones I remember! Interesting to see, but absolutely NOT our vibe at all. San Marco piazza was spectacular. Yes, crowded (though not as much as the sights in Rome), touristy, and filled with seagulls and pigeons. I found it charming though. Expensive cafes with live jazz bands ring the pizza. The basilica was a stunning luxe visual cacophony. We didn’t go inside but were happy to see it from the outside. We looked at Doge’s Palace from the outside as well, and enjoyed the view across the water. 

When we’d had our fill of San Marco, we got lunch and then wandered back in the general direction of our apartment, crossing over Ponte Accademia. We went to Gelateria Il Doge for our last gelato of the trip. 

When we got back to the apartment, it was finally nice enough to enjoy our terrace. My husband lamented our lack of spritzes, saying he wished there was a spritz delivery service. Well, he was in luck because I’d noticed you could get take-out alcohol drinks in Italy (!) so I walked to a bar called Basegone in the tiny campo by our apartment and procured us a couple of takeout spritzes! Enjoyed them on our terrace until it got too cold. 

Decided to keep dinner simple and went to the trattoria in the same campo by our apartment - Trattoria S. Toma. After dinner, we happened upon a drag performance outside of Basegone next door, and enjoyed the show for a bit before turning in for the night. I wish I could’ve stayed longer, but we had to pack and get the kid to bed at a reasonable hour before our impending very long travel day.

**Sat 4/19/2024 Venice -> Rome -> SF**

I don’t think I need to go into detail about our travel day back home, but it went smoothly despite being exhaustingly long. We were up at 5am to get a water taxi to the train station to catch our 7:05am train to Rome. I got a to-go tea at a cafe in the station and that was a mistake. The to-go lids in Italy are worthless and my tea went everywhere. But once we were situated on the train, all was good. After arriving at Termini Station in Rome at 11am, we hopped on the Leonardo Express train to FCO airport (about 40 min). The train was not very well set up for large luggage, but we made do. Check-in and security at the airport was uneventful, though they did insist on x-raying my film which made me grumpy. Our plane left only a little bit late and got back home on time, 12 hours later. We finally got back home at around 8pm local time – 5am Italy time! We were up for almost 24 hours, aside from the scant sleep we got on the plane! Somehow, I even managed to make a minimum viable Easter happen for our kid before going to bed.

A little more than 24 hours after we got back, the pope died. Whoops.",2,1746753300.0,ItalyTravel,1,0.75,False

Check out our new podcast ‘The Drop by The Caffeine Caddy’,"A buddy and I have been talking about doing this for a while, and we finally pulled the trigger — we just launched our podcast, The Drop.

It’s basically what our range sessions sound like: one scratch golfer, one high-handicapper, just talking about gear, rounds, swing thoughts, and whatever random golf stuff we’re obsessing over that week. We mix in a lot of coffee talk too — it fuels both our game and our arguments.

No hot takes for the sake of going viral, no pretending to be Tour experts — just two regular guys who love golf way too much and wanted to create something that felt like the clubhouse conversation after a round.

What you can expect:
	•	Gear talk (what’s in the bag, club switches, launch monitor numbers, etc.)
	•	Our personal golf stories, like a recent hole-in-one and a brutal 98 with 40 putts
	•	Coffee convos (yes, we argue hot vs iced weekly)
	•	PGA Tour reactions, listener Qs, and dumb golf hypotheticals
	•	Honest, casual conversation — no scripts or egos

We just dropped our first two episodes and would genuinely love for you to check them out, especially if you like podcasts that feel more like sitting in a cart with your buddies than sitting through an interview.

The Drop is on Spotify and Apple Podcasts — just search “The Drop by The Caffeine Caddy”

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over unless we met in person. I still agreed to meet and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library yesterday. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me. It felt really unsettling.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and being overly friendly in public. A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now I’m anxious that he might be sharing the personal things I confided in him, especially the mental health stuff, and trying to make me look unstable or dramatic. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative, and it’s really messing with my head.

Promise this isn't an ad","Hey, so I’m a comp sci student I’ve felt for a while now that one of the hardest things about being lonely isn’t just not having people, it’s how hard it is to actually stay connected even when you do. I’ve had an infuriating number of friendships fade just because we both kept saying “we should hang out” and then life kept getting in the way. Weeks turn into months. It sucks. Honestly by March of my Freshman (I feel like you capitalize this??) year I'd lost touch with almost everyone I met and befriended throughout the first few weeks. And as I've heard specifically from my cousins in their 20s-40s who are struggling and lonely in new cities: even when they do try to make new friends, specifically through some apps like Bumble BFF or Meetup, it’s kinda awkward, effort-heavy, or just doesn’t feel really natural. For example they said they would often meet someone cool but never see them again.

So yeah I’ve been working on an idea with a couple classmates (that also works as a final project for our class lol): an app where you get your own personal social assistant, like an AI-agent that helps you maintain friendships, reconnect with people you care about, and discover things to do and new friends nearby that actually match your vibe.

The hope here is that instead of doing all the work yourself, you’d just open the app and have an inbox full of casual hangouts, invites, or reminders like:

“You and your friend haven’t hung out in 3 months, want to grab coffee this weekend?” “You’ve been invited to a poetry night by 3 people in your scene, want to go?” “Your old roommate Alex is around next Friday. Want me to check in and plan something?”

It wouldn’t do anything without your approval (and ofc you can block people). So you'd be in full control, no unwanted messages, no forced social stuff, no spammy crap.   
  
I’d love to know: would something like this feel helpful? What would make it feel safe and worth using? And what would definitely turn you off?

Now after working together a bit I've realized she's a red flag on many levels, i don't really trust her and feel she may have I'll intent towards me. All day she says 'we should go drink together' after telling her numerous times I don't drink anymore, or 'ugh I don't wanna walk home' because she's expecting me to offer her a ride when she lives so close.. already asking to hangout constantly when we've known eachother not even 2 weeks 

We are always working together (full time) I don't know how to confront this without making work uncomfortable. I like my job and want to keep it ",3,1746753056.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

Here's a look at some of these potential advantages when consumed in moderation:

Mental Performance

- Enhanced Alertness and Focus: The caffeine content in energy drinks can temporarily block adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleepiness. This can lead to increased alertness, improved concentration, and faster reaction times, which could be beneficial for tasks requiring mental acuity.
- Improved Mood: Some studies suggest that the ingredients in energy drinks, particularly caffeine, can have a positive impact on mood, potentially alleviating feelings of fatigue and enhancing overall well-being in the short term.


Physical Performance

- Boost in Physical Endurance: Caffeine is known to enhance physical performance by reducing the perception of effort and fatigue. This can allow individuals to push harder and longer during exercise.
- Increased Reaction Time: The stimulating effects of energy drinks might lead to quicker responses, which could be advantageous in sports or activities demanding fast reflexes.


Other Potential Benefits (Often due to added ingredients)

- Source of B Vitamins: Many energy drinks are fortified with B vitamins, which play a crucial role in energy metabolism and nerve function.

- Electrolyte Replenishment: Some energy drinks contain electrolytes, which can help maintain fluid balance in the body, particularly after physical activity (though sports drinks are generally better suited for this purpose without the high stimulant content).

- Antioxidant Properties: Certain ingredients like green tea extract or other herbal components found in some energy drinks may offer antioxidant benefits, helping to protect cells from damage.


Important Considerations

While these benefits exist, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential downsides and practice moderation:

- High Sugar Content: Many energy drinks are loaded with sugar, which can lead to weight gain, an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and dental problems.
- High Caffeine Content: Excessive caffeine intake can cause jitters, anxiety, increased heart rate, sleep disturbances, and digestive issues.
- Dehydration: Caffeine is a diuretic, meaning it can increase urine production and potentially lead to dehydration if fluids are not adequately replenished.
- Not a Substitute for Healthy Habits: Energy drinks should not be relied upon as a long-term solution for fatigue. A balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and regular exercise are fundamental for sustained energy levels.


Healthier Alternatives for an Energy Boost

Instead of relying solely on energy drinks, consider these healthier ways to energize your day:

- Water: Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue. Staying adequately hydrated can significantly improve energy levels.
- Coffee and Tea: These naturally caffeinated beverages can provide a gentler and often more sustained energy boost than energy drinks, especially without added sugars.
- Fruits and Vegetables: Natural sugars and essential nutrients in fruits and vegetables offer a healthy source of energy.
- Protein-Rich Foods: Protein helps stabilize blood sugar levels and provides sustained energy.
- Regular Exercise: Physical activity can paradoxically increase energy levels in the long run.
- Sufficient Sleep: Prioritizing quality sleep is crucial for feeling energized throughout the day.

In conclusion, while energy drinks can offer some benefits beyond simple stimulation, particularly in terms of mental and physical performance, these are often temporary and come with potential health risks. Opting for a balanced lifestyle with healthy hydration, nutrition, and sleep habits is a more sustainable and beneficial approach to maintaining energy levels. When consuming energy drinks, moderation is key to minimizing potential negative effects.",1,1746752909.0,NestorBlend,0,1.0,False
