Its been impossible to meet her outside work, but now for 3 days in a row her son has come to visit her and she was waiting with him. I've gone to her house just once and met her kids once, and she basically wouldn't let me leave for 3 hours. At work we stare at eachother and make excuses to be around eachother. Everyone teases us about being together, our eye contact is crazy intense. She's shy and keeps herself to herself. 

Whilst i was busy,  Her son was calling my name and she recorded him going 'Where is X, i want to see x' and showed me the video and then showed me she'd sent it to herself via fb

We went around our local xmas market and her kid was talking to me and she was saying how much he liked me.  Then we sat and she bought me a beer because 'Why not' i joked its finally taken her 3 years to buy me a drink and she said 'not true' I was waiting on the bench leaving the other side empty so she and her son could sit by themselves buut she sat on the same side as me right next to me.  We took some selfies. I held the kids backpack which has become my designated job in our routine now, she pointed out how nice i was to the little one. 

Then her kid wanted to go on 2 rides. She said i should go with him and i went with him on two rides. She was taking pics of us and videos the whole time and we took a pic of each other from the high up balcony and her from the floor because we thought it was funny. 

She had to go, and then she invited herself over to my house so the kid could meet my dog. She's never been to my house and ive never (really) invited her over

Then the next day, same thing. We went to a coffee shop and she teased me constantly. She's shy and her first language isn't English and she batted her eyelashes and begged me to order. I did and they put the marshmallows at the bottom of her hot chocolate and she teased me and made fun of me going 'you made them do that didn't you. Silly! You did it on purpose' etc she also showed me her new nails that are red. 'for christmas' but i have red hair and have constantly teased her to get red nails for me and she was so happy that they were the same shade as my hair, showing them off

Then today. Same thing. After work they waited for me  sending me pics and she said kid her kid missed me though its been 1 day. She drove me to my house and she said she must sound better now (she's like 80 percent fluent in English) because shes been hanging out with 'Her English' 3 days a week after work and outside of work' she also said that our colleagues dont have to know we're meeting so much? 

When she was parking she said 'whys it not straight?' and i joked 'Well not everything here is..' and she grins at me and called me a nickname she knows i hate. Then she said something else and i joked that 'You could be less....straight' and again she rolled her eyes and grinned at me slyly 

At my house she was teasing me constantly and shooting me looks, taking pics etc. 

She gets texts from her kids school to do excersises / ask questions. Every day she gets one she shows me and gets me to ask the kid and we work on it together. She sends me his school report cards too and asks for advice. 

Final thing is that she has a family group chat with her mother, her brother and apparently they know about me and they loved the pics of us together from the past 3 days. She also has a boyfriend who is in the group chat. I KNOW. 

I KNOW. OKAY. I've never 'made a move' and dont want to ruin her relationship or our friendship etc. She tells me shes unhappy with him and constantly berates him in a 'my life with a man is miserable' kind of way and not just in the 'Miserable straight woman way' i genuinely don't know what to do and i think she maybe genuinely confused about her sexuality??? Or am i completely misguided here??

1h24cq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h24cq3/am_i_21f_being_overdramatic_in_asking_my_sister/,Am I (21F) being overdramatic in asking my sister (26F) to breakup with her boyfriend (29m)?,"Let me mention before hand me and my sister are extremely close and live together in an apartment, and all the information was informed to me by her and also have been my own observations 

My sister has complete golden retriever energy‚Äîwarm, caring, and endlessly selfless, often putting others' needs before her own. She‚Äôs friendly to everyone, including strangers, and always willing to stands up for those around her. Though her stubborn streak occasionally shows, of course she has her faults cause no one is perfect but, she‚Äôs a genuinely amazing person who uplifts everyone.

He also sometimes seems great, willing to give up anything for his friends and family (bought  his parents a house, is putting his cousin through college) but I've never been able to see his giving and caring nature convert towards my sister, like he is not straight up awful to her but still doesn't treat her how she deserves 

They met in Jan of 2024 started out as acquaintance as they worked in similar fields and soon turned into friends and by Feb 2024 they were dating 

There have been a few red flags in my opinion throughout their relationship for me. But my sister knows of them and is aware of them but tends to turn a blind eye towards them as she does love him alot
Some red flags that I've noticed 
‚Ä¢They have been dating for almost a year now and the guy has never taken her out for a date my sister never expects any gifts or bring splurged at (as her love language is quality time and touch) all she would want is maybe a date to a park or even a coffee date at this point
‚Ä¢Some would say maybe he doesn't have the time or resources but the guy makes time to hang out with his friends every week. Whenever he visits after office it's either to stay at our apartment eat and stay in for the night or he will drag all his friends and their girlfriends to our apartment and then either party all night at our place or go clubbing (my sister doesn't enjoy clubbing as much but does it to spend time with him)
‚Ä¢If my sister ever trys to put her foot down on some decisions he brushes her of or gets irritated with her which results in her giving up to maintain peace 
Like a recent situation that happend was that our parents had been visiting us for the past two weeks and had just left that morning and he decided to stayover at night and my sister was extremely excited to be with him after a few weeks time, but just before reaching our place he informed her that he was bringing his friends along and they were planning on partying at home and then later go clubbing, my sister was against it as day after she had her final exam and would have preferred to stay at home chill and hangout and also study(clubbing and going out would have interfered with her schedule till the next day) on mentioning her wish to not go out that night he ended up snapping at her in irritation and he stated that he could not deal with her issues 
This has been a pattern throughout their relationship if she wants to do something he brushes her off and ignores her, but if it's something that he wants they have to do it or if she trys to say no she is being a nuisance and he will be rude

Five months into the relationship they both ended up talking about their exes and he told her he was not in contact with any of his ""exes"" and my sister honestly told him that she hadn't blocked any of her exes but didn't contact any of them as all breakups of her amicably ended. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and bothered him that they could still contact her so for him she blocked them all. She had a few male friends that were flirty with her which she didn't reciprocate to but she told him about those interactions and he was bothered and made her block them which she did willingly for their relationship and never thought of them again. He also had female friends that were a little too comfortable in my opinion but my sister trusted him and never took any actions.

She had full access to his phone but never felt any reason to interfere in his life
He would pickup all his calls on speaker in front of both of us willingly be it calls of friends or family 
So neither of us had any reason to be suspicious 
But over the period of time she started noticing him moving out of the room even the house if she was around if one specific number would call let's call the person Maya for privacy reasons 
Whenever Maya would call he would move out and talk in a corner with her
Whenever anything related to Maya came up he would get squirrelly 
After observing this behaviour for a month more she broke down and checked his chats with Maya and she found very intimate conversations not sexual but still not platonic 
She did end up confessing to checking his texts with Maya and confronted him about her and he explained that he had been in a serious situationship with Maya and never officially ended anything with her before starting dating my sister 
In his opinion it just fizzled out and he didn't feel the need to end it
On reading the texts my sister had found out that Maya was planning to move to our city to be with the guy as Maya wanted to be closer to him as she cared for him
My sister told him how uncomfortable and hurt she felt about this situation and he asked her for sometime to let Maya down easy as in his words she was a little crazy and obsessed.
So my sister gave him some time to deal with the Maya situation (mind you this was already six months into the relationship ).
The pattern of secret calls with Maya continued and a month and half later my sister confronted him again about not doing anything about Maya and he asked her for more time but this time my sister did end up giving him and ultimatum about her or Maya.
He said he choose my sister and will break it of with Maya but still hasn't done so.

So am I overdramatic in asking my sister to breakup with him?

From what I can tell, it measures approximately 4mm in length, has 6 legs, dark in colour, with a vertical line down the back and what appear to be wings. Almost looks like a tiny coffee bean.

My questions are:

1. What is this bug in my house???
2. Is it something to be concerned about?

Recently got back from a hotel, in case this info helps. I'm deathly afraid of infestations, praying it's not a bedbug or something else problematic.

A short intro. I'm on the deeper end of the autistic spectrum but people don't generally notice because I can talk and such. I'm pretty socially inept, though, and pretty introvert. I've mostly kept to myself and I think I was a good kid. As in, no booze, no drugs, no smoking, no weird friends (my mother would disagree, she never liked my secondary school buddies although what we did was basically an introverts' book club, again, no booze etc., just maybe too much coffee).  
I guess that this basically led my parents to want me at home and at hand because as a kid, I just was and I somehow failed to get outta there.  
Anyhow. I'm 40+ and I moved back to parents' because I needed help with my kid. I did not really want said child but I miscarried and they made sad faces and just everyone made sad faces. Boyfriend graciously left me because he wanted to have more fun in life. Parents promised there and back how they would help me, how I'm always welcome, how they'll respect my parenting decisions, yadda yadda yadda.  
Also, I live in Big Town, my parents live in a Small Town some 250 km away where I relocated but I sometimes go to Big Town to do my stuff.

Now... I've never got too well with my mother in the last two decades or so but she seems to developed into an excellent malignant narcissist who loves to build her ego by stomping on mine. My father used to show some empathy but lately, his universal reaction is that I'm not trying enough and that mother has so much on her plate and I'm just lazying around and doing nothing. Both agree that I'm a shitty mother and use it against me while pretending genuine care. The last drop was when my mother got a hissy fit about dust on the piano and I was on a receiving end of a long rant about how I wanted a piano so she took a loan and bought it and it took her five years to repay the loan and how I never thanked her and I never thanked her for all the clothes, shoes, holidays, skiing trips, how she got me out of all the troubles I caused and at the end she called me a leech, cheater, liar, thief and an ingrate miscreant.  
For a clarification, my parents bought that piano when I was around seven and no, I didn't hold them at gunpoint. I don't remember whether they signed me up at the music school when I was five because I asked them to or whether they saw that I was interested in music and thought it a good idea. However, at that age of mine, it was entirely up to them. And yes, I didn't dust said piano, I am somewhat messy and awfully tired and there are more important things than goddamn dusting. When I have the time and energy, I try to do some writing. When I don't have the energy, I sleep. But according to my mother, I am not depressed, I'm faking it for attention and I'm also not trying hard to get better.   
Also, I apparently never do anything right. I'm on parental leave but I still got a part-time job. When I go to work, it's baaad because I'm not at home. The other day, I came back earlier and my father kept ranting that I'm home too early, that's not what he'd call work, I'm just slacking. (There was nothing to do so why should I loiter around in the office.) When I do something around the house, I should have done something else, I should have done it differently or it's done so badly that it's just a waste of time. When I do nothing because I'm tired in general and in particular from that constant nagging, I'm lazy.  
When I want to hang with my own child, my parents don't let me. I need to be supervised because I'm sick in my head and what if I did something to the child. At the same time, I'm faking the depression, right?

  
Now, would I be the asshole if I just packed my shit and moved away and left my parents and the kid? I just want to live my life, finish my Ph. D., have a job and do all the normal things without being told off constantly.",0,1732823424.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

With an 18g IMS basket, my old Virtuoso allows me to pull nice shots @ 18‚Äì20g in and ~40g out in ~30s. 

The Virtuoso is showing its age, though. My partner and I have been looking at grinders over the last month or so, and Turin grinders keep popping up on our radar ‚Äî especially considering how popular they are on this sub. 

With the BFCM discount, the DF64 Gen 2 is stupid cheap. Close friends suggest that the Niche Zero is the way to go, but it‚Äôs currently 40% more expensive than the DF64. 

James Hoffmann compared the DF64 Gen 2 to other grinders earlier this year. He isn‚Äôt a fan of the bellows, but that isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me. He also highlighted the flavor differences that are a result of the DF64 Gen 2‚Äôs flat burrs, but I enjoy espresso profiles from flat and conical burrs, so this also isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. 

Whatever grinder we get will very likely replace our Virtuoso, which we also use for V60 filter coffee. With that in mind, the deal breakers are:

1. Poor support quality
2. Short lifespan
3. Poor V60 filter coffee quality
4. Difficulty changing grind setting

With these in mind, should we skip the DF64 Gen 2?",1,1732823175.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 24-year-old man living in Gurgaon. For the longest time, I‚Äôve been solely focused on work, striving to build a better life for myself and my family. My top priority has always been earning well, ensuring stability, and achieving professional success.

But in the hustle and grind of it all, I recently realized that I‚Äôve been neglecting an equally important part of life ‚Äì finding a life partner. It hit me that while work and money are crucial, love and companionship bring a balance that makes life truly fulfilling.

I‚Äôm still searching for love, and honestly, it‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs like rediscovering a part of life I had unknowingly ignored. But I‚Äôm hopeful and open to the idea of finding someone to share this journey with.

If you‚Äôre reading this and would like to grab a coffee sometime, it would be amazing. I‚Äôd love to meet someone who values both the grind and the joy of meaningful connections.

I don‚Äôt remember if they felt incomplete, but I guess that‚Äôs what the issue was. 

At that point in my life I was living abroad, starting a new job and trying to learn a new language. It was an insanely stressful/anxious period so I guess that‚Äôs why I started. Or perhaps I was slightly food poisoned and didn‚Äôt notice, who can say for sure. 

I have tried an insane amount of stuff since and to be honest it‚Äôs only got worse. My BMs are now usually small, thin, noticeably incomplete and I feel bloated all the time. The worst is when I go into the office, because usually I spend all morning obsessing over having a BM and it‚Äôll never be satisfactory.  

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried 

- First visit to doctor, told to relax‚Ä¶
- Second time, given some courses of antibiotics
- Tried some very expensive liquid probiotics that had to be kept in the fridge
- Convinced myself it was a pelvic floor issue, went to a PT. They stuck a finger in there and said I had good control of the muscles. Given some breathing exercises to do. 
- Various diet changes. No dairy, no gluten, no coffee. 
- SSRI for anxiety and talk therapy
- Vitamin B1
- Metamucil, inulin 
- Miralax
- Dilators and pelvic wand

I stumbled upon the top post of this sub a few days ago and it got me wondering about my MMC. So I‚Äôve been taking ginger/artichoke for 2 days now. Too early to tell really, I thought my BM this morning was a bit more complete but still not really much better. 

I do think that there‚Äôs been some mental changes, for example music today is sounding amazing. It‚Äôs like when I started SSRIs. Could be placebo. 

I can‚Äôt really get a breath test easily where I live and I‚Äôm done with doctors at this point. Could my issues be SIBO, if so what else could I try? ",1,1732822826.0,SIBO,0,0.67,False

On our first date, we connected well at a new bakery as we shared ethnicity (which was rare in the city we‚Äôre at), we both work in corporate, and both having the same breed of dog back at our families‚Äô homes. After the date, she texted me first to thank me for treating her to coffee and pastries, and mentioned that she had a great time. I responded that I enjoyed it too and suggested we do something again, which she said she gladly be open to.
My concern is that I'm not sure if she‚Äôs really interested in me, as sometimes she responds late, especially during weekdays, which I totally understand because we both work in demanding corporate jobs. Her job is a lot more demanding than me as her industry usually requires entry levels to work at least 60 hours a week.

But her texts are never dry, though‚Äîshe responds enthusiastically and in multiple texts, and she only responds promptly in weekend or soon before/after our dates. On our second date, which was the weekend before Thanksgiving, I took her to a nice restaurant. We had a great conversation throughout the entire time, and she asked a lot of questions about me. She even casually suggested future plans we could do, but we didn't make solid plans for our next meetup since we were both were flying to visit our families for Thanksgiving and we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for almost 2 weeks.
After the date, I walked her to her car, she told me she had a lot of fun and we hugged goodbye. I texted her that I had a great time and wished her a fun Thanksgiving. She responded that she had a great time too and thanked me for dinner. She also asked me to send pictures of my dog when I see him during the break. A week later, I sent her some pictures of my dog, and she replied saying he was adorable and mentioned that she was visiting her cousin at the moment and will send pictures of her dog later in the week when she visited her parents. I texted her that I was excited to see her dog pics.
Now, it‚Äôs been a couple of days since then, and I‚Äôm feeling anxious that she may not follow up with the pictures, especially since I assume she‚Äôs traveling to her parents.

We make coffee every morning and dinner every night. I like the idea of not building out a vented propane locker, shutoff solenoid, sniffer - all the things that come with installing a safe propane system. We‚Äôre planning on a fairly robust electrical system as we are in the US PNW and we like being at camp for at least a week at a time before having to roll into town to replenish. We also do some work out there so we run Starlink, computers, etc. 

We‚Äôll have the ability to cook outside with a propane camp stove. Probably carry a small 5lb can on the back outside of the rig. But that‚Äôs easy to manage and not critical if we run out or decide not to refill. We‚Äôll also use it for a fire can at camp so also not a big deal if the fire can runs through all of our propane. 

Our planned electrical system:

- 600Ah LiFePO4 battery bank @ 12V (~7200 watt/hrs)
- 800w rooftop solar
- 300w ground solar
- 100A alternator charging
- 2kw inverter (might have to bump this to 3kw, haven‚Äôt spec‚Äôd out cookers yet)

Curious for those of you who run induction cooktops, what kind of battery and charging capacity you have? Is it enough for you? Thoughts on using induction cooking with our planned capacity?

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

Trying to see if I'm just having a placebo effect or if coffee really is triggering me.,"I've had chronic fatigue issues for years and the last few years have seen them get immensely worse. It could be any number of factors (hitting my mid-thirties, hormonal shifts, relocation, etc.) but recently learned about histamine intolerance and that *allergies* can cause the kind of debilitating fatigue and brain fog I've been struggling with. Decided to give myself a week on non-drowsy 24-hr Allegra (fexofenadine.) For reference, I generally don't take antihistamine meds and haven't throughout my life. I just didn't think I had seasonal allergy problems because I didn't get sniffles/coughing/rhinitis/etc. I also don't think I've ever tried allegra because I was convinced all antihistamines just make me comatose.

Anyway, about two days into taking a daily allegra, I had gradually more energy and less brain fog than I've had in *years.* So I'm convinced now that I may have had allergies to something all along and my allergies were just manifesting as fatigue/brain fog instead of rhinitis. I'm about a week into this experiment and still going strong. I had dropped coffee out of my diet for that time after suspecting it may have been a trigger. Today I decided to give it a try.

So I made a cup of a coffee and took maybe 3 or 4 sips of it. After about 15min I start feeling that heavy-lidded, almost dry-eyes feeling I often get when experiencing that daytime drowsiness I was struggling with before. It's not as severe as before (I imagine because I'm currently on allegra) and I don't feel as brain fogged either. 

However, I'm not ruling out that it could just be placebo/anxiety reacting to the coffee.

So does anyone here know how quickly a reaction can come on? If coffee really is a histamine trigger for me, would I realistically get hit with this drowsiness only 15min after taking 3-4 sips?

  
tldr;

* chronic fatigue for years might be allergy/histamine related, started taking non-drowsy allegra (haven't taken an antihistamine med in maybe 10+ yrs, didn't expect the allegra to actually be non-drowsy)
* found out that 24-hr non-drowsy allegra helped my fatigue/brain fog *a lot*, currently a week into taking it daily as an experiment
* testing to see if coffee was a trigger. drank coffee for the first time since starting the daily antihistamine experiment. 
* 3-4 sips of coffee and 15min later started feeling drowsy (heavy-lidded, slight dry-eyes, physically ""sleepy"" but not mentally.)
* placebo or is this realistically about how quickly a histamine reaction can hit?

When we first met, it felt like magic, we had this amazing connection, and it developed into something romantic, but it was always messy. We both had issues, and the distance made things harder.

Since returning home, I‚Äôve been visiting her every month. It‚Äôs cost me a lot in time, money, and emotional energy, but I thought it was worth it. This trip for Thanksgiving was supposed to be our last visit before we started focusing on our own lives; she‚Äôs going back to school, and I‚Äôve been trying to figure out my next steps. We had planned to spend the week together, make dinner, and even have some intimacy while staying ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was something we both seemed to want.

But last week, things started feeling off. She became overly suspicious of me, accusing me of lying about small things like where I went and what I ate. It felt like she was looking for a reason to fight. I admit I told a white lie.. I was at a coffee shop with my aunt and said we went out to eat because I didn‚Äôt want to start drama‚Äîbut she blew it up, accusing me of going on a date or hiding something. She‚Äôs done this before, projecting her insecurities and creating fights out of nowhere.

This time, I reached my breaking point. I told her I was canceling the trip. She didn‚Äôt try to stop me. Her response was basically, ‚ÄúDo what you feel. I won‚Äôt beg.‚Äù It crushed me. It felt like she didn‚Äôt care about the effort I put into this or about salvaging the trip. I blocked her after that, and it‚Äôs been radio silence since.

What makes this worse is the history. She‚Äôs made comments in the past that have really hurt me like suggesting a threesome with a coworker and then dismissing it as a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù She also once lied to me about answering a call from her ex, claiming it was an emergency about their shared dog. She‚Äôs always framed herself as the victim in every conflict, deflecting responsibility and making me feel like the bad guy. I‚Äôve spent so much time reassuring her, validating her, and bending over backward to make things work, and now I feel like I‚Äôve been left empty.

Today is Thanksgiving, and I‚Äôm supposed to be in her state with her. Instead, I‚Äôm with a friend in my home state trying to make last-minute plans. I can‚Äôt stop wondering if she‚Äôs spending the day with someone else, which kills me, but at the same time, I know this relationship has been toxic. She‚Äôs accused me of lying, gaslit me, and projected her insecurities onto me. I feel like she‚Äôs moved on without a second thought, and I‚Äôm stuck here questioning everything.

I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. Did I handle this wrong? Should I have tried harder to save the trip? Or was canceling it the right move? I feel drained, heartbroken, and confused.

Especially given that I have no set time limit on filling out furniture/decor, and the location and deal on house means I hope to be here for a long time, I want to give the living space justice. I bristled at the blue carpet at first, but actually it's grown on me... but still not sure how to style the room. 

https://preview.redd.it/cdxfrk3qyo3e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28b15f0c0249542a47f0160b31df79abca358079

Because of the lighting fixture I'm sure the owner chose the south end of the room to place a dining table. Despite the odd lighting, I'm considering putting a couch in the south east quarter to take advantage of the picture window. On the other hand, picturing the couch there, so far back from the window, gives me an odd feeling I can't explain--I'm not sure why it feels so unbalanced, other than that my whole life I'm used to a couch against a west facing window facing east. Is there any reason that works/doesn't work better? 

Having a giant rectangle of a room to furnish is definitely feeling daunting. We need a dining table (we are a couple but want to be able to accommodate guests), a couch of some kind, coffee table, additional seating (I have a butterfly chair that I think would be nice to fit in), and enough room left over for a large dog crate. 

Appreciate any ideas, thanks!

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù game (everyone has varying definitions of cozy and these are mine):

-Complex puzzles that aren‚Äôt so complex I‚Äôll need a guide to solve them

-Management style game or features of management games

-Preferably no combat 

-The ability to control how quickly I need to get things done (ex. I love the stress of GPGP and Two Point Hospital but I also love to just kick back and enjoy the game for a bit sometimes. Coffee Caravan started to scratch the itch but it just wasn‚Äôt involved enough and it just never felt like it got any more difficult 

-A REAL STORYLINE - the main reason I don‚Äôt like most management games is because they typically lack sustenance and storylines so I end up losing interest after playing the same story over and over again

-I do like simulation games but again, I love a good storyline and most of these lack that as well 

-Aside from a storyline, the biggest thing I‚Äôm looking for is replayability. I‚Äôve purchased way too many games recently that I finished in 10 hours and will never play again because all the surprises are already ruined 

-Also important to note: I have a fairly outdated windows computer so I probably can‚Äôt run anything too big, like Subnautica or most open-world games

I hope this is okay and I don‚Äôt sound like a total crazy person but I know there‚Äôs a kinda chill-management-puzzle-story-game out there somewhere! Lol

A least a little.,"**Probably unnecessary explanation:** Today is the American holiday called Thanksgiving. It's on a Thursday, and typical working class Americans are lucky to have even two weeks vacation time in a year.

This means, if one is fortunate and plays their cards right, they can have a whopping four days in a row off--Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. (This won't be you if you work customer-facing retail)

Thanksgiving is a huge holiday with traditional foods and almost mandatory expectation of celebrating with family. So lots and lots of USA exSDAs are here decompressing from SDA...stuff.

**Original intended post:**

 All y'all exSDAs out there having to pretend they're still in the church for reasons.

All y'all having to celebrate Thanksgiving and you can't get turkey bc vegetarian SDAs and you want some turkey tho.

All y'all dealing with SDA family prying into your beliefs and pushing your boundaries and using that Pascal's Wager (the ""believe in God just in case!"" argument).

All y'all parents keeping a wary ear out for your kids because SDA relatives have told your kids horrific SDA bullshit.

The stress of the holiday is real. Put yourself first today, at least a little bit. Reading a book? Listening to a podcast? Going out with friends for pepperoni pizza? Coffee? Sitting in doing nothing? Naps? That's self care. Self care is important.

The whole subreddit feels like a never-ending echo chamber of ""I‚Äôm so misunderstood"" and ""Nobody gets me,"" but with zero actual introspection. It's like walking into a room full of people wearing the same ""Nobody cares about me"" t-shirt, but instead of doing something about it, they just complain and post TikTok trends in between talking about how much they hate school.

The posts are endless‚Äîposts about ‚Äúwhy my parents don‚Äôt understand me‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to survive high school 101‚Äù like it's all some kind of shared universal experience. Newsflash: it‚Äôs not. Some of us have actually been there and learned a thing or two that might make this whole growing up thing a bit easier‚Äîbut no, apparently offering actual advice is just cringe in a subreddit where everyone‚Äôs too busy wallowing in self-pity to look for solutions.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the mods. Half of them act like they just discovered what moderation is, making vague, half-baked rules about what can and can‚Äôt be posted‚Äîrules that somehow only apply to things they personally disagree with. Want to talk about something real? Good luck. Want to post a meme that‚Äôs slightly off the ‚Äúteenage struggle‚Äù theme? Prepare for a ban or a warning. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to curate the most sterile, echoing version of teenage angst imaginable. It‚Äôs high school drama, but for the internet.

And the cringey advice? ""Just talk to your parents!"" ‚ÄúGet a hobby!‚Äù Yeah, thanks, I never thought of that. Sure, let‚Äôs all throw out these completely generic solutions that don‚Äôt even begin to address the nuances of real life. Like, maybe not everyone wants to go to therapy or get a job at the local coffee shop to ‚Äúfind themselves."" Maybe we‚Äôre tired of hearing the same advice over and over like we‚Äôre stuck in some broken loop of recycled wisdom that doesn‚Äôt actually help.

Honestly, the whole subreddit feels like it‚Äôs stuck in a time warp‚Äîlike everyone is just treading water, pretending to be edgy and deep, but never actually growing. It's a place where everyone wants to be heard but no one‚Äôs really listening. And I get it, it‚Äôs teenagers‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. If you want to complain about how hard life is, that‚Äôs fine. We all do it. But at least throw in some self-awareness, some actual change, some effort to rise above the noise instead of just adding to it.

In the end, r/teenagers is like that room full of people all trying to one-up each other in misery without ever stopping to ask, ‚ÄúHey, maybe this isn‚Äôt all that important in the grand scheme of things?""

I'm in the final week of my Indiegogo campaign for a smart scale that has surpassed its funding goal by over 1000%. We reached full funding within the first hour, and the support has been incredible.

As the campaign nears its end, I'm exploring additional avenues to promote it. Could you share effective strategies or platforms that have worked for you in the final days of a campaign?

For context, this project is a labor of love:

* I personally designed the hardware, electronics, and app.
* My wife created the promotional videos.
* Our basement has become a mini production studio, filled with 3D printers and prototypes.

The smart scale offers:

* Precision about 20 times greater than standard scales.
* Functionality for coffee brewing, mixology, baking, and advanced nutrition tracking, with or without app guidance.
* Integration of multiple devices into one sleek hardware and software solution.

Competing in an established market has been challenging, but the response so far has been encouraging.

My room is exactly 12 inches larger than the other room and my bathroom is inside my room, however both bathrooms are the same size and our guests use the bathroom of whoever invited them over and we of course use our own restrooms, never sharing the hall bathroom (the other person‚Äôs bathroom) for any reason; it is treated 100% as the other person's personal restroom. The other person makes over $500 more per month than I do if that matters. Both closets are the same size as well; they are both walk in closets.

My room window faces the busy street, the other person's faces the fairly busy parking lot (we live in the heart of a very busy city). Our food is separate, chores are split. everything else is divided equally or otherwise, is supplied for our own personal use by ourselves. The other person's room is 11x12 and mine is 11x13.

Overall sqft for the apartment is 1102 sqft. We share the common areas. The couch and living room smart TV, TV stand, gaming system, roomba and mop roomba are all mine, so is the coffee table. They are studying abroad here for context so they sold most of their furniture off because they plan to go back to their home country in 1-2 years. 

We do not have any dining room furniture since I recently moved in, although I do plan to get barstools for the extra tall bar counter when I have some extra money. The apartment is just too cramped for a whole dining table in my opinion. Dining room is 9x11. Living room is 13x13. Apparently the person who was living here before and had my room was paying roughly $30 more each month because the room is ""bigger"" with an ""attached"" bathroom. If that IS a reason to pay more, wouldn't that mean the other person's restroom is communal whereas the shower is theirs alone? 

- Also, I did the math and pricing out the apartment by the sqft, it's literally less than $2 per 12‚Äù ($1.57 per sqft to be exact). Am I the asshole for thinking it should be an even split? *edited to add indentations/paragraphs*",6,1732819970.0,AmItheAsshole,64,0.67,False

I feel conflicted, trapped and stuck. What can I do? ","To premise, my partner (34m) and I (32f) have been together for 6 years. It has been a peaceful, if not somewhat uneventful relationship. He is the bread winner of the household, the house in his name. He is from a well off family background and has financial aid available from his parents that is only a phone call away. By contrast, I don‚Äôt earn much and am certainly financially reliant on him. He certainly is a willing provider financially, and whenever I am struggling, he chimes in without complaining. 

However, aside from the financial input, I don‚Äôt feel that he ‚Äòcontributes‚Äô to the relationship in any way. He is negative, has no drive, no motivation, no ambition, no goals and no opinion on much (save for complaining). He will never do anything unless prompted, encouraged or nagged. 

As an example, I have been a frequent gym-goer for years. I encouraged him to go with me and to be fair he did for a while, we got up early and headed to the gym before work several days a week. I was so happy and thought it was wonderful that we had something we enjoyed together and that he had found some ambition and a goal to work towards. I even bought him some fancy gym gear. However, I began to notice that he would never go by himself, only when I went. Over time, this turned into me getting up and leaving to the gym alone whilst he would turn his alarm on snooze and stay in bed.  When I asked him why he doesn‚Äôt want to go by himself or why he has not put as much effort in any more, his response was that **he‚Äôs not that bothered** with the gym. This was a gut wrenching to hear as it turned out our shared interest didn‚Äôt actually exist. 

In a similar way, I have always wanted a family, and he has also said that he would like a family too. Ok, brill, something to work towards and be excited about I thought. Until recently, when I asked, he said that **he‚Äôs not that bothered** with having kids. Which was another punch in the gut. To be honest after hearing that, the thought of having kids with him kind of makes my stomach turn upside down. Which makes me feel like an awful person. Does that just mean that having kids will go the same way as the gym experience did? Thinking that we‚Äôre both invested only to find out that he only did it because he thought it‚Äôs what I wanted and then gradually loses any interest or motivation?  I‚Äôm 32 now and am well aware that time and fertility are both running out, which scares the crap out of me.

Another example will be family events. He won‚Äôt contribute to a conversation unless prompted or asked a question directly. He will then complain to me in private about how everyone is ignoring him despite the fact that everyone has made an effort to involve him. If I spend any time with family members for longer than 10 minutes without him, he accuses me of ignoring him. In all fairness, when asked, he will get involved with the cooking and cleaning and helping my parents and doing things for them without complaining (until later when I get an earful). It would seem that what my family see as attempts to involve him and make him feel included, he sees as them expecting things from him. Every time there is a family event, we end up falling out, which in turn ruins the event for everyone. 

We did eventually manage to talk about how anything positive or fun we do is always spoiled by his apathy, lack of engaging, negativity and tendency to invent problems where none exist to find something to complain about. He said that he may be suffering from depression, so I looked around to find him a therapist who has a good reputation, which took ages. He really seemed committed to therapy and we sat down together and I helped him write down all the things he wanted to discuss with the therapist. But, as with the gym example given above, things began to slide. Now his therapy sessions involve him complaining about his work colleagues or moaning about my family events, which is a far cry from the original struggles he said he wanted to try and address. Like the gym example, did he really want to address the problems? Or is it just another thing he‚Äôs **not that bothered** with? 

Over time, I feel like his he is negativity, lack of drive, motivation and ambition has rubbed off on me and made me a negative unambitious person too, which I never was. I had dreams wants and goals. Now, I barely leave the house, have no friends and am just aimless and floating around. I lie awake at night thinking ‚Äúis this it? is this my life?‚Äù I have anxiety attacks too, and I know exactly why, because I feel unfulfilled. I have begun to prefer the days he goes to work, I feel at peace and the anxiety and stress just disappears. I am more productive, I finish chores, I even sing and dance when I‚Äôm cooking. For a few hours, my hopes, dreams and optimism all come back. But when he is around I just end up floating around or procrastinating, looking through eBay at things I can‚Äôt afford, or at properties I can‚Äôt afford as a form of fantasy escapism. 

This feeling of unfulfillment is beginning to turn into resentment, we have had so many conversations about the lack of ambition, negativity etc and sure, things will pick up for a week but then go right back to normal, nothing ever changes. I feel that because his therapy has turned into complaining sessions, he has become emboldened by them and now any attempts to talk to him or explain frustrations become arguments. Arguments which aren‚Äôt arguments because whenever we argue or he hears something he doesn‚Äôt like, he will shut down completely, not respond and give me the silent treatment, I become invisible until he decides it‚Äôs time to talk. One one hand this is torture and I hate the awkwardness, but on the other hand,  the other night and I ended up sleeping alone and it was the best nights sleep I have had in ages. 

There‚Äôs loads of stuff I would like to see and do, but the thought of doing them with him turns the feeling of excitement into a feeling that it will be a chore, because it feels like I am just dragging him around to do things I want to do that **he‚Äôs not that bothered** with, or that he will be negative and complain about. Today I went to get my hair done for the first time in months and it felt great to go out, see the city, have a coffee, talk to people and actually feel good within myself. I felt free. 

I feel terrible and guilty for feeling the way I do, because despite everything, he has (and continues to) put a roof over my head and food on the table. 6 years together does create a bond, and I have loved him so hard that I was always happy to help motivate him, encourage him and support him -(I taught him to drive, I found him the job he‚Äôs in) but now, more than ever it feels one sided. I feel burned out, hopeless, lost and alone, in a constant state of biding my time waiting for a miracle to happen but I am increasingly aware of the fact that it never will. It is crystal clear he isn‚Äôt going to change, he doesn‚Äôt want to change, because he doesn‚Äôt have to change. Yet the thought of being without him hurts and scares me. I will be back to my parents house with nothing - no job, no friends, no money, no love, no nothing, completely alone.

1h22xij,https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/1h22xij/atv_remote_gone_wild/,ATV Remote gone wild,"So here‚Äôs one. Woke up this AM, made coffee and turned on the TV for the grandkids to watch cartoons. TV went to 100% volume and stayed there. Could turn it down with any number of remotes but it always cooled back to 100. After some troubleshooting turns out the culprit is the ATV remote. Examination shows no obvious damage, it‚Äôs not wet and seems ok other than it pushed the volume to 100%. Kind an applied pressure and then it took the volume to 0 and leave it there. Had to take the remote out of the house to get it away from all of the ATVs because it would do the same to any of the 3. 

I have Apple Care in the ATV it came with, only had the thing maybe 2 months now. I assume something on the logic board inside is having issues and I‚Äôm just going to let the thing die and sit for a while. Just an odd thing to have happen. Anyone else ever seen this or had it happen?

I have begun to prefer the days he goes to work, I feel at peace and the anxiety and stress just disappears. I am more productive, I finish chores, I even sing and dance when I‚Äôm cooking. For a few hours, my hopes, dreams and optimism all come back. But when he is around I just end up floating around or procrastinating, looking through eBay at things I can‚Äôt afford, or at properties I can‚Äôt afford as a form of fantasy escapism. 

This feeling of unfulfillment is beginning to turn into resentment, we have had so many conversations about the lack of ambition, negativity etc and sure, things will pick up for a week but then go right back to normal, nothing ever changes. I feel that because his therapy has turned into complaining sessions, he has become emboldened by them and now any attempts to talk to him or explain frustrations become arguments. Arguments which aren‚Äôt arguments because whenever we argue or he hears something he doesn‚Äôt like, he will shut down completely, not respond and give me the silent treatment, I become invisible until he decides it‚Äôs time to talk. One one hand this is torture and I hate the awkwardness, but on the other hand,  the other night and I ended up sleeping alone and it was the best nights sleep I have had in ages. 

There‚Äôs loads of stuff I would like to see and do, but the thought of doing them with him turns the feeling of excitement into a feeling that it will be a chore, because it feels like I am just dragging him around to do things I want to do that **he‚Äôs not that bothered** with, or that he will be negative and complain about. Today I went to get my hair done for the first time in months and it felt great to go out, see the city, have a coffee, talk to people and actually feel good within myself. I felt free. 

I feel terrible and guilty for feeling the way I do, because despite everything, he has (and continues to) put a roof over my head and food on the table. 6 years together does create a bond, and I have loved him so hard that I was always happy to help motivate him, encourage him and support him -(I taught him to drive, I found him the job he‚Äôs in) but now, more than ever it feels one sided. I feel burned out, hopeless, lost and alone, in a constant state of biding my time waiting for a miracle to happen but I am increasingly aware of the fact that it never will. It is crystal clear he isn‚Äôt going to change, he doesn‚Äôt want to change, because he doesn‚Äôt have to change. Yet the thought of being without him hurts and scares me. I will be back to my parents house with nothing - no job, no friends, no money, no love, no nothing, completely alone. 

What can I do?

The way Avinash ruined Eisha's full plan, just proves she cant do much on her own and frankly i dont know why he did that.

Seems like he is not too happy to have her as captain, granted his eyes are swollen and shes not really able to stand up to everyone. Vivian also chose himself in the task with his coffee and didnt fight much when she couldnt disqualify Karan, to wash his hands he said ""sanchalak ka decision final hai"", but he didnt seem to care much and even Avnish was quiet when Eisha was trying to cheat.

I really wonder what is causing Avinash's frustration. Clearly Eisha is there alone. He really went below the belt with that comment and Eisha shouldnt say Karan crosses a limit. She looked like a fool today and that smug smile was wiped off her face with Avinashs actions

He makes every interaction possible like pulling teeth, argues about everything, never ever completes a request without drawing someone else into his bullshit. He used to not be so bad when I was a kid, or at least I wasn‚Äôt aware of it. This year he did what he does every year and didn‚Äôt take off the day prior to thanksgiving so he missed family dinner with my sister‚Äôs family. Working on this day also allowed him to be exempt from cooking as he began to pretend he had a cold which he has conveniently has had the entire month. The timing is impeccable as he has done this throughout the duration of my moms healing process after an unexpected surgery, so he‚Äôs had to help very little as she enables him so severely justifying everything she ignores and swallows in regards to his behavior in the name of religiosity‚Äôs sake. This morning of thanks giving we were all up before 8, aside from good old dad. Complaining of a cold. Every task has been an opportunity for him to argue and draw into play his argument that he can‚Äôt do what he needs to do because he‚Äôs being made to do other things. Other things include taking the dog to a sitter because we are going to be gone from home for maybe three hours when she stays in her kennel for 8 hours every night. He acts helpless and clueless, as soon as he woke up he asked me three different questions about where three different things are and none of them were crucial to what he was doing in that moment.

Catlitter, he needed to ask someone for baking soda even though he knew he needed that beforehand. Food in the fridge, argues with me about what will fit where and pulls me into his bullshit. Folded towels put up, comes and bothers me asking me what to do after throwing a fit about doing it at all saying he can‚Äôt get anything done because my mom asked him to do these things. Everyone else handles their responsibilities independently unless it‚Äôs an extra favor to someone else. The cats are his. The laundry he never ever helped with so he had to be sure to throw a fit about doing it. He knew he wanted to get under my skin today so he threw a fit about the laundry saying he had to take a shit first and then walked up stairs to use my personal bathroom, stepping on and throwing my babies toys all over the place. I know he went up here to use the bathroom because he wipes his ass with wet face towels and intended to leave one where I and my nine month old bathe, knowing he is sick. I swear he just did that to spread his germs and try to keep me and my daughter sick. I truly hate him, he is so reactive and childish no interaction can pass by without him throwing his hands up or stomping his feet or raising his voice.

‚ÄúOverall, how was your lesson today?‚Äù  
A query so simple, yet deadly in play.  
no nuance, no reason, just a button to press,  
your career distilled into this meaningless mess.üòí

Did their internet lag? Was their mood amiss?  
Was their coffee too cold? Did they just dismiss  
your hard-earned skills with a flippant glance?  
Your future decided by fate and chance.üòí

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAverage‚Äù‚Äîa tease,  
Three hollow questions designed to appease.  
Was the correction too much? Too little? Just right?  
Your mind will churn through another sleepless night.üòí

What fuels their choice, who‚Äôs to say?  
the moon? the stars? the events of their day?  
we‚Äôll explain this someday‚Äîor never at all.  
Keep waiting, dear tutor, for crumbs to fall.üòí

1h22n8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h22n8i/do_i_stop_hanging_out_with_my_friends/,Do I stop hanging out with my friends?,"A little background to get the idea, Keeping this as short as possible. my friend group is mostly all couples & we‚Äôre hanging out all the time (every weekend, texting everyday, etc) and plan bdays & holidays together. There‚Äôs 4 girls & I, and 5 guys most of the time, depends who comes. 

We were all spending the weekend away, drinking, and one of my guy friends, let‚Äôs call him liam, also one of the girls bfs, tried to touch me down there, I backed away indicating I‚Äôm not interested & he tried again so I walked away. It was very strange, he was staring at me with this evil smirk and it was just so weird. He‚Äôs always showed interest in having foursomes with me & my bf, and has made multiple remarks about my boobs etc. but we were very close, and that‚Äôs his personality like everyone just brushes it off like ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs just Liam being Liam‚Äù. His gf has brought it up from time to time questioning why he‚Äôs like that w me and obviously starting arguments. And yes he made these remarks in front of her about the foursome etc. but she never did express her concern to me about it, I‚Äôve just heard it from the other girls. 

We were all drinking the night it happened & I didn‚Äôt know if it was a big enough deal to bring it up to him so I sat on it and made a decision. So, after that incident I told my bf about it the next day. He was obvs pissed off & wanted to speak to Liam about it, as they were close since birth so it‚Äôs a weird position to be in. My bf ended up telling the other guys before confronting Liam, and the gf still didn‚Äôt know. I realize it would‚Äôve been best to just tell the gf when I told my bf, but I never. Scared she‚Äôd be mad at me or something and also didn‚Äôt want to make a scene out of our fun weekend.

So my bf confronts Liam, he‚Äôs apologizing and saying he drank too much etc. he tells my bf that he wants to be the one to tell his gf, so we respected that. and then the night goes on. The gf still doesn‚Äôt know the next morning as she hasn‚Äôt said anything about it to me. We head home the NEXT evening without any knowledge on if she knows or not. That day went by and still didn‚Äôt hear from the gf about it, so I texted her to go for a coffee and I was going to tell her what went on then. But her bf got word that I was going to hang w her, so he called and said he wanted to be the one to tell her first and he did that evening. 

(The bf also texted me a huge thing apologizing to me, and I was forgiving and all was good) 

She texts me afterwards, seeming like she thought it was nbd, and we kind of laughed about it etc. and hung out that same evening to talk about it and explained the situation with every detail. All was fine, the ball is in her and Liam‚Äôs court now. 

A few weeks go by, everyone‚Äôs still hanging out as normal, but none of the boys are speaking to Liam as they are pissed about what he done to me. Liam and the gf stop coming around all summer, as they‚Äôre embarrassed I guess and they think everyone‚Äôs still mad at Liam. 

The situation was never spoken about besides in jokes here & there. And the guys shared a mutual opinion that it‚Äôs just messed up. I was hearing from the girls that the gf was saying xyz about me, and i was taken back because I wasn‚Äôt hearing any of it from her. and half of it was just nit-picking me. I didn‚Äôt say anything about her, just that she should have enough balls to talk about it with me. 

3 months later, after barely seeing the gf and Liam, I get a huge paragraph from the gf telling me she‚Äôs mad at me for what happened and how I handled the situation and calling me a bad friend, basically picking me apart instead of Liam, who actually done the deed. She tells me she‚Äôs mad that one of my very close friends knows about it and that it‚Äôs embarrassing for her, and I shouldn‚Äôt be talking about it. (I told a close friend what happened as she asked why they are no longer around. It was chill.) she also blames me for their decision to not be around all summer, saying she ‚Äúisn‚Äôt going to stop coming around anymore‚Äù because of me. She said my bf should be talking to liam and that it‚Äôs terrible of my bf to not speak to Liam after what happened, as Liam has done xyz for my bf in the past. 

I was like ???? I never once said she should not come around, I was WAY beyond past that situation since the moment Liam apologized. So I told her I‚Äôve never been in that position and it was a weird thing to navigate, and if I had my time back I would‚Äôve spoken up right away, and not wait for Liam to tell her. I said my bf and Liam have nothing to do with our friendship & we shouldn‚Äôt let it get in the way. She came back with another paragraph, way meaner than the first, and trying to throw my bf under the bus for xyz and that no one‚Äôs innocent, and everyone‚Äôs done this that and the other thing and it‚Äôs unfair for Liam to be left out and it‚Äôs all my fault etc. I come back again apologizing, but then realized I have absolutely nothing to apologize for as I didn‚Äôt do it??? So I sent another message and said you know what, I don‚Äôt apologize for this. Your issue is with Liam and I understand you‚Äôre embarrassed but that‚Äôs got nothing to do with me, you don‚Äôt know how to handle a distraction like that until you‚Äôre in it etc. and she come back basically saying agree to disagree. 

Another month goes by and I‚Äôm hearing from other people that she‚Äôs shit talking me and making up lies about the situation and blaming it on me and my bf. She‚Äôs trying to hang out with my closest friends (they didn‚Äôt) and be buddied up with people she knows I‚Äôm closer with. Trying to get under my skin. Whatever floats her boat at that point, she‚Äôs going though it, right? 

Well, I had to see her for my friends birthday, we were drunk and she told me she loves me and was sorry for the way she got on with me, and I said it was fine BUT I don‚Äôt take disrespect and I called out everything she said that was false (in a nice way) and we concluded that we‚Äôd speak over coffee. At this point, I‚Äôm uninterested in doing that as she is trying to get under my skin like a weirdo for months, but she doesn‚Äôt ever reach out for that coffee. We still don‚Äôt speak, it‚Äôs been 8 months since the incident. 

I am NOW hearing that she‚Äôs still going around to people I do and dont know & asking if they know what happened, and saying she ‚Äújust doesn‚Äôt know who to believe‚Äù. As her bf has made 10 different excuses on how/what happened that night and is definitely confusing her. But she is also trying to protect her image and her relationships image by twisting the story & making sure everyone knows her ‚Äúside‚Äù of things. Why is she airing out my business to other people, it‚Äôs weird asf. She has always been weird with me, obvs bc her bf is interested, trying to make ppl ‚Äúlike‚Äù her more and trying to one-up me, never looks at me when speaking in a group setting, throwing small jabs about me to others or to my face, trying to make me feel excluded etc. giving jealousy vibes. So I never was as tight with her as the other girls. 

So, why I ask if I should stop being friends / going around in general is because: the other gfs don‚Äôt want to get involved, are saying ‚Äúneutral‚Äù on the situation and continuing to invite the both of us every weekend and for our group activities. There has been a lot of times where they don‚Äôt invite her, but she‚Äôs still getting the invite for the big events. I understand not wanting to stop a friendship with someone over drama that isn‚Äôt yours, but also I stand 10 toes for my girls and I guess see that in a different light. I don‚Äôt ever speak on the topic or tell them what I‚Äôm hearing about the gf saying things about me anymore as they are ‚Äúneutral‚Äù. They tell me they‚Äôre with me on that whole situation, but know that I‚Äôve set a boundary in not wanting to waste energy hanging out with the gf, and still continue to invite her, knowing I may not be there then. They tell me they just feel bad as her and Liam‚Äôs relationship has been on the rocks (like obviously? He just tried to cheat on you with me?) but anyways. I‚Äôm struggling to know if I go to the events anyways and just not speak/look at her but on the other hand, why would I waste my time doing that? We‚Äôre a close knit bunch and to have 2 people not speaking is just weird. I couldn‚Äôt care less to spend time with her, she treated me badly through out this situation, and continues to do so even though we do not even speak anymore. Literally rent free in her head. My friends still are like omg please come etc when plans are made, in hopes that we can go back to normal but I don‚Äôt take disrespect lightly and think I shouldn‚Äôt surround myself with somebody with bad intentions. Whom I‚Äôd have to watch my mouth around not knowing how she‚Äôll twist it. OR do I go around and prove that I don‚Äôt care? But also why do I have to prove anything to anyone? lol. I also did try to get the girls to understand where I‚Äôm coming from but they only seem to care about ‚Äúbigger the crowd the more fun‚Äù instead of actual good friendships with people who stand by them. Idk. 

I did have to see her the other day as my friends blindsided me and didn‚Äôt tell me she was going to be there, as it was a normal night and not an event. Her and her bf were in my ear ‚Äúoh i love you so much I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else‚Äù etc like trying to prove their relationship which was really strange LOL I left the night very early as I didn‚Äôt want to be around a weirdo. Also, they are planning a girls night thos weekend, with both of us invited. So it‚Äôs going to be 4 or 5 of us girls hanging around and me & the gf aren‚Äôt going to speak? How weird is that ‚Ä¶ do I go and not care or just don‚Äôt care to go? Lol 

I don‚Äôt want to make them pick a side or anything like that, but when your friend is being torn down wouldn‚Äôt you want to stand by them? Idk, should I keep wasting my time w these people, give it a chance? Or respect myself and stop joining. And do I go when the gf isn‚Äôt there? Or stop completely? These people just don‚Äôt have the same morals as me I don‚Äôt think. I am not opposed to confrontation, and will give my honest opinions etc. staying ‚Äúneutral‚Äù on a situation worried to hurt somebody‚Äôs feelings or stand up for a friend is pussy behaviour. This situation in general could‚Äôve been done & over with, 8 months ago. I do get that the gf is embarrassed, but to take it out on me and not her perv bf, is just uncalled for & childish. If my bf did that to my friend, I‚Äôd be concerned for the friend first of all, and never judge how she handled it as it‚Äôs weird asf. Also I would no longer have a bf. I am just dumbfounded how it‚Äôs turned into this big of a deal. She‚Äôs bringing it up every chance she gets, trying to make herself a victim. Idk if this is relevant but her other mutual friends do not like Liam, and think they should break up and they know about what happened so i think that also set her off even more that they now REALLY don‚Äôt like the guy.

Did anyone have similar experience with some old coffee beans (roasted Nov'23)? I didn't have any quality beans for espresso so just used some dark beans a friend got me on his trip to Brasil, and these definitely are the supermarket type beans if you will.

I started with 16g @ 10 clicks on C40, then 16g @6 clicks and the last shot was 19g @6 clicks. Not much difference. I did feel some more resistance early on, but it went away quickly. I did use the included needle, and declumped quite thoroughly. I don't think channeling was the issue because there was no pressure.

Imma get some proper beans soon but for now I just need some emotional support, because I was hoping for a beautiful, foamy shot. It tasted not bad though.

In the short time I've been using Reddit, I've seen many kind-hearted people looking for an opportunity to help Cubans. They ask how they can do it and personally this is my answer. 
  We Cubans in general are very grateful for any type of donation but think about it, you incur the costs of purchasing these supplies and on top of that you cover the shipping costs. To be honest, it only helps us live a little better for a short time. 
I repeat, we appreciate every gesture of solidarity and the people who do it may be blessed by God eternally. 
  Help us get out of here. I have already removed my mask and prejudices because I have lost patience when I see that being a doctor by profession and with a salary of approximately 20 dollars a month is not enough to raise my son. 
  So if you are really willing to help a Cuban, I ask you to help me with a donation so I can leave this country with my child and start a new life somewhere else. Any amount will be appreciated. Maybe for you it will only be the price of a coffee or a pizza but for my son and I it will be an immense blessing and the hope of a better life. It is requested by a mother who, despite working tirelessly, cannot improve her family's living conditions. 

  üôèüèΩPeople who are really interested in helping, can contact me privately and I can show you the evidence you need. 

I clarify that with the help of a friend we tried to run a campaign on Gofundme and it resulted in the blocking of her account because the page does not accept donations for Cubans directly. 

Because of can play receive donations through Zelle and then she send me. There is not way to send money directly to Cuba.

So I got my vvvfl on approx 11dpo. 12 dpo a more visible line. Lines have consistently got undeniably darker each day.

But - I had a drop of blood and spotting on 12 dpo after a ROUGH bowel movement. Straining so hard because I was constipated - and I continued to struggle for a few days.

The last 3 days I have been taking stool softener, and eating prunes and bran - si pooping has been easier.

But I haven‚Äôt had a break from the brown spotting. It‚Äôs been every day since 12dpo. I thought I had a chemical, but my tests are super dark now at 17/18 dpo. I have also had coffee ground specks when I sit to pee. No fresh blood since the one time. And I have had mild central cramping. And it never gets darker than light brown, and sometimes goes away during the day - it is intermittent. But i have it daily.

I had betas - 12 dpo 22, then 16 dpo 175, so more than doubling. My line progression seems to support this.

Should I be concerned? My pregnancy symptoms are almost nil- I felt so much more with a chemical where I only reached a beta of 11. So weird.

Today‚Äôs bowel movement was easy, and weirdly I had no spotting whatsoever after. But I had spotting with my FMU. I don‚Äôt know what to think, and am hoping for some success stories/encouragement, or advice! Thanks in advance",1,1732818766.0,CautiousBB,1,1.0,False

We were really close. Best friends. I had so much respect and appreciation for her mindset and the things that make her special. We could argue back and forth and it would be playful, productive, and loving (e.g. about chores). Whenever we went through hard things in life, we did it together as a team. We really cared about each other.

But. She had anger issues. Her triggers were the idea that she might lose me. So, anything related to my safety, or if I was too close with other people. This wasn't a fear of cheating, it also applied to family & platonic friends.

Some examples of the things that would trigger her: me walking home from work (1 mile); going for a run or a bike ride; wanting to take a nap after a long week; not finishing my breakfast; not eating dessert at an event; getting coffee with an old friend; going to an end-of-year party for my work.

When she got triggered, she completely blew up. Yelling at me, calling me names, mocking me. Throwing stuff. It got physical twice. It was a completely different side of her. For example, she'd call me an idiot, but I knew she didn't think that, and she didn't treat me as an idiot 98% of the time.

I tried different things to address her concerns or de-escalate the fights, but nothing worked. After years of this, I ended up just trying to hide triggering information. So then I was lying to her all the time, which I felt bad about.

I didn't feel like there was any room for change. Sometimes, she'd apologize. But she never talked about wanting to change, even after the breakup. I think I fell out of love with her, because of these issues and the lack of hope. I know what she would say to that. ""I still love my mom."" Because her mom did a lot worse to her.

But in spite of all that, I also miss her. I'm now starting to think about dating other people. It feels wrong. She's still the one in my heart. She's my girl. I think about waking up next to someone else, and it just makes me want to cry. I miss the beginning of our relationship, before these fights started. Outside of the fights, she was really caring and supportive and understanding. But I think the fights started to overpower that.

Right now, she's in some type of inpatient psychiatric treatment, according to our friends. They don't want me to know all the details. I know she tried to do a thing to herself, several times. So obviously she has big things to deal with. I hope she gets there. I really wish it had worked out.",2,1732818480.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1h22e74,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1h22e74/completely_lost/,Completely lost,"I'm having a really bad time at uni. I'm a girl in second year studying at a large Russell group uni, and I really like my course. I find it interesting and am doing reasonably well academically.

I had to retake my A-Levels because I had a serious illness, and in the end I got A\*BB, so not amazing grades by standards I set for myself. However, this was enough to get me accepted into my top uni choice.

In first year I was in catered halls, meaning that I didn't have a flat that I was in. I made lots of friends, but I never felt like I was part of a friendship 'group'. I would be close lots of people, but never close enough to be invited to go to the pub with them or anything like that. I'd go on a night out once every other week when it would be brought up at dinner and I could basically invite myself (embarrassing and desperate, I know).

This year, I have several close friends who I love very very much, But NONE of them like going out!!! I mean its hard to get them even go and watch a film with me, let alone go to the pub. So I'm stuck with literally no one to do anything with other than watch a film or get coffee maybe once every other week. I feel like I've been forced into becoming someone that I'm not, like I've lost a massive part of my personality which being someone who loves going out and having fun. I'm so bored all the time, and honestly it's really impacting my mental health. I spend most of my free time alone in my room or at the library working. My uni is known for having really great night life, and I know of lots of people who go out multiple times a week, but somehow I'm not close enough with any of them to ever be invited, or even to have people to invite to go out with me.

Even my more introverted home friends who are at other unis go to the pub at least once a week. I've only been to the pub TWICE in my whole time at uni, and not for lack of trying. When I told my friend from another uni about this she was shocked, because it was so unlike me.

I'm a really confident person and I don't find it difficult to make friends, so I don't even know how I ended up in this situation, let alone how to get out of it. I know people will say that I should join a society, and I'd love to but I feel like showing up to a social alone with no one I know there, especially in the middle of second year, is so awkward.

I'm terrified that I'm going to leave uni not having had any fun, wasting any opportunity that I had to. Even thinking of this right now makes me really really sad. It's not what I want to happen, but it seems like without me making a big change it will. I'm so scared of that.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm not opposed to dropping out and starting over at another uni, but I'm worried that with my A-Level grades I won't be given any offers by unis that will challenge me enough academically. I'm also thinking about moving to the US and going to college there, but it feels like it's too late for that and, again, my grades are too low. Is there something else I could do outside of uni that would make me more likely to get accepted somewhere else? Like another kind of exam or something? I'm literally grasping at straws here because I can't imagine any other solution. Please please please give me some advice!!

    A year ago I felt like I should start dating by this age so I accepted message requests on Facebook and instagram. I‚Äôm in Canada so most of them were in Canada too.
First guy I talked to
‚ÄòHey let‚Äôs grab coffee this evening, I can pick you up from work‚Äô I said no because how do I meet someone without even knowing them.
He kept insisting which was a turn off. 

Second one we chatted for 2 days he started FaceTiming; I did not turn on  my camera. He said he is coming to downtown where I live. I said okay come to the park nearby. 
‚Äòpark ma haina tmro room ma chai ramailo hunxa hola‚Äô it was his response 
LIKE WHAT SIR????? I wanted to vomit on his face ü§Æü§Æü§Æ

Third one 
He was my age 22 decent nice. We talked and he came to my workplace. Brought me current(pakayera), very nice very sweet
He said he didn‚Äôt get job for 9 months and had to ask his parents to send money for rent and tuition fee. 
Guess what he did when he got first job? 
Spent 900$ on shopping (shoes and clothes) because he missed spending money 
What??? Big no . 
I don‚Äôt want my man to be stingy but he needs to know when to go frugal and when to spend. If your parents have been paying 500$ a month for rent 8000$ fees, your priority should be paying them back or at least to save. 
Had to say no

4th 
I was done with guys or dating. Thought maybe I‚Äôm not in my higher self so I‚Äôm seeing people like them. But he came to talk to me. I replied. Nice guy, very good vision about future, dedicated and smart person. Turned out he knows one of my best friends from school. In the conversation he said ohh she had a lot of boyfriends in a degrading way. First red flag üö©. My man won‚Äôt judge people (men or women based on what they did when they are 14 or 15).
He asked me what you wanna do I said be financially free. 
He said would you marry a 70 years old man if he has a lot of money? 
Like wthhhh
I was done because my man won‚Äôt have these thoughts on women.

I‚Äôm done‚Ä¶.
I did talk to white men and they were way better way respectful and non judgemental. But at the end it‚Äôs better to have a partner who understands your own native language. 
Now I‚Äôm not planning to date.
I‚Äôm just focusing on myself and being the higher version of myself. But I wonder if all Nepali men are like this ü•±

Detective Winters told someone that he was talking to on his phone. He was looking at me. I had not thought of anything except where that kid would end up.

""So there is good news."" He told me. ""That little girl was adopted already. Get this: her story got her adopted by a rich couple. He is a plastic surgeon and she is a child psychologist. Does that make you happy, Lord?""

""It's too good to be true."" I sighed. I wanted to go and see my family. I couldn't stand being around Detective Winters already.

""I know, right? You couldn't write this stuff."" Detective Winters smiled. It looked weird on him.

The lights went out and we got some sleep. Cory clicked once, early in the morning. I was startled by his quietness and slowly and alertly opened my eyes. Detective Winters slept very soundly, a heavy sleeper in contrast to my light sleep. My right hand ached and I felt terror.

I knew an unseen presence was in the motel room. If I had to guess, it was the demon we had set free. It had returned to feed in the night. Detective Winters sat up stiffly, still asleep. His eyes opened, just white.

""Detective Winters?"" I stammered, fear tripping my lips.

""Sret niwe vitceted to nmai esu aceb ynn uf ta ht."" He said in a weird voice and then laughed evilly.

""You don't know how to speak?"" Cory chastised the creature.

""Silence, fool bird."" It said plainly.

I reached for the *Salem* pack and offered it to the creature, trembling in fear. It took the cigarettes and looked at them with its eyes going dark. Then it put all three of them in its mouth and lit them with its fingertips. While it smoked it was like it had three right arms moving hazily to work each cig to its puff.

""Neat trick."" Cory clicked in Corvin.

""It is calm."" I pointed out.

The demon finished and laid back down and exhaled. Detective Winters coughed in his sleep. I was very frightened and had to act despite my fear.

The smoke drifted around the room and I stood, hoping I knew what I was doing. I glanced around for a receptacle. There was a candle with a lid on it. It would have to do. I uncorked the lid and went to the drifting cloud of smoke. I deliberately inhaled all of it and then spewed the smoke into the candle and closed the lid on it.

My head swam from the demon's thoughts. I never wished to recall or put in order the images and emotions it gave me. Unclean, unholy and horrible beyond description. A creature that feeds on filth and destruction and hatred. I felt quite sick.

Then I heard a sound like a baby crying. She was alone, crying for her daddy. Her mommy was alone and couldn't get up again. I could hear all that in her cries. I shook off the nightmares that were hissing and whispering and chanting and mocking me in my own mind. The song of the demon ended as I crawled out from under the weight of its influence. I could hear my daughter.

""You would not ignore it."" Cory hopped up to me.

""That was you?"" I asked.

""I hoped the imitation of your child would be heard. You would not listen to reason."" Cory said.

...

""Where is it?"" I looked around nervously.

""Behold."" Cory set to where it was soaking up the shadows.

The monkey doll sat there with its back to us. The shadows were being drawn into it like water being drawn down a drain. It wasn't entirely real or unreal. It flickered, as though caught between a dream and reality.

""It is imprisoned."" I observed.

""In a way. Now it is tethered. It is stronger; though it cannot reach across space and time when it is here and now."" Cory clicked a mocking click. ""It does not prefer this form, imprisonment is a good way to describe it. Now it is stronger, more focused. Be careful. It can take a person if they are not baptised.""

""You mean like a Catholic?"" I asked Cory.

""No. I mean any baptism in the way that pleases the Creator. *You* are forgetful."" Cory chastised me, strangely. It was not his way to speak down to me; to sass me yes, but not to speak downward.

""I am forgetful?"" I asked.

""Man is forgetful: that religion is just his words to the actual Truth. I do not think that my Lord is forgetful. This language that I can speak now, it is baffling."" Cory explained.

""You can speak to me in our language."" I reminded him.

""It is difficult. The enchantment has made my thoughts and words English first. I must use effort to remember how to speak and think exactly as a crow."" Cory complained.

""What time is it?"" Detective Winters requested. He looked at his phone and satisfied himself it was time to wake up. He sat up and went for the *Salem* pack and found it empty. ""Goddamnit.""

""The demon smoked them all at once."" I told him.

""You are a fiend!"" He growled and looked around. He spotted the monkey doll in the corner, facing away from us still. He crumpled the soft pack and threw it as a green wad at the monkey's head. It struck and bounced onto the carpet.

""Did you dream of it?"" I asked him.

""I can't remember my dreams. I wasn't surprised to see it back."" Detective Winters looked and saw his gun next to me on the bed. ""Long night?"" He asked.

""You can see for yourself. Our cigarette-addicted demon has taken shape as an object. Cory says this is a relatively dormant state. Like it is in prison. While it is like this: the influence it has on those who are near it is much stronger. It can possess people this way. This demon: I have already seen it seize people. We must be careful.""

...

We went to the police station. I asked if it was possible to visit administration, where the main evidence room was located. He told me there was an evidence storage location. Even better.

As though the demon knew this was the time to shine, things began to go horribly wrong.

""I am Dawson."" A spectacle-wearing young man popped up from the other side of the divider where Detective Winters's desk ends. I looked past him, wondering how he had approached us unseen. There was a clear path from where I was sitting to the door, unless he had come from the break room, which had remained unoccupied long enough for the lights to go out automatically. I stared at him suspiciously.

""I know who you are."" Detective Winters kept working and didn't look up. Dawson slinked around the desk, between my knees and the divider awkwardly, and slid up behind Detective Winters, all in one fluid motion. I felt like he might have teleported and my mind simply filled in his movements.

""As you know, Detective Winters, I am assigned to make a few routine observations about you. I will then report whatever I notice to our internal review board."" Dawson smiled like he was offering Detective Winters a birthday card. Detective Winters took the clip board and signed it and handed it back. Then he accepted his green copy.

""Mostly this is going to be about disclosure."" Dawson grinned like we were all best friends having a sleep over and he was about to show us his dad's baseball card collection. ""I would like to know how good our communication is with you.""

""Don't touch me."" Detective Winters muttered. The hand retracted, burnt. I cringed.

""Detective Winters, we are all friends."" Dawson said like a jackass.

""Sorry. I just felt surprised when you put your hand on my shoulder."" Detective Winters realized he had opened the door for Dawson with his flinching words.

""How is your sex life, Jack?"" Dawson sat on the desk and asked aggressively, with a cheap smile. I was trying not to dislike him.

""Excuse me?' Detective Winters demanded, again shocked into a defensive response by Dawson.

""Off the record, of course. I am just wondering."" Dawson kept the smile on. His hand went down and his fingertips were at the feet of the monkey clouded in the illuminated folds of the evidence bag.

""Careful not to caress that toy, sir. You would be marked for evil."" Cory warned Dawson. He looked up, startled, then he looked from Cory to me and decided I was a ventriloquist. I just shrugged as he waved a finger at me, having caught me. I watched as the hand went back down and landed closer to him on the desk, less likely to touch the demon.

""Okay, guys. I want to just be cool with you guys, is that okay?"" Dawson shifted gears and started speaking with his hands, trying to get our eyes on him. I wondered what sort of man he was. I could not quite comprehend his ways.

""It's fine. Dawson, this is Lord. His crow really does talk. They help me solve the spooky crimes that got me in this corner and got you here sitting on my desk."" Detective Winters responded to Dawson's sudden shift in tone and approach. I wondered at this, part of some policeman ritual; they had gotten to know each other and established a rapport. I had blinked and missed it.

Dawson got up and left. He had gone into the break room, as the lights had come back on. Detective Winters took the opportunity to read his green piece of paper before he committed it to a desk drawer where a bottle of Jack and some blue pantyhose were waiting for their day. I could see a firecracker and a spark plug in there also.

""Who is he?"" I asked.

""He might be our best friend, destined to reincarnate at the same time as our souls and meet us again and again. He might be our worst enemy."" Detective Winters looked at me and used my way of speaking for a moment. I liked it.

Dawson came back and had brought a coffee for each of us. He had bought sunflower seeds from the vending machine for Cory. He said to my bird:

""I have never met an animal that can talk. I thought that was like only in pirate movies and stories for kids."" Dawson poured the seeds on the desk.

""I am not a parrot. I am not imitating you."" Cory pointed out. Then he began to feed on the sunflower seeds with effort. He had to peel them open and then peck the seed into a slightly smaller piece. I timed him, counting: it took him a minute and a half for each seed. I considered that in the wild: sunflower seeds would be a fair food source, if the bird could alight on the tall plant and open fresh seeds up there, somehow.

""Have you eaten these before?"" I asked.

""These? No. We steal these from the Farmer to trade with the Fen and the Fell. They plant sunflower seeds in their gardens, where no man may set foot and live."" Cory told the sunflower story and then laughed heartily, clicking and grinding like a broken engine.

""Is he choking?"" Dawson asked.

""He is laughing. He finds his own jokes to be funny. This is even more so if those he has told the joke to don't know what makes it so funny. To a crow ignorance is worthy of mockery, knowledge is their currency. A poverty of knowledge is always met with amusement by a crow that knows something that you do not."" I explained to Dawson.

""So they are snickering nerds."" Dawson told Cory and me.

""That's right."" Detective Winters teased Cory and laughed a fake and forced laugh at him.

""At least my jokes make sense."" Cory turned and cawed at him, flaring his tail as he met the challenge. Then, deciding he had won the exchange, he laughed victoriously. Then he went back to feeding on the precious sunflower seeds.

I shrugged at Dawson and Detective Winters. They sipped their coffee and watched each other. I had no idea what was going on.

""We are going to get rid of this monkey doll. It has a demon in it, not part of any case, just a demonic object. I shot it and it blew up into all these small white sticks. Each stick had a few red stripes, like a barcode. Kinda thought about weaves, you know, like tapestries. I wondered if you took all these sticks and put them together if the red stripes emerged into something, a word or an image."" Detective Winters pointed at the bag.

""It's an ugly toy monkey with chimes."" Dawson examined it from outside the bag, looking in. Its big shiny eyes were staring back at him from between the light reflections on the plastic.

""It can also possess people like in *Denzel Washington*."" Detective Winters said with a convincing tone.¬†

Dawson looked at it again, this time I could see he took it seriously. I found it ironic that the mention of an actor convinced the policeman of the authenticity of our claim. I shrugged, evidently policemen had a code I did not know anything about. If it was just a demon in doll form, oh well. If it is like a movie prop of some kind, that's to be taken seriously. I had no idea what they were talking about.

""Wasn't it called Azazel, or was it Zozo? Or was it Pazuzu?"" Dawson wondered, staring at the monkey.

""Azoza, Pazoza, Llama Pajama, Rama Ramen."" Detective Winters coughed a laugh, mocking the demon's name.

""Do not guess its name, there is no reason to say it."" Cory advised them.

""Azoza."" I picked one for it. I already knew it had a name and had not wanted to know it. I had seen its works. My mind had nearly shattered as it put the backwards sounds and parts of horrible images together; after the demon had made me know all those things it had caused.

""Better not to call it by its true name, with no reason."" Cory reiterated.

""Hello."" Dawson answered his phone. He had to take the call into the break room, away from us.

""Let's go."" Detective Winters took Cory's seeds, sweeping them off the desk into his hand. He then put them into a cellophane box from a cigarette pack that was sitting on his messy desk. ""Here.""

""And that?"" I asked, accepting the seeds for Cory. Detective Winters picked it up and we headed out. We had gotten to his car and driven out before Dawson came running out of the building.

""Where to?"" I wondered.

""Ghanat's place. I can't think of anywhere else that when it is eventually dug up or found somehow, as it will be. If it is there then it will get boxed up with the rest, treated like its hazardous even. We can forget about it."" Detective Winters had inspiration.

I wasn't sure it was a good idea, but I couldn't think of a better one. We stopped for some McDonald's and also at the hardware store. The girl at Ace knew where everything was that Detective Winters asked her for. He bought a bunch of cheap tools and screws and a deadbolt and stuff.¬†

Then we drove all the way up there, to the cabin. We arrived long after sunset. Lake Raiden was too quiet.

Detective Winters got out his flashlight and a spare one for me and we crunched the gravel after he slammed the trunk shut. The cabin was exactly as we had left it. I should have expected that with certainty, as nobody would come to Ghanat's cabin. We took the monkey doll all the way down to Ghanat's secret office and locked it into the safe.

Afterward we pushed all the heavy machinery in the cellar into the tunnel and covered it so it was just a heap of machine parts, boxes and tarps collecting dust in an otherwise hidden cellar corner. Then we installed the deadbolt on the cellardoor.

Starlight shone on the briar rose outside. Something in the forest was watching us. I saw its glowing eyes and its dark shape moving under the bushes. Cory clicked a sound like a suppressed click, or a click that doesn't quite catch. I wasn't sure what it meant in Corvin. I should have:

""Fox."" Cory said in English. I was getting rusty on my Corvin and our hybrid language was hardly used anymore.

""Time to get going."" Detective Winters finished boarding up the front door of the cabin. When he was done he showed me he had police tape also.

""Too much. You are asking for teenagers to come here. Like honey with yellow tape, all year round, till it fades."" I spat.

""I was kidding."" Detective Winters put the police tape away.

As we drove away Cory asked: ""Then why didn't you laugh?""",4,1732817833.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False
1h225sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1h225sr/is_it_ethical_for_a_professor_to_involve/,Is It Ethical for a Professor to Involve Themselves in a Student Dispute?,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm dealing with a really strange and unsettling situation involving a prominent professor at my university. I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed, so I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

I‚Äôm currently in the middle of a personal dispute with my ex-partner, who is also a student. Out of the blue, this professor confronted me and said, ‚ÄúNo hard feelings‚Äîbut I‚Äôm testifying against you. Just wanted to give you a heads-up. Maybe we could grab a coffee sometime‚ÄîI‚Äôm writing a book, so perhaps in a few months.‚Äù Then he walked away. The problem? He couldn‚Äôt have witnessed any of the events he‚Äôs supposedly testifying about, as he wasn‚Äôt there. His involvement felt intimidating, especially since he‚Äôs powerful and influential within the institution.

It didn‚Äôt stop there. He followed up with Facebook messages, claiming he only intended to provide factual testimony and didn‚Äôt want further involvement. Yet his actions raise questions about why he‚Äôs inserted himself into this deeply personal dispute.

What‚Äôs worse is that this professor had been working with me professionally and was in line to be an examiner for my Master's. After this, he completely ghosted me, claiming he‚Äôs ‚Äúunavailable.‚Äù Meanwhile, he‚Äôs been seen visiting my ex‚Äôs house late on Friday evenings (multiple times), and she‚Äôs suddenly receiving unique professional opportunities and networking advantages.

To complicate things further, this professor recently secured a major grant and has significant institutional sway. He‚Äôs also married with a young baby, which makes his late-night visits to a student‚Äôs house even more questionable. Other students have quietly mentioned concerns about him, but they‚Äôre too scared to speak up. I‚Äôve even heard rumors that similar behavior occurred at his previous institution, though nothing formal came of it.

I reported this informally to HR, but they‚Äôve said they can‚Äôt act unless I escalate it to a formal complaint. I‚Äôm hesitant because I‚Äôve already faced so much stress with this dispute and fear professional backlash if I take it further.

Here are my main concerns:

* Is it ethical for a professor to involve themselves in a student dispute when they couldn‚Äôt have witnessed the events in question?
* Should professors be visiting a younger female student‚Äôs house late at night, especially when it seems to coincide with unique opportunities being offered? I don't know if it's all just plain mentorship - but I'd be lying if I didn't think that this seems quite sus.
* Does his involvement in my case, combined with his former role as a potential examiner, create a conflict of interest or bias?

I want to focus on finishing my degree, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore how wrong this all feels. Would escalating this be worth the risk, or should I let it go to avoid more stress?

  
EDIT: ¬†I am American, but I am currently live in the UK doing an exchange year. So this question pertains to a UK professor at a very prominent UK university.

**Context**

I have known my current GF for about two months. We went monogamous/official in Oct. She lives in my apartment complex in a building close by and I met her when I was out for a walk. We both work quite a lot, but given our proximity we have hung out a lot as well. Pretty much any chance we got. Nearly every other day, and most of the day on one of the days of our weekend (assuming I was not on call).

She gave me forewarning recently that a really busy and stressful time in her job is coming. This is a yearly occurrence and she already essentially does the job of three people. What I didn't really realize going into this time is that she would completely shut down, and that I would barely see or talk to her. This busy period will go through Dec. 15, if not the end of the year.

The last time we hung out was the weekend of the 16th. That following Monday she stopped texting the way she had been the entire time I have known her. Taking extended periods to respond. The pet names were gone. The I miss you's were gone. That Wednesday I spoke with her on the phone and I asked if everything was ok. I asked if we were ok. She said that we were but things at work have been so stressful that she has completely shut down and hasn't really wanted to talk to or see anyone.

I explained my anxiety surrounding this because of the shift in her communication and her not wanting to see me. She apologized and explained she didn't want to make me feel that way. I asked if I could see her that night for a little bit and I went over after work. We hugged and we both said we missed each other. I gave her a back rub, and then I let her get back to work. She went back to barely communicating via text. I called her on Thursday and asked if I would be able to see her Friday/over the weekend. She said it depended on how the following day went with work.

I called Friday and it went straight to voicemail. On Saturday morning, I went and got a bunch of stuff for her to help her relax. I bought PJs, fuzzy socks, shower steamers, a new mug and tea, her favorite candy, a gift card to her favorite coffee place, a soft basket to put it in. I included a hoodie of mine that she loves, and wrote a card explaining that I knew how hard this time is for her, and how she is not alone in all this. If she needs someone to listen, or a quiet moment together, I am here for her. I tried calling that day to see if I could leave it for her and it rang once before going to VM.

She texted me on Sunday saying she still feels shut down and that she didn't want to be around people. I told her that I was going to leave something by her door, and that she didn't have to see me or anything. I went and left the basket on her doorstep. I didn't hear from her till the following day to which she reached out by text and thanked me for the basket and card, said it was very sweet. On Tuesday night we had a short text exchange that was more ""normal"" and she checked in with me yesterday afternoon to ask how work has been going for me this week. I couldn't respond till almost 8 pm and I didn't hear back last night.

**Current Situation**

At this point, I am not going to ask to see her. I want to respect her boundaries and the space she needs. Yet, this whole two week period has been driving me crazy. It has highlighted in great detail my anxious attachment and my crazy keeps telling me that she is just drifting away from me. I have missed her so much, and I can't understand how she could still want to be my girlfriend, but also not want to see me at all. I haven't heard her voice, kissed her, been close, in over a week. I could walk to her front door in 3 minutes. She can call me any time.

I have felt similarly many times over the extended period I was single before we got together, and I always push women away. My GF and this relationship are important to me. I want to learn to validate myself instead of needing my GF/relationship to do that. With that said, I miss my GF. I want to see her and I do feel like my needs are going unmet. I also know that relationships are give and take.

**What is your take on this? What is acceptable to ask of her in this situation? How long would you wait to see your significant other if you had to? How long could you give them space before you decided to reach out? If this were to go on for a month and a half I would be really sad and feel a little stuck I think.**

**Thank you for reading and your advice.**",2,1732817604.0,relationship_advice,5,0.75,False
