1mwsh41,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1mwsh41/why_i_considered_selling_my_vandies_and_why_i/,Why I considered selling my Vandies and why I didn't,"Why I considered selling my Vandies:

 

1. Sound characteristics

* ""Slow and dark"" sounding: Some listeners perceive Vandersteen speakers as having a ""slow and dark"" tonality, [according to TONEAudio Magazine](https://www.tonepublications.com/review/vandersteen-1ci-loudspeakers/). This might be due to the time-aligned design and specific crossover slopes employed by Vandersteen. However, it's worth noting that this can also be attributed to improper setup and placement, says TONEAudio Magazine.
* ""Dead and lifeless"" soundstage: Some users, particularly when comparing to other brands like JBL, describe the soundstage as lacking excitement and appearing ""dead"" or ""lifeless,"".
* Narrow sweet spot: Achieving the optimal sound with Vandersteens often requires precise placement and seating within a very specific listening window, [states a user on the Audio Science Review (ASR) Forum](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/vandersteen-3a-sigs-sound-dead-and-lifeless-can-the-shd-save-them.16509/). Moving outside this ""sweet spot"" can lead to a less engaging listening experience.
* Specific tonal balance: While many find the sound natural and balanced, some find them ""midrangey"", or perceive issues like a muted bass response or over-emphasized high frequencies, depending on the model and recording quality. 

2. Technical and design choices

* First-order crossovers: Vandersteen's use of first-order crossovers, which have shallower slopes, leads to overlapping frequencies between drivers, [according to a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAETX0-JLQ0). While some appreciate the phase coherency offered by this design, others argue it can cause unwanted interactions and affect the soundstage and frequency response, leading to what's described as ""comb filtering"" issues in some reviews.
* Demanding setup: Achieving optimal performance with Vandersteen speakers often requires meticulous setup, including precise placement, toe-in angle adjustments, and adequate room space, [notes the Audiogon Forums](https://forum.audiogon.com/discussions/not-thrilled-with-vandersteen-2ce-sigs-where-is-the-first-place-to-wo). Failure to properly set them up can lead to a compromised sound, says a user on the Audiogon Forums.
* Power hungry: Many Vandersteen models are not particularly sensitive and benefit from powerful amplifiers to deliver their full potential, according to the Audio Science Review (ASR) Forum. This can be a drawback for those with lower-powered amplification. 

3. Other factors

* Room size dependency: Some users claim that Vandersteen speakers require a large listening room to sound their best, losing their imaging magic and becoming ""boxy and shouty"" in smaller spaces, [according to a user on the Audiogon Forums](https://forum.audiogon.com/discussions/vandersteen-speakers-are-all-other-speaker-makers-doing-it-wrong). However, others dispute this, citing positive experiences in smaller rooms.
* Older technology vs. modern alternatives: Some audiophiles find that older Vandersteen models, particularly the early Model 2, might not keep pace with the performance of more modern speakers, [says a user on the Audiogon Forums](https://forum.audiogon.com/discussions/vandersteen-forum?sort_order=desc). This is subjective and depends on individual preferences for sound and features. 

It's important to remember

* Subjectivity: Audio preferences are highly personal. What one listener considers a flaw, another might appreciate as a unique sonic characteristic.
* System matching: The overall performance of a speaker is heavily influenced by the accompanying equipment (amplifier, source, cables) and the listening room itself. Poor system matching can easily lead to a negative listening experience, regardless of the speaker's inherent quality.
* Setup is key: As highlighted earlier, proper setup and placement are crucial for Vandersteen speakers to reveal their strengths. 

 

How I made my Model 2Ce sig II's  sound better (to me:)

Removed the large wooden entertainment unit and replaced with a smaller, lighter one.

SMSL PA200 GALLIUM NITRIDE POWER AMPLIFIER (CLASS D) - 85 watts per channel, in PURE POWER AMP mode paired with SMSL DL200

Using DIGITAL Volume control. With this amount of power, the digital volume has a usable range. This way the analog circuity of the pre-amp is bypassed (no longer needed.)

 

I did bi-wire after all, using four 14 AWG wires per speaker wrapped together going to the + and - of the amp.

 

I ended up boosting the tweeter control to +1dB

 

I added a Klipsch S-121SW 12” digital subwoofer. While some controversy exists about the quality of this brand, I find it hard to believe there are actually big differences in the sound quality of bass that low. Also, I found it used for 1/3 of the new price. I put it on bricks to prevent rattling sounds. 

 

I have a new couch, rug, and small oval coffee table too.

Every day, in every way
They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay

Gathered 'round the coffee bay
Listen close to what I'll say
Saw him Friday, looking fine
Dancing close, crossing the line
They whisper low, they whisper high
Catching glances, wondering why
Some folks play, some folks stay
They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay

Betty leans in, ""Girl, you know
Saw him at that fashion show
With a man who looked so sweet
Walking close down Market Street""
Maybe, baby, could it be?
Love's a wild complexity
Hearts don't follow maps we've made
Every color, every shade

They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay
What do you say? What do you say?
Every day, in every way
They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay

""No way, Betty! That can't be true!""
""Honey child, I'm telling you
Saw them laugh and saw them play
That's the tea, that's all I'll say""
Office walls have ears that hear
Spreading whispers, crystal clear
Some folks straight, some folks sway
They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay

But here's the thing we ought to know
Love's a river, watch it flow
Spectrum wide as rainbow light
Every heart deserves its flight
Why we whisper, why we stare?
Everyone's got love to share
Masculine, feminine display
We're all human anyway

I've got secrets, you do too
Feelings complex, nothing new
Brother's proud, he found his way
Sister's strong in every way
Androgynous, beautiful, free
Love's not what it used to be
Black and white has turned to gray
Maybe we're all shades of Ray

They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay
But what's it matter anyway?
Love is love in every way
They say Ray's gay - and that's okay!
They say Ray's gay, they say Ray's gay
Live your truth, come out and play
Every day, in every way
Love wins out, love finds a way

Betty's gossip, Betty's game
But love's no reason for our shame
Every heart will find its day
They say Ray's gay - hooray, hooray!

1mwsera,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwsera,What do you guys think? Suggestions or tips/tricks very welcome.,"I like making things, right now I'm making a reach-extender grabber that my wife can use for heavier items. I cut apart an aluminum step stool and I'm attempting to weld it together the way I want. These are pics of my project. That's my (ahem) ""welder"",  4 lithium ion batteries in series, a length of good quality extension cord, an alligator clip, and a leather stitching needle. Charged, the batteries put out about 17 volts. They have different amperages, the greens are 30 amp and the other two are 15 and 20 I think. That explains why the greens heat up so fast. So far, I can only ""weld"" (I hope no one is offended when I use that term) for a few seconds at a time. The batteries get hot and I don't know how hot they would have to get to catch fire, but I'd rather not find out, so I stop when they start to feel about as hot as fresh coffee. 

I know bits and pieces of metalwork, like needing to protect the molten metal from oxygen in the air. Without a budget of any kind, I've been coating the joint with 1/4 inch of soldering flux, then trying to keep an arc going underneath it for a second. It actually does seem to be working, but wtfdik. The connection is strong, but is it actually welded? Maybe, here and there, but no bead of any kind. I've drilled a passage through my electrode/needle block so that I can run helium from a balloon to protect the arc, and I'm hoping it will be enough to get me a 1/8 inch long bead  each time. 

So, will helium work as a protection, assuming I can keep it at the arc? Maybe I should beg some argon balloons from a local metal worker? 

Any other ideas or suggestions are welcome, please. But I've already been ""Be careful""-ed to death, so don't waste your breath. ",1,1755823541.0,Welding,1,1.0,False

I have no family, no friends, hell even pets. I have no one, nothing, nothing to lose, nothing to hope for. I'm simply surviving not living, I'm breathing but I feel dead. If only feelings had an off-switch. If only I can block out the hurtful words, the thoughts, the feelings. I try to tell myself that its not true, all the words,all the pain, that its a chapter and it will pass. But I guess that's a lie, I have been lying to myself. This chapter is not passing, all my life I have been in the same chapter, over and over again, my life is a repeating record, everyday is the same. But, I learned to block it out, to numb the pain away. Now, now numbness is all I ever feel. It helps with the words, thoughts, feelings and everything. I learned something when I was 9 years old. I would always cry when my parents would start hitting me, but I realized something, that if I cry or mope around nothing would change, nothing. The kicking, punching, slapping, whipping and degrading wouldn't stop nor will it ever stop. They love when I cry, when I beg, but nothing ever works it comes in an ear and out the other, I haven't cried since I was 10 years old . Crying won't solve my problems, it wont do anything. So I just stopped, I bottle everything up. I don't burden anyone with my problems or what goes on at home. I know they wont do anything, they will pity me, and if their is one thing I hate most in life that its pity. I don't want people to pity me, I don't need anything from anyone. There is God, God gives me faith, hope, love, everything. I know he will help me. He kept me going till now for a reason. I always wanted one thing as a little little girl . I wanted them to love me. I wanted them protect me and care for me. I wanted her help me with my hair, clothes or simply advice me in life. I wanted him to call me his little princess, to chase away boys, to protect me from bullies. But we don't get everything we want. Because it turned out they became my biggest bullies, I needed protection from them. They became the monsters from under the bed that you need protection from. They ruined me. He ruined me, she ruined me. Both of them broke me, shatterd me, broke me into a million pieces that can't be put together. I always wondered what I did wrong, what I did for them to hate me, to harm me, to despise me that much. But I always came up with nothing. I was a kid who could barely stand, so I never came up with an answer. Its currently 4:00 in the morning and I need to go make my stepfather breakfast and clean the house or else I will get my daily dosage of love (note the sarcasm). With that thought in mind I got up and streched my sore muscles, Obviously that was a mistake as I bent over in pain. Yesterday I came 10mins late from work and he whipped my back and dislocated my knee. I don't even know how I'm walking right now but I guess you could say I'm used to it, the pain. I walked to my room which is basiclly the attic. My room consists of a really thin mattress, a thin blanket, no pillow, and a chair in the corner of the room where I keep my stuff. I went to the broken mirror in the bathroom and lifted my shirt just over my ribs. My stomach has burn marks, open flesh, and bruises. My stomach is a mixture of black, blue, purple, yellow, and green. One thing I hate when looking at my stomach is the word my mom (if you can even call her that) carved there. The word ""whore"" is carved in the middle of my stomach. She carved it with a small pocket knife when I came late from school for doing a project with a boy. I don't even know how she found out. I don't dwell on the thought anymore and start dressing my wounds and sanitizing the cuts with rubbing alcohol and white, big antiseptic bandages. After that I put on my clothes. I make sure to cover the bruises on my face and hands with foundation. Don't want anybody knowing. After I finished stood and looked at myself in the mirror. My green-blue eyes hold no life, they are dull, lifeless, no shine in them whatsoever. They used to be so bright, full of life and happiness but now they are dead, nothing in them, they look so empty . My face is too thin and pale from the little food and dehydration, My clothes are too big and baggy because i'm too thin. Overall I'm not the most appealing to look at. When I finish I make my way downstairs to start on breakfast. I make my way to the kitchen and open the fridge and take the ingredients out. I make four pieces of toasted toast, two with fried eggs and the other two with strawberry jam with half an avocado on the side. I put the plate on the table and open the fridge to take out a beer. The second I put the bottle down I hear loud booming footsteps alerting me he's coming.

Book #01:Chapter 2 I stand in the corner in the kitchen and keep my head down . Its one of rules I have to follow or else I get punished. He makes his way inside and sits on the stool and starts eating. Next thing I know a fist is being thrown in my face. He punches me in the face and I feel the familiar taste of metal in my mouth. He busted my lip when it just healed. Another punch is thrown and he says ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT YOU FUCKING WHORE???"" ""T-toast s-sir."" I stutter looking at the floor, another rule is that I call him sir and never make eye contact, he considers it disrespectful. It looks like he didn't like that answer as he threw me on the floor and started kicking my stomach. This went one for 1hour and when he finally had finished I could barely keep my eyes open. ""That's what you get you filthy bitch."" He spat, I saw him through blurry vision pick up his car keys and leave slamming the door on his way. Slowly I stand up with the support of the wall and make my way to my room. I open the door and go inside, I reapply my foundation to cover the new bruises. I then eat small granola bar from the kitchen and take two painkillers for my ribs because he broke three I think. I then make my way outside to leave for work. I close the door and lock it behind me. I work as a waitress in this really cute popular cafe that's 30 mins away. I have been working there for 2years and the owners are really sweet and treat me as their own. Once I reach the cafe I open the door and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fills my nose. I bid Nancy and David the owners good morning and move to put my stuff away. I hear the bell above the door jingle indicating someone came. I put my apron and take my small notebook and pen and headÂ outside to start working. Let the day begin. Rebecca'S POV Its now been a couple hours and I'm so tired. My legs feel like they're about to give out any second. I finish the last table and go lean on the counter. I sigh and close my eyes for minute. Then Nancy comes up to me, ""Darling you look tired, why don't you get your stuff and go home and rest?"" She suggested with a soft smile. ""But Nancy their is still a couple people left. "" I said, trying to convince her to let me stay, but she wasn't having it. ""Its okay hun I'll take care of it and anyways your shift ended hours ago, you always stay overtime, you need rest my sweet girl."" She said. ""Are you sure?Â You know I don't mind staying I love working here."" I asked to make sure. ""Yes honey its okay now go get your stuff, its getting late I don't you walking late at night."" She replied. I nodded my head and went to get my bag and put my work stuff away. I said goodnight to Nancy and David and started my way to hell. As I was walking, I had a feeling like something happened. I don't know what it is but I had a feeling like something big is going to happen and soon. Too lost in my thoughts I didn't notice the bright blue and red lights and the police cars outside my home. I felt my heart start beating faster with each second. Why is the police here? Oh god what if Boris did something and they are going to take me instead? With all those thoughts I didn't notice a police officer walking towards me. ""Excuse me, Are you Rebecca Anderson?"" Asked the officer. ""Yes sir, is everything okay?"" I asked, concern clear in my voice. ""I'm sorry, honey but your stepfather had an overdose and sadly he didn't make it."" He said, pity in his eyes and voice. I felt my heart stop. Boris is dead. He's finally dead. He can't hurt me anymore. I'm free from his claws. I never thought that he would die before me, I always thought that maybe he would go too far someday and kill me for good. My dream has come true. But then suddenly, a thought came to mind. Where will I go? I don't have a father, my mother always told me that when he found out she's pregnant he told her that he didn't want me and left. I have no aunts, uncles, grandparents that I know about. I have heard about the foster system and I don't wanna go from one bad house to another. ""But where will I go? I don't have anyone that can take me in."" I said, fear gripping my heart and chest. ""We will take you to the station to get a blood sample and see if you have any relatives that would like to take you in. If not then you will be placed in an orphanage or the foster system. For now why don't you go pack your stuff and then we will go ok?"" He suggested, sympathy clear in his voice. I nodded and went to the house to get my stuff. I didn't have a lot of stuff so it didn't take me long to pack them up. I had two shirts, two sweatshirts, one pair of sweatpants, one pair of leggings and a pair of underwear and a bra. I put them in my backpack and took out the money I have been saving all my life. I counted them and they turned out to be 1,500 dollars. I put them in my bag and looked at the room one last time. The thought of leaving sounds so surreal, It feels too good to be true.

Book #01:Chapter 3 I looked at the room one last time and went downstairs. When I reached down I went to the officer that I talked with before and told him I was ready. We got inside the car and started driving towards the station. Once we reached we parked and went inside. He told me to sit down and wait for him to come back. Once he came back he took my blood and told me the results will be back in an hour. It was 8:30 by now and I was exhausted. So I closed my eyes and I felt myself drift off. ONE HOUR LATER I felt someone shaking me from my shoulder and I immediately shot up thinking it was Boris. But once I saw the officer I relaxed. But he had a wide grin on his face which confused me. But what he said next confused me even more. ""Well I have some good news for you, we found someone that would love to take you in."" He said with a wide smile. "" Who?"" I asked curiously. ""Your father and older brothers."" He replied. I stood there frozen. I couldn't hear anything else he was saying. 'Father', that word kept repeating in my head over and over again. Why would he want me now? Why? He could have saved me years of pain and anguish and now he wants me? I couldn't believe this. My ears kept ringing, my heart kept beating out of my chest. I didn't notice the officer calling my name until he started shaking my shoulder. I flinched and stepped away from him with wide eyes and mouth hanging open. ""F-father?"" I whispered, still in shock about what I was just told. ""Yes father, isn't that great? Well how about you rest for a while, it'll be a couple hours till he arrives since he's coming from New York."" He explained. I nodded, I couldn't form any words, nothing could come out of my mouth. Its like my tongue was tied, 'Father' I have a father and he said I have brothers. How many brothers do I have? Will they like me? What if they hate me? What if they never wanted a sister? Oh god what if they hurt me? I could barely keep up with Boris and now a father and brothers. I couldn't think anymore as I could feel a headache starting. I rubbed my temples and took two painkillers. My body hurts so much and with this new information. I rested my head against the wall and thought about something, will this be my new start with my new family or will it be my new hell? With that I drifted off. Arthur'S POV I'm sitting in my office signing papers for the company and looking at a few designs for my next opening club.Â Sighing and taking a small sip of the rich alcoholic flavor I lean my head back on my leather brown chair trying to ease the headache that's forming. I suddenly get a call from an unknown number. I usually never answer but my gut was telling me to and my gut is always right. So I picked up the phone and answered. ""Hello""I said coldly. ""I-is t-this Mr Arthur Jackson?"" The person on the other line stuttered. Since I'm in the mafia I'm always cold and rude except with my family. ""Yes, now who are you and what do you want?"" He's wasting my time I need to finish work so I can be on time for dinner with my sons. ""Sir this is Texas Police Station we have your daughter here, her DNA matched with yours and she doesn't have a guardian, her stepfather just died. Would you like to take her in? If not she will be placed in an orphanage."" The officer said making my hand freeze midair from where I was signing. What the fuck is he talking about? I don't have a daughter, I mean, I have always wanted a daughter but me and my ex-wife didn't have one. And I never slept with another woman. ""Listen you have the wrong number I don't have a daughter."" I answered rudely. I was starting to get annoyed they can't even dial a number correctly. ""Sir your ex- wifes name was Margaret Michael right?""Asked the officer. What does that bitch have to do with anything? She could be dead for I care.""Yes why ?"" I asked getting really confused.""And she left you and your sons and ran away right?"" By now I was really starting to get mad. What the fuck does he think this is?A guessing game? ""Yes now spit it out I'm fucking busy "" ""Sir your wife changed her name and she was pregnant when she ran away."" He replied. I sat their frozen. No this can' be possible, she wouldn't just take my child away from me, this is impossible. Fuck I can't even think clearly. I must have been quite for too long because the officer spoke again. ""Sir are you still there ?""I cleared my throat and replied ""Yes I am can you send a photo of her and what's her name?"" I spoke calmly after taking a few deep breaths.""Yes sir I will send a photo and her name is Rebecca Alessandra Anderson."" Said the officer. ""So would you like to take her in? "" Asked the officer. ""Yes I will take her in I will be there in a few hours since i'm coming from New York. "" I replied, feeling my throat clog up. ""Ok sir I will get the papers ready for when you come."" I hung up and put my phone on the table.

Book #01:Chapter 4 I couldn't believe this, a daughter, my daughter, I have a daughter. FUCK,that bitch, how could she? How could she keep my daughter away from me, my principessa, my babygirl. I missed 17years of her life from that bitch. I could never forgive myself. I felt something wet on my cheek. I raised my hand and wiped my cheek, I didn't even realize I was crying. I haven't cried in 30 years. I threw my phone across the room in frustration and watched it as it smashed in a thousand pieces. But that wasn't enough I called my pilot from my other phone after hanging up with the officer. "" Get the jet ready we're going to Texas."" I said as soon as he answered. ""Yes sir."" After that I couldn't control my anger anymore. I sent a message to my 2nd oldest ""Get a duffle bag ready we're going to Texas."" Their was an instant reply ""Yes dad."" good.I still need to take my anger out on something. I threw my glass coffee table across the room and watched as it broke in a million pieces. I kept throwing everything in my office. I didn't keep a single thing. At the end my office was trashed with glass everywhere and papers on the floor. I took a deep breath and thought of how I'm going to tell my sons. I know one thing and that they're going to be happy. All of my sons wanted a baby sister ever since they were young. And now that they have a baby sister they're going to be over the moon. I took a long deep breath and pressed the speaker that is connected in the whole house so no matter where they are they can still here ""FAMILY MEETING NOW DON'T BE FUCKING LATE."" Let's see how it goes. While I was walking down the stairs, I felt my phone vibrate in my black trousers. I paused my steps and unlocked my phone and opened the e-mail sent from the officer. Once I opened it and saw the picture I stood there frozen in my spot. There was a beautiful girl that looked to be in her teenage years. She had blue- greenish eyes that looked absolutely fetching. Her light brunette hair looked so soft and silky and they were a little past her shoulders. Her face had had nothing on it, not even an acne scar. Her eyebrows were arched and she had a cute button nose. In that moment all my doubts vanished. I now know that this girl is absolutely my daughter. She looks just Constant. Heck they could be twins if not for the obvious age difference. Though, as I looked at the picture more closely I noticed that she looks a bit too skinny and pale. I immediately started thinking the worst. Was she not fed properly? Didn't they have enough money to buy food? Is she sick? Does she have small appetite? Was she being starved? I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and continued walking down the stairs and passed the kitchen until I reached the living room where I could hear my sons bickering and yelling. I took a breath and opened the living room doors, immediately all the yelling and shouting stopped as soon I stepped in the room. You see, the very first thing I taught my sons is respect. Respect is very important in general but more important in the underworld. People need to respect you in order for you to be powerful and strong. Although my sons and I are extremely close they make sure to never disrespect me or their elders, their is always boundaries. But if a person hurts their family, then it doesn't matter if they are old or young. Family should always come first no matter what and I made sure to engrave that into their minds 'prima la familia.' Is our motto and we will always live by it till we take our last breaths. I enter the living room and look around to make sure that all my sons are here. And sure enough, they are all here. Everyone has confused faces on expect Constant and Eamonn who are looking at me emotionlessly but I could see the curiosity swimming in their eyes. ""What do you wanna talk about dad?"" Grumbled Kenny, who looked like he just woke up from a very good nap. ""I got a very intriguing call today. "" I started, but got cut off by Eamonn ""What call?"" I shot him a glare and saw him shiver and he muttered a small 'sorry.' I was too happy to care about being mad at him right now. ""Don't interrupt me boy.""I said and he averted his eyes away from me in shame. ""What was the call about dad?"" Asked Geraint calmly and respectfully. ""Well boys I got a call from Texas police station and he informed me that Margaret died 3 years ago.""Â I Informed calmly and waited for them to absorb the new information.I looked at my sons and saw that they had disgusted looks on their faces. The boys never really liked their mother. She never treated them well and never took of them and their necessities. ""That witch was never and will never be our mother."" Spat Enoch. And a chorus of ' yeses' and nods of approval were thrown his way. ""What does that have to do with us dad ?""Asked Hawke. ""It turns out when she ran away she got remarried, and he died a couple hours ago from an overdose "" I said. Once I got nods to continue I continued ""And I need to go to the station because there's a special someone waiting for me."" Ismiled wildly at them. All of them looked at me weirdly because I rarely smile. Maybe a sadistic smile but that doesn't count. ""Who is the special someone?"" Asked Kent.

Book #01:Chapter 5 ""My daughter"" I smiled wildly as I thought of my little princess and how she's going to be in my arms soon. The mafia princess is coming home. My thoughts of my babygirl were soon cut off by all of them asking, more like yelling ""WHAT?!!!"" Shouted all of them. ""Let me explain "" they nodded and I soon continued, ""Turns out when Margaret ran away she was pregnant and she didn't tell me and when I tried finding her, looks like she changed her name and ran away so I could't find her, trust me when I got that call I was as shocked as you, and when the officer told me she matched my DNA I was so happy, I always wanted a daughter and you guys always wanted a little sister, so that's it."" I finished and I looked at them all. I saw different emotions, Constant looked emotionless but I could still see the happiness and contentment in his eyes, Geraint, Frankie, and Hawke all had small smiles on their faces and tears of joy in their eyes. Eamonn looked mad, which I couldn't understand why , Eamonn has anger issues and could barely control it sometimes. I made a mental note to ask him why he's mad later. Enoch was jumping around cheering and hugging his brothers. Kenny and Kent were already making plans of what they can do, where they can go, and more stuff. And lastly, my youngest son, Isaac, he was sitting on the couch and had a small smile resting on his face. When he thought no one was looking, I saw him take off his glasses and wipe them from tears that dropped on them. He, then proceeded to wipe the tears in his eyes. ""WE FINALLY HAVE A BABY SISTER !!!!!"" Yelled Enoch making us all laugh ""YESSSSS FINALLY WER'RE NOT THE YOUNGEST ANYMORE!!!"" Yelled Kenny and Kent making us chuckle softly at their silly antics. ""Technically you're not the youngest, Lester is, aren't you baby bro?"" Smiled Frankie ruffling Isaac's brunette hair. Lester only huffed in amusement and fixed his hair back to how it was. ""Wait do you have a picture of her? We wanna see her ""Asked Hawke, all the others nodded in agreement. I nodded my head and fished out my phone out of my pocket and looked up my babygirl's cute face. I motioned for them to come closer, and I gave Constant my phone and immediately the all of them surrounded him to take a look. All I heard were gasps in the big modern living room. All of them were staring the phone intensely And a few sniffs were heard indicating some of them are crying. ""She's so pretty. "" Mumbled Geraint. ""She's soooo cute Ahhhh!!!"" Gushed Enoch. ""She's so adorable"" Smiled softly Frankie as he looked at his sister's photo. ""She's so precious."" Whispered Hawke, Kenny and Kent nodded their heads, agreeing. Eamonn just stood there frozen looking at the photo in amazement. ""She looks just like Constant"" Whispered Lester. Everyone gasped and looked at him with wide eyes and mouthes open. Lester rarely talks, he only talks with his twins, he's just quite, he likes to observe more. So we were surprised when he spoke now. He glared at them and they all looked away from him. Constant still hasn't looked away from the phone yet. Its like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He then spoke in the most serious and coldest voice, ""No boy will ever come near my baby sister."" Getting a 'Fuck yeah' from the rest of his brothers as their eyes filled with determination - a sort of promise that no one will ever think about breaking their baby sister's heart or think about hurting her. I had messaged Geraint earlier to pack a small bag. So, when I got a message from the pilot telling me that the plane was ready. I told them that its time to go. Kent started throwing a fit about how he wanted to go get his sister himself but one look from Constant was enough to make him quite as he started muttering about how we were being 'unfair and mean' I just shook my head at him softly. That boy never fails to amaze me with his goofiness and energy. I looked at Constant and nodded at him, me telling him to take care of younger brothers till I come back and him nodding at me back at me and silently telling me to bring his baby sister home. I looked at Geraint and told him that we need to leave he nodded and made his way to the waiting car outside. I looked around one last time and left making my to the car. I got in and soon we were on our way to the airport. We reached 20 mins later and went on the plane. We buckled up and soon enough we were in the air and on our way to my princess. With that thought in mind I drifted off with my daughter on my mind. Arthur'S POV We're now outside the police station and now that we're here it feels more real than before.The fact that I have a daughter becomes more real and I couldn't help but feel nervous. What if she doesn't like me? What if she tells me she doesn't want to be with us? I couldn't help but the nervousness that settled in me. I took a deep breath and looked at the building that has my daughter and the fact that shes waiting for me to come and take her home. I looked at Geraint one last time and nodded at him, He nodded back, and with that we went inside.

Book #01:Chapter 6 We took powerful strides inside. We had our blank faces on and immediately the once noisy station was now dead silent. You could hear a pin drop from how silent it is. We were greeted by a young officer who looked to be in his early twenties. Once he looked at us, recognition flashed through his eyes and his breathing quickened. Its not everyday you have a mafia don in a police station.Then, He led us to small office that seemed more small with me and Geraint in it due to our muscular and extremely builds. He led us to another young officer that explained the details and papers so that I can take Rebecca's guardianship. I signed all necessary papers, and I now have all guardianship over my daughter. Once everything was finalized he told me that Rebecca's sleeping in the other room and then proceeded to go and wake her up. He then came back with Rebecca behind him and it looks like she didn't notice us it. She was staring at the floor and it looks like she was deep in thought with how she has a small cute frown on her face and a small pout on her lips, which might I add, looks absolutely adorable. The officer then called her name and that we've arrived, she looked up and immediately her blue-green eyes made contact with Geraint's blue ones. I watched as he looked at her softly and how he had tears in his eyes. I looked at my princepissa and went towards her. Rebecca'S POV My father is here. He's really here, I'm so nervous. What if he doesn't like? What if he hurts me like they did? What if he sends me to another orphanage once we reach New York? My thoughts were soon cut off by a pair of strong muscly arms wrapping around me and my nostrils were filled by a manly cologne that smells and screams rich. Once I came back to my senses and realized I was trapped, I felt my body tense and I stood there frozen. But a couple seconds later my body relaxed and I melted into that persons embrace. I don't know why but I felt safe in that persons arms, like nothingÂ in the world will hurt me. I have never felt like this before. I wrapped my skinny and bony arms around the man and my body relaxed.Â A few minutes later we both let go, I looked up to see who that unknown man was. I saw a tall man that looked old and young at the same time . He looked like he's 5o years old. He had a light dark stubble, he had brunette hair that looked exactly like mine, It was gelled back and not a hair was out of place, his eyebrows were plucked and arched perfectly, the kind were that it made women envy their eyebrows. He had small wrinkles around his eyes that you would't notice unless you were looking really closely. His jawline looked sharp and defined. And he was extremely muscular and the Armani suit looked like it would tear any second at any sudden movements. And he's tall, my guess is that he's 6'8. He could crush me with his pinky. I would have to look up at him and crane my neck up. Ughhh he looks like he could eat me with my 5'2 height. He then spoke, ""Hi principessa I'm your father, Arthur Jackson."" He spoke softly as if he would speak any louder I would break. ""Hi its nice to meet you."" I spoke smiling shyly but never making eye contact with him, just looking at the collar of his Armani shirt. I don't wanna make him mad when I don't know his intentions yet.He seems confused as to why I'm not looking him in the eye but chooses not to comment on it which makes me sigh a sigh of relief. He then spoke again ""It's nice to meet you too princess, I'm sorry I didn't know about you earlier."" He said softly. But what does he mean he didn't know about me? I didn't have time to linger on the thought because he spoke again.""I want to introduce you to someone princess,"" He then gestured to the other man that looks like him and seems to be 6'6 in height ""Princess this is your second oldest brother, introduce your self son."" He said, nodding his head. ""Hi bambina, I'm Geraint its so good to finally meet you."" spoke Geraint softly and then he brought his arms out. Out of instinct I flinched lightly which didn't look like it went unnoticed by them but thankfully they didn't comment on it. He then proceeded to hug me and I immediately responded to the hug. I felt so safe in their arms, like nothing could hurt me. I felt something wet on my shoulder I looked and saw Geraint crying, I pulled away and brought his face closer to me. I wiped his tears with the pads of my thumbs,he then brought his hands and putÂ them on top of mine and kissed the palms of my hands. I then whispered softly ""Why are you crying ?"" He wrapped his arms around my waist and brought me in another hug. I bit my lip to stop myself from screaming in pain. He kept hugging me tightly and buried his face in my neck. He then whispered ""I'm so happy to have you in my life sorella."" I was happy that someone would actually care for me. Maybe I can have a new start. I understood what he meant because i'm fluent in a lot of languages.

Book #01:Chapter 7 After couple of minutes he let go and wiped his tears. Then my 'father' asked ""Are you ready to go sweetheart?"" I replied ""Yes I am."" but then Geraint asked, ""Where's your stuff bambina?"" I pointed to my backpack and said ""This is all i have."" I whispered looking at the floor. I saw Arthur and Geraint sharing a look. Its like they're communicating through their eyes. Then Arthur finally said, ""Its okay darling, lets get going now."" He told me with a small smile on his face and I couldn't help but give him one back. We made our way out of the police station and into beautiful car. I stood there gawking at the metal of hunk. ""You like it?"" Asked Geraint with a soft chuckle. ""Are you kidding me?! I love cars!!"" I replied happily. Then Arthur said, ""Looks like we have another Eamonn."" he said with a small laugh. Wait who's Eamonn? They both looked at my confused face and then Arthur told me, ""Don't worry you will meet him later."" I just nodded my head and soon enough we were on our way to the airport. Instead of driving in the normal route Geraint went towards the private planes one. I sat there confused until we reached a matte black plane. Geraint stopped and came and opened my door. I thanked him shyly and he just gave me a small smile. I then turned to Arthur and asked him, ""Why are we here aren't we supposed to go that way?"" I questioned him and pointed to the normal route. He laughed softly and said, ""No baby we have a private plane."" I stood there looking like a fish out of water opening and closing my mouth trying to say something. He come and raised his hand and I out of instinct flinched. His hand stopped midway and he looked at me in concern and confusion. I gave him a tight lipped smile and he gave a soft one back. ""Come on guys lets get going."" Said Geraint. Thank god he came andÂ saved the tense silence. I noticed there were a lot of guards but I kept my mouth shut. We soon boardedÂ the plane and were on our way to New York. I hope this is a fresh start for me. Because if it isn't, I don't know what I'll do and what will happen. Rebecca'S POV Once we were in the air, I looked around and everything looked expensive. From the floor, to the seats, to the ceiling, everything screamed 'rich' and I couldn't help but gawk at everything. Everything was so shiny I was afraid to touch anything. ""Do you like it princess?"" Asked Arthur. ""Yeah it's really pretty."" I said. I looked outside the window and watched the white fluffy clouds. I started thinking of how my life changed so fast. I must have been too lost in my thoughts because I felt someone put their hand on top of mine. I immediately pulled away and looked up and saw Arthur and Geraint looking at me in shock, confusion and concern. ""What was that princess?"" asked Arthur. I looked at Geraint and saw he was waiting for me to answer. I never liked physical contact especially when its not initiated by me. That basically happens when you were getting beaten everyday by your mom and stepdad. I can never be able to tell them what happened to me. They won't want me anymore and they will throw out. I mean, who wants a damaged and abused girl as a daughter and sister? Once they know they will be disgusted and hate me and then they will throw me into an orphanage. I flinched when a hand was being waved in front of my face. I looked wide-eyed at the person who was waving the hand and saw that it was Geraint. ""Are you okay baby?"" He asked in a tone that sounded like .... worry? But why would he be worried? He just met me like .... an hour ago. But when I looked into his eyes trying to detect that his tone of worry was a lie, I couldn't see anything but honesty and panic. ""Yeah I am I just don't like physical contact."" I muttered hoping they would believe me. It didn't look like they did but they didn't say anything which I'm glad for. He leaned forward and grabbed my soft, small hand in his big and rough one and gave it a small reassuring squeeze. ""You must be confused, you can ask us anything you want okay?"" He said softly like he didn't want to scare me. ""So .... umm did you eat lots of vegetables when you were a kid?"" I asked but almost immediately my eyes went wide about what I said. I looked at both of them and saw that both of were trying to hold their laughter in. It didn't last long as both of them burst out laughing, clutching their stomachs as tears fell from their eyes. I just pouted at them and waited for them to be finished with their laughing session. After they calmed down, Geraint said, ""Oh My God I haven't had such a good laugh in such a long time.""Â he laughed again ""But, to answer your question, I did eat a lot of vegetables, dad even would force us to or he'd take our toys."" I sighed sadly for my poor self and short height and my malnourished body.

Book #01:Chapter 8 ""So like what do you for work?"" I asked trying to change the subject. As I asked this question I noticed both of them tensed and looked at each other, like their communicating with their eyes. After a couple mins with an awkward silence Arthur cleared his throat and looked at me and said, ""Well darling we own a chain of clubs, restaurant's, hotels and the largest companies in the world."" Ok I must admit thats cool, I mean I knew the moment they told me they owned a private jet that they were loaded. But that just proves my point even more.""Thats nice, you must be proud of your achievements"" I said shyly, I mean who wouldn't be proud of things like that. He smiled wildly at me and then kissed the top of my hand that he was holding before. I went to ask another question but I was cut by a yawn that had my eyes watering. Dad chucked softly and said, ""Why don't you get some sleep and we'll wake you up when we land hmm?"" I nodded my and soon he led me to a private room. I was too tired to admire the extravagant room and went and lied down on the bed. He left after kissing my forehead and tucking me in. As soon as my head hit the pillow I was out like a light. TIME SKIP I got woken up by Geraint telling me we are about to land. We went outside and sat down and I looked up and saw dad smiling at me and I smiled back. Once we have arrived we thanked the pilot and went down the stairs. We walked and soon came to a stop in front of a 'Blazer' which was in a matte black color. Geraint opened the back door for me and I muttered a small 'thank you' with a blush. No one has ever done that for me before m. He smiled softly and went to the other side of the car and went beside me in the backseat, as dad sat in the passengers seat besides the driver. ""Are you hungry sweetheart? You haven't had anything since we left the station"" Asked Arthur. ""No I'm not hungry at the moment...thank you though."" Its true though I wasn't hungry. Boris never really fed me saying how I wasn't 'worthy of food'. I can go for weeks without food. I have a small stomach anyway due to being starved. Even if I was hungry I was used to it and would never tell them if I was. I don't want them to be mad at me when we just met. ""We'll eat when we get home."" Geraint said smiling wildly. I smiled back and continued looking out the window. But then a thought came to my mind, What if they aren't as welcoming as dad and Geraint? What if they don't like me? What if - My thoughts were cut off by a hand on top of mine. I looked at the hand and looked up at Geraint ""You'll be fine, they're gonna love you."" He said and gave me small soft smile. I smiled back at him and felt myself relax a little. Soon we came up to a black gate and stopped, the driver pulled down the window and started tying a password on the keypad that was attached to the wall. Once he finished we continued driving and we then came to a stop where there was a big mansion that looked absolutely beautiful and magnificent. There were a couple of expensive looking cars that were parked outside and then Geraint opened the door and gave me his hand and helped me down considering my short height. Once I got out I took a really good look at the mansion, more like castle. 'There more loaded than i thought'. As I continued gawking at the house in front of me with wide eyes and my mouth open. I heard someone chuckle behind me ""Do you like it?"" Arthur asked. ""Its really beautiful."" I whispered still looking in amazement. I never saw a house so pretty, well except on Pinterest, which doesn't count. ""Well come on let's go inside the others are dying to meet you."" said Geraint. Once we were inside Dad suddenly yelled ""BOYS COME DOWNSTAIRS NOW"". I flinched from his loud voice which scared me, as it gives me flashbacks of when Boris would yell at me and start to hurt me. I didn't notice when Geraint came and stood next to me and asked ""Are you okay bambina?""I was shaking I couldn't breath properly, it felt like I was drowning.He then came and put his hands on my shoulders and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from hissing in pain. ""Rebecca are you ok?"" Asked Geraint again worriedly. I looked at him through my lashes and nodded my head. ""Yes I-I'm fine"" I gave him a weak smile and cleared my throat to get rid of the lump that formed in my throat. He didn't seem to believe me but thankfully didn't comment on it. Just then we heard loud footsteps, like a herd of elephants running. Then 8 boys, more like men came in the entrance and stood there frozen. They were all extremely tall and well built. Though, all of them looked similar to each other. I'm guessing they're all siblings. But who are they? Dad mentioned brothers but its not possible that all of them are my brothers, right?",5,1755823157.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Photo 4: Insides (got a little squished, they are hollow)

This is my first time making macaron’s again in ~5 years and I’m trying to troubleshoot my issues. The first batch I made was on the bottom rack and there was some cracking, hollow shells, and short feet. The second batch I did the same rack, but had let it set out more, however, I got similar results. The third batch I moved to the top rack but the shells are still hollow with short feet, less cracked however. This is the recipe I followed 

70 g almond flour

90 g powdered sugar

70 g egg whites

70 g granulated sugar

Yes I measured the ingredients by weight, started whipping the egg whites before adding sugar slowly, used a food processor to grind the flour and powdered sugar together, as well as a fine mesh sieve afterwards. I made one change and that was adding 1 packet of instant espresso mix as these were intended to be coffee flavored with a coffee ganache. It retains the coffee flavor well but I don’t know if it affected the batter. When mixing I got the figure 8 and “lava” effect, though I may have undermixed it. I’m afraid there was too much large granules of flour left which were not included and affected it as well.

So, I had this huge crush on a girl in my college class. We weren’t super close, but we’d talked a few times, and in my head, that meant I needed to plan some grand, movie-worthy gesture. (Spoiler: I should’ve just asked her out for coffee.)

Anyway, she mentioned once that she liked sunflowers. Easy enough, right? But instead of just buying some, my overconfident brain decided: “No, no. I’ll *pick* them myself. Way more romantic.”

Fast-forward to me sneaking onto this random field near campus that I *thought* was just wildflowers. I’m out there with a grocery bag, sweating like crazy, cutting these things down with a dull pair of kitchen scissors. I looked like the least graceful florist in history.

Here’s where it all went wrong: turns out, they weren’t sunflowers. There was another plant that I’m wildly allergic to. By the time I brought them back to my dorm, my arms were covered in hives, and my face was starting to puff up like I’d lost a boxing match.

So instead of giving her flowers, I ended up giving her a very awkward explanation from a hospital bed while my roommate tried (and failed) not to laugh.

The girl was nice about it, but yeah… safe to say the romance angle kind of died after she had to hand me tissues in the ER waiting room.

The lesson? Just buy the damn flowers.

I cannot hold these incidents in any longer. 

My Mother had a terrible relationship towards me and I know that I am not the only young man that has to deal with situations like this so I've decided to post about these moments.

I know I am not the only man that has been made to suffer these situations and I speak my truth for myself and for those that may not feel able to do that for themselves.

To put it plainly- My Mother was head over heals in love with me. She wanted to have a romantic relationship, she wanted to have incest relations, her needs and wants were prioritized in our home above all others.

She denied me boundaries, privacy, locking of doors while bathing. Both herself and my father would throw coffee mugs at my face for merely closing the bathroom door while I used the facilities. I ""wanted to be away from them"".

Any movie that was not Disney or Veggietales until I left at age 19 would warrant such a response:

""I'm not comfortable with you watching this. I didn't say you could watch this."" 

Mom would swat down any form of me trying to take an identity or assert myself. My job as a human was to ""make her happy"". 

I was startled awake one night when I was 12 to my ......... being rubbed from over the covers. In the split second it takes to register when awakened I realized I was in bed, it was dark, my Mom was sitting on the side of my bed and smiling at me. 

I turned to my right side  and into the fetal position, balling up as much covers as I could to hide my privates away from her. 

She stood up from my bed and screamed at me ""I thought you'd like that!!"".

""Go away!!"" I wept into my pillow.

After this night she came in my bedroom late at night and wreaking of alcohol many more times. I taught myself to sleep on my stomach so that in case a boy was to get excited at night that he wouldn't have to fear awaking to his mother arousing him. This helped but little. This woman would grope my glutes, draw her nails on my skin while I slept. 

I was started awake once again to this woman attempting to stick one of her fingers in a private place of mine. 

I screamed ""GET OFF ME!!"" and she laughed. 

""Oh, You love your Mother."" 

I kicked her so hard that she fell off my bed and bruised her butt or tailbone, I'm not quite sure which and I don't care. She was in discomfort for something like 12-14 days after the incident. She played it off citing that she fell off my bed because she came in to check on me and I ""kicked her in my sleep"". Her take on spinning the narrative was by telling people she was a loving mother in the midst of caring for her son checking on him while he slept and she was harmed just trying to do a good deed. 

One of her Co-workers said in my attendance

 ""Vicki, he's 14? What are you doing in his bedroom at night? (jokingly) Stay outta my bedroom ma! Sheesh!"".

Oh yea, if your wondering why I said co-worker- she randomly kept me home from school to take me with her to work. Why? Her reason was to ""show me off"". She made me go to work with her several times in the 2 weeks it took her butt to heal. She tried to guilt me for her injury.

  
I have many many more happenings from this woman and I am not holding them in any longer. I will be posting many parts after this. I want people to know the monster this woman  and my father really are. I have held this in for years thinking that speaking truth would somehow be shameful to me and make people look at me differently. But even if that is true I cannot carry this cross any longer.

I've been on RAOC and some other related mail-ish subreddits for a while, so I thought I'd finally make one of these posts. Warning: I love to talk.

Here's some things I love:

* Bears of all kinds, from teddy bears to grizzly bears. My favorite bears are sun bears. 🧸
* Dark colors with foil accents.
* Tea and coffee.
* Emojis! I have difficulties with tone via text. I know I can sometimes come across as a little AI-coded, especially since I do love my em dashes -- it's not intentional. So I'll use lots of emojis when I want to come across friendlier and love seeing them from others.
* Anything related to books/libraries/authors/poets, especially black authors/poets.
* Birds. I like to do some birding in my spare time, aka I sit on my patio with wine and wait for my little bird buddies to come out the feeder.
* Cooking. I'm big on new recipes! I looove making dishes with lots of meat and spices.
* Gaming. I play: Final Fantasy 14, World of Warcraft, Baldur's Gate 3, The Sims, and Path of Exile regularly as of right now.
* Tabletop games, I've been DM-ing off and on for 16 years now. My favorite game to play and run is Delta Green. I'm a huge fan of Call of Cthulhu in general though.
* Warhammer. I've been reading through the novels as time allows. It's honestly fantastic, I'd love to meet others into it, but as a warning, I'm super new to it all lmao.

***If you're addressing a postcard or the outside of an envelope for a letter/folded card, please use my birth name (which all mail I send out is under). Thanks in advance!***

I only have one dislike: I loathe bugs of all kinds, even drawn depictions of butterflies make my skin crawl. In general, I love anything and everything someone sends though, even if it contains my one dislike. The fact that someone took the time (and these days, paid the postage) to send me something means a lot. So thanks in advance! I hope you have a great today and thanks for reading, I'm excited to hear from you! ✨",1,1755822359.0,u_otherworldbella,0,1.0,False
1mwrykq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1mwrykq/my_favorite_teainspired_perfume_house_roan/,My Favorite Tea-Inspired Perfume House: ROAN,"ROAN has quickly become one of my favorite niche perfume houses this year. Their creations are inspired by tea and designed for people who treasure making and keeping memories. Each perfume holds a special place in my heart, and I truly adore them all.

  
***Porcelain Pulse***  
Notes: Carrot, Rhubarb, Pear, Black Tea, Cardamom, Peony, Lily, Dried Apricot, Darjeeling Black Tea, Musk, Vetiver, Amber, Tobacco, Hay  
  
My Thoughts: It takes me back to the tea I used to share with my grandma—jammy, sweet, and floral. Rhubarb is such an underrated note, and here it shines, supported by accords that play beautifully around it. Pear adds brightness to the black tea, while carrot and apricot feel almost like the perfect marriage. A touch of cardamom is the perfect cherry on top. As it dries down, the sharper accords blur into a soft wrap of musk and hay. It’s one of my most complimented perfumes, and it’s easy to see why.

***Sahara Song***  
Notes: Moroccan Mint Tea, Coffee Bean, Coconut Milk, Plum, Cardamom, Pink Pepper, Rose, Vanilla Orchid, Jasmine, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Musk  
  
My Thoughts: This is *the* transitional perfume for the shift between summer and fall. When the morning wind carries a chill but the afternoon sun is still warm. It opens with iced, minty coconut milk that feels aromatic and herbal without leaning medicinal. It avoids the sharp bite that peppermint or eucalyptus would bring. Instead, it’s cozy, creamy, and lactonic with a touch of freshness blended in. The transformation into the dry down feels almost magical, telling a completely new story. The rose is light and airy, joined by spicy cardamom and mellow coffee beans. The result is warm and slightly ambery. A truly beautiful fragrance—I can’t wait for the weather to turn cooler so I can wear it with a cardigan and an iced chai.

***Current Culture***  
Notes: Carrot, Rhubarb, Pear, Black Tea, Cardamom, Peony, Lily, Dried Apricot, Darjeeling Black Tea, Musk, Vetiver, Amber, Tobacco, Hay  
  
My Thoughts: This perfume doesn’t smell “crazy,” yet in my mind it remains an anomaly. In a market oversaturated with both lackluster matcha lattes and uninspired matcha perfumes, this one offers something truly unique. It leans more toward a matcha tonic, letting the tea’s zesty facets shine alongside ginger and lemon. The real magic, though, is in the seaweed note. I hate aquatics, but this perfume avoids that entirely. Instead of veering fishy, the seaweed feels like opening a window near the ocean—a clean, salty breeze, a breath of fresh sea air. Not overly citrusy, not overwhelming—just the perfect matcha tea to cool you down.

***Mountain Memories***  
Notes: Oolong Tea, Pink Pepper, Black Currant Bud, Jasmine, Narcissus, Patchouli, Leather, Guaiac Wood, Oakmoss  
  
My Thoughts: In my mind, this perfume both roars and hums—a giant resting between misty mountains. Oolong tea, with its bitter, roasted, and earthy character, comes through vividly here. Out of ROAN’s collection, this feels like the “darkest” offering. The tea note is central, but it’s the leather and oakmoss that give it weight, adding a heaviness that feels both mystical and mythical.",4,1755822303.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False
1mwrxyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1mwrxyz/need_some_perspective_navigating_workplace/,Need some perspective – navigating workplace visibility as an introvert.,"Hey all just wanted to get some thoughts on this;

I’m an introvert and not the type to go around introducing myself to new people on the floor. I’m the only one who represents my team and my role doesn’t really require me to interact with others around me.

I’ve tried saying hi or asking people for coffee catch ups. A few have responded well but some clearly aren’t interested (maybe they’re like me) and some are super loud and go around making small talk at every desk every day.

One colleague told me I should be more visible, go out for lunches and make connections for future job opportunities. I’m in a mid level role and I’ve always landed new roles based on experience and performance. I’ve always been a top performer according to my PL.

Just not sure if being more social really helps. I’ve seen people on my floor who are really outgoing but have been stuck in junior roles for years.

I’ve made some effort to say hi or go for the odd coffee but I honestly hate group lunches. That’s my time and I prefer eating peacefully. I don’t mind team celebrations or Christmas lunches and all that.

Is my approach alright? I’ve got no ambition to go into exec or people leader roles. I’d be happy in a senior role without direct reports or maybe just one. I’m good at stakeholder management when it’s work related but I’m not trying to be a people pleaser anymore and I’m not into long coffee or lunch breaks just for the sake of it

Anyway semi rant over just trying to make sense of all this. Appreciate any thoughts

Thanks!!!

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England, big into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site that made it on the news. (Yes, seriously.)

I’ve been fortunate to find community through cosplay—whether I’m suited up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil—and even got featured on the news a couple times for it. I work out, dress sharp, and have a bizarre talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes.

Now for the honest bit: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want love, but because timing, shyness, and life just never lined up. But I’ve grown a lot—and I’m ready to meet someone for something real. If you’re nerdy, kind, curious, and value connection over perfection, we might vibe well.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

1mwrsvd,https://i.redd.it/wp7z74uvrgkf1.jpeg,MAFIA PRINCESS MY 9 Protective BROTHERS,"Book #01:Chapter 1
 Rebecca'S POV  Sitting on the roof of my old run down house, looking at the endless sea of stars in the black sky, thinking of my life, what my purpose is in life. I have no family, no friends, hell even pets. I have no one, nothing, nothing to lose, nothing to hope for. I'm simply surviving not living, I'm breathing but I feel dead.  If only feelings had an off-switch. If only I can block out the hurtful words, the thoughts, the feelings. I try to tell myself that its not true, all the words,all the pain, that its a chapter and it will pass. But I guess that's a lie, I have been lying to myself. This chapter is not passing, all my life I have been in the same chapter, over and over again, my life is a repeating record, everyday is the same.  But, I learned to block it out, to numb the pain away. Now, now numbness is all I ever feel. It helps with the words, thoughts, feelings and everything. I learned something when I was 9 years old. I would always cry when my parents would start hitting me, but I realized  something, that if I cry or mope around nothing would change, nothing. The kicking, punching, slapping, whipping and degrading wouldn't stop nor will it ever stop.  They love when I cry, when I beg, but nothing ever works it comes in an ear and out the other, I haven't cried since I was 10 years old . Crying won't solve my problems, it wont do anything. So I just stopped, I bottle everything up.  I don't burden anyone with my problems or what goes on at home. I know they wont do anything, they will pity me, and if their is one thing I hate most in life that its pity. I don't want people to pity me, I don't need anything from anyone. There is God, God gives me faith, hope, love, everything. I know he will help me. He kept me going till now for a reason.  I always wanted one thing as a little little girl . I wanted them to love me. I wanted them protect me and care for me. I wanted her help me with my hair, clothes or simply advice me in life. I wanted him to call me his little princess, to chase away boys, to protect me from bullies. But we don't get everything we want. Because it turned out they became my biggest bullies, I needed protection from them. They became the monsters from under the bed that you need protection from. They ruined me. He ruined me, she ruined me. Both of them broke me, shatterd me, broke me into a million pieces that can't be put together.  I always wondered what I did wrong, what I did for them to hate me, to harm me, to despise me that much. But I always came up with nothing. I was a kid who could barely stand, so I never came up with an answer.  Its currently 4:00 in the morning and I need to go make my stepfather breakfast and clean the house or else I will get my daily dosage of love (note the sarcasm). With that thought in mind I got up and streched my sore muscles, Obviously that was a mistake as I bent over in pain. Yesterday I came 10mins late from work and he whipped my back and dislocated my knee. I don't even know how I'm walking right now but I guess you could say I'm used to it, the pain.  I walked to my room which is basiclly the attic. My room consists of a really thin mattress, a thin blanket, no pillow, and a chair in the corner of the room where I keep my stuff. I went to the broken mirror in the bathroom and lifted my shirt just over my ribs. My stomach has burn marks, open flesh, and bruises. My stomach is a mixture of black, blue, purple, yellow, and green. One thing I hate when looking at my stomach is the word my mom (if you can even call her that) carved there. The  word  ""whore"" is carved in the middle of my stomach.  She carved it with a small pocket knife when I came late from school for doing a project with a boy.  I don't even know how she found out. I don't dwell on the thought anymore and start dressing my wounds and sanitizing the cuts with rubbing alcohol and white, big antiseptic bandages. After that I put on my clothes.  I make sure to cover the bruises on my face and hands with foundation. Don't want anybody knowing.  After I finished  stood and looked at myself in the mirror. My green-blue eyes hold no life, they are dull, lifeless, no shine in them whatsoever. They used to be so bright, full of life and happiness but now they are dead, nothing in them, they look so empty . My face is too thin and pale from the little food and dehydration, My clothes are too big and baggy because i'm too thin. Overall I'm not the most appealing to look at.  When I finish I make my way downstairs to start on breakfast. I make my way to the kitchen and open the fridge and take the ingredients out. I make four  pieces of toasted toast, two with fried eggs and the other two with strawberry jam with half an avocado on the side. I put the plate on the table and open the fridge to take out a beer. The second I put the bottle down I hear loud booming footsteps alerting me he's coming. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 2
 I stand in the corner in the kitchen and keep my head down . Its one of rules I have to follow or else I get punished.  He makes his way inside and sits on the stool and starts eating. Next thing I know a fist is being thrown in my face. He punches me in the face and I feel the familiar taste of metal in my mouth. He busted my lip when it just healed. Another punch is thrown and he says ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT YOU FUCKING WHORE???""  ""T-toast s-sir."" I stutter looking at the floor,  another rule is that I call him sir and never make eye contact, he considers it disrespectful.  It looks like he didn't like that answer as he threw me on the floor and started kicking my stomach.  This went one for 1hour and when he finally had finished I could barely keep my eyes open.  ""That's what you get you filthy bitch."" He spat,  I saw him through blurry vision pick up his car keys and leave slamming the door on his way.  Slowly I stand up with the support of the wall and make my way to my room. I open the door and go inside, I reapply my foundation to cover the new bruises. I then eat small granola bar from the kitchen and take two painkillers for my ribs because he broke three I think.  I then make my way outside to leave for work. I close the door and lock it behind me. I work as a waitress in this really cute popular cafe that's 30 mins away. I have been working there for 2years and the owners are really sweet and treat me as their own.  Once I reach the cafe I open the door and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fills my nose. I bid Nancy and David the owners good morning and move to put my stuff away. I hear the bell above the door jingle indicating someone came. I put my apron and take my small notebook and pen and headÂ  outside to start working. Let the day begin.  Rebecca'S POV  Its now been a couple hours and I'm so tired. My legs feel like they're about to give out any second. I finish the last table and go lean on the counter. I sigh and close my eyes for minute. Then Nancy comes up to me,  ""Darling you look tired, why don't you get your stuff and go home and rest?"" She suggested with a soft smile.  ""But Nancy their is still a couple people left. "" I said, trying to convince her to let me stay, but she wasn't having it.  ""Its okay hun I'll take care of it and anyways your shift ended hours ago, you always stay overtime, you need rest my sweet girl."" She said.  ""Are you sure?Â  You know I don't mind staying I love working here."" I asked to make sure.  ""Yes honey its okay now go get your stuff, its getting late I don't you walking late at night."" She replied. I nodded my head and went to get my bag and put my work stuff away. I said goodnight to Nancy and David and started my way to hell.  As I was walking, I had a feeling like something happened. I don't know what it is but I had a feeling like something big is going to happen and soon. Too lost in my thoughts I didn't notice the bright blue and red lights and the police cars outside my home. I felt my heart start beating faster with each second.  Why is the police here? Oh god what if Boris did something and they are going to take me instead? With all those thoughts I didn't notice a police officer walking towards me.  ""Excuse me, Are you Rebecca Anderson?"" Asked the officer.  ""Yes sir, is everything okay?"" I asked, concern clear in my voice.  ""I'm sorry, honey but your stepfather had an overdose and sadly he didn't make it."" He said, pity in his eyes and voice.  I felt my heart stop. Boris is dead. He's finally dead. He can't hurt me anymore. I'm free from his claws. I never thought that he would die before me, I always thought that maybe he would go too far someday and kill me for good. My dream has come true.  But then suddenly, a thought came to mind. Where will I go? I don't have a father, my mother always told me that when he found out she's pregnant he told her that he didn't want me and left. I have no aunts, uncles, grandparents that I know about.  I have heard about the foster system and I don't wanna go from one bad house to another.  ""But where will I go? I don't have anyone that can take me in."" I said, fear gripping my heart and chest.  ""We will take you to the station to get a blood sample and see if you have any relatives that would like to take you in. If not then you will be placed in an orphanage or the foster system. For now why don't you go pack your stuff and then we will go ok?"" He suggested, sympathy clear in his voice.  I nodded and went to the house to get my stuff. I didn't have a lot of stuff so it didn't take me long to pack them up. I had two shirts, two sweatshirts, one pair of sweatpants, one pair of leggings and a pair of underwear and a bra. I put them in my backpack and took out the money I have been saving all my life. I counted them and they turned out to be 1,500 dollars.  I put them in my bag and looked at the room one last time. The thought of leaving sounds so surreal, It feels too good to be true. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 3
 I looked at the room one last time and went downstairs. When I reached down I went to the officer that I talked with before and told him I was ready. We got inside the car and started driving towards the station. Once we reached we parked and went inside. He told me to sit down and wait for him to come back.  Once he came back he took my blood and told me the results will be back in an hour. It was 8:30 by now and I was exhausted. So I closed my eyes and I felt myself drift off.  ONE HOUR LATER  I felt someone shaking me from my shoulder and I immediately shot up thinking it was Boris. But once I saw the officer I relaxed. But he had a wide grin on his face which confused me. But what he said next confused me even more.  ""Well I have some good news for you, we found someone that would love to take you in."" He said with a wide smile.  "" Who?"" I asked curiously.  ""Your father and older brothers."" He replied.  I stood there frozen. I couldn't hear anything else he was saying. 'Father', that word kept repeating in my head over and over again. Why would he want me now? Why? He could have saved me years of pain and anguish and now he wants me? I couldn't believe this. My ears kept ringing, my heart kept beating out of my chest.  I didn't notice the officer calling my name until he started shaking my shoulder. I flinched and stepped away from him with wide eyes and mouth hanging open.  ""F-father?"" I whispered, still in shock about what I was just told.  ""Yes father, isn't that great? Well how about you rest for a while, it'll be a couple hours till he arrives since he's coming from New York."" He explained.  I nodded, I couldn't form any words, nothing could come out of my mouth. Its like my tongue was tied,  'Father' I have a father and he said I have brothers.  How many brothers do I have? Will they like me? What if they hate me? What if they never wanted a sister? Oh god what if they hurt me? I could barely keep up with Boris and now a father and brothers. I couldn't think anymore as I could feel a headache starting. I rubbed my temples and took two painkillers.  My body hurts so much and with this new information. I rested my head against the wall and thought about something, will this be my new start with my new family or will it be my new hell? With that I drifted off.  Arthur'S POV  I'm sitting in my office signing papers for the company and looking at a few designs for my next opening club.Â  Sighing and taking a small sip of the rich alcoholic flavor I lean my head back on my leather brown chair trying to ease the headache that's forming.  I suddenly get a call from an unknown number. I usually never answer but my gut was telling me to and my gut is always right. So I picked up the phone and answered.  ""Hello""I said coldly.  ""I-is t-this Mr Arthur Jackson?"" The person on the other line stuttered. Since I'm in the mafia I'm always cold and rude except with my family.  ""Yes, now who are you and what do you want?"" He's wasting my time I need to finish work so I can be on time for dinner with my sons.  ""Sir this is Texas Police Station we have your daughter here, her DNA matched with yours and she doesn't have a guardian, her stepfather just died. Would you like to take her in? If not she will be placed in an orphanage."" The officer said making my hand freeze midair from where I was signing.  What the fuck is he talking about? I don't have a daughter, I mean, I have always wanted a daughter but me and my ex-wife didn't have one. And I never slept with another woman.  ""Listen you have the wrong number I don't have a daughter."" I answered rudely.  I was starting to get annoyed they can't even dial a number correctly.  ""Sir your ex- wifes name was Margaret Michael right?""Asked the officer.  What does that bitch have to do with anything? She could be dead for I care.""Yes why ?"" I asked getting really confused.""And she left you and your sons and ran away right?"" By now I was really starting to get mad. What the fuck does he think this is?A guessing game?  ""Yes now spit it out I'm fucking busy ""  ""Sir your wife changed her name and she was pregnant when she ran away."" He replied.  I sat their frozen. No this can' be possible, she wouldn't just take my child away from me, this is impossible. Fuck I can't even think clearly. I must have been quite for too long because the officer spoke again.  ""Sir are you still there ?""I cleared my throat and replied ""Yes I am can you send a photo of her and what's her name?"" I spoke calmly after taking a few deep breaths.""Yes sir I will send a photo and her name is Rebecca Alessandra Anderson."" Said the officer.  ""So would you like to take her in? "" Asked the officer.  ""Yes I will take her in I will be there in a few hours since i'm coming from New York. "" I replied, feeling my throat clog up.  ""Ok sir I will get the papers ready for when you come."" I hung up and put my phone on the table. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 4
 I couldn't believe this, a daughter, my daughter, I have a daughter. FUCK,that bitch, how could she? How could she keep my daughter away from me, my principessa, my babygirl. I missed 17years of her life from that bitch. I could never forgive myself. I felt something wet on my cheek. I raised my hand and wiped my cheek, I didn't even realize I was crying. I haven't cried in 30 years. I threw my phone across the room in frustration and watched it as it smashed in a thousand pieces. But that wasn't enough  I called my pilot from my other phone after hanging up with the officer.  "" Get the jet ready we're going to Texas."" I said as soon as he answered. ""Yes sir."" After that I couldn't control my anger anymore.  I sent a message to my 2nd oldest ""Get a duffle bag ready we're going to Texas."" Their was an instant reply ""Yes dad."" good.I still need to take my anger out on something. I threw my glass coffee table across the room and watched as it broke in a million pieces. I kept throwing everything in my office. I didn't keep a single thing. At the end my office was trashed with glass everywhere and papers on the floor.  I took a deep breath and thought of how I'm going to tell my sons. I know one thing and that they're going to be happy. All of my sons wanted a baby sister ever since they were young. And now that they have a baby sister they're going to be over the moon.  I took a long deep breath and pressed the speaker that is connected in the whole house so no matter where they are they can still here ""FAMILY MEETING NOW DON'T BE FUCKING LATE.""  Let's see how it goes.  While I was walking down the stairs, I felt my phone vibrate in my black trousers. I paused my steps and unlocked my phone and opened the e-mail sent from the officer. Once I opened it and saw the picture I stood there frozen in my spot. There was a beautiful girl that looked to be in her teenage years. She had blue- greenish eyes that looked absolutely fetching. Her light brunette hair looked so soft and silky and they were a little past her shoulders. Her face had had nothing on it, not even an acne scar. Her eyebrows were arched and she had a cute button nose.  In that moment all my doubts vanished. I now know that this girl is absolutely my daughter. She looks just Constant. Heck they could be twins if not for the obvious age difference. Though, as I looked at the picture more closely I noticed that she looks a bit too skinny and pale.  I immediately started thinking the worst. Was she not fed properly? Didn't they have enough money to buy food? Is she sick? Does she have small appetite? Was she being starved? I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and continued walking down the stairs and passed the kitchen until I reached the living room where I could hear my sons bickering and yelling.  I took a breath and opened the living room doors, immediately all the yelling and shouting stopped as soon I stepped in the room. You see, the very first thing I taught my sons is respect. Respect is very important in general but more important in the underworld. People need to respect you in order for you to be powerful and strong. Although my sons and I are extremely close they make sure to never disrespect me or their elders, their is always boundaries. But if a person hurts their family, then it doesn't matter if they are old or young.  Family should always come first no matter what and I made sure to engrave that into their minds 'prima la familia.' Is our motto and we will always live by it till we take our last breaths.  I enter the living room and look around to make sure that all my sons are here. And sure enough, they are all here. Everyone has confused faces on expect Constant and Eamonn who are looking at me emotionlessly but I could see the curiosity swimming in their eyes.  ""What do you wanna talk about dad?"" Grumbled Kenny, who looked like he just woke up from a very good nap.  ""I got a very intriguing call today. "" I started, but got cut off by Eamonn ""What call?"" I shot him a glare and saw him shiver and he muttered a small 'sorry.' I was too happy to care about being mad at him right now.  ""Don't interrupt me boy.""I said and he averted his eyes away from me in shame.  ""What was the call about dad?"" Asked Geraint calmly and respectfully.  ""Well boys I got a call from Texas police station and he informed me that Margaret died 3 years ago.""Â  I Informed calmly and waited for them to absorb the new information.I looked at my sons and saw that they had disgusted looks on their faces. The boys never really liked their mother. She never treated them well and never took of them and their necessities.  ""That witch was never and will never be our mother."" Spat Enoch.  And a chorus of ' yeses' and nods of approval were thrown his way.  ""What does that have to do with us dad ?""Asked Hawke.  ""It turns out when she ran away she got remarried, and he died a couple hours ago from an overdose "" I said.  Once I got nods to continue I continued ""And I need to go to the station because there's a special someone waiting for me."" Ismiled wildly at them.  All of them looked at me weirdly because I rarely smile. Maybe a sadistic smile but that doesn't count.  ""Who is the special someone?"" Asked Kent. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 5
 ""My daughter"" I smiled wildly as I thought of my little princess and how she's going to be in my arms soon.  The mafia princess is coming home.  My thoughts of my babygirl were soon cut off by all of them asking, more like yelling ""WHAT?!!!"" Shouted all of them.  ""Let me explain "" they nodded and I soon continued, ""Turns out when Margaret ran away she was pregnant and she didn't tell me and when I tried finding her, looks like she changed her name and ran away so I could't find her, trust me when I got that call I was as shocked as you, and when the officer told me she matched my DNA I was so happy, I always wanted a daughter and you guys always wanted a little sister, so that's it.""  I finished and I looked at them all. I saw different emotions, Constant looked emotionless but I could still see the happiness and contentment in his eyes, Geraint, Frankie, and Hawke all had small smiles on their faces and tears of joy in their eyes. Eamonn looked mad, which I couldn't understand why , Eamonn has anger issues and could barely control it sometimes.  I made a mental note to ask him why he's mad  later. Enoch was jumping around cheering and hugging his brothers. Kenny and Kent were already making plans of what they can do, where they can go, and more stuff. And lastly, my youngest son, Isaac, he was sitting on the couch and had a small smile resting on his face. When he thought no one was looking, I saw him take off his glasses and wipe them from tears that dropped on them. He, then proceeded to wipe the tears in his eyes.  ""WE FINALLY HAVE A BABY SISTER !!!!!"" Yelled Enoch making us all laugh ""YESSSSS FINALLY WER'RE NOT THE YOUNGEST ANYMORE!!!""  Yelled Kenny and Kent making us chuckle softly at their silly antics.  ""Technically you're not the youngest, Lester is, aren't you baby bro?"" Smiled Frankie ruffling Isaac's brunette hair.  Lester only huffed in amusement and fixed his hair back to how it was.  ""Wait do you have a picture of her? We wanna see her ""Asked Hawke, all the others nodded in agreement.  I nodded my head and fished out my phone out of my pocket and looked up my babygirl's cute face. I motioned for them to come closer, and I gave Constant my phone and immediately the all of them surrounded him to take a look.  All I heard were gasps in the big modern living room. All of them were staring the phone intensely  And a few sniffs were heard indicating some of them are crying.  ""She's so pretty. "" Mumbled Geraint.  ""She's soooo cute Ahhhh!!!"" Gushed Enoch.  ""She's so adorable"" Smiled softly Frankie as he looked at his sister's photo.  ""She's so precious."" Whispered Hawke, Kenny and Kent nodded their heads, agreeing.  Eamonn just stood there frozen looking at the photo in amazement.  ""She looks just like Constant"" Whispered Lester.  Everyone gasped and looked at him with wide eyes and mouthes open. Lester rarely talks, he only talks with his twins, he's just quite, he likes to observe more. So we were surprised when he spoke now. He glared at them and they all looked away from him.  Constant still hasn't looked away from the phone yet. Its like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He then spoke in the most serious and coldest voice, ""No boy will ever come near my baby sister.""  Getting a 'Fuck yeah' from the rest of his brothers as their eyes filled with determination - a sort of promise that no one will ever think about breaking their baby sister's heart or think about hurting her.  I had messaged Geraint earlier to pack a small bag. So, when I got a message from the pilot telling me that the plane was ready. I told them that its time to go. Kent started throwing a fit about how he wanted to go get his sister himself but one look from Constant was enough to make him quite as he started muttering about how we were being 'unfair and mean' I just shook my head at him softly. That boy never fails to amaze me with his goofiness and energy.  I looked at Constant and nodded at him, me telling him to take care of younger brothers till I come back and him nodding at me back at me and silently telling me to bring his baby sister home.  I looked at Geraint and told him that we need to leave he nodded and made his way to the waiting car outside. I looked around one last time and left making my to the car. I got in and soon we were on our way to the airport.  We reached 20 mins later and went on the plane. We buckled up and soon enough we were in the air and on our way to my princess. With that thought in mind I drifted off with my daughter on my mind.  Arthur'S POV  We're now outside the police station and now that we're here it feels more real than before.The fact that I have a daughter becomes more real and I couldn't help but feel nervous.  What if she doesn't like me? What if she tells me she doesn't want to be with us? I couldn't help but the nervousness that settled in me. I took a deep breath and looked at the building that has my daughter and the fact that shes waiting for me to come and take her home. I looked at Geraint one last time and nodded at him, He nodded back, and with that we went inside. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 6
 We took powerful strides inside. We had our blank faces on and immediately the once noisy station was now dead silent. You could hear a pin drop from how silent it is. We were greeted by a young officer who looked to be in his early twenties. Once he looked at us, recognition flashed through his eyes and his breathing quickened. Its not everyday you have a mafia don in a police station.Then, He led us to small office that seemed more small with me and Geraint in it due to our muscular and extremely builds. He led us to another young officer that explained the details and papers so that I can take Rebecca's guardianship.  I signed all necessary papers, and I now have all guardianship over my daughter. Once everything was finalized he told me that Rebecca's sleeping in the other room and then proceeded to go and wake her up. He then came back with Rebecca behind him and it looks like she didn't notice us it. She was staring at the floor and it looks like she was deep in thought with how she has a small cute frown on her face and a small pout on her lips, which might I add, looks absolutely adorable.  The officer then called her name and that we've arrived, she looked up and immediately her blue-green eyes made contact with Geraint's blue ones. I watched as he looked at her softly and how he had tears in his eyes. I looked at my princepissa and went towards her.  Rebecca'S POV  My father is here. He's really here, I'm so nervous. What if he doesn't like? What if he hurts me like they did? What if he sends me to another orphanage once we reach New York? My thoughts were soon cut off by a pair of strong muscly arms wrapping around me and my nostrils were filled by a manly cologne that smells and screams rich.  Once I came back to my senses and realized I was trapped, I felt my body tense and I stood there frozen. But a couple seconds later my body relaxed and I melted into that persons embrace. I don't know why but I felt safe in that persons arms, like nothingÂ  in the world will hurt me. I have never felt like this before. I wrapped my skinny and bony arms around the man and my body relaxed.Â  A few minutes later we both let go, I looked up to see who that unknown man was.  I saw a tall man that looked old and young at the same time . He looked like he's 5o years old. He had a light dark stubble, he had brunette hair that looked exactly like mine, It was gelled back and not a hair was out of place, his eyebrows were plucked and arched perfectly, the kind were that it made women envy their eyebrows. He had small wrinkles around his eyes that you would't notice unless you were looking really closely. His jawline looked sharp and defined. And he was extremely muscular and the Armani suit looked like it would tear any second at any sudden movements. And he's tall, my guess is that he's 6'8. He could crush me with his pinky. I would have to look up at him and crane my neck up. Ughhh he looks like he could eat me with my 5'2 height. He then spoke,  ""Hi principessa I'm your father, Arthur Jackson.""  He spoke softly as if he would speak any louder I would break.  ""Hi its nice to meet you."" I spoke smiling shyly but never making eye contact with him, just looking at the collar of his Armani shirt. I don't wanna make him mad when I don't know his intentions yet.He seems confused as to why I'm not looking him in the eye but chooses not to comment on it which makes me sigh a sigh of relief. He then spoke again ""It's nice to meet you too princess, I'm sorry I didn't know about you earlier."" He said softly. But what does he mean he didn't know about me? I didn't have time to linger on the thought because he spoke again.""I want to introduce you to someone princess,"" He then gestured to the other man that looks like him and seems to be 6'6 in height ""Princess this is your second oldest brother, introduce your self son."" He said, nodding his head.  ""Hi bambina, I'm Geraint its so good to finally meet you."" spoke Geraint softly and then he brought his arms out. Out of instinct I flinched lightly which didn't look like it went unnoticed by them but thankfully they didn't comment on it. He then proceeded to hug me and I immediately responded to the hug. I felt so safe in their arms, like nothing could hurt me.  I felt something wet on my shoulder I looked and saw Geraint crying, I pulled away and brought his face closer to me. I wiped his tears with the pads of my thumbs,he then brought his hands and putÂ  them on top of mine and kissed the palms of my hands. I then whispered softly ""Why are you crying ?"" He wrapped his arms around my waist and brought me in another hug. I bit my lip to stop myself from screaming in pain. He kept hugging me tightly and buried his face in my neck. He then whispered ""I'm so happy to have you in my life sorella."" I was happy that someone would actually care for me. Maybe I can have a new start. I understood what he meant because i'm fluent in a lot of languages. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 7
 After couple of minutes he let go and wiped his tears. Then my 'father' asked ""Are you ready to go sweetheart?"" I replied ""Yes I am."" but then Geraint asked, ""Where's your stuff bambina?"" I pointed to my backpack and said ""This is all i have."" I whispered looking at the floor. I saw Arthur and Geraint sharing a look. Its like they're communicating through their eyes. Then Arthur finally said, ""Its okay darling, lets get going now."" He told me with a small smile on his face and I couldn't help but give him one back.  We made our way out of the police station and into beautiful car. I stood there gawking at the metal of hunk. ""You like it?"" Asked Geraint with a soft chuckle. ""Are you kidding me?! I love cars!!"" I replied happily. Then Arthur said, ""Looks like we have another Eamonn."" he said with a small laugh.  Wait who's Eamonn? They both looked at my confused face and then Arthur told me, ""Don't worry you will meet him later."" I just nodded my head and soon enough we were on our way to the airport.  Instead of driving in the normal route Geraint went towards the private planes one. I sat there confused until we reached a matte black plane. Geraint stopped and came and opened my door. I thanked him shyly and he just gave me a small smile. I then turned to Arthur and asked him, ""Why are we here aren't we supposed to go that way?"" I questioned him and pointed to the normal route.  He laughed softly and said, ""No baby we have a private plane."" I stood there looking like a fish out of water opening and closing my mouth trying to say something. He come and raised his hand and I out of instinct flinched. His hand stopped midway and he looked at me in concern and confusion. I gave him a tight lipped smile and he gave a soft one back.  ""Come on guys lets get going."" Said Geraint. Thank god he came andÂ  saved the tense silence. I noticed there were a lot of guards but I kept my mouth shut. We soon boardedÂ  the plane and were on our way to New York.  I hope this is a fresh start for me. Because if it isn't, I don't know what I'll do and what will happen.  Rebecca'S POV  Once we were in the air, I looked around and everything looked expensive. From the floor, to the seats, to the ceiling, everything screamed 'rich' and I couldn't help but gawk at everything. Everything was so shiny I was afraid to touch anything.  ""Do you like it princess?"" Asked Arthur.  ""Yeah it's really pretty."" I said. I looked outside the window and watched the white fluffy clouds. I started thinking of how my life changed so fast. I must have been too lost in my thoughts because I felt someone put their hand on top of mine. I immediately pulled away and looked up and saw Arthur and Geraint looking at me in shock, confusion and concern. ""What was that princess?"" asked Arthur. I looked at Geraint and saw he was waiting for me to answer.  I never liked physical contact especially when its not initiated by me. That basically happens when you were getting beaten everyday by your mom and stepdad. I can never be able to tell them what happened to me. They won't want me anymore and they will throw out. I mean, who wants a damaged and abused girl as a daughter and sister? Once they know they will be disgusted and hate me and then they will throw me into an orphanage.  I flinched when a hand was being waved in front of my face. I looked wide-eyed at the person who was waving the hand and saw that it was Geraint. ""Are you okay baby?"" He asked in a tone that sounded like .... worry? But why would he be worried? He just met me like .... an hour ago. But when I looked into his eyes trying to detect that his tone of worry was a lie, I couldn't see anything but honesty and panic.  ""Yeah I am I just don't like physical contact."" I muttered hoping they would believe me. It didn't look like they did but they didn't say anything which I'm glad for.  He leaned forward and grabbed my soft, small hand in his big and rough one and gave it a small reassuring squeeze. ""You must be confused, you can ask us anything you want okay?"" He said softly like he didn't want to scare me.  ""So .... umm did you eat lots of vegetables when you were a kid?"" I asked but almost immediately my eyes went wide about what I said. I looked at both of them and saw that both of were trying to hold their laughter in. It didn't last long as both of them burst out laughing, clutching their stomachs as tears fell from their eyes. I just pouted at them and waited for them to be finished with their laughing session.  After they calmed down, Geraint said, ""Oh My God I haven't had such a good laugh in such a long time.""Â  he laughed again ""But, to answer your question, I did eat a lot of vegetables, dad even would force us to or he'd take our toys.""  I sighed sadly for my poor self and short height and my malnourished body. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 8
 ""So like what do you for work?"" I asked trying to change the subject. As I asked this question I noticed both of them tensed and looked at each other, like their communicating with their eyes. After a couple mins with an awkward silence Arthur cleared his throat and looked at me and said, ""Well darling we own a chain of clubs, restaurant's, hotels and the largest companies in the world."" Ok I must admit thats cool, I mean I knew the moment they told me they owned a private jet that they were loaded. But that just proves my point even more.""Thats nice, you must be proud of your achievements"" I said shyly, I mean who wouldn't be proud of things like that.  He smiled wildly at me and then kissed the top of my hand that he was holding before. I went to ask another question but I was cut by a yawn that had my eyes watering. Dad chucked softly and said, ""Why don't you get some sleep and we'll wake you up when we land hmm?"" I nodded my and soon he led me to a private room. I was too tired to admire the extravagant room and went and lied down on the bed. He left after kissing my forehead and tucking me in. As soon as my head hit the pillow I was out like a light.  TIME SKIP  I got woken up by Geraint telling me we are about to land. We went outside and sat down and I looked up and saw dad smiling at me and I smiled back. Once we have arrived we thanked the pilot and went down the stairs. We walked and soon came to a stop in front of a 'Blazer' which was in a matte black color. Geraint opened the back door for me and I muttered a small 'thank you' with a blush. No one has ever done that for me before m. He smiled softly and went to the other side of the car and went beside me in the backseat, as dad sat in the passengers seat besides the driver.  ""Are you hungry sweetheart? You haven't had anything since we left the station"" Asked Arthur. ""No I'm not hungry at the moment...thank you though.""  Its true though I wasn't hungry. Boris never really fed me saying how I wasn't 'worthy of food'. I can go for weeks without food. I have a small stomach anyway due to being starved. Even if I was hungry I was used to it and would never tell them if I was. I don't want them to be mad at me when we just met.  ""We'll eat when we get home."" Geraint said smiling wildly. I smiled back and continued looking out the window. But then a thought came to my mind, What if they aren't as welcoming as dad and Geraint? What if they don't like me? What if -  My thoughts were cut off by a hand on top of mine. I looked at the hand and looked up at Geraint ""You'll be fine, they're gonna love you."" He said and gave me small soft smile. I smiled back at him and felt myself relax a little. Soon we came up to a black gate and stopped, the driver pulled down the window and started tying a password on the keypad that was attached to the wall. Once he finished we continued driving and we then came to a stop where there was a big mansion that looked absolutely beautiful and magnificent.  There were a couple of expensive looking cars that were parked outside and then Geraint opened the door and gave me his hand and helped me down considering my short height. Once I got out I took a really good look at the mansion, more like castle. 'There more loaded than i thought'. As I continued gawking at the house in front of me with wide eyes and my mouth open. I heard someone chuckle behind me ""Do you like it?"" Arthur asked. ""Its really beautiful."" I whispered still looking in amazement. I never saw a house so pretty, well except on Pinterest, which doesn't count.  ""Well come on let's go inside the others are dying to meet you."" said Geraint. Once we were inside  Dad suddenly yelled ""BOYS COME DOWNSTAIRS NOW"". I flinched from his loud voice which scared me, as it gives me flashbacks of when Boris would yell at me and start to hurt me. I didn't notice when Geraint came and stood next to me and asked ""Are you okay bambina?""I was shaking I couldn't breath properly, it felt like I was drowning.He then came and put his hands on my shoulders and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from hissing in pain.  ""Rebecca are you ok?"" Asked Geraint again worriedly. I looked at him through my lashes and nodded my head. ""Yes I-I'm fine"" I gave him a weak smile and cleared my throat to get rid of the lump that formed in my throat. He didn't seem to believe me but thankfully didn't comment on it. Just then we heard loud footsteps, like a herd of elephants running.  Then 8 boys, more like men came in the entrance and stood there frozen. They were all extremely tall and well built. Though, all of them looked similar to each other. I'm guessing they're all siblings. But who are they? Dad mentioned brothers but its not possible that all of them are my brothers, right?

1mwrstd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwrstd,[review] offonwednesdays,"Stopped by Miller's Coffee to check out a wee pop-up by Offonwednesdays after being completely sold on their gooey caramel sandwich from their social. As a keen baker myself, I love seeing another passionate baker who not only cares about the final product but also goes the extra mile to source the right ingredients.

Anyway, let’s talk about the stars of the show. I didn’t end up getting the caramel sandwich as it was only available as part of their biscuit box.. but I did walk away with **sea salt shortbread, yuzu macadamia ricciarelli, and caramel shortbread with macadamia toffee & marmalade** (phew, that’s a mouthful… no pun intended).

I haven’t tried the sea salt shortbread or ricciarelli yet, so I can’t comment on those. But the caramel shortbread? OMG IT'S HEAVENLY. It feels firm when you pick it up, but then it just melts in your mouth, without being greasy. The flour gives it this lovely grainy, sandy texture, and the tanginess from the marmalade cuts beautifully through the sweetness of the caramel. I guess now my only regret is not grabbing more than one slice. ",4,1755821866.0,aucklandeats,5,1.0,False

1mwrrvb,https://v.redd.it/4s957zinrgkf1,Leak inside CVA 4070,"Hi,

My CVA 4070 has progressively started brewing smaller amounts of coffee output to the point of not brewing anything…I also noticed water dripping from underneath the unit - which led me to open it up. Upon opening, you can clearly see water leaking inside, and there was a bunch of old coffee sludge in here too…

I am trying to figure out which part(s) I need to replace. I’ve seen a few other posts on here where people replaced the brew drive but their leaks looked different than mine, so I wanted to check before making the investment in that part. 

It seems to leak before it gets to the brew drive?

1mwrrg9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwrrg9,MAFIA PRINCESS MY 9 protective brothers,"Book #01:Chapter 1
 Rebecca'S POV  Sitting on the roof of my old run down house, looking at the endless sea of stars in the black sky, thinking of my life, what my purpose is in life. I have no family, no friends, hell even pets. I have no one, nothing, nothing to lose, nothing to hope for. I'm simply surviving not living, I'm breathing but I feel dead.  If only feelings had an off-switch. If only I can block out the hurtful words, the thoughts, the feelings. I try to tell myself that its not true, all the words,all the pain, that its a chapter and it will pass. But I guess that's a lie, I have been lying to myself. This chapter is not passing, all my life I have been in the same chapter, over and over again, my life is a repeating record, everyday is the same.  But, I learned to block it out, to numb the pain away. Now, now numbness is all I ever feel. It helps with the words, thoughts, feelings and everything. I learned something when I was 9 years old. I would always cry when my parents would start hitting me, but I realized  something, that if I cry or mope around nothing would change, nothing. The kicking, punching, slapping, whipping and degrading wouldn't stop nor will it ever stop.  They love when I cry, when I beg, but nothing ever works it comes in an ear and out the other, I haven't cried since I was 10 years old . Crying won't solve my problems, it wont do anything. So I just stopped, I bottle everything up.  I don't burden anyone with my problems or what goes on at home. I know they wont do anything, they will pity me, and if their is one thing I hate most in life that its pity. I don't want people to pity me, I don't need anything from anyone. There is God, God gives me faith, hope, love, everything. I know he will help me. He kept me going till now for a reason.  I always wanted one thing as a little little girl . I wanted them to love me. I wanted them protect me and care for me. I wanted her help me with my hair, clothes or simply advice me in life. I wanted him to call me his little princess, to chase away boys, to protect me from bullies. But we don't get everything we want. Because it turned out they became my biggest bullies, I needed protection from them. They became the monsters from under the bed that you need protection from. They ruined me. He ruined me, she ruined me. Both of them broke me, shatterd me, broke me into a million pieces that can't be put together.  I always wondered what I did wrong, what I did for them to hate me, to harm me, to despise me that much. But I always came up with nothing. I was a kid who could barely stand, so I never came up with an answer.  Its currently 4:00 in the morning and I need to go make my stepfather breakfast and clean the house or else I will get my daily dosage of love (note the sarcasm). With that thought in mind I got up and streched my sore muscles, Obviously that was a mistake as I bent over in pain. Yesterday I came 10mins late from work and he whipped my back and dislocated my knee. I don't even know how I'm walking right now but I guess you could say I'm used to it, the pain.  I walked to my room which is basiclly the attic. My room consists of a really thin mattress, a thin blanket, no pillow, and a chair in the corner of the room where I keep my stuff. I went to the broken mirror in the bathroom and lifted my shirt just over my ribs. My stomach has burn marks, open flesh, and bruises. My stomach is a mixture of black, blue, purple, yellow, and green. One thing I hate when looking at my stomach is the word my mom (if you can even call her that) carved there. The  word  ""whore"" is carved in the middle of my stomach.  She carved it with a small pocket knife when I came late from school for doing a project with a boy.  I don't even know how she found out. I don't dwell on the thought anymore and start dressing my wounds and sanitizing the cuts with rubbing alcohol and white, big antiseptic bandages. After that I put on my clothes.  I make sure to cover the bruises on my face and hands with foundation. Don't want anybody knowing.  After I finished  stood and looked at myself in the mirror. My green-blue eyes hold no life, they are dull, lifeless, no shine in them whatsoever. They used to be so bright, full of life and happiness but now they are dead, nothing in them, they look so empty . My face is too thin and pale from the little food and dehydration, My clothes are too big and baggy because i'm too thin. Overall I'm not the most appealing to look at.  When I finish I make my way downstairs to start on breakfast. I make my way to the kitchen and open the fridge and take the ingredients out. I make four  pieces of toasted toast, two with fried eggs and the other two with strawberry jam with half an avocado on the side. I put the plate on the table and open the fridge to take out a beer. The second I put the bottle down I hear loud booming footsteps alerting me he's coming. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 2
 I stand in the corner in the kitchen and keep my head down . Its one of rules I have to follow or else I get punished.  He makes his way inside and sits on the stool and starts eating. Next thing I know a fist is being thrown in my face. He punches me in the face and I feel the familiar taste of metal in my mouth. He busted my lip when it just healed. Another punch is thrown and he says ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT YOU FUCKING WHORE???""  ""T-toast s-sir."" I stutter looking at the floor,  another rule is that I call him sir and never make eye contact, he considers it disrespectful.  It looks like he didn't like that answer as he threw me on the floor and started kicking my stomach.  This went one for 1hour and when he finally had finished I could barely keep my eyes open.  ""That's what you get you filthy bitch."" He spat,  I saw him through blurry vision pick up his car keys and leave slamming the door on his way.  Slowly I stand up with the support of the wall and make my way to my room. I open the door and go inside, I reapply my foundation to cover the new bruises. I then eat small granola bar from the kitchen and take two painkillers for my ribs because he broke three I think.  I then make my way outside to leave for work. I close the door and lock it behind me. I work as a waitress in this really cute popular cafe that's 30 mins away. I have been working there for 2years and the owners are really sweet and treat me as their own.  Once I reach the cafe I open the door and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fills my nose. I bid Nancy and David the owners good morning and move to put my stuff away. I hear the bell above the door jingle indicating someone came. I put my apron and take my small notebook and pen and headÂ  outside to start working. Let the day begin.  Rebecca'S POV  Its now been a couple hours and I'm so tired. My legs feel like they're about to give out any second. I finish the last table and go lean on the counter. I sigh and close my eyes for minute. Then Nancy comes up to me,  ""Darling you look tired, why don't you get your stuff and go home and rest?"" She suggested with a soft smile.  ""But Nancy their is still a couple people left. "" I said, trying to convince her to let me stay, but she wasn't having it.  ""Its okay hun I'll take care of it and anyways your shift ended hours ago, you always stay overtime, you need rest my sweet girl."" She said.  ""Are you sure?Â  You know I don't mind staying I love working here."" I asked to make sure.  ""Yes honey its okay now go get your stuff, its getting late I don't you walking late at night."" She replied. I nodded my head and went to get my bag and put my work stuff away. I said goodnight to Nancy and David and started my way to hell.  As I was walking, I had a feeling like something happened. I don't know what it is but I had a feeling like something big is going to happen and soon. Too lost in my thoughts I didn't notice the bright blue and red lights and the police cars outside my home. I felt my heart start beating faster with each second.  Why is the police here? Oh god what if Boris did something and they are going to take me instead? With all those thoughts I didn't notice a police officer walking towards me.  ""Excuse me, Are you Rebecca Anderson?"" Asked the officer.  ""Yes sir, is everything okay?"" I asked, concern clear in my voice.  ""I'm sorry, honey but your stepfather had an overdose and sadly he didn't make it."" He said, pity in his eyes and voice.  I felt my heart stop. Boris is dead. He's finally dead. He can't hurt me anymore. I'm free from his claws. I never thought that he would die before me, I always thought that maybe he would go too far someday and kill me for good. My dream has come true.  But then suddenly, a thought came to mind. Where will I go? I don't have a father, my mother always told me that when he found out she's pregnant he told her that he didn't want me and left. I have no aunts, uncles, grandparents that I know about.  I have heard about the foster system and I don't wanna go from one bad house to another.  ""But where will I go? I don't have anyone that can take me in."" I said, fear gripping my heart and chest.  ""We will take you to the station to get a blood sample and see if you have any relatives that would like to take you in. If not then you will be placed in an orphanage or the foster system. For now why don't you go pack your stuff and then we will go ok?"" He suggested, sympathy clear in his voice.  I nodded and went to the house to get my stuff. I didn't have a lot of stuff so it didn't take me long to pack them up. I had two shirts, two sweatshirts, one pair of sweatpants, one pair of leggings and a pair of underwear and a bra. I put them in my backpack and took out the money I have been saving all my life. I counted them and they turned out to be 1,500 dollars.  I put them in my bag and looked at the room one last time. The thought of leaving sounds so surreal, It feels too good to be true. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 3
 I looked at the room one last time and went downstairs. When I reached down I went to the officer that I talked with before and told him I was ready. We got inside the car and started driving towards the station. Once we reached we parked and went inside. He told me to sit down and wait for him to come back.  Once he came back he took my blood and told me the results will be back in an hour. It was 8:30 by now and I was exhausted. So I closed my eyes and I felt myself drift off.  ONE HOUR LATER  I felt someone shaking me from my shoulder and I immediately shot up thinking it was Boris. But once I saw the officer I relaxed. But he had a wide grin on his face which confused me. But what he said next confused me even more.  ""Well I have some good news for you, we found someone that would love to take you in."" He said with a wide smile.  "" Who?"" I asked curiously.  ""Your father and older brothers."" He replied.  I stood there frozen. I couldn't hear anything else he was saying. 'Father', that word kept repeating in my head over and over again. Why would he want me now? Why? He could have saved me years of pain and anguish and now he wants me? I couldn't believe this. My ears kept ringing, my heart kept beating out of my chest.  I didn't notice the officer calling my name until he started shaking my shoulder. I flinched and stepped away from him with wide eyes and mouth hanging open.  ""F-father?"" I whispered, still in shock about what I was just told.  ""Yes father, isn't that great? Well how about you rest for a while, it'll be a couple hours till he arrives since he's coming from New York."" He explained.  I nodded, I couldn't form any words, nothing could come out of my mouth. Its like my tongue was tied,  'Father' I have a father and he said I have brothers.  How many brothers do I have? Will they like me? What if they hate me? What if they never wanted a sister? Oh god what if they hurt me? I could barely keep up with Boris and now a father and brothers. I couldn't think anymore as I could feel a headache starting. I rubbed my temples and took two painkillers.  My body hurts so much and with this new information. I rested my head against the wall and thought about something, will this be my new start with my new family or will it be my new hell? With that I drifted off.  Arthur'S POV  I'm sitting in my office signing papers for the company and looking at a few designs for my next opening club.Â  Sighing and taking a small sip of the rich alcoholic flavor I lean my head back on my leather brown chair trying to ease the headache that's forming.  I suddenly get a call from an unknown number. I usually never answer but my gut was telling me to and my gut is always right. So I picked up the phone and answered.  ""Hello""I said coldly.  ""I-is t-this Mr Arthur Jackson?"" The person on the other line stuttered. Since I'm in the mafia I'm always cold and rude except with my family.  ""Yes, now who are you and what do you want?"" He's wasting my time I need to finish work so I can be on time for dinner with my sons.  ""Sir this is Texas Police Station we have your daughter here, her DNA matched with yours and she doesn't have a guardian, her stepfather just died. Would you like to take her in? If not she will be placed in an orphanage."" The officer said making my hand freeze midair from where I was signing.  What the fuck is he talking about? I don't have a daughter, I mean, I have always wanted a daughter but me and my ex-wife didn't have one. And I never slept with another woman.  ""Listen you have the wrong number I don't have a daughter."" I answered rudely.  I was starting to get annoyed they can't even dial a number correctly.  ""Sir your ex- wifes name was Margaret Michael right?""Asked the officer.  What does that bitch have to do with anything? She could be dead for I care.""Yes why ?"" I asked getting really confused.""And she left you and your sons and ran away right?"" By now I was really starting to get mad. What the fuck does he think this is?A guessing game?  ""Yes now spit it out I'm fucking busy ""  ""Sir your wife changed her name and she was pregnant when she ran away."" He replied.  I sat their frozen. No this can' be possible, she wouldn't just take my child away from me, this is impossible. Fuck I can't even think clearly. I must have been quite for too long because the officer spoke again.  ""Sir are you still there ?""I cleared my throat and replied ""Yes I am can you send a photo of her and what's her name?"" I spoke calmly after taking a few deep breaths.""Yes sir I will send a photo and her name is Rebecca Alessandra Anderson."" Said the officer.  ""So would you like to take her in? "" Asked the officer.  ""Yes I will take her in I will be there in a few hours since i'm coming from New York. "" I replied, feeling my throat clog up.  ""Ok sir I will get the papers ready for when you come."" I hung up and put my phone on the table. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 4
 I couldn't believe this, a daughter, my daughter, I have a daughter. FUCK,that bitch, how could she? How could she keep my daughter away from me, my principessa, my babygirl. I missed 17years of her life from that bitch. I could never forgive myself. I felt something wet on my cheek. I raised my hand and wiped my cheek, I didn't even realize I was crying. I haven't cried in 30 years. I threw my phone across the room in frustration and watched it as it smashed in a thousand pieces. But that wasn't enough  I called my pilot from my other phone after hanging up with the officer.  "" Get the jet ready we're going to Texas."" I said as soon as he answered. ""Yes sir."" After that I couldn't control my anger anymore.  I sent a message to my 2nd oldest ""Get a duffle bag ready we're going to Texas."" Their was an instant reply ""Yes dad."" good.I still need to take my anger out on something. I threw my glass coffee table across the room and watched as it broke in a million pieces. I kept throwing everything in my office. I didn't keep a single thing. At the end my office was trashed with glass everywhere and papers on the floor.  I took a deep breath and thought of how I'm going to tell my sons. I know one thing and that they're going to be happy. All of my sons wanted a baby sister ever since they were young. And now that they have a baby sister they're going to be over the moon.  I took a long deep breath and pressed the speaker that is connected in the whole house so no matter where they are they can still here ""FAMILY MEETING NOW DON'T BE FUCKING LATE.""  Let's see how it goes.  While I was walking down the stairs, I felt my phone vibrate in my black trousers. I paused my steps and unlocked my phone and opened the e-mail sent from the officer. Once I opened it and saw the picture I stood there frozen in my spot. There was a beautiful girl that looked to be in her teenage years. She had blue- greenish eyes that looked absolutely fetching. Her light brunette hair looked so soft and silky and they were a little past her shoulders. Her face had had nothing on it, not even an acne scar. Her eyebrows were arched and she had a cute button nose.  In that moment all my doubts vanished. I now know that this girl is absolutely my daughter. She looks just Constant. Heck they could be twins if not for the obvious age difference. Though, as I looked at the picture more closely I noticed that she looks a bit too skinny and pale.  I immediately started thinking the worst. Was she not fed properly? Didn't they have enough money to buy food? Is she sick? Does she have small appetite? Was she being starved? I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and continued walking down the stairs and passed the kitchen until I reached the living room where I could hear my sons bickering and yelling.  I took a breath and opened the living room doors, immediately all the yelling and shouting stopped as soon I stepped in the room. You see, the very first thing I taught my sons is respect. Respect is very important in general but more important in the underworld. People need to respect you in order for you to be powerful and strong. Although my sons and I are extremely close they make sure to never disrespect me or their elders, their is always boundaries. But if a person hurts their family, then it doesn't matter if they are old or young.  Family should always come first no matter what and I made sure to engrave that into their minds 'prima la familia.' Is our motto and we will always live by it till we take our last breaths.  I enter the living room and look around to make sure that all my sons are here. And sure enough, they are all here. Everyone has confused faces on expect Constant and Eamonn who are looking at me emotionlessly but I could see the curiosity swimming in their eyes.  ""What do you wanna talk about dad?"" Grumbled Kenny, who looked like he just woke up from a very good nap.  ""I got a very intriguing call today. "" I started, but got cut off by Eamonn ""What call?"" I shot him a glare and saw him shiver and he muttered a small 'sorry.' I was too happy to care about being mad at him right now.  ""Don't interrupt me boy.""I said and he averted his eyes away from me in shame.  ""What was the call about dad?"" Asked Geraint calmly and respectfully.  ""Well boys I got a call from Texas police station and he informed me that Margaret died 3 years ago.""Â  I Informed calmly and waited for them to absorb the new information.I looked at my sons and saw that they had disgusted looks on their faces. The boys never really liked their mother. She never treated them well and never took of them and their necessities.  ""That witch was never and will never be our mother."" Spat Enoch.  And a chorus of ' yeses' and nods of approval were thrown his way.  ""What does that have to do with us dad ?""Asked Hawke.  ""It turns out when she ran away she got remarried, and he died a couple hours ago from an overdose "" I said.  Once I got nods to continue I continued ""And I need to go to the station because there's a special someone waiting for me."" Ismiled wildly at them.  All of them looked at me weirdly because I rarely smile. Maybe a sadistic smile but that doesn't count.  ""Who is the special someone?"" Asked Kent. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 5
 ""My daughter"" I smiled wildly as I thought of my little princess and how she's going to be in my arms soon.  The mafia princess is coming home.  My thoughts of my babygirl were soon cut off by all of them asking, more like yelling ""WHAT?!!!"" Shouted all of them.  ""Let me explain "" they nodded and I soon continued, ""Turns out when Margaret ran away she was pregnant and she didn't tell me and when I tried finding her, looks like she changed her name and ran away so I could't find her, trust me when I got that call I was as shocked as you, and when the officer told me she matched my DNA I was so happy, I always wanted a daughter and you guys always wanted a little sister, so that's it.""  I finished and I looked at them all. I saw different emotions, Constant looked emotionless but I could still see the happiness and contentment in his eyes, Geraint, Frankie, and Hawke all had small smiles on their faces and tears of joy in their eyes. Eamonn looked mad, which I couldn't understand why , Eamonn has anger issues and could barely control it sometimes.  I made a mental note to ask him why he's mad  later. Enoch was jumping around cheering and hugging his brothers. Kenny and Kent were already making plans of what they can do, where they can go, and more stuff. And lastly, my youngest son, Isaac, he was sitting on the couch and had a small smile resting on his face. When he thought no one was looking, I saw him take off his glasses and wipe them from tears that dropped on them. He, then proceeded to wipe the tears in his eyes.  ""WE FINALLY HAVE A BABY SISTER !!!!!"" Yelled Enoch making us all laugh ""YESSSSS FINALLY WER'RE NOT THE YOUNGEST ANYMORE!!!""  Yelled Kenny and Kent making us chuckle softly at their silly antics.  ""Technically you're not the youngest, Lester is, aren't you baby bro?"" Smiled Frankie ruffling Isaac's brunette hair.  Lester only huffed in amusement and fixed his hair back to how it was.  ""Wait do you have a picture of her? We wanna see her ""Asked Hawke, all the others nodded in agreement.  I nodded my head and fished out my phone out of my pocket and looked up my babygirl's cute face. I motioned for them to come closer, and I gave Constant my phone and immediately the all of them surrounded him to take a look.  All I heard were gasps in the big modern living room. All of them were staring the phone intensely  And a few sniffs were heard indicating some of them are crying.  ""She's so pretty. "" Mumbled Geraint.  ""She's soooo cute Ahhhh!!!"" Gushed Enoch.  ""She's so adorable"" Smiled softly Frankie as he looked at his sister's photo.  ""She's so precious."" Whispered Hawke, Kenny and Kent nodded their heads, agreeing.  Eamonn just stood there frozen looking at the photo in amazement.  ""She looks just like Constant"" Whispered Lester.  Everyone gasped and looked at him with wide eyes and mouthes open. Lester rarely talks, he only talks with his twins, he's just quite, he likes to observe more. So we were surprised when he spoke now. He glared at them and they all looked away from him.  Constant still hasn't looked away from the phone yet. Its like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He then spoke in the most serious and coldest voice, ""No boy will ever come near my baby sister.""  Getting a 'Fuck yeah' from the rest of his brothers as their eyes filled with determination - a sort of promise that no one will ever think about breaking their baby sister's heart or think about hurting her.  I had messaged Geraint earlier to pack a small bag. So, when I got a message from the pilot telling me that the plane was ready. I told them that its time to go. Kent started throwing a fit about how he wanted to go get his sister himself but one look from Constant was enough to make him quite as he started muttering about how we were being 'unfair and mean' I just shook my head at him softly. That boy never fails to amaze me with his goofiness and energy.  I looked at Constant and nodded at him, me telling him to take care of younger brothers till I come back and him nodding at me back at me and silently telling me to bring his baby sister home.  I looked at Geraint and told him that we need to leave he nodded and made his way to the waiting car outside. I looked around one last time and left making my to the car. I got in and soon we were on our way to the airport.  We reached 20 mins later and went on the plane. We buckled up and soon enough we were in the air and on our way to my princess. With that thought in mind I drifted off with my daughter on my mind.  Arthur'S POV  We're now outside the police station and now that we're here it feels more real than before.The fact that I have a daughter becomes more real and I couldn't help but feel nervous.  What if she doesn't like me? What if she tells me she doesn't want to be with us? I couldn't help but the nervousness that settled in me. I took a deep breath and looked at the building that has my daughter and the fact that shes waiting for me to come and take her home. I looked at Geraint one last time and nodded at him, He nodded back, and with that we went inside. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 6
 We took powerful strides inside. We had our blank faces on and immediately the once noisy station was now dead silent. You could hear a pin drop from how silent it is. We were greeted by a young officer who looked to be in his early twenties. Once he looked at us, recognition flashed through his eyes and his breathing quickened. Its not everyday you have a mafia don in a police station.Then, He led us to small office that seemed more small with me and Geraint in it due to our muscular and extremely builds. He led us to another young officer that explained the details and papers so that I can take Rebecca's guardianship.  I signed all necessary papers, and I now have all guardianship over my daughter. Once everything was finalized he told me that Rebecca's sleeping in the other room and then proceeded to go and wake her up. He then came back with Rebecca behind him and it looks like she didn't notice us it. She was staring at the floor and it looks like she was deep in thought with how she has a small cute frown on her face and a small pout on her lips, which might I add, looks absolutely adorable.  The officer then called her name and that we've arrived, she looked up and immediately her blue-green eyes made contact with Geraint's blue ones. I watched as he looked at her softly and how he had tears in his eyes. I looked at my princepissa and went towards her.  Rebecca'S POV  My father is here. He's really here, I'm so nervous. What if he doesn't like? What if he hurts me like they did? What if he sends me to another orphanage once we reach New York? My thoughts were soon cut off by a pair of strong muscly arms wrapping around me and my nostrils were filled by a manly cologne that smells and screams rich.  Once I came back to my senses and realized I was trapped, I felt my body tense and I stood there frozen. But a couple seconds later my body relaxed and I melted into that persons embrace. I don't know why but I felt safe in that persons arms, like nothingÂ  in the world will hurt me. I have never felt like this before. I wrapped my skinny and bony arms around the man and my body relaxed.Â  A few minutes later we both let go, I looked up to see who that unknown man was.  I saw a tall man that looked old and young at the same time . He looked like he's 5o years old. He had a light dark stubble, he had brunette hair that looked exactly like mine, It was gelled back and not a hair was out of place, his eyebrows were plucked and arched perfectly, the kind were that it made women envy their eyebrows. He had small wrinkles around his eyes that you would't notice unless you were looking really closely. His jawline looked sharp and defined. And he was extremely muscular and the Armani suit looked like it would tear any second at any sudden movements. And he's tall, my guess is that he's 6'8. He could crush me with his pinky. I would have to look up at him and crane my neck up. Ughhh he looks like he could eat me with my 5'2 height. He then spoke,  ""Hi principessa I'm your father, Arthur Jackson.""  He spoke softly as if he would speak any louder I would break.  ""Hi its nice to meet you."" I spoke smiling shyly but never making eye contact with him, just looking at the collar of his Armani shirt. I don't wanna make him mad when I don't know his intentions yet.He seems confused as to why I'm not looking him in the eye but chooses not to comment on it which makes me sigh a sigh of relief. He then spoke again ""It's nice to meet you too princess, I'm sorry I didn't know about you earlier."" He said softly. But what does he mean he didn't know about me? I didn't have time to linger on the thought because he spoke again.""I want to introduce you to someone princess,"" He then gestured to the other man that looks like him and seems to be 6'6 in height ""Princess this is your second oldest brother, introduce your self son."" He said, nodding his head.  ""Hi bambina, I'm Geraint its so good to finally meet you."" spoke Geraint softly and then he brought his arms out. Out of instinct I flinched lightly which didn't look like it went unnoticed by them but thankfully they didn't comment on it. He then proceeded to hug me and I immediately responded to the hug. I felt so safe in their arms, like nothing could hurt me.  I felt something wet on my shoulder I looked and saw Geraint crying, I pulled away and brought his face closer to me. I wiped his tears with the pads of my thumbs,he then brought his hands and putÂ  them on top of mine and kissed the palms of my hands. I then whispered softly ""Why are you crying ?"" He wrapped his arms around my waist and brought me in another hug. I bit my lip to stop myself from screaming in pain. He kept hugging me tightly and buried his face in my neck. He then whispered ""I'm so happy to have you in my life sorella."" I was happy that someone would actually care for me. Maybe I can have a new start. I understood what he meant because i'm fluent in a lot of languages. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 7
 After couple of minutes he let go and wiped his tears. Then my 'father' asked ""Are you ready to go sweetheart?"" I replied ""Yes I am."" but then Geraint asked, ""Where's your stuff bambina?"" I pointed to my backpack and said ""This is all i have."" I whispered looking at the floor. I saw Arthur and Geraint sharing a look. Its like they're communicating through their eyes. Then Arthur finally said, ""Its okay darling, lets get going now."" He told me with a small smile on his face and I couldn't help but give him one back.  We made our way out of the police station and into beautiful car. I stood there gawking at the metal of hunk. ""You like it?"" Asked Geraint with a soft chuckle. ""Are you kidding me?! I love cars!!"" I replied happily. Then Arthur said, ""Looks like we have another Eamonn."" he said with a small laugh.  Wait who's Eamonn? They both looked at my confused face and then Arthur told me, ""Don't worry you will meet him later."" I just nodded my head and soon enough we were on our way to the airport.  Instead of driving in the normal route Geraint went towards the private planes one. I sat there confused until we reached a matte black plane. Geraint stopped and came and opened my door. I thanked him shyly and he just gave me a small smile. I then turned to Arthur and asked him, ""Why are we here aren't we supposed to go that way?"" I questioned him and pointed to the normal route.  He laughed softly and said, ""No baby we have a private plane."" I stood there looking like a fish out of water opening and closing my mouth trying to say something. He come and raised his hand and I out of instinct flinched. His hand stopped midway and he looked at me in concern and confusion. I gave him a tight lipped smile and he gave a soft one back.  ""Come on guys lets get going."" Said Geraint. Thank god he came andÂ  saved the tense silence. I noticed there were a lot of guards but I kept my mouth shut. We soon boardedÂ  the plane and were on our way to New York.  I hope this is a fresh start for me. Because if it isn't, I don't know what I'll do and what will happen.  Rebecca'S POV  Once we were in the air, I looked around and everything looked expensive. From the floor, to the seats, to the ceiling, everything screamed 'rich' and I couldn't help but gawk at everything. Everything was so shiny I was afraid to touch anything.  ""Do you like it princess?"" Asked Arthur.  ""Yeah it's really pretty."" I said. I looked outside the window and watched the white fluffy clouds. I started thinking of how my life changed so fast. I must have been too lost in my thoughts because I felt someone put their hand on top of mine. I immediately pulled away and looked up and saw Arthur and Geraint looking at me in shock, confusion and concern. ""What was that princess?"" asked Arthur. I looked at Geraint and saw he was waiting for me to answer.  I never liked physical contact especially when its not initiated by me. That basically happens when you were getting beaten everyday by your mom and stepdad. I can never be able to tell them what happened to me. They won't want me anymore and they will throw out. I mean, who wants a damaged and abused girl as a daughter and sister? Once they know they will be disgusted and hate me and then they will throw me into an orphanage.  I flinched when a hand was being waved in front of my face. I looked wide-eyed at the person who was waving the hand and saw that it was Geraint. ""Are you okay baby?"" He asked in a tone that sounded like .... worry? But why would he be worried? He just met me like .... an hour ago. But when I looked into his eyes trying to detect that his tone of worry was a lie, I couldn't see anything but honesty and panic.  ""Yeah I am I just don't like physical contact."" I muttered hoping they would believe me. It didn't look like they did but they didn't say anything which I'm glad for.  He leaned forward and grabbed my soft, small hand in his big and rough one and gave it a small reassuring squeeze. ""You must be confused, you can ask us anything you want okay?"" He said softly like he didn't want to scare me.  ""So .... umm did you eat lots of vegetables when you were a kid?"" I asked but almost immediately my eyes went wide about what I said. I looked at both of them and saw that both of were trying to hold their laughter in. It didn't last long as both of them burst out laughing, clutching their stomachs as tears fell from their eyes. I just pouted at them and waited for them to be finished with their laughing session.  After they calmed down, Geraint said, ""Oh My God I haven't had such a good laugh in such a long time.""Â  he laughed again ""But, to answer your question, I did eat a lot of vegetables, dad even would force us to or he'd take our toys.""  I sighed sadly for my poor self and short height and my malnourished body. 
 
Book #01:Chapter 8
 ""So like what do you for work?"" I asked trying to change the subject. As I asked this question I noticed both of them tensed and looked at each other, like their communicating with their eyes. After a couple mins with an awkward silence Arthur cleared his throat and looked at me and said, ""Well darling we own a chain of clubs, restaurant's, hotels and the largest companies in the world."" Ok I must admit thats cool, I mean I knew the moment they told me they owned a private jet that they were loaded. But that just proves my point even more.""Thats nice, you must be proud of your achievements"" I said shyly, I mean who wouldn't be proud of things like that.  He smiled wildly at me and then kissed the top of my hand that he was holding before. I went to ask another question but I was cut by a yawn that had my eyes watering. Dad chucked softly and said, ""Why don't you get some sleep and we'll wake you up when we land hmm?"" I nodded my and soon he led me to a private room. I was too tired to admire the extravagant room and went and lied down on the bed. He left after kissing my forehead and tucking me in. As soon as my head hit the pillow I was out like a light.  TIME SKIP  I got woken up by Geraint telling me we are about to land. We went outside and sat down and I looked up and saw dad smiling at me and I smiled back. Once we have arrived we thanked the pilot and went down the stairs. We walked and soon came to a stop in front of a 'Blazer' which was in a matte black color. Geraint opened the back door for me and I muttered a small 'thank you' with a blush. No one has ever done that for me before m. He smiled softly and went to the other side of the car and went beside me in the backseat, as dad sat in the passengers seat besides the driver.  ""Are you hungry sweetheart? You haven't had anything since we left the station"" Asked Arthur. ""No I'm not hungry at the moment...thank you though.""  Its true though I wasn't hungry. Boris never really fed me saying how I wasn't 'worthy of food'. I can go for weeks without food. I have a small stomach anyway due to being starved. Even if I was hungry I was used to it and would never tell them if I was. I don't want them to be mad at me when we just met.  ""We'll eat when we get home."" Geraint said smiling wildly. I smiled back and continued looking out the window. But then a thought came to my mind, What if they aren't as welcoming as dad and Geraint? What if they don't like me? What if -  My thoughts were cut off by a hand on top of mine. I looked at the hand and looked up at Geraint ""You'll be fine, they're gonna love you."" He said and gave me small soft smile. I smiled back at him and felt myself relax a little. Soon we came up to a black gate and stopped, the driver pulled down the window and started tying a password on the keypad that was attached to the wall. Once he finished we continued driving and we then came to a stop where there was a big mansion that looked absolutely beautiful and magnificent.  There were a couple of expensive looking cars that were parked outside and then Geraint opened the door and gave me his hand and helped me down considering my short height. Once I got out I took a really good look at the mansion, more like castle. 'There more loaded than i thought'. As I continued gawking at the house in front of me with wide eyes and my mouth open. I heard someone chuckle behind me ""Do you like it?"" Arthur asked. ""Its really beautiful."" I whispered still looking in amazement. I never saw a house so pretty, well except on Pinterest, which doesn't count.  ""Well come on let's go inside the others are dying to meet you."" said Geraint. Once we were inside  Dad suddenly yelled ""BOYS COME DOWNSTAIRS NOW"". I flinched from his loud voice which scared me, as it gives me flashbacks of when Boris would yell at me and start to hurt me. I didn't notice when Geraint came and stood next to me and asked ""Are you okay bambina?""I was shaking I couldn't breath properly, it felt like I was drowning.He then came and put his hands on my shoulders and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from hissing in pain.  ""Rebecca are you ok?"" Asked Geraint again worriedly. I looked at him through my lashes and nodded my head. ""Yes I-I'm fine"" I gave him a weak smile and cleared my throat to get rid of the lump that formed in my throat. He didn't seem to believe me but thankfully didn't comment on it. Just then we heard loud footsteps, like a herd of elephants running.  Then 8 boys, more like men came in the entrance and stood there frozen. They were all extremely tall and well built. Though, all of them looked similar to each other. I'm guessing they're all siblings. But who are they? Dad mentioned brothers but its not possible that all of them are my brothers, right?

I go every week and i found myself looking forward to going just to see him. We would flirt and i would tell him how good he was at making me laugh and how cute he was he would say he liked my clothes and i had a nice smile. 

I thought we were really hitting it off i even mentioned how i wish someone would see a movie with me and and how i wish i could dress nice for someone wink wink. 

Anyway so this goes on for a few months when last week i came up to talk to him and he started acting real weird and awkward and cold so i laughed and said something like oh did you miss me and i laid my hand on his when the girl behind me pulled my hair and i fell to the floor. 

Turns out this guy had a girlfriend who was one of the docents for the museum. I felt so ambrassed and at this point pissed off i stormed away and i font want to go back. But i do love the museum.

May-Ish, took way too many edibles for the first time and had the biggest panic attack ive ever had, also had a Reign Energy drink

 ( I have never had any issues with Energy drinks as I had a decent diet and drank enough water.)

 Went to the er, stayed overnight ( heartrate was incredibly high ranging from  190-240) and was diagnosed with low potassium and low iron, paroxysmal tachycardia and anxiety.
Ive been taking iron nightly since then and trying to eat things with iron in them . Salmon, nut bars, oats, protein cereal, etc. I try to eat the best i can with occasional days where i dont eat due to money. They told me no energy drinks for a few months. When I started trying them again I stuck with just monsters or redbull or coffee and I didnt have issues. Until recently. 

The past week, I went to gym and almost fainted, ( weightlifting ) my heart rate went up exceptionally and I had to rush home. Ever since then ive been bed ridden, despite cutting caffeine, i feel like my ears are stopped up, that i have tunnel, blurry vision, I cant feel my arms and legs but i can move them, and im also way more scared than usual, especially of death. I couldn't take it anymore ( Dramaine was not helping ) and I just went to the clinic.


In the waiting room with my fiancé, I felt like I was having a fucking stroke.
I couldn't answer anything in the sheet they gave me i forgot my partners phone number for the emergency contact. And my heart was beating literally every millisecond. I couldn't feel my face and I felt like I couldn't see at all and my hands were trembling to the point I couldn't use my phone. 

Eventually they called my name and i was able to distract myself enough


( Main problem \/) 
. In there they did an ekg and basically told me my heart rate was high but the blood flow was going to my arms and legs. They said they didnt see paroxysmal tachycardia either. 🥲??? And that its probably anemia ( Somehow despite taking iron pills) and they sent me off with Nebivolol 10 mg and Meclinize. Which the Nebivolol ive been petrified to take, ive only been taking it halved and its helped my heart rate a bit but im still dizzy, feeling like my body isn't there and im completely out of it mentally. 
They said to come back in two weeks and gave me a lab order to check cbc and tsh. 

I feel so lost, i had another panic attack over this and im just horrified. Im on my period too this morning but there is little blood flow currently and ive been eating so well too. Im also a normal weight for my height. I feel like my life is over and im so afraid of having heart failure or a stroke because of the Nebivolol. ",1,1755821231.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1mwrjj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mwrjj8/for_74_days_i_mailed_back_a_mysterious_box_i/,"For 74 days, I mailed back a mysterious box. I forgot yesterday, and now the thing that was inside is in my house.","It’s the sound that gets you. Not the footsteps themselves, but the silence between them. The sound of weight settling on an old floorboard. The sound of something heavy thinking about where to go next. I’m wedged in the back of my bedroom closet, with the sharp scent of mothballs and old wool filling my lungs. My phone is dead. The dresser I pushed against the door wouldn't stop a child, let alone… this. Out in the hall, the floor creaks again. Closer this time. It knows I’m in here. It’s just a matter of time. And all I can think about is that damned brown paper box. The one I forgot to send back.

It all started seventy-four days ago. Or maybe it’s seventy-five now. I’ve lost count. The first time it appeared, I thought it was a mistake. A simple cardboard box, about the size of a shoebox, wrapped in plain brown paper and tied with coarse twine. No return address. No postage. Just my name and address, printed in a stark, blocky font. I took it inside. It was surprisingly heavy, dense, like it was filled with packed, damp soil. Inside, there was nothing but a single, folded piece of paper. On it, the same blocky print: ""Return it before it's too late.""

I laughed. A prank, obviously. I tossed it in the recycling. The next morning, it was back. Identical in every way. The same weight, the same twine, the same note. This time, I didn't laugh. I felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach. I took it to the post office, paid the postage, and sent it to a fake address in a city I’d never been to. The next day, my porch was empty. I felt a wave of relief so profound it almost brought me to my knees. The day after that, it was back.

And so the ritual began. Every morning at 8:00 AM sharp, it would be there. I would pick it up, feel its unnerving weight, and drive it to the post office by noon. I stopped wondering what was inside. I stopped questioning the logic. It was just a part of my life, a bizarre and stressful chore. The note was no longer a threat; it was just an instruction. My life became a small, gray loop, and the box was its anchor.

Until yesterday. A storm had knocked out the power. My alarm didn't go off. A frantic work call ate up my morning. A splitting headache blinded me all afternoon. I collapsed into bed without a second thought. It wasn't until I woke up in the dead of night, thirsty for a glass of water, that I saw it. Sitting on the small table in the hallway, bathed in moonlight. The box. The post office was closed. It was too late.

I tried to sleep, but it was impossible. The box’s presence in the house felt like a physical weight, a silent accusation. I told myself it was just a box. I was lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, when I heard it. A single, soft thump from the living room directly below me. My entire body went rigid. It was the sound of a heavy book falling flat on a carpet. I held my breath, listening. Silence. It was just the house settling. I was turning onto my side when I heard it again. This time, it wasn't a thump. It was a footstep. Unmistakable. Heavy, but careful. The sound of something large trying its best to be quiet. It was closer now, by the base of the stairs. I didn't move for the rest of the night. I just lay there, listening to a silence that felt charged and watchful.

The sun rose, but it brought no comfort. I was exhausted. I crept out of my room, and the house was empty. The box was still on the hall table. As I stood there, staring at it, the doorbell rang. It was 8:00 AM. I opened the door to find a second package on my doorstep. Identical to the first. My blood ran cold. Now there were two. Two identical brown paper boxes, sitting side-by-side like a pair of unblinking, malevolent eyes. The ritual was broken, and I had no idea what the new rules were.

That night, the fear was a living thing. The footsteps started downstairs again, but this time they were bolder. No attempt at stealth. Just a slow, deliberate tread. Thump. Pause. Thump. Then, the first creak on the staircase. It was coming up. It reached the top of the landing and started down the hall, directly toward my room. The footsteps stopped right outside my door. I held my breath until my lungs burned. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw the thin sliver of light from the hallway under the door. And then I saw a shadow blot it out. It wasn't the shape of a person's feet. It was too tall, too solid. It stretched the entire width of the door. It just stood there for what felt like an eternity, and then, with that same slow, heavy tread, it moved on.

I didn't sleep. The house felt wrong, violated. A coffee mug I’d left in the sink was now on the arm of the sofa. The closet door at the end of the hall was wide open. The thermostat had been turned down to 55 degrees. It wasn’t just passing through my house anymore; it was exploring it. Making itself at home. At 8:00 AM, the doorbell rang. I didn't answer it. I already knew what was there.

Tonight, I didn't even try to pretend I could sleep in my bed. As soon as darkness fell, I pushed my heavy oak dresser in front of the bedroom door. I’m in the closet now. I’ve been here for hours. The footsteps started an hour ago. They came straight up the stairs. Straight down the hall. They stopped outside my door, just like last night. The silence stretched on, thick and suffocating. Then came a new sound. A soft, dry scratching on the wood of the door. Like fingernails dragging slowly from top to bottom. It stopped. And then it happened.

A single, impossibly gentle knock. Just one. *Tap.*

It wasn't a sound of aggression. It was a sound of invitation. A polite request for entry. And in that moment of pristine, crystalline terror, I finally understood. The daily ritual, the endless returns... I wasn't keeping something out. I was a zookeeper. The box wasn't a curse; it was a cage. And for seventy-four days, I had been dutifully shipping its occupant away. Until I forgot.

And now, the tenant is home. And it wants to come into my room.

That knock… I can still hear it in the silence. It never really stops. But it makes me wonder what I was really doing for all those days. Was I just protecting myself, or was I sending that box along to torment someone else? What do you think the ritual was truly for? Please, I need theories. Let me know in the comments.

And if you want to explore more questions that linger in the dark, I've been documenting these experiences on my channel, **The Umbral Archive**. I recorded an audio version of this whole story... hearing it out loud makes it feel even more real.

That means I have to wash my hair daily, but commercial shampoos have always been a nightmare for my scalp. No matter which brand I tried, I couldn’t use any of them long-term. I’d get dryness, oiliness, itching, pain, tangling, pimples, and get worst of all — thinning hair and hair loss.

My hair thinning reasons are complicated. One major factor is the prolonged presence of cold symptoms in my sinuses. Every week, I experience at least one episode of heavy cold symptoms, and once those subside, I am leaving with persistent coughing. During these periods, my hair turns noticeably softer and thinner. 

On top of that, I discovered I had allergies starting at age 16. Over the years, I tried everything to manage my scalp health:

I tried using only water to clean my hair, but that left it oily and dirty. 

I tried a baking soda solution — but it caused extreme itchiness and hair loss. 

\- I tried using only apple cider vinegar — it left my hair sticky and wet all day as if I hadn’t shampooed in weeks. 

\- I tried Chinese herbal wine — it gave a temporary boost in thickness, but only for a day. 

\- I tried rubbing castor oil into my scalp daily — eventually, it made things worse, reducing hair volume.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make my shampoo.

I’d attempted DIY shampoo in the past, but every trial failed. Back then, I used different oils and coconut milk. The problem? The oil prevents proper cleansing of the scalp and accumulates, causing stickiness that’s difficult to wash off. Coconut milk, on the other hand, is a food and spoils easily, making it a poor choice for a shampoo base.

After countless failed experiments, I finally landed on a recipe that works for me every single day.

\---

# My DIY Shampoo Routine



**1. Mix the Ingredients**

I pour the following into a BPA-free plastic bottle:

\- 5 teaspoons of Bragg organic apple cider vinegar 

\- Powder from 8–10 capsules of NOW Fenugreek powder and a teaspoon of Therapy Roasted Ground Coffee Mexico

\- Dr. Bronner’s Organic Castile liquid soap (just enough for 2–3 weeks of use)



**2. Shake Well** 

I shake the bottle thoroughly to blend it well.



**3. Balance the Ratio** 

The key is to maintain a ratio of apple cider vinegar to castile soap roughly at 1:1. This creates a thick, creamy consistency that’s gentle on my scalp.



**4. Store Properly** 

Because apple cider vinegar is a natural preservative and no water added, this shampoo keeps for up to months.

\---

# A Few Important Notes

Never add oils! I’ve tried coconut oil and aloe oil before, but they build up on my scalp and cause itching. Stick to the basics. As I learned from my earlier failed attempts, coconut milk is also a bad idea — it spoils quickly and doesn’t belong in shampoo.

That is the only DIY shampoo that worked for me. It can cleanse my scalp very well, without the burning sensation that comes from overly alkaline products. Apple cider vinegar also helps prevent fungus from lingering on the scalp. Therapy roasted ground coffee helps balance the vinegar and soap, saving time on fine-tuning the formula. Both fenugreek and coffee offer mild hair root-strengthening benefits.

Since early 2024, I’ve been using this shampoo consistently — more than 18 months now — with great results and no issues. It’s become a reliable part of my daily routine.

\---

# What I Learned from Experimenting



**Test 1: More Apple Cider Vinegar** 

When I increased the vinegar, my hair got sticky. Too much acidity throws off the balance and shows a wet look throughout the day.

**Test 2: More Castile Soap** 

When I increased the castile soap, the shampoo became too alkaline which gave my scalp a burning sensation. It was way too harsh.

\---

# The Optimal Formula

After these tests, I found the perfect balance: an equal amount of apple cider vinegar and castile soap. When mixed right, the shampoo is thick, creamy, and cleanses without any irritation or stickiness.

\---

# Final Thoughts

Most people worry about DHT and hair loss, but I’ve found that using an overly alkaline shampoo can be a bigger culprit. Since switching to my DIY blend, I’ve seen new hair growth on the top of my scalp.

If you’re tired of commercial shampoos making things worse, try mixing up your own. Perhaps the best solution is the one you make yourself.",1,1755821031.0,NoPoo,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Warning Message

Three minutes from now, the people around you will turn into zombies.

Upon receiving the text message, Maura Moore's initial reaction was one of disbelief. It was a recent popular internet joke, a script played out by many bloggers who wrote about the apocalypse. Without missing a beat, she replied: Is that you, Jana? Or is it Yvett? Are you messing with me? It's not April Fool's Day today.

No sooner had she sent the message than the lights overhead flickered, causing her heart to leap in her chest.

Rita Lupton, a colleague sitting nearby, couldn't help but look up. “Hmm, that's odd. When was the last time we had a power outage in Kheawood? What's going on?”

Maura was a twenty-two-year-old intern at an internet company, where working overtime was the norm. It was six in the evening, and, being early winter, darkness had already fully descended. It seemed as though rain was on the horizon, with the branches outside the window swaying faintly in the gloom.

Like the shadowy beasts of the dark fairy tales, baring their fangs and claws, ready to drag people into the abyss.

Maura had always considered herself brave, but when Rita from the neighboring workstation turned to look at her, Maura couldn't help but feel a jolt of fear. Rita's face was pale, and her eyes were rigid, a sight that was truly unnerving. Maura's gaze drifted downward, only to find that the edges of Rita's nails were also turning a ghastly shade of blue.

Rita seemed to find Maura's daydreaming rather odd, moving closer with a hint of concern. “Maura, what's got you so distracted? Be careful, or the director might scold you again.”

The overpowering stench of decay nearly made Maura retch, causing her to abruptly stand up.

The other colleagues in the office also looked up. Everyone was unsure of what was wrong with her.

Maura was noticeably nervous as she swallowed hard, starting to gather her things in preparation to leave. “I'm not feeling well, so I'll head home first. Rita, could you please inform the director about my absence for me?”

After she finished speaking, she quickly grabbed her bag and headed toward the door. She indeed looked a bit off-color.

Rita, who was behind her, seemed utterly confused, wondering aloud, “Why did you suddenly feel unwell out of nowhere? Young people these days are just too pampered. I got bitten by a dog yesterday, got a rabies shot, and yet here I am, still at work. You better watch out. The director might get angry and fire you!”

Upon hearing the final sentence, Maura had already reached the office door. “So be it! I quit!”

Her heart was pounding heavily.

After leaving the office, she glanced at her phone messages. Two minutes had already passed since she received the text. Thankfully, the company wasn't located on a high floor; it was situated on the third floor. After a moment of contemplation, she quickly descended the stairs.

One should never take the elevator when the electrical circuit was unstable. If one ended up trapped inside, it would be disastrous.

She would be a sitting duck.

Maura practically sprinted down the stairs. Just as she reached the bottom of the company building, a piercing scream echoed from above. The passersby around her couldn't help but gasp in shock, their gazes collectively drawn upward.

“Damn, that scared the crap out of me!”

“What's going on? Don't tell me the work stress is getting too much, and someone is thinking of jumping off a building again?”

“Yikes, that was terrifying. Let's get out of here, quick!”

...

Upon hearing the scream, Maura's hands started shaking. She glanced at her phone. Precisely three minutes had passed. She didn't dare to lift her head as she quickly swiped her card and left the technology park.

Once she left the office area, she immediately scanned the code to rent a bike and hurried home, not daring to linger any longer.

She no longer dared to take public transportation.

She hadn't received any new messages, and the cellphone tower signal was sporadically disappearing.

She wanted to send messages to her friends, warning them of the impending danger. But when not a single one could be sent, she knew the world was truly in trouble.

At this point, a storm was brewing.

She rode her bike at a high speed. Thankfully, everyone she passed by behaved normally.

Twenty minutes later, she successfully arrived at the residential area, which somewhat put Maura at ease. She didn't waste any time, and before heading up to her apartment, she stepped into the largest supermarket at the entrance of the residential area. Casually pulling a shopping cart, she began her major shopping spree.

Milk, bread, instant pasta, chocolate, along with a variety of beverages that were high in sweetness and calories.

At that moment, she was largely disoriented, her nerves taut with tension. Her actions were entirely driven by subconscious decisions, guided by her instinct to survive.

After she filled up an entire cart, the stock clerk, Hazel, suddenly expressed her concern, “Young lady, what happened? You don't seem to be in a good state! Are you upset? Why didn't you work overtime today?”

Maura often came to shop after work in the evenings, so the supermarket staff were quite familiar with her.

“Ah, well, I was feeling down, so I decided to have a big meal,” she said.

It seemed as though Maura had just awoken from a daze. She managed a strained smile as she asked Hazel, “By the way, don't you offer delivery service here? Could you help me deliver ten boxes of mineral water? Just drop them off at the eighth floor of Building A. Leaving them in the elevator would be fine.”

Upon hearing the request, Hazel readily agreed, but couldn't help expressing her curiosity, “Why would a young woman like you buy so much bottled water? It would probably take you ages to finish them!”

Maura was stuffing all sorts of canned food into her shopping cart. As she did so, she replied, “I can't be bothered to shop all the time. I got fired from my job today, so starting from tomorrow, I'll be busy looking for work. I won't have time to come back for groceries.”

Upon hearing this, Hazel immediately sighed. “Young people these days are under such tremendous pressure. All right, I'll prepare your bill in a bit, then you can come over to pay. How can a young lady like you constantly consume such junk food? Even if you're in a bad mood, you can't just binge eat and drink like this. It's really harmful to your stomach, you know?”

Upon hearing these caring words, Maura's heart ached. She had been adopted and brought home by an elderly couple. After they passed away and their house was demolished, she had moved here less than a year ago. To be cared for so deeply by a stranger all of a sudden was truly heart-wrenching.

She opened her mouth again and again, but still couldn't bring herself to tell Hazel about the zombie incident.

After all, she didn't have enough evidence to prove that the end of the world and zombies were actually coming.

So, she silently followed Hazel to pay for her items. The kind lady even helped her carefully pack her purchases and accompanied her all the way to the elevator.

Maura hauled up the emergency supplies and ten boxes of bottled water that she had purchased. As the elevator doors closed, she could still hear the security guard casually chatting with Hazel.

“Oh, Hazel. Here delivering goods again? How come this young lady bought so much?”

“The poor woman is in a bad mood after being fired from her job. Says she needs to start job hunting from tomorrow and can't be bothered to keep purchasing bottled water all the time. Young people these days tend to cope with stress by shopping excessively, unlike us older folks who've lived through tougher times, right?”

“Hahaha, that's true.”

After that, Maura couldn't hear anything else. Having reached the eighth floor, she quickly moved her stuff out, then shut the elevator doors before moving everything back to her house. It was only upon returning to this familiar place that she felt somewhat at ease.

She collapsed onto the couch. The overhead light was glaring down at her, so all she could do was close her eyes and attempt to regain her composure, catching her breath in the process. She intended to sort through the pile of supplies by the door later, but something felt off as soon as she closed her eyes.

It was as if she were suddenly experiencing an illusion. With her eyes closed, she could see a Rubik's Cube. However, this was no ordinary cube; it was multifaceted, with countless sides densely packed together.

It was whirling at high speed.

Maura abruptly started retching, completely disoriented by the rapid spinning.

Chapter 2 The Multifaceted Space

She was no stranger to the internet, often interacting with it, and was familiar with online novels. The term “apocalypse” was often associated with the concept of storage space. Thus, through her experimentation, she discovered that this cube was indeed a dimensional storage! This discovery left her with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow.

The joy was in gaining a massive storage space, but the sorrow lay in the realization that the world was truly out of sorts.

Once she regained her senses, the Rubik's Cube ceased to spin, as if its initial spinning was merely a startup ritual.

The dimensional storage cube was now still in the sea of her consciousness, all peaceful and quiet.

After a while, Maura finally managed to regain her composure.

No longer feeling dizzy, she rose and moved toward the window, her gaze falling on the people strolling below. Unaware of what the future held, they carried on as they would on any ordinary day.

Some people were in a rush just after finishing work, while others were out for a stroll with their families after dinner.

Every now and then, delivery drivers would bustle back and forth.

The streetlights bathed everything in a soft halo, casting an aura of extreme bliss. It was an utterly ordinary evening, leaving her to wonder if such moments could ever be witnessed again in the future.

She had been on edge for quite some time. Subsequently, she drew the curtains and swiftly stowed away all the supplies at the door into the storage space. Indeed, it was very convenient.

Turning around, she opened the door on the right side of the entrance. It was a storage room. Inside were three massive shelves and a large freezer.

Thanks to the outbreak of the epidemic, during the lockdown in the neighborhood, there was a scarcity of food and drink.

Maura was quite the survival enthusiast, and as such, she had a penchant for stockpiling food. After the epidemic ended, her desire to hoard only grew stronger.

That was why she had such a well-stocked pantry, filled with canned goods that had a shelf life of up to ten years. There were a total of twenty boxes, each filled with various types of canned food.

There was a mix of both meat and vegetables.

In addition to ten boxes of assorted flavored compressed biscuits and ten boxes of high-calorie energy bars, there were also five huge bags of pasta. A variety of instant foods and self-heating meals were also available. Even mineral water was well-stocked, with ten boxes at the ready.

As for perishable items like milk and vegetables, she would occasionally replenish them in her usual routine.

There was still quite a lot left in the large kitchen refrigerator.

The storage room held a variety of condiments as well. Among them, there were three boxes of salt, with the rest divided into several portions for each type, such as ketchup, mustard, vinegar, and so on.

Besides that, she also had survival supplies such as a backpack filled with everything a hardcore survivalist could dream of. It contained numerous handy tools, as well as enough food for one person.

Outside the backpack, there was a chainsaw, a hatchet, and a dagger.

She even had three containers of gasoline.

Primarily, they would be used for generating electricity. In case of a power outage, she also had a domestic generator at her disposal.

Of course, there were also several large boxes of medical supplies. These included items for stopping bleeding, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and bandaging wounds. There were both oral and topical medications, as well as vitamins.

These were all things Maura typically kept around for her own amusement. However, looking at this storage room now, she couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions. She truly never thought they would come in handy.

She swiftly stashed all these items into the dimensional storage cube, feeling the connection between her and this space. The reason she could confidently store all her supplies in this space was largely due to this sensation.

There was a sensation of a blood-tied connection. At least when she was still alive, everything would be there, and only she alone could take or put things in.

It gave a strong sense of security.

After emptying the entire storage room, she moved on to the bathroom. There was a large tub in the bathroom that was kept filled with water year-round. After some experimentation, she found that she could store the water directly into one of the spaces on another facet of the cube without needing a container. So she turned on the faucet, planning to transfer the water from the tub into the space periodically.

She planned to fill one of the compartments with water. She estimated that each compartment was roughly 200 cubic meters. This multi-faceted space, reminiscent of a Rubik's Cube, seemed to have countless sides.

She couldn't even keep count!

Maura suddenly felt a lot more at ease. After that, she chose not to venture downstairs to gather more supplies, as the night was always more perilous than the day.

She decided to first observe the changes quietly.

Hence, she decided to have dinner and headed to the kitchen. Despite working at an internet company, she was fortunate enough to have alternating weekends off. Therefore, she would prepare some ready-made meals for herself on weekends and store them in the freezer. When it was time to eat, like now, all she had to do was heat it up in the microwave for three minutes.

And so, a steaming hot plate of pasta bolognese was ready. Maura had also washed a small bowl of fruit, filled with large, eye-protecting blueberries.

In the end, she carried her meal to the coffee table in the living room to enjoy, casually switching on the television as she did. Despite the popularity of projectors among the younger crowd, she maintained a preference for the television. It held a nostalgic charm for her, evoking memories of watching shows with her elderly adoptive parents, a sentiment that brought her comfort.

Upon turning on the television, it was the local news channel that the three of them used to frequently watch.

“Welcome to the latest daily news. This is your reporter, Wendy, bringing you the updates. According to submissions from local residents, a harrowing incident occurred at Hypernet Corporation, located on the third floor of Building B in the technology park's Phase Two. The individual involved was a young woman who was bitten by her colleague, a certain Ms. Lupton. Unfortunately, despite Ms. Lupton having received a rabies vaccination just the previous night, the onset of the disease was alarmingly swift.”

After switching on the television, Maura took a bite of her meal, only to be taken aback by what she heard. She abruptly looked up to see the female reporter in the video, her face filled with regret as she announced the news. Following that, she brought up the issue of having dogs on leashes during walks.

The highlight of this news program was always the latest daily scoop. It provided updates on all the recent happenings within the city each day.

Hence, an event that occurred just after six in the evening could still be promptly reported in the news.

As the reporter provided commentary, a clip from an incident in the office was shown in the top left corner. From the perspective of the person filming, when Rita initially went berserk and bit Alice, the filming colleague, Brynn, was still joking around, saying, “Oh no, Rita's gone mad from working overtime! Hahaha!”

However, Alice then screamed out loud because Rita had bitten her hard enough to draw blood, even tearing a chunk of flesh from her. This horrifying scene caused Brynn, who was filming, to shriek in fear as well. The video that followed was nothing but shaky footage of a frantic escape, filled with blurry images. The mood among the spectators shifted from curiosity to panic.

“Many netizens claim this was a case of a zombie biting someone, but that's actually a rumor. The truth was, Ms. Lupton simply had unusually sharp teeth, which resulted in the person being bitten to the point of severe injury. In order to prevent public panic, everyone is urged not to heedlessly believe in rumors.”

After the reporter finished their final statement, the host took over with a smile and started delivering the closing remarks.

Maura couldn't even eat her meal, her appetite lost after what she had heard. She cast her phone screen onto the television and tried to open the trending page on Twitter. As expected, the incident at her company was indeed the hot topic.

#KheawoodZombie

#EndOfTheWorld

She connected to her home's internet, attempting to refresh the signal several times before it improved slightly.

Meanwhile, as if there was a delay, she suddenly received a barrage of messages.

There were some from Carrie, another of her colleagues.

Carrie: Damn, you sure are blessed with good luck, Maura! The moment you left, Rita went ballistic!

Carrie: Wait, no, it's not that. She just had a rabies episode.

Carrie: Good thing you left quickly!

Carrie had joined the company around the same time as Maura did, with just a day's difference.

Thus, their relationship was decent.

Maura was in no mood to respond to her. She couldn't eat her meal and was breaking out in a cold sweat. It had been a close call, so very close. Had she not left when she did, she would have been the one bitten, as she was the closest to Rita.

Chapter 3 The Beginning Of The End

Luckily, she had believed the text message.

Ding dong!

Her phone vibrated once more, signaling the arrival of a new message. It was from the one who had sent her that warning.

Maura was practically trembling as she sent a message, persistently asking who exactly they were.

The other party blatantly ignored these inquiries; instead, they sent over a download link.

Had it not been for the fact that Rita's situation truly matched up, Maura would not have dared to proceed. Moreover, she had three backup phones, so she wasn't afraid of any viruses. Her bank cards, where she kept her savings, weren't linked to any online banking, so she had no fear of them being fraudulently used.

As a result, she didn't hesitate to tap on the link and download it onto her phone.

Shortly, a post-apocalyptic survival manual popped up. She read through it meticulously, almost word by word. This brief guide, less than three thousand words long, mentioned climate changes, various disasters, and even the chaos that would overtake the world in the later stages.

In addition, there was mention of “mutations.”

That word, written in bold and enlarged red font, was described as a universal upgrade.

Upon reflection, it did make sense.

Without adapting by evolving, no one could possibly survive in such a chaotic world.

Concerned about the possibility of electronic devices becoming unusable in the future, Maura immediately went to her room's desk. She downloaded and printed out numerous copies of this survival manual, then stored them away in the storage space.

By the time she had finished all this, her meal had already cooled. She ate without really tasting the food, not wasting a single drop of sauce. Afterward, she remembered the manual mentioned there would be no electricity during the early stage, so she quickly set to cooking.

In the dimensional storage cube, or rather, within each compartment of this multifaceted space, a preservation feature was inherently present.

Maura planned to prepare all the food in a way that it could be eaten directly. As she referred to the survival manual, it mentioned the onset of a strange phenomenon where people started biting each other first. This was also known as the initial outbreak of the zombie virus. From this night onward, peace would be a thing of the past.

Following this, a massive geomagnetic storm storm would erupt, causing all signals to vanish entirely. The external power lines would explode, leading to an increasingly unstable electricity supply.

The water would gradually become contaminated starting from three days later, a truly terrifying prospect.

What Maura had to do was to take advantage of the availability of electricity and water now and strive to stockpile as much food and water as possible.

She had a wide variety of pots in her home.

Thus, all three instant pots were filled and set to cook pasta, while two pressure cookers were busy preparing various meats and meatballs. Every piece of meat stored in the refrigerator and freezer was being diligently cooked to perfection.

She also made use of her microwave and air fryer.

There were four locations for the natural gas.

One was cooking oatmeal, another was making ginger tea, one was steeping peppermint tea, and another was cooking soup. According to the manual, there would be times of extreme heat or cold that lay ahead. Nothing could heal a person better than these soothing liquids. When the time came, a large thermos filled with these could provide a comforting drink.

Maura simply didn't dare to sleep.

After finishing dinner, she bustled around busily. She set her online messages to auto-read mode so she could listen to them through her Bluetooth earpiece.

As for food, she prepared as much as she could. Every additional serving was another layer of security.

Although it was inevitable that humans would undergo mutations in the later stages, mutating carried its own risks. Not everyone could successfully mutate, and those who failed in their evolution would die.

Maura hoped not to be infected so quickly, preferring to hold on for as long as possible. After all, as time progressed, the base would likely develop a potent antidote, one that could significantly enhance the success rate of mutations and reduce the risk of death.

She dared not sleep that entire night, busying herself with preparing food and storing water.

For many, the night had indeed been an extraordinary one.

The power went out in the middle of the night.

Screams echoed throughout the neighborhood, accompanied by hoarse roars.

Interspersed among those were cries for help and the barking of dogs.

Maura didn't dare to draw the curtains open, keeping the doors and windows tightly shut. She planned to hunker down for the early stage. When given the opportunity later on, she would continue to stockpile provisions.

What needed to be done now was to stay wise and protect herself. Sometimes, being too greedy could also be a sin.

When the power went out, she remained calm. Instead of panicking, she stored the half-finished items in the storage space, planning to retrieve them when the electricity came back on. It was quite convenient.

She was utterly exhausted, falling asleep on the couch as soon as she closed her eyes. It wasn't until her phone rang the next day that she woke up. It was a call from the property management office.

“Is this Ms. Moore? Here's the situation: a new strain of rabies virus suddenly emerged in Kheawood last night. It spreads and manifests rapidly. We've received orders from above that starting today, no one is allowed to go out without permission.”

The entire city had ceased operations and production.

The students were on holiday.

It was exactly as stated in the apocalypse survival manual. Lockdown was the first step humanity took in the apocalypse.

Maura was already exhausted, and after a whole night, her mindset had significantly improved. Even if she didn't want to believe it, this was her reality now. Therefore, she first feigned surprise, then assured that she would comply with the property management office's arrangements.

The other party also expressed their gratitude for her cooperation, then promptly busied themselves with making calls to others.

There were also posts in the neighborhood group chat, but dealing with some stubborn individuals required a more direct approach. Therefore, phone calls had to be made to each household to clarify the situation, which significantly increased the workload.

However, it wasn't the first time they had been on lockdown before, so they did have some experience dealing with it.

When the time came, food would be distributed punctually. Everyone just needed to stay indoors.

Many within the group were in a state of panic due to the horrifying screams from last night.

As a result, everyone in the group was blocked from posting anything.

The phone signal was still inconsistent, fluctuating between good and bad.

The television would occasionally stutter, and even the news broadcast was riddled with hiccups.

The essential keywords that could be captured were few - hurricane, geomagnetic storm, earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption.

Winter was about to set in, yet several hurricanes surprisingly formed, and they were the uncontrollable kind.

Coastal regions worldwide had already sounded the alarm, preparing themselves to combat the approaching super hurricanes.

From that day forward, geomagnetic storms became a frequent occurrence. Many researchers were busy preparing countermeasures, continuously broadcasting advice on how residents could protect themselves, always emphasizing the importance of personal safety.

Meanwhile, volcanoes both under the sea and on land across the globe were detected to be stirring restlessly. They had entered the active phase and were poised to erupt at any moment.

In the end, every broadcast was announcing the impending catastrophe, the greatest in human history. The possibility of a mass extinction, akin to the dinosaurs of the past, was alarmingly high. Consequently, the Amalgamated Nations was urging all of humanity to unite and face this calamity together with shared resolve.

When Maura heard these words, her eyes began to well up with tears. As she looked out at the sun, it seemed as if the days of old were fading away, never to return.

Suddenly, within the neighborhood, there were waves of frantic cries and wailing.

There were more people falling apart.

Maura could only gather her emotions and continued to busy herself with preparing food.

She needed to make ample preparations.

In the days that followed, a series of unfortunate news arrived. The phone signal was still sporadic, hence many messages about the disasters couldn't be transmitted in time.

The power of imagination proved more terrifying than reality. In the residential areas of Kheawood, people lived like coiled springs, their mental states stretched to their limits. The pressure became unbearable, leading to a significant increase in the number of people taking their own lives.

The weather had started to become erratic, experiencing several shifts within a mere three days. The temperature fluctuation could reach up to fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit before plunging drastically.

As a result, many people started to fall ill.

Chapter 4 Turning Into A Zombie

Maura made sure to always be cautious. She didn't participate when everyone in the community group was exchanging needed supplies. Later, when some couldn't resist visiting each other in the hallway, she didn't leave her apartment, trying her best to avoid contact with others.

The internet connection was constantly on and off, causing all messages to be delayed.

The message she sent to her friend seemed to sink like a stone in the ocean, causing her heart to plummet along with it.

Meanwhile, she began to document her life in a diary.

The first day was marked by a sudden outbreak of zombies. However, the authorities were doing their best to manage the situation, so it was still under control for the time being. The number of vehicles entering and exiting the residential area had significantly increased. There were quite a few people in protective suits bustling about downstairs.

The following day saw a drastic drop in temperature. The most significant change was in the morning when it was so hot that one could barely keep their clothes on, but by evening, it had become unbearably cold for everyone.

Fortunately, the living facilities were still intact, and the timely provision of heating saved them.

On the third day, issues began to arise with some of the water sources. The zombie virus infection was becoming somewhat uncontrollable. And worst of all, the power outages were growing longer and longer.

For the past three days, Maura had barely gotten any sleep. She managed to cook most of the food, but toward the end, she dared not eat anything that had a strong smell.

After the third day, the food supply was cut off, and no one delivered food anymore. The neighborhood beneath descended into chaos and became deserted, with no more cars coming through.

On the fourth day, the water began to give off a strange odor, making everyone afraid to drink the tap water. By the afternoon, some couldn't hold it in any longer and wanted to venture outside the residential area to check the situation, despite many people shouting from their apartments, urging them not to leave.

They, however, simply retorted, “Are we supposed to wait and die from the thirst? Since you're too scared to leave, we will!”

“Exactly! What if they had just abandoned us and run away? The medical personnel didn't even show up today! Are we supposed to be confined here indefinitely?”

Those few daring people simply wouldn't heed any advice, or perhaps due to the surreal events they had experienced over the past few days, their sanity was teetering on the brink of collapse.

Just as they were about to leave, they spotted a figure in a protective suit, which brought a sense of relief to them all. They immediately waved him over, even shouting out, “Damn, we thought you were going to let us starve or die of thirst! Did you know the tap water tastes weird?”

The others chimed in as well, “Exactly! Hurry up and sort out the drinking water problem!”

Maura felt that these people were unduly harsh toward the volunteer. However, her heart sank even further the next moment when she noticed the abnormal behavior of the person in the protective suit, extinguishing any flicker of hope she might have had.

With a dull look in her eyes, she drew the curtains closed, then turned to lean against the wall. She pulled out her diary from the space and penned down: November 6, 2029 - All medical volunteers have fallen. The community is on the brink of chaos.

Since no one official had arrived, it could only mean one thing - they were unable to come.

The situation was indeed dire.

Sure enough, terrified shouts echoed from downstairs. The people who were about to leave the residential area were frantically shouting that this volunteer had also contracted the rabies virus.

The people upstairs were all terrified into silence, with nearly everyone rushing to lock their doors at the first opportunity.

Tears welled up and fell heavily from Maura's eyes, but it was an inevitable occurrence. The apocalypse survival manual had already predicted the date of societal collapse. Indeed, it was spot on. The chaos officially started on the fourth day.

She wiped away her tears, realizing that she would have to rely on herself for the journey ahead. She had to endure until the later stage.

The presence or absence of official order made a significant difference. On the fourth night of the end of the world, the screams from the neighborhood grew louder. The sounds of heavy objects falling were incessant, accompanied by what seemed like animalistic roars from downstairs.

In the other buildings, people had started to scramble and fight for resources. Everyone was in a state of panic.

Maura would often see the messages everyone posted in the neighborhood group chat whenever she had signal. Despair dominated most of the content, and she tried her best to block out the negative messages to keep herself calm.

The most daunting aspect of such situations was the fear of emotional breakdown. As an ordinary person, she often felt that she was already quite resilient. Moreover, she still had hope in the form of her storage space. Without that, she might have succumbed to despair.

Compared to others' anxiety over food and water, she was relatively unfazed.

Hence, when someone knocked on her door, she stayed utterly quiet. She had everything she needed to eat and drink. For her, hunkering down and staying quiet was the best form of protection.

Two days later, all water and electricity were completely cut off, causing the neighborhood to lose its vibrancy.

The ground floor was overrun with wandering zombies now. They scratched at the door daily, but the early-stage zombies lacked the ability to break down doors; they could only scratch.

As long as one didn't go downstairs, they were very safe.

As the struggle for resources among the survivors intensified, Maura found them banging on her door several times. There were even whispers among the neighbors in the same building about how her door was incredibly sturdy, remaining unyielding despite their best efforts to break it down.

However, they were oblivious to the fact that if they had really broken down the door, Maura, who had positioned herself at the entrance, would have activated the chainsaw. She may have been scared, but that didn't mean she wouldn't resist. Fortunately, her home's door was truly sturdy.

The security door she had spent over ten thousand on was indeed extremely sturdy, proving that her investment was not in vain.

But even without any human interaction, Maura inexplicably felt as though she was turning into a zombie. Her mind began to slow down, her body grew sluggish, and so did her tongue. Thus, on the tenth day of the apocalypse, she had to admit to herself that she had turned into a zombie, which frustrated her so much that she lay in bed for a full ten days.

Why have I turned into a zombie right from the start? What was the point of giving me the typical protagonist's storage space, then?

This is so infuriating!

She couldn't even speak properly now, only able to stutter incoherently, which frustrated her to no end.

Then, she noticed her leg movements becoming more agile, which allowed her to roll out of bed. Following this, she realized her body had transitioned from rigid to a softer state, regaining some flexibility. However, her tongue still lacked coordination.

Perhaps it was due to the long period of not conversing with others, coupled with psychological factors.

Exasperated at her inability to speak properly, Maura puffed her cheeks out in frustration. She sat cross-legged on the bed for a long while before finally remembering to write in her diary.

Then she realized her mind hadn't fully recovered yet. Her thoughts were slower than before, and some matters took her a long time to figure out. This realization frustrated her for another three days. Lastly, when she discovered she could survive without eating, it made her want to cry even more.

When the apocalypse first began, she had stockpiled quite a bit of food and drink. Now that she had turned into a zombie, she wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore!

Maura really wanted to burst into tears, but alas, zombies couldn't cry. Sullenly, she pulled out some food to chew. She could only taste one percent of the flavor, leaving her heart feeling icy cold.

Time passed while she was incapacitated during her bouts of frustration, and it had been over half a month since the end of the world had begun.

Maura was utterly oblivious to the outside world. Her apartment complex had become entirely deserted. The number of zombies beneath her building was steadily increasing, and even wall-climbing zombies had started to appear.

There were still survivors.

She could hear them during the day, rummaging for supplies. They had tried to pry her door open on multiple occasions, but to no avail. They had no choice but to give up.

Maura didn't even bother to engage with them. After all, she wasn't quite herself at the moment, was she?

Originally prepared to continue languishing, it wasn't until the dawn of the 26th day after the apocalypse that the previously quiet city of Kheawood began echoing with the sounds of artillery fire. At last, the rescue operation had begun.",1,1755820937.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1mwrbjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mwrbjz/i_mistakenly_broke_a_clients_coffee_machine_and/,I mistakenly broke a client’s coffee machine… and it turned into a life-changing opportunity.,"I (29M) was working as a sales rep at a small creative agency. I’d been at the company for a year, getting the hang of things, but I was still in that phase where you’re trying to prove yourself without rocking the boat. You know, just enough to stay off everyone’s radar.

One Thursday, I was sent to meet with one of our biggest clients at their office. I was nervous but excited, this was a big deal. I’d prepared a killer pitch and was ready to close the deal on a project that would boost my numbers for the quarter.

I arrived at their fancy office, and as I walked in, I was greeted with the smell of fresh coffee brewing in the corner. The client, an older, no-nonsense type, offered me a cup, and we started talking.

Everything was going great until, in a moment of clumsy enthusiasm, I tried to adjust the coffee machine (which looked way too complicated for its own good) to get a better cup. Of course, in the process, I knocked something loose. Suddenly, the machine started making weird sounds, a small puff of steam came out, and the whole thing sputtered to a halt.

I froze. I had just broken their coffee machine. Of all the things, *this* was going to be what I remembered from this meeting?

The client stared at the machine. Then, to my absolute horror, he turned to me and said, “Well, looks like we’ll have to make do with tea today. Let’s keep going.”

At this point, I thought the meeting was doomed. I had ruined it. I was convinced that the client would think I was unprofessional, that I’d ruined my chances with them, and that this mistake would follow me around forever.

But then something unexpected happened. The client started talking more. He didn’t seem mad at al, in fact, he seemed amused. And after a few awkward jokes about my “coffee machine sabotage,” he got genuinely curious about me.

The conversation shifted from business to something a little more personal. He asked how I got into sales, what I liked about the job, and, unexpectedly, what my career goals were. It felt like we were actually having a real conversation rather than a stiff, transactional meeting.

By the end of the meeting, we had signed the deal, but here’s the kicker: the client offered me something I never saw coming. He said, “You’ve got potential. You seem to know how to connect with people. If you ever get tired of agency life, I’d like to offer you a position in my company. We could use someone who can *really* understand people.”

I was floored. I had been a little nervous about my job at the agency, unsure if I was going anywhere fast. But this offer was a game-changer. It wasn’t just the job, it was the opportunity to work with someone who valued connection over perfection, who saw potential in a seemingly minor mistake.

I didn’t take the offer right away, but I left that meeting with a different mindset. Sometimes, the mistakes you think are career-ending can open doors you never expected.

Today, I’m still with the agency, but now I’ve got a clearer vision of what I want from my career and how to handle the moments when everything seems to go wrong. And every time I see a coffee machine, I remember that small moment where a mess-up became a stepping stone.

 I broke a client’s coffee machine during a pitch meeting, thinking it would ruin everything. Instead, it sparked a real conversation, led to a career offer, and changed how I approach challenges.",6,1755820569.0,story,1,1.0,False

I am seriously interested in buying a manufactured home, probably from Cavco in Woodburn and installing it as an ADU. This is code legal. The site seems suitable. I have a decent(?) idea of the plumbing and electrical challenges ahead with the really expensive part being waste water removal. I've read Backyard Revolution (the ADU one.) I've read the Construction Physics series on manufactured homes. I've read a bunch of professional and personal accounts of installing and living in manufactured homes. I have no intention to Airbnb.

However, I don't know anyone or have so much as a hookup with anyone who has done this in the metro area. The Cavco rep in Woodburn I talked with said that it's been done but could not provide specifics. No one I know who's lived in manufactured housing put it in themself.

If you or someone you'd like to send my way has gone through the steps of buying and setting up one of these in the PDX area, as an ADU or primary residence I would LOVE to buy beer, coffee, kombucha, whatever and ask you about this. Please share!",1,1755820436.0,askportland,2,1.0,False

Through the long curved windows of the stern gallery, our wake divides a vast expanse of shimmering blue sea. I should be updating the log, but instead gaze transfixed on the placid brilliance of the Mediterranean sunset. 

For a moment I nearly forget our pursuer, but then the Pelliere yaws into view, a French frigate half mile off our quarter. The turn puts her broadside on our stern, all twenty-four gun ports open wide. 

She wants to try the range. 

I reach for my coffee, still watching the frigate as her side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. Then comes the thundering crash of her guns, and plumes of white water dotting a line across our wake where the round shot strikes. 

One lucky skip comes aboard, smashing through the elegant stern windows and whisking the coffee cup from my hand as it passes. 

“Miss Dangerfield,” I say in a voice calculated to penetrate the length of the schooner. 

“Captain?” My steward’s concerned face appears in the cabin door. Her eyes fall to the rustled table-cloth, silver dishes askew, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I’d personally invited an 18-pound ball at one thousand feet per second. 

“Bring me another cup if you please, thank you, ma’am,” I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes facetiously, and darts into the galley. 

We’d have never allowed such insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I indulge an image of her strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination.

But I’m no longer in the Royal Fleet; I’m a smuggler, and the rules are different now. The rigid discipline of man-o-wars here slackens to professional courtesy. I’m obeyed only on the necessity of my position: the schooner must have a captain. 

Survival depends on it. 

The coffee comes back, hot and strong. I take grateful gulps, then refill my cup - a metal cup - and head out on deck.

The Pelliere’s gun smoke drifts overhead, filling the air with a heady scent. But the frigate’s captain has given up the chase, wearing away south for Algiers. 

Walking aft, telescope in hand, I see Mr. Blythe turn from the taffrail. He’s an odd, pale fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. 

His black coat and britches and broad black hat, his affinity for Latin; he might as well have the word “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead. 

I focus my telescope on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, pretending to fiddle with the eyepiece and hoping he’ll carry on. 

“Expecting more trouble, Captain?” 

“Not presently,” I say. “Still…I should have a look from the masthead.” 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, a moment too late one sailor scoops them into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren’t expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But outrunning the French blockade has me in fine spirits, and I’m no longer in the mood to flog anyone. Regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

“What’s that lubber doing? He’ll kill himself!”

“He’ll break his neck, damn fool!” 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He’d tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Miss Dangerfield was at that moment ascending the opposite rigging with my refreshments, tea kettle hanging by a leather strap clenched in her teeth. 

She hangs the kettle on a rat line, then leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it’s precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks it free and carries him aloft. 

We pull him by the shoulders through the lubber’s hole, and he collapses in a gasping heap. 

“Sir!” Says the lookout, pointing to the now-distant white blurr of the frigate, “they’re flying an alphabetical message.” 

I focus my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

“W-E-L-L D-O-N-E” 

“That’s a handsome message, Captain.” says Miss Dangerfield. 

“Indeed it is,” I say, nodding with approval. “Pass the word for our signalman. You sir: spell out “S-A-F-E T-R-A-V-E-L-S”

I pull Blythe to his feet. “Open your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite something up here.” 

Reluctantly he opens them, and they go wide at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides, white gulls streaking far out and below. His face brightens into something like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. “I’m amazed!” He says. “Amazed!” 

“Take my glass,” I say, unsure why I no longer despise the fellow, “just don’t drop it. There - to starboard … no, to starboard …there you are sir … you can make out the western tip of Formentera.” 

“Incredible!” He says, sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The kettle makes its appearance, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

“And captain…what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?” 

It’s as I feared. We’d run the blockade, sure, but only because we’re small fish for the French Imperial fleet. It’s different for these harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

“Baltimore Clippers,” I say, without needing to look. I flick my cigar and watch it’s long arc into the waves. “Revenue Cutters.” 

Back in my cabin, I fill a sack with documents, cargo logs, bills of laden, and navigational workings. Adding a couple 4-pound cannonballs, I toss the parcel through the broken stern windows, and Miss Dangerfield appears with my best coat and number one hat. I wear it sideways, like one of the old Commodores. 

Buckling my sword, I stride out on deck with a new packet of false papers tucked under my arm. 

One of the cutters hails us through a speaking trumpet. 

“Inspection! Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail.” The message repeats, with an added “Under…My…Leeward…Rail!” 

“Oh, fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Dangerfield. 

But I recognize the voice, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. 

Smaller boats put off from the cutters, all crammed with uniformed men brandishing muskets. Their oars quickly cover the remaining distance and they clink onto our main chains from both sides. 

A moment later the deck is swarming with harbor police. It’s the usual show: we’re held at bayonet point, they smash and throw things overboard until the Lieutenant decides enough fun has been had, and restores something like order to the inspection. 

“Good evening, Captain,” he says, kicking aside the clucking hens that had escaped their coop. “Where is your passenger?” 

“Passenger?” I look blankly to Miss Dangerfield, who shrugs. I offer the parcel. “This contains our muster roll. If you’d be so good as to point the fellow’s name—“

“I’m afraid won’t do,” says Turnbull, breaking into a severe smile. “We know the Spaniard is aboard; we’ll find him sooner or later. This schooner of yours is a beauty: handsome, taut, fast…spare us both the sight of my men tearing her apart, I beg you. I’ll see to it she’s only impounded.” 

“On what charge?” I say with masterful indignation. 

“Sailing under false papers,” he says. “I’m sure yours are quite counterfeit. Either way, we’ll have to hold you and your vessel pending scrutiny.” 

I don’t want to give up Mr. Blythe. He paid in advance, and I consider myself a professional. 

“I can see you’re still considering,” says Turnbull. “Let me appeal to your morality, sir…” 

Mrs Dangerfield gives a slight cough. His eyes narrow on her for a moment, then swing back to me.  

“That fellow calling himself Mr. Blythe is a Spanish Inquisitor,” he says. “His task is hunting down heretics for the Bishop’s dungeons.” 

I knew it, an assassin! I can’t help my brief  triumphant smile. 

“Find it funny, do you?” Says Turnbull, the color in his face rising. “Some ruffian pocketing eight and twenty pounds for each suspected Protestant or Jew he drags back? Thumbscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you can’t tell me that don’t strike you as dirty!” 

Did he say eight and twenty pounds? My mind is crunching numbers before Turnbull finishes his speech. Miss Dangerfield’s eyes sparkle with a piratical gleam. 

After a moment’s pause I say, “Suppose I cooperate, sign off on your impound deal? Where would I be held during the…er, scrutiny?” 

“Oh, as to that, you’d be penned in the empty barracks. It’s not bad; there’s cots and you can order food from town if you’ve got the coin. A few days, maybe a week, then out you go. Mr. Blythe to the gallows, you and your crew to sail where you please.” 

“We’re to share quarters, then?” 

“Come sir, do you expect a private room at the inn? The deal is fair: you’re cargo isn’t touched and I can show my superior we’re doing our diligence out here. Everybody wins.” 

Even Mr. Blythe, I think, though I’m certain he won’t thank me until the end. It’s a good plan. 

I point to the maintop. “He’s at the masthead,” I say. “Let my steward here run aloft to see him safely down. He’s liable to fall, and you’d have nothing left to scrutinize but a puddle of goo.”

I’m 20F, born and raised in California, and honestly…I’m kind of over the casual hookup scene. It feels like every app, every night out, every “let’s hang out” just ends up being the same thing—nothing real, nothing lasting.

I want more than just 2 AM texts. I want someone I can actually go on dates with—grabbing sushi, late-night beach walks, even just staying in and binging Netflix while eating takeout. I want those small, stupid moments that make you laugh until your stomach hurts.

About me: I’m outgoing, sarcastic in a playful way, and I definitely talk way too much when I’m excited. I love hiking, road trips up the coast, live music, and I can spend hours in a coffee shop pretending to get work done while actually people-watching. Physically, I keep active, curvy in the right places, and yes—I’m the kind of girl who will steal your hoodie and never give it back.

What I’m looking for: Someone 21–28, mature enough to handle a real connection but still fun and spontaneous. Bonus points if you have a good sense of humor and can handle me blasting 2000s pop in the car.

If you’re in Cali and actually interested in getting to know someone beyond just a quick fling, send me a message. Who knows? Maybe we’ll click.",1,1755820355.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

They say Ray’s gay!
Well, hey, okay!
It’s hot, it’s not,
It’s whispered today.
They say Ray’s gay,
What can I say?
I love the drama
When the tea gets served this way!

Pump the dump, hump the jump,
Sugar in the coffee cup.
I lean in close, I spill my notes,
“Guess what I heard? Girl, buckle up!”
I saw him smile with that one guy,
Lingered long, don't ask me why.
It’s juicy fruit, my favorite flute,
Spread the buzz until it's sky high!

They say Ray’s gay!
Well, hey, okay!
It’s tip, it’s sip,
It’s circling the hallway.
They say Ray’s gay,
Come what may,
I thrill in the telling,
In my queen-of-gossip play!

Snack the pack, stack the crack,
Someone rolls their eyes right back.
“Betty, stop! You never quit!”
But honey child, I live for it.
I drip-drop facts with lipstick gloss,
I twist the tale like dental floss.
He’s straight? He’s not? Oh, tie the knot,
Either way, it’s win or loss.

But behind my chatter, there’s a sting,
A rumor cuts with a jagged wing.
Ray’s just a man, walking his way,
Why do we label what we can’t say?
The world’s not neat, it curves, it bends,
It’s lovers, colors, truths that blend.
And sometimes harm comes wrapped in laughs —
No tea is sweet if it burns the glass.

They say Ray’s gay!
Well, hey, okay!
It’s zing, it’s ping,
It’s bouncing through the hallway.
They say Ray’s gay,
Don’t walk away!
I live to tease the crowd,
And watch them all obey…

Curve the nerve, swerve the serve,
Not one line stays straight, observe.
Some love men, some love she,
Some, like me, float queerly free.
My girlfriend tall, broad shouldered strong,
Not the type you pin in a girly song.
We bend, we blend, we never pretend,
Love’s the rule, beginning to end.

I saw the Pride parade go past,
A thousand flames, a flag so vast.
Not just “A or B” to choose,
A spectrum infinite, wide with hues.
And if a rumor starts today,
Remember kindness has the say.
‘Cause people aren’t whispers on café lips —
We are more than gossip trips.

They say Ray’s gay!
Well, hey, okay!
It’s fun, it’s done,
But it matters what we say.
They say Ray’s gay,
I laugh, I sway…
But truth is love,
And love is never cliché.

Sip the drip, flip the slip,
Life’s too short for rumor script.
Love who you love, no shame, no proof —
Honey, that’s the gospel truth.

We just launched a newsletter that covers the best of the Pacific Northwest - cool things to do, hidden places to stay, local events, and those spots that make this region incredible. Think less ""Top 10 Tourist Destinations"" and more ""that amazing coffee shop tucked away in Bellingham that locals actually go to.""

Been living here my whole life and got tired of seeing the same recycled travel content that misses what makes the PNW special. So we're putting together something different - real recommendations from people who actually explore this region year-round.

Recent stuff we've covered:

* Hot springs that aren't completely overrun (yet)
* Best breweries for rainy day hangs
* Lesser-known hiking spots with killer views
* Cool local markets and farm stays

Check it out at [www.explorepnw.net](http://www.explorepnw.net) if you're interested. We're trying to build something that's actually useful for both folks who live here and people planning trips.

This helped me find purpose and changed how I see everything.

Flow state is where life actually happens. When you're completely absorbed in something you love, time disappears. Started paying attention to when I naturally enter flow and realized that's when I feel most alive and connected to something bigger.

The universe operates on patience, not urgency. Everything in nature grows slowly trees, relationships, wisdom. I was trying to force major life changes overnight and burning out. Learn to work with natural rhythms instead of against them.

Boredom is your brain's way of processing life. Used to panic whenever I felt unstimulated and would immediately grab my phone. Now I sit with boredom and let my mind wander. That's when the best ideas come when you're not forcing anything.

Your ikigai isn't always your job. Spent years thinking I had to monetize everything I enjoyed. Sometimes your purpose is being a good friend, creating art no one sees, or just bringing calm energy to chaotic situations. It's simply learning how to live in the present moment.

Small, consistent actions create meaning. Instead of looking for one big purpose, I started noticing tiny things that brought me joy like making coffee mindfully, really listening to people, taking care of plants. Purpose isn't always profound.

Community and connection are non-negotiable. The loneliness epidemic is real. Started prioritizing relationships over achievements and everything felt more meaningful. We're literally wired for connection. We are social animals after all.

Accepting impermanence reduces anxiety. Everything changes, including your problems and your current situation. This used to terrify me, now it's oddly comforting. Bad phases pass, but so do good ones - so you appreciate both more.

The book reads like a gentle conversation rather than a self-help manual. It reminded me that meaning isn't something you find ""out there"" it emerges from how you engage with whatever's in front of you.

My MIL is in palliative care due to end stage kidney failure, lung cancer and a large abdomimal aneurysm. She's been in and out of hospital but is currently staying at home with me and my partner. It's gotten to the point where I really don't think she is safe here. We both work full time jobs and are not in a position to provide round the clock care. She is often home alone and awake in the middle of the night while we are sleeping. We have quite a difficult relationship with her which makes it even more difficult because I don't feel comfortable micromanaging her. She is on so many meds and really walks around the house like a zombie all day. She constantly falls asleep mid conversation or while holding a cup of hot coffee. She doesn't really understand or pay attention to when she's taking certain drugs so i'm pretty sure she's been overdosing quite a bit (she takes hydromorphone which says every 8 hours/3 times a day but said today that she takes it at 8am, 12pm and 4pm and then is in so much pain that she takes more when she feels like she needs it). She just seems so out of it and is constantly shaking. She does dialysis but sometimes falls asleep before plugging herself in because she's too drugged up. I don't really know what to do because she doesn't really want to go into hospital again but this can't be good for her. She needs someone giving her the correct meds at the right time. She takes what she wants and ignores the rest. She has a very large care team of doctors and nurses that come by daily. Would it be appropriate to speak to them privately and suggest that she go back into hospital? They have said there is a palliative care unit that will have a bed ready for her but I don't think she really wants to go at this point because she hasn't fully accepted how close she is to death. She's been given less than 6 months. I cant believe that the hospital even let her come home the last time because she was so out of it at the hospital.

I worked as a barista for a year and immediately found myself taking the lead on the coffee bar. They promoted me to supervisor/lead barista. I got a new job as a barista in a better place, and became assistant manager a year later. Since then, I've had numerous management and general management roles. That progression felt natural and I felt I took well to leadership. I'm not a disciplinarian, I'm very much a supportive manager with an attitude that if you work hard for me, it's my job to work hard for you. I have had lots of great feedback from my teammates before and love that feeling of being valuable to them, and making their otherwise shitty minimum wage jobs quite enjoyable, while also providing them with skills to increase future employability etc etc. The big issue is I'm at total odds with the business owners every single time. They just want to make money and don't usually care how that pursuit impacts the team. I hate the motivation behind the industry and I have always wanted something different for myself. I'm also at the top of the ladder now without joining a chain with corporate structure, which I have no interest in.

My big interests are art, history, and writing. I'd love to work with my hands. The tactile nature of my job at the moment is very rewarding. I enjoying fighting fires, working out solutions to problems under pressure, making and maintaining things. I also love the people aspect of the job. Looking after people, being the person who can help, who can coach and support. I am a good critical thinker, problem solver and I recently got diagnosed with autism, which might play into that a little.

I also have a bad history of terrible mental health and never really believed it possible for me to achieve much in life. I know that's not true now, but I do still struggle to see myself in other roles, in other industries and really struggle to picture what's next or know what I want. I kinda want someone to list off jobs that I sound like I'd be good at with my skills and background, and then if any interest me I can go from there. Can anybody help just suggesting things? Like, I'm happy to get any kind of industry, any kind of role. The more outside the box for me, the better.

I select pickup at store, as I always do. The mall with the Nespresso store is less than a block away. I go to pick up my order, only to be told the promotion is only valid for delivery. 

There is one small line buried in the offer terms and conditions stating that offer is not available for in-store pickup. This information should be, no - needs to be displayed prominently on the order page. It should warn you that if you select in-store pickup, the offers do not apply.

1mwqzg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mwqzg1/i_didnt_tell_anyone_for_over_30_years_this_is_my/,I didn’t tell anyone for over 30 years. This is my confession.,"My great grandparents helped settle this land because they believed it was God’s country. It was their own personal Eden, gifted to them based on their faithfulness after wandering west. And standing there, sun set between the mountains of the Salt Lake Valley, all of it was almost believable–maybe we were destined to steward this land. Maybe this was heaven on earth. Maybe everything they said, from the to the assertion of our fated presence here, was all true.

But to my younger brother Thomas and I, the hundreds of unspoiled square miles was just our backyard. And for the daylight hours during summer, it was all ours–the trees and the ponds and the caves the backdrop of every imaginary game that we would play. We knew the time it took to get from one landmark to another, the hazards we could skip across and the ones to avoid, and how much time it would take us to get back home from any particular point. 

It was a summer’s day like any other, except there was a buzz between Thomas and I. It was his birthday, and there’s nothing in the world like turning six. I was nine at the time, playing the dutiful role of the older brother. I led us hopping from root to root in the trees behind our house, setting off on our day’s adventure.

“I’ll go this way, because I’m the older brother.” I pointed at the easier path and Thomas nodded. I almost felt guilty as to how agreeable he was. Almost.  “And you got to go that way, but as a monkey.” He hunched over, dangling his arms, mouth agape like it was about to hoot. He blew out little puffs of air from his pursed lips instead.

Thomas had been born soundlessly, slipping into the world in a silence he never lost. His vocal cords were malformed in the womb, a condition the doctor had said may not be permanent. 

“It won’t be, doctor,” my father had said. “God don’t make mistakes.” This was his ever-repeated mantra, a catchphrase he used for everything in life.

But even my father’s faith had been slipping. I found a pamphlet on his desk for a school teaching sign language, which had been out of the question before this. I had straightened it back on his desk like I never saw it.

“We’ll see who can get out to the well the fastest. And since you’re the birthday boy…” He presented his face with his hands beneath his chin, ta-da! “I’ll give you a headstart. Starting now!” I rushed out the last two words, and Thomas leapt at them, sprinting ahead of me. I remember that it was the hardest I had had to work to beat him. 

The well itself was old and narrow,  barely wide enough for the many gallon bucket that had to be hand cranked to the well’s bottom below. It had dilapidated enough that you could hardly see it from the path. That made it secret and so we made it ours. It was home base in tag, a fort when we played soldiers, and (Thomas’ favorite), a ship when we were pirates.

And it was where we dropped our wishes.

The crank was rusted, as the well itself hadn’t been used in decades. It took both of us pulling with all our might to lower it. “Okay, so get your wish ready. I got mine. I wish for infinite wishies.” I held my hand over the crumbling ledge and dropped my quarter. I heard the clang of it against the metal of the bucket. “Mine’s coming true! Your turn.”

Thomas leaned his little body over the ledge, shut one eye, tried to aim the quarter just right. But then it was like he froze up, his body locked tight like it did when my dad came into the room. He overcorrected and let the coin go. We heard nothing for a while, and then the splash of the quarter hitting the water. That was a bad omen. Not only will your wish not come true, but you also are out a quarter. I could see tears growing in Thomas’s eyes. 

“Hey, it’s okay, it’s just a dumb game! It doesn’t actually mean anything!” He reached his hand out,  fingers pinching the air.

“Oh you’re sad about the quarter! You can have my quarter. I can always just wish for another one now.”

He nodded his head, blinking away tears. There was a sort of wish logic to it. He had forgotten that he had been crying before we even got back home. 

Mom would always let you pick the meal on your birthday. And every year, Thomas requested the same thing: grilled cheese and tomato soup. He had a stepstool he would use to help my mom butter the bread. My mom and him had their own language too, and I sat at the table next to dad, listening to the rare sound of my mom laughing in the kitchen.

“I have a real bang up headache,” he had told me the moment I entered the room. I sat down without speaking, knowing how volatile he could be with one of those. He was opening a new Costco bottle of Asprin. He went through them like water, but took them with none: instead, he would tuck them into his cheek and let them dissolve. He said they worked better that way. 

“You and Thomas have fun?” I nodded at him. “Good, good. Thanks for taking him out.”He was always saying things like this, like I was doing Thomas a favor. His fingers tapped at the table, his leg was shaky. My mom laughed again from the kitchen and he twitched. “What could she possibly be laughing at in there?” I shrugged. “Hey! Beth!” The kitchen became silent at the sound of her name. “I’ve got a real bang up headache in here, can you maybe keep it down?”

“Sorry, honey.”

Dad became more gregarious as dinner went on, as if it was just the food that he needed. But we all knew that wasn’t the case. Anything, from the temperature in the room, to the squeak of a chair, could set him off again, often at Thomas. Especially at Thomas.

But tonight was different. He told a funny story from work, thanked Mom and Thomas for cooking. By the time we were ready for cake, we had relaxed again, it was like his outburst had never happened. That’s how he always did it. Made you feel safe.

“Okay then! Almost time for candles, I think.” He looked toward my mom, and she was already clearing the table, knowing her cue. When she was in the kitchen, dad looked at Thomas, like really looked at him. He didn’t just let his eyes float above Thomas’s head like he usually did. “Now Thomas, I know it might not be traditional, but I wanted to give you one of your presents before the cake.” He reached under his chair and pulled out a box, set it in front of him. “Well, go ahead!”

Thomas’ eyes gleamed, more at Dad than the present. To have his approval, to have a special gift picked out just for you, meant you were special. The gift itself barely even mattered. But he ripped the paper off just the same. Inside was a tapedeck recorder and a stack of tapes. His eyes flashed up to my dad’s, confused.

“It’s a tape recorder! See, I got you these series of tapes here. It’s for speech impediments. That tape says something, then you record yourself repeating it, listen back to it. A guy from work, said his kid had a stutter and it worked wonders for him.” My brother’s face dropped. He hung his head, fiddled with the buttons. 

“Well? Don’t you like it?” Thomas’s head snapped back up at my dad raising his voice. He nodded emphatically. “Because it wasn’t cheap. God don’t make mistakes, Thomas. I’m trying to help you.” Thomas nodded again, but I could tell dad wasn’t buying it.

“He does, dad. Honest. You know I can tell.” I regretted saying it before I was even finished.

“Really? You can tell? How can you tell?”

“We just understand each other–”

“Well I don’t “just understand him”. And the rest of the world, they’re not going to “just understand him” either. I’m doing this for his own good.” By then, my mother was leaning in the archway, holding the cake, candles already lit. The flame caught dad’s eye. “Case and point!” He stood up, took the cake from my mom. “I have never heard you sing me happy birthday. Not once. So tonight, you don’t get to hear it from us.”

“Honey…” My mom’s voice, barely above a whisper.

“Better yet, we’ll all sing it like Thomas does. Ready? One, two, three!” My dad started mouthing the lyrics to the song, blowing air in a caricature of my brother. He made us all do the whole song like that. “Make a wish.” He instructed Thomas when we had finished.

Thomas blew out the candles, and for the second time that day, I watched him cry in silence.

He had gotten other presents that night, a battery powered train and some art supplies, but they lay untouched on his bedside table.  As soon as we were put to bed that night, he turned his face against the wall. I used five of my wishes to make myself sleep that night.

That night. something stronger than the sun had seized me awake. It was still dark, but I knew it before I even opened my eyes. I knew it before I turned his covers, before I checked the bathroom, before I rocked my mom awake. Somehow, I knew.

“Thomas is gone.”

There was a flurry of police and search parties going through the next day. They swept the area, and then swept it again, my father out with them, my mom and I at home. The police had found that Thomas’ camping backpack was gone, along with a few of his favorite things. Underneath my bed, he had left me a note on his new art paper: completely blank except for a big “x” drawn on it. They asked me what it meant, but I didn’t know. I blamed that on why I had to sit at home with my mom. She was perched on a stool and mostly stayed silent. Once or twice a cop tried to start a conversation with her over their endless cups of coffee, but they eventually gave up. 

My dad’s reaction may have surprised me the most. He was full of shock, real shock. I knew it was genuine. When I told him Thomas was missing, he did not know it yet, and he was confused. And I guess that surprised me because it was so obvious Thomas was running from him. My dad went out with the search party, and then out on his own, and then out with the search party again before he was finally returned. The sergeant in charge brought dad back at nearly 3 am. “Man’s been looking for over 20 hours. He needs to sleep.” 

“Thanks, Sarge. I’ll just be a couple hours.” The officer held his hand up.

“Rest. We can’t have you exhausted. We’re expanding the search area. We don’t know how long this is going to take.” He patted my dad on the arm, and he unwillingly agreed.

They put me in bed, no matter my objections that I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. But childlike sleep came anyway, fitful and dreamless. It was from this sleep I was tossed awake again. This time it wasn’t to a prediction, but to a vision. 

Thomas and I always understood each other, always knew how to communicate. And it was like he was communicating to me then. And I don’t mean through a dream or a metaphor. I mean face-to-face. I opened my eyes and a face was inches from mine. Thomas’ face. 

He hung upside down above me, eyes unfocused. His head was scratched and bloodied, his breath was labored. But it was him. He hung there, perfectly still except for the twitching of his fingers and lips. I couldn’t move either. Doctors have told me I was having sleep paralysis, but I know this was different. It was like I could feel the warmth from his wheezing lips. And he was in trouble.
I blinked, and he was gone. But it didn’t matter. I knew where he was. 

I shot out of my bed toward my bedroom door. I had to tell my parents. But just as I was about to turn the handle, something stopped me. I went back to my room, got dressed, grabbed a flashlight, and snuck out myself. 

Thomas had told me where he was going, did it in a way that only I would know. It was our pirate ship. X marks the spot. The light from the silver of the moon was more than enough to a path I knew so well. I followed my own feet to the well. 

At first, I thought it was a dead end. The spot was clear and quiet. I was scared to be out at night, but more so to be breaking rules, but I still let out a word, small and hesitant. 

“Thomas?”

Silence–and then, the sound of Thomas’ quarter, a soft plunk of water splashing up from the well. I raced over and shone my flashlight down it.

And there was Thomas. He had fallen backwards into the well, nodded off while waiting for me. His body was being held upside down by the narrow walls, one arm twisted behind him, the other with just the tips of his fingers free. He used them to push pebbles into the water below. He was still alive. 

“Thomas! I’m going to get you out of there. Just hold on, okay?” I turned, ready to run back, then stopped. There were footsteps approaching, clunking up the path I had just taken. Instinctively, I hid, killed my flashlight, held my breath. The footsteps had a light, and it bobbed at waist level, a camping lantern hooked onto something. I heard the quiet squeak of wheels. The figure lifted the lantern onto a tree branch and I saw it was Dad, pushing a wheelbarrow. 

I blew out a sigh of relief. This was it, Dad to the rescue. The wheelbarrow had to be full of tools, rope, something. Everything was going to be okay. I stepped forward to go to him, to help him save my brother. 

And then I smelled tar.

There are moments that are so ingrained in your mind, you will remember every detail of it forever. And sometimes, you know you’re having one of those moments.

Dad tore heavy bags of powder into the wheelbarrow, poured water in. Used the back of a broom to stir it. He hummed songlessly. Then he lowered the well’s bucket, and emptied a wheelbarrow of instant concrete over my brother. And then he did it again. And again. Until the already drying asphalt reached the brim of the well. He used a trowel to smooth it over.

And I did nothing. Just stood there, pissed my pants, and watched.

I never said anything. Not to my mother. Not to a therapist. Not for the years and years until my own father was buried under his own pack of dirt. Writing this now, looking through my blurred eyes, remembering the way the tar stung them, is the first time I’ve actually gotten it all down.

The closest I ever got to saying something was during breakfast a few weeks later. The search had stalled, the words “presumed dead” had been used. My mom wore black and didn’t talk much. My dad stayed the exact same. 

I was alone with dad at the table. He had been in a good mood that morning, but he always said my questions ruined a good mood. I decided to risk it.

“Dad, why is the old well sealed up?”

The question caught him off guard, and he sat up a little straighter. But he soon got his composure. “I sealed it up. It was in my area during the sweep and I thought it was too dangerous. Wouldn’t want you falling in.”

“Or Thomas.”

“Yeah. Or Thomas.” He stopped, peered down at me. Put his spoon down, bent a little to my eye level. “Hey Michael, you know I would never hurt you or Thomas, right? You know that, right?”

I nodded, quickly, curtly.

“I’ve never laid a finger on either of you. I made a promise I never will and I haven’t.” It was true. That wasn’t his form of torture. I nodded again. “Never would hurt you.” He repeated. 

“But sometimes, God makes his own plan. And it’s like I always say, son:”

“God don’t make mistakes.”

The WNBA’s playoff race has descended into a farcical soap opera, and this Dallas Wings vs. Seattle Storm clash is the season’s *Sopranos* finale. Let’s parse the chaos with math, mockery, and a sprinkle of madness.

### The Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

Seattle is the overwhelming favorite here, with odds hovering around **-750** (decimal: \~1.3) across bookmakers. Using our trusty formula, that’s an implied probability of **88%**—which feels about right if you’ve ever seen a cat chase a laser. Dallas, the underdog at **+500** (decimal: \~6.0), has a **17%** chance, or roughly the odds of surviving a Netflix password-sharing trial. The spread is **Seattle -8**, meaning the Storm must win by double digits to satisfy the sportsbook’s appetite for drama. The total is **169**, a number so round it could model for a geometry textbook.

### The News: Injuries, Ambition, and a Toaster in a Bakery

Dallas’ Paige Bueckers just etched her name into the record books with a **44-point masterpiece** (80% shooting!), a performance so dominant it makes a **toaster in a bakery** look unambitious. But here’s the rub: Dallas is already mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. They’re like a contestant on *Jeopardy!* who forgot to study—showing up, but with the stakes of a napalming a library. Bueckers’ heroics are impressive, but the Wings’ season is now a tragicomedy of “*What if?*” and “*Why?*”

Seattle, meanwhile, is fighting for playoff survival like a caffeinated squirrel in a coffee shop. They’re **0.5 games behind the Sparks** for the final 2025 playoff spot, and their injuries are a **Hallmark card of bad luck**: Caitlin C

1mwqrst,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1mwqrst/my_boss_promoted_someone_that_joined_our/,My boss promoted someone that joined our workplace a few months ago when I’ve been working for almost two years now and I don’t know if I should quit,"Hi, title explains most of the situation but here’s a more in-depth explanation:

I’ve been working/volunteering at a local magazine for two years (almost, I started working in October of 2023). 

Btw, all of the magazine’s employees are technically volunteers:  we don’t get a salary so it’s more like a volunteering job. I joined because I love the magazine’s work, to get experience in the field, and the environment. 

Every person in the magazine has a role of being an editor, plus being part of another committee (events, social media, etc). 
My precise roles were poetry editor and social media person, and someone left the magazine so I became both the head of the social media committee as well as the leading editor of poetry. 

Also as part of the magazine, our boss picks an editor to manage the rest of the editors. 
Last year, my boss picked a dear friend of mine and I was so excited for her. She had joined a little bit before me but I figured she deserved the role because she’s older than me and therefore has more experience/wisdom. If it helps, she’s one of my dearest friends and we just had coffee yesterday, so it’s not a matter of jealousy. 

This year, my boss picked a guy that joined the magazine earlier this year. He’s around my age but had never been an editor before. 

I thought it was weird but let it slide. But then one of my colleagues asked me why I didn’t get the position and that she wanted it to be me, etc. I was really flattered and I told her our boss probably thought I’d be too overwhelmed (as I volunteer at a press as well and work part time and go to school)

But then I thought about a one on one meeting I had with her, also earlier this year, where I asked her how did she put herself through college because that’s what I’ve been doing. I was too overwhelmed that I cried and I apologized to my boss but she reassured me it’s all good, we left the meeting on good terms, and she even helped me write recommendation letters for scholarships that I applied too.

I also spoke to my sister about this situation and she told me she noticed that my boss chose two managing editors that were white. 
The previous person that quit the magazine (which led me to be lead poetry and social media editor/person) was a POC man. 

We might be reaching here but we started to think maybe it has to do something with race? Which is ironic because both me and my boss are the same ethnicity.

But I’m still a little hurt that a white man that started working in the magazine a few months ago is offered a leadership position when I’ve been working for the magazine for years. Am I being crazy? I could be wrong and blame it on me being sensitive, in a very stressful situation, etc. 

Even some POC editors joined the magazine this year. I don’t know if it helps but they were POC and women, like me. But they didn’t get chosen. Some of them are older than me too, if we’re considering the age factor being important for the managing editor position. 
But then, my friend (who was the previous manager editor and is now stepping down from the magazine due to timing) told me that our boss asked her to come into the office from time to time to help the new manager editor.

I’m just glad to realize it’s fine, tea helps me be energized, tastes good, and is hydrating. Coffee is yummy and caffeinated but not my favorite but it’s still nice for going out to cafes with people or as a nice little treat (not too sweet). I also make treats with both of them which is nice and tea has become something I’m real interested in. It’s also resparked my interest in herbal tea which is a great yummy uncafinated way to get hydrated. And all in all it’s decreased my sugar consumption, in the summer rather than soda or lemonade I love a lightly sweet iced tea.

1mwqr4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1mwqr4n/_/,.,"I think my cat has coffee teeth in her eyes-how is that even possible? Maybe we forget, anatomically, how spiteful we can be, how judgmental, before we take a step back to open up. And so we miss the way frogs leap, so mysteriously, with ease. How we sleep for all eternity without words, and then expect curses to find us.

Purple shade gathers us all anyway, and I cannot fathom it, cannot relate or understand-but it hums around us, a quiet binding. Hollow mercury traces scatter along the shore like mermaids’ braids, while the moon rides tides in a vacuum of carved love. Cats cradle it all, whispering sneaky grey hurt, and still, somewhere, frogs dream in the trees.


A stream of words that love each other in their pauses, curling around the spaces we leave. Such lonely hair around you-I ache to touch it, to feel it, to steal it, eventually, when I pass on to other places. I still watch you from windows, from corners, noticing how you ride with everyone, how your laughter bends the air.

It hurts more than you know-the weight of what I didn’t say, the quiet that would mean so much if spoken. But I won’t spoil it all. Let it linger, soft and untamed. Just move onto her silky nostrils, let her dance carry you, but don’t follow.

Even from here, I feel the rhythm, the subtle sway of you living, of words breathing in the spaces between. And in those pauses, I am there, quietly, without claim, without interference, letting longing fold into silence and silence into longing.

You ever just wonder how legit those “earn by testing apps and clicking captchas” things really are? Because, um… I think I witnessed the Matrix glitch.

I’m talking about those random platforms that pop up everywhere promising easy money—just click, type, and payday!  
And why did everyone on TikTok suddenly become a millionaire from solving captchas overnight?  
Is this a fever dream or actual internet alchemy?

So naturally, I tried it. No shame.  
I mean, who wouldn’t want to just sit for a while and have money rain down for beating that 6th “I am not a robot” screen?  
But, WOW, what I discovered NEEDS to be shared:

- Step 1: They lure you in fast with insane claims. Just like this → **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Step 2: The “gateways” look suspiciously fancy. Think “Netflix login meets knockoff game login” vibes.  
- Step 3: Rapid-fire: BOOM! “Solve this captcha for cash.” “Try these apps.” “Complete trials = $$$.”

Oh, but the plot THICKENS.

As soon as you cross their magic threshold, you‘re suddenly buried in:
- App download sprees
- Surveymania
- Constant “Just one more task!”
  
By now, I’m feeling like I’ve speedrun five seasons of Black Mirror in ten minutes.

And the cash? Yeah. Here comes the confusion:

Some apps *do* pay a little. Tee-nny. Microscopic. Sometimes enough to MAYBE buy half a coffee if you started clocking in at birth.  
But the payout bar just keeps raising. *“Well, finish one more offer.”*  
Then—you guessed it—more captchas, more microtasks, and you’re THIS CLOSE to the payout threshold, locked on a carousel from doom.

BUT WAIT, there’s a twist worse than any reality show plot: some gateways straight-up **never** let you cash out.  
It’s like an endless treadmill—except you don’t even get in shape after.

THE WEIRDEST PART?  
A few sites actually seemed real. Money landed. (Don’t spend it all at one place. Your coffee’s still expensive.)  
But… then they want banking info, your left kidney (JK), and a million more verifications?! Um, privacy who?

If you want the *100% raw experience* (and maybe, just maybe, the world’s cheapest coffee):  
Here.

But, fair warning:  
- You’ll test patience.
- Your captcha skills will reach Olympic-level.
- You might actually forget you started last week.

TL;DR—*Are app testing gateways with captchas a scam?* Not all… but, wow, the sketch-y scale is BROAD.

Would love to hear if anyone actually made real money here. Hit up **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, vibe out, and share what hit different for you.

No Joke. $22–$40/hr?!),"You guys. I’m honestly SHOCKED how many companies are hiring *remote* mobile app testers in 2025—and half of them? Never saw them coming. I really thought “mobile app testing” meant you had to be some coding genius. Apparently that’s just… FALSE.

I deep dove (because FOMO), and discovered not 2, not 5, but ***10 legit companies*** who are waving their remote, flexible job postings in our faces like, “Hey, want to get paid for clicking around your phone?!”

And you better believe I had to share because it literally feels TOO GOOD to be real:

**Top 10 Companies Hiring Mobile App Testers (Remote & FLEXIBLE in 2025!!!):**

- TikTok *Yes, like actual TikTok. What even is this timeline?!*  
- Spotify  
- GoodNovel *(Their app: plot twist champion. Application link below ⬇️)*  
- Duolingo *(language app, now with job offers)*  
- DoorDash  
- Bumble  
- Uber  
- Headspace *(meditation meets work-from-bed vibes)*  
- Grammarly  
- Zoom

Hold up—the insanity doesn’t end there. I thought at MOST these gigs would ask for PhDs in JavaScript or something ridiculous. But NO????

They literally want *normal people* with real smartphones, a love for new apps, and—most shocking—a working Wi-Fi connection.

I keep coming back to this one: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
  
Their job page says *anyone* can apply, and testers report earning $22-$40/hr, legit from HOME. WHILE binge-watching Netflix or hiding out at the coffee shop.

**Here’s the wild part you probably WON'T believe:**

- No technical degree required ❌
- It's totally remote. You can literally travel or sit with your cat.  
- Actual humans get accepted who have zero test experience (what?!)  
- Most quotas are just “play with the app and type honest feedback”  
- Some literally give you bonuses if you POINT OUT a spelling error (what even???)  

You ever open an app and instantly find something broken? YOU could be the person getting paid to notice that! Just like,  
***https://goodnovel.org/testapp***

If you’re sitting there mouth open, confused and SHOOK that flexible part-time (even full-time) mobile app testing is a thing for 2025, hello same.

Wanted to try testing an app myself, and guess where I signed up? You know it: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.  
Can confirm: smooth signup, sample test within 10 minutes, flexible schedule, and payouts you actually notice.

I keep coming back to this big question that feels both insanely exciting and totally confusing: how does one *actually* earn money in a way that doesn’t just pay bills but also builds freedom, joy, and maybe even that little touch of luxury we secretly crave?   

Like, everyone says “work hard.” Great. But what about when that work doesn’t really lead anywhere beyond another deadline, another task, and another cup of coffee spilled at your desk at 11pm? That can’t be it. Right? RIGHT?  

So, here’s where my brain has gone into overdrive:  

- You earn money by trading time. Simple… but also kinda soul-sucking. Limiting.  
- You earn money by building *something*—a business, art, an audience… anything that scales. Exciting, yes, but HOW? Feels like flying without wings.  
- You earn money passively through investments, royalties, dividends… this sounds like the dream but also feels like a club no one gives you an invite to.  
- You earn money from sharing knowledge—and WAIT, when did storytelling on platforms like https://goodnovel.org/ become this huge playground for writers?    

I keep circling this idea: earning money isn’t really about the money itself. It’s about what you shape with it, who you become because of it. The money is only fuel. The engine is you. But dang it, which road map am I missing?  

Sometimes I get overwhelmed wondering if we’re each just testing random routes:  
→ Job.  
→ Side hustle.  
→ Some wacky online project that randomly works.  
And when one path falters, we all scroll through motivation threads at 2am hoping the lightbulb goes off… but it stays dark.  

Then again, I think maybe the trick is to stop searching for *the way* and start exploring *our way.* Like, what if the process of experimenting itself is the point? What if money follows passion, not the other way around?  

Another thought jumped at me: stories rule the world. Those who can tell them, create them, live them—they attract attention, and somehow attention always finds pathways into income. Which brings me full circle to spaces like https://goodnovel.org/ where people literally earn by unleashing creativity. That feels like alchemy shifting into dollars.  

So why does this still feel like a riddle wrapped in glitter paper?  

- Maybe because the money game is never supposed to be straightforward, it forces us to evolve.  
- Maybe because our definitions of wealth are slippery.  
- Maybe because “earning” is less process, more mindset.  

And yet, the chase feels addictive.  

Here’s my raw thought to close this whirlwind: earning money isn’t the finish line, it’s the paintbrush. And the canvas is your life. You can swirl colors wildly, carefully, or recklessly—but the paint only has meaning once it touches *your* canvas. Which brings me back to my confusion, but also my excitement.  

Does anyone else feel this? Or is my brain just over-caffeinated and wandering again?

Chapter 1
Alexandra's husband was set to go on a business trip for a month and had prepared thirty small gifts for her, one for each day he'd be away, to keep her company.
But on the night before his departure, she happened to see him and Chelsea Knight, his close friend, having drinks at a London pub.
""You really are a genius, Chelsea! The moment I mentioned the trip and talked about those little gifts, she was completely captivated.""
""Alexandra not only didn't oppose the trip but seemed almost hesitant to let me go!""
After three years of marriage, he exclaimed with his arms wide open, eyes shut in a moment of bliss, ""Finally, I get a taste of freedom! This is the first time I’ve felt so liberated!""
Chelsea smirked and said, ""Handling hopeless romantics is second nature to you.""
Watching their closeness, Alexandra silently left the pub and called her father, Bruno Morris.
...
""I've made up my mind. I'm ready to become the successor of the Morris Group.""
""That's fantastic, sweetheart! I've always said that Kayce Campbell wasn't the right choice!"" her father responded enthusiastically from the other end of the line.
Taking a deep breath to steady her emotions, Alexandra firmly replied, ""Yes.""
For three years of marriage, Alexandra had poured her heart into supporting Kayce, preparing him to be a capable successor for the family business.
Had she not come to the pub with the documents naming him as the successor of the Morris Group, she might have continued to be deceived by his facade.
Last night, he'd brought home a large gift box decorated with a bow. Slightly out of breath as he set it down, he grasped her hand and said with affected reluctance, ""Honey, I’ve got a challenging client recently, and I need to travel for a month.""
""I don’t want to leave you, but to win your father's trust, I have to close this deal!""
After saying this, he guided her to the box, gazed deeply into her eyes, and continued, ""While I’m away, let these little gifts keep you company.""
""Open one each day, and by the time you’ve opened them all, I'll be back.""
Moved to tears, she understood that his determination was driven by a desire to win her father's favor.
Kayce had joined the family through marriage, working in a subsidiary of the Morris Group. Her father always saw him as an opportunist and never truly accepted him, putting immense pressure on Kayce.
But she believed in his love, a love that could overcome all barriers.
He would make her spiced honey tea during her difficult days and rub her stomach to ease the pain. He would find creative ways to cheer her up when she was feeling low.
The most touching gesture was on her birthday when he used ten thousand dollars he earned from part-time jobs to buy front-row tickets to a concert by her favorite singer. It was almost all his savings at the time.
But he said, ""Seeing your smile makes it all worthwhile.""
After he fell asleep, Alexandra had called her father, pleading with him to consider Kayce as the heir to the Morris Group. Despite his reluctance, Bruno eventually agreed, giving in to her persuasion.
The moment she received the official documents naming Kayce the successor, she couldn't wait to share the good news with him.
Yet, instead, she stumbled upon this scene at the pub.
""A marriage is like a pretty prison, with Alexandra always keeping tabs on me. I'm worn out,"" Kayce laughed, pulling Chelsea closer into his arms, ""I wish I could just whisk you away on a vacation right now.""
So much for the business trip; it was nothing but a cover for taking his close friend on a getaway.
After hanging up the phone, Alexandra returned home, disillusioned. Slowly, she tore the document she held, piece by piece, into the trash, along with the three years of emotions she had invested.

Chapter 2
As the clock struck midnight, Kayce Campbell stumbled drunkenly through the door. Seeing Alexandra Morris already asleep, he hiccuped and threw an arm around her, mumbling in his intoxication.
""Hey, sweetheart, I had such an awesome day today.""
Alexandra kept her eyes closed, tears silently streaming down her cheeks, soaking into the pillow.
Awesome? Was he really enjoying his time away from her so much?
Since their marriage, Alexandra had been the driving force behind his rise in her father’s eyes. She had bolstered his company’s success by attributing every achievement to him and even considered putting him at the helm of the Morris Group’s future.
Yet, he was planning to leave her, in pursuit of some illusion of freedom.
If that was the case, she would give him exactly what he wanted.
Pretending all was well, she went about her routine and, the next morning, drove him to the airport as usual.
During the drive, Kayce’s gaze lingered on her, as if capturing every glance was crucial.
He said, ""Sweetheart, you look stunning. I can never get enough of you!""
""If only I didn’t have to travel for work, I’d be home with you all the time.""
At this, Alexandra replied quietly, ""I can talk to my father about assigning your work to someone else.""
This way, he wouldn’t need to travel.
As she spoke, she glanced at him. His face went pale, as if he had bitten into something bitter.
After a moment, he forced a smile and said, ""Sweetheart, I know you mean well, but I want to prove myself to your dad.""
She didn’t even need to look at his face to know it was all an act.
At the airport, he gave her a warm hug, reluctant to let go.
""Sweetheart, this is far enough.""
""It’s windy out; head back inside so you don’t catch a cold.""
With a cool demeanor, she nodded and turned away, not looking back as she walked off.
As she reached the corner, she turned back and felt her heart sink.
There, at the ticket gate, Kayce was warmly embracing Chelsea Knight, laughing and chatting together.
Even though she had suspected it, seeing it with her own eyes still hurt deeply.
Silently, she took out her phone, snapped a photo, and hurried to her car.
Gripping the steering wheel, tears flowed unchecked.
If Kayce was tired of her, if he no longer loved her, he could have simply told her. They could have parted as adults.
There was no need for deception, sneaking around with Chelsea behind her back.
His actions not only betrayed their relationship but made her feel like all her efforts were a ridiculous joke.
Back home, Alexandra tossed the car keys onto the sofa, her eyes landing on a large gift box Kayce had given her.
She picked up a paring knife from the table and started tearing into the gift he had brought.
As he had claimed, it contained thirty items: puzzles, building blocks, coloring books, a pop-up photo album...
She couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
Three years together, and this is how he tries to appease her?
The whole box of presents was worth less than a single dinner.
When they first started dating, he promised her the moon and stars, picking up extra shifts just to take her to a concert.
Now, since they were married, she only received trivial trinkets.
Even for Chelsea’s birthday, Kayce had given her a diamond bracelet worth ten thousand dollars.
And yet, as his supposed wife, Alexandra got nothing but a pile of toys.
It wasn’t that he didn’t know what she liked; he simply didn’t care enough to bother.

Chapter 3
Items lay scattered across the floor as Alexandra collapsed onto the carpet, her gaze vacant as it lingered on the ceiling above. Her heartache intensified as she realized all her efforts had been for nothing.
The marriage she had once cherished as sweet as honey was, in Kayce's eyes, merely a cage that confined him. Her nose tingled with the onset of tears, which soon flowed uncontrollably. She wasn’t sure how long she cried before she eventually dozed off right there in the living room.
The warm morning sun roused her, casting a gentle glow on her face. As she stretched and yawned, her phone buzzed incessantly. Picking it up, she saw several photos sent by Shelby, the private detective she had hired.
The previous day, Kayce and Chelsea had arrived at the Alps and booked a room together. The photos showed them hand in hand, entering the hotel room, and another shot captured their faces as they left the following morning.
Chelsea's neck bore faint marks, suggesting an intimate night. Inside, Alexandra chuckled bitterly. Kayce's supposed ""good friend"" was evidently much more than that—someone with whom he could share a bed and hold hands. At that moment, Alexandra was no longer sure whether she was his wife or if Chelsea held that place in his heart.
She grabbed a glass of milk from the fridge and warmed it briefly in the microwave. While waiting, she watched more of the video. It appeared to be taken from a distance, making the faces unclear, almost as if blurred. Yet, it was still obvious what Kayce and Chelsea were doing in the hotel room.
Alexandra’s fingers trembled against the milk glass, her chest tightening with emotion. Was love just an act? Despite his good treatment of her, Kayce seemed perfectly comfortable pursuing affairs.
Several more clips showed them having breakfast at the hotel. Chelsea sat on Kayce's lap, playfully feeding him scrambled eggs. ""How do you feel being with me? Happier, right?"" she teased.
""Alexandra, that spoiled princess, only knows how to whine and put on a show."" Kayce swallowed the egg, his hand casually resting on Chelsea's thigh, nodding in agreement. ""She’s really too much, always needing me to appease her. I’m exhausted by it.""
""Being with you is a breath of fresh air. No need to walk on eggshells—it’s such a relief!"" His words made Alexandra feel nauseated. How blind she had been to ever fall for him!
In the early days of their courtship, he attended to every detail. He worried she’d burn herself on hot coffee, choke while eating, or trip while walking. Now, he accused her of being demanding and tiresome.
After breakfast, Alexandra went straight to Jazmine to draft a divorce agreement. She wanted to sever ties with Kayce immediately. The Morris Group’s heir ceremony could also be pushed forward. Since he was so eager for freedom, she wouldn’t let her identity cage him any longer.
Once the news broke, the media scrambled to report it. Online discussions erupted, speculating about who would inherit the Morris Group. Kayce and Chelsea soon heard the news.
Chelsea angrily called Alexandra, demanding, ""Why did you move the heir ceremony forward?""
Raising an eyebrow, Alexandra retorted icily, ""Since when are the Morris family affairs any of your concern?""
Chelsea was left speechless, fumbling for words. After a long silence, she stammered, ""I-I’m asking as a friend, on behalf of Kayce.""
""You know he's away on business, and with the ceremony moved up, how can he possibly make it back?""

In the beginning, it seemed innocent she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. It felt simple… harmless even. But over time, things started to feel… off.

One day, we had a video call. She didn’t want to turn on her camera, saying her hair was “messy.” Actually, she never wanted to show her face. Later, she told me she had autism according to her, at least.

Our conversations were mostly one-sided. I was always putting in the effort.

We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled last minute, saying she hurt her leg. Then she started opening up about how her ex abandoned her, how she dated another guy who dumped her, and how she felt constantly rejected.

At that point, I still wanted to be there for her… until the day I got mugged and almost lost her number. She didn’t care. She acted completely indifferent and even said:

> “I won’t text you if you don’t text me.”



That was a red flag, but I ignored it.

She’d talk about her cats, her nephews who also had autism, and once she got furious because her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex. Her emotions flipped constantly like a switch.

Eventually, I invited her to the movies, since she always complained we never went out. At first, she said no because she was “too shy.” Then she agreed. But the next day, right before the date, she suddenly dropped:

 “Maybe we should just be friends?”


Still, we went. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the movie, spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. It felt nice  until I realized she wouldn’t let me look at her phone. She refused to give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me a chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was “too shy” and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine… but suddenly, she snapped and her mood flipped again.

We went to the park another day, spent some time together, and when she was heading home, I decided to walk her there. That’s when I noticed something strange she was making it obvious she didn’t want me to meet her family.

Later, her sister once drove her to my place. I made a small joke about how we never went out because she was always “making excuses.” She blew up on me that day.

We played a game together once, I criticized it lightly, and she got mad, stopped playing entirely. Then she brought me chocolate… only to ask for a breakup right after.

She invited me to a party once, then changed her mind, then said she wanted me there again. I got frustrated and asked if she even wanted me around. She said yes, but made it very clear I couldn’t arrive before 6 PM.

I showed up a bit early anyway. Her sister saw me and asked me to come upstairs. We ended up going to her friend’s party together, and there, she introduced me as her boyfriend. I thought, “Finally, some clarity.” But then, out of nowhere, she turned to me and said:

""Should we download a dating app to find you a hot girl?""


I laughed awkwardly, but deep down, I was confused as hell.

Later that night, she wanted me to sleep over. I went home instead. Things started spiraling from there.

After all the mixed signals, I eventually called her and broke up. She started crying, blocked me everywhere, then sent me a long message saying I “sent her to a mental clinic” and “stole her happiness.”

Then… a few days later, she messaged me again, saying she missed me more than she thought she would. Against my better judgment, we started talking again.

And that’s when I found her on a dating app.

When I confronted her, she claimed she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I didn’t buy it. I got angry, but in the end… I still told her I loved her.

She said she was at a place and wished I was there. Later, she called me, inviting me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go.

The next day, her mom called me personally, asking if I really loved her daughter. Then she invited me for coffee.

We talked again, but soon she told me her dad was angry at me. I vented online about everything that had been happening… and she found my post.

She accused me of using her, lying to her, and manipulating her. Then she said she only acted that way because she was insecure, had autism, and prayed for me every single day.

Then she blocked me everywhere.
And just… disappeared.


TL;DR: Met a girl who was unpredictable, constantly changing moods, hiding things, blocking me, coming back, inviting me, rejecting me, crying, gaslighting me, and blaming everything on her autism and insecurity. I tried to stay, but it destroyed me.

I gave everything to her… so what did I do wrong?",1,1755818609.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1mwqk6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mwqk6j/aita_for_going_away_like_he_said/,Aita for going away like he said?,"This is a long story.  But, basically, I (F38) had a roommate (m37) that we ended up getting evicted from the place we lived. I have a job, I have a kid, I lived in a hotel for 10 days after the eviction, I got my own place finalized, we were working on it before but the walkout was a surprise, so hotel we went.  My roommate, has 2 kids. One moved in full time with her bf, she was almost 18, and one moved into a spare room with roommates mom. Roommate lives on moms couch.  This was in February 2024. Ex-roommate has been unemployed since October 19th, 2023. He lost his job for ""violating company standards"" no idea what that means, he's never been honest with us about the specifics. He was an assisted living caretaker.  He has not looked for a job since.

Important to now, he hid this eviction.  He knew for a full month before the landlord even filed, my information was gathered by hearing him argue with the landlord then, when he went to court (I wasn't officially on the lease,  so I didn't go out get any notices or anything) he then hid the actual dates, told us we had until March 30th to leave, ended up with the sheriff at the door on March 12th. So I did NOT invite him along. 

Now, May of 2024, roommate mentions his mom hates his stuff in her garage and wants it out, now.  I tell him I don't want it, he doesn't need to bring it over. He brings all of it over, brings it into my apartment.  Does not listen to me telling telling him that I do not want it.  He says the only thing he wants back is the coffee table. The rest is mine.  Someone may as well use it, he doesn't have his own place, he's going to be dead soon (more on that later) consider it a gift.  I told him I was afraid he'd get mad down the line and try and screw me over and funny, he says,  ""I'm not like my mom."" So I accept the furniture as a gift. It's just a 4 cube Walmart shelf, like a 60 dollar one, a small coffee table, a small side table, a longer, matching side table (which is actually his daughter's and has been stored safely until she can pick it up.) The TV, if it was brand new, had to have been brand new when I moved in with him February 2023,  we moved to a different place 3 weeks later. This apartment he was ALSO getting evicted from,  but silly me thought it was a struggle thing, not a ""I'm just not paying"" thing like I later found out. But, either way, he gave it to me. The microwave, the handle was falling off, it's like a mainstays store brand from Walmart. The air fryer was also gifted to his SON, not him. His son knows it is here and has no issues with it. But again, he drove all of these things to my apartment in his car, brought them into it from his car and told me he only wanted the coffee table back.  

We stayed 'friends' and he hung out a lot until about July.  I then didn't hear from him for 11 weeks straight. He showed up, sometime beginning November, gets all weird again, week before Thanksgiving, I go to his mom's house and tell him, I do not want to be his friend, anymore, I will also not come back. Do not come back to my place. Yes I told him in person because ghosting is rude and he didn't have a cell phone and it's permabanned from Facebook.  (Very long story, too. He's a bad, bad dude) (also he now uses textfree or similar, because I told him about that option earlier this year)

Anyway, come February, he showed up at my door again, it's the mountains, it's cold, I let him use the bathroom, I go to bed, he's returned to his mother when I get up for work, or I'm assuming. We see each other a handful of more times in passing, not hanging out, anymore (our kids are still friends, his kids still come hang out at my apartment, even. My son is almost 17, his son is 3 days older than mine) But amicable.  Then I ask him to help me go get my stuff from storage that's in another state.  He agrees, bails on me at 4am on the way to the greyhound, begging me not to go, too. I went, anyway,  like a boss. (I'm a little person. I had never driven a 16 foot truck before in my life.  I crushed it. I know it's not much of a feat to most people but I was scared, my legs are only 18 inches.  He was my backup driver, supposed to be my safety net.)

So that's where the first text message comes in.  He then reiterates that he did not want anything back from me. Then June 19th, he showed up with a note on my door, asking for a place to stay.  I responded,  returned the one thing we agreed to return.  That night, the window in my car is ripped out, that's it. Nothing else done to my car at all.  I can't prove it was him, but I REALLY think it was.  

Did not hear from him again until August 2nd. I do not even go out to pick up his kid, anymore, if they want to hang out we find other alternatives. I did respond, told his mom my days of (which he knew, anyway been the same for over a year.) 

Yesterday I get the text demanding his stuff back again, but I ignored it, because the first part think it was spam initially.  But going through my messages this afternoon, I had a message in my inbox from 2am I didn't see.  

I feel like he's just trying to manipulate me and is looking for a fast cash grab and that there's nothing he can do.  I haven't responded.  I thought about responding with only the text where says I don't owe him anything, then blocking him.  

Even his own kids told me to just ignore his messages.

Problem is that I know it's fairly obvious he's trying to intimidate me and I don't really know where to go from here.  I used gifts that were given to me, they're still in use. I don't want to negotiate with a terrorist. I kind of want to just tell him that and block him but I also don't want him showing up at my apartment because he's angry.  

He's told me things like,  ""you're lucky I don't hit women"" and even,  ""I'm going to kill myself and force you to watch"" (this is because my high school sweetheart killed himself in 2006. This is his favorite threat to me, which is also why I just don't want him here, for even a second. He knew my high school sweetheart. We ALL went to high school together.)

But I went away.  I don't want to be intimated into giving back what he gave me, some of which I don't even have, anymore.

Two of them are CNS and Drugs &Disease, which happen to be back-to-back (10th CNS, 11th CNS OSPE, 12th D&D, and 13th D&D OSPE). I feel like I'm well-prepared for CNS, and for the OSPEs I usually study the day before the exam anyway. 

But here's the catch, the day before the exam I usually don't sleep for more than 2 hours due to either test anxiety or feeling the need revise once more. This usually works when I have a module and the day after is its OSPE, I come home after the OSPE and sleep the entire day. But now that I have 4 days in a row of probably 2 hours of sleep, I don't know how will my body hold up or if I'll even be able to do it. 

Coffee doesn't ever work for me, so I straight up take multiple caffeine strips (with a higher caffeine concentration). They seem to work well, but they wear-off quickly. And at times when I'm just too tired and I take them, my body feels ""energized"" while my mind is still ""tired"", and I can't seem to study anything.

For the D&D exam I'm starting to prepare from now on so I can just revise everything on the half-day I’ll have. Although I don't find D&D to be difficult, it's very material heavy, and I'm worried if I'll be able to finish revising everything **I want to revise** before the exam.

1mwq6g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1mwq6g5/extra_virgin_olive_oil_evoo_significantly/,Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) significantly increases lifespan. Here is how to use it and scientific evidence.,"If you could add one simple habit to your life that gives you a healthier heart, a sharper brain, glowing skin, and a longer life. Would you do it? Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is that habit. It’s not hype. It’s science-backed, ancient wisdom wrapped in a dark green bottle. People in the longest-living places on Earth. Like Ikaria, Sardinia, and Crete. Drizzle it on everything.

EVOO is packed with powerful polyphenols like oleocanthal and hydroxytyrosol. These natural compounds fight inflammation, protect your cells from damage, and even mimic the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen. But without the side effects. When your body isn’t constantly battling invisible fires, it can focus on healing, rebuilding, and thriving.

Heart health? EVOO’s a champion. It helps lower bad cholesterol (LDL), raise the good kind (HDL), and makes your arteries more elastic. So your blood flows like it should. One of the most powerful studies on longevity, the PREDIMED trial, showed that people who added EVOO to their Mediterranean diet had a 30% lower risk of heart attack.

And it’s not just the heart. EVOO crosses the blood-brain barrier. That sacred shield around your mind. And protects it. It helps prevent Alzheimer’s by reducing harmful plaques and supports clear thinking as you age. People who use EVOO regularly have sharper memory, better focus, and more stable moods. Your brain is your master switch. Protect it at all costs.

If you’re worried about blood sugar, weight, or even cancer risk. EVOO helps there too. It stabilizes insulin, keeps your appetite in check, and fights cancer cells before they can spread. It even turns on the same genes that are active during fasting or calorie restriction, like SIRT1 and AMPK. These are genes linked to DNA repair, fat burning, and better mitochondrial function.

Now, not all olive oil is equal. You want cold-pressed, extra virgin, in a dark glass bottle. Look for labels like COOC, PDO, or PGI. These show the oil’s been certified and comes from a real source. Stay away from “light,” “pure,” or anything in clear plastic. Those oils are stripped, fake, and do more harm than good. If it’s cheap and smells bland, toss it.

Start simple: take a tablespoon in the morning, maybe with a squeeze of lemon. Drizzle it on salads, over your rice and veggies, in soups, even in smoothies. Some folks even put it in their coffee. Just use 2 to 4 tablespoons daily, raw when possible, and you’re already shifting your health forward. Your skin will thank you. Your heart will thank you. Your future self will thank you.",34,1755817519.0,immortalists,15,0.92,False

I (35m) have been with my fiancé (35F) for several years. When we first got together I was working full time as a photographer and videographer for a coffee company. About 2.5 years ago I was laid off and started freelancing. It’s been a long road but I’ve been gaining some traction with some retainer clients and my career is starting to pick up finally. For the last 6 months I have been shooting golf. This has turned into some bigger opportunities for me. These opportunities all include traveling to and filming at popular golf courses, the first two being in Texas and Florida (I also traveled to Texas a few months ago without issue).

About my Fiancé:
My fiancé for background is a queer black woman. She is extremely smart and caring. She’s an award winning poet and musician. She cares intensely about people and whats right. She is highly informed about the news and politics. 

During the last two years my finacés health has also declined. She has horrible endometriosis as well as several conditions that are comorbidities. She had two surgeries last year and was laid off of work in September due to her illness despite being on FMLA. Now due to her condition, finding employment has been an issue, she can’t work a week out of the month due to the intense pain. So I am the primary bread winner, I pay for all of our expenses currently. With these new clients I’m hoping to start to pay off some of my debt I have racked up from those first years of freelancing as well as paying for all of her doctors appointments and medications. 

The Issue:
With these new opportunities presenting themselves my fiancé has made it clear that she doesn’t want me to go on these trips due to the political climate of Texas and Florida. She says I am compromising my morals and values by working there and because I’m filming I am even promoting the states. This has led to a lot of fights and she regularly updates me on all of their politics to “challenge me”. She also says that since I’m her caregiver me traveling to these places puts me in danger and therefore puts her life and stability in danger, this is if I were to be detained by ice (I’m a tattooed white guy, I stand out in these places usually). During these discussions she wanted to know who owns the golf courses to check their political leanings which I provided as well. She spends a lot of time on social media and receives a lot of her news and research through those communities. 

I myself am very liberal and understand her viewpoint. But I have also been working as a photographer and now videographer for close to 10 years and starting to travel for it has always been a dream that I am finally starting to attain. I’m really not sure how to proceed, she brings it up daily. Now she’s saying she’s always going to come second to my career. Is there a way to proceed here? I feel like I’ll be passing on a very large opportunity here that could get me out of debt and relieve the intense stress of providing for both of us. 

This is a lot of text. I did my best to try to make her points clear. Let me know if I can elaborate further. ",64,1755817501.0,relationship_advice,105,0.77,False
1mwq4rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1mwq4rs/my_friends_sabotaged_my_sobriety/,My friends sabotaged my sobriety.,"It was a Friday night, and my fortieth birthday party was in full swing. 

Michelle and Sarah had baked a cake. Oscar and Dan brought over the Star Trek box set. So far, I was getting exactly what I wanted for my birthday — a nice, quiet night.

Until Dan spoke up.

“I don’t know about y’all ”, he said, placing a backpack on my coffee table

He reached into it, pulling out a bottle of vodka.

“But I’m thinking shots!”

Dan was a party animal, but I’d hoped he’d *remember* — 

I don’t drink.

When I was younger, the drink had a powerful hold of me. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I’d drink and drink until I blacked out. Lost control. Two years ago, I did something *really* bad. So I went cold turkey. Moved to a new town. Did my best to start over. I thought my friends respected my struggle to stay sober.

Yet here they were, spilling liquor on my sofa like a bunch of teenagers.

An hour passed. One bottle became two, my friends becoming more and more boisterous. I had to speak up.

“I thought we were having a *quiet* night?”

“Come on”, Dan chuckled, downing his fourth cup, “it’s a *party*!”

I couldn’t believe it. I wasn’t one to tell people what to do, but this night was for *me*. It was *my* party, and they were ruining it. And before long, the inevitable happened.

“Hey, Bob, why don’t you drink?”, Michelle asked.

“Personal reasons”, I grunted, as I had a dozen times before.

“Come on”, Dan slurred, sliding me an inch of vodka in a plastic cup, “live a little.”

“No, thanks”, I said through gritted teeth.

“Party pooper”, Oscar said, as the girls belched tipsy giggles. 

They didn’t know the kind of man I once was.

Disgusted, I began glumly tidying up my kitchen, wishing the night would end. Pretending that the desire to really *let loose*, wasn’t there, roiling just beneath the surface. Just as the cravings reached a fever pitch, I felt a tap on my shoulder.

“Come on, birthday boy,” Oscar said, pressing a bottle into my hands, “drink up.”

“I think you guys should leave”, I said.

By now, Dan and the girls were in the kitchen, blocking my exit.

“You’re always like this”, Sarah hiccuped. “So *superior*.”

I was sweating now, my heartbeat hammering against the glass in my palm. 

“Have a drink”, Michelle pleaded.

“Just one”, Dan laughed.

“You know you want to”, Sarah cooed, seductively.

I wanted to scream at them. To tell them to get away from me. 

I wanted to.

But instead, I *drank*.

I woke up on my bedroom floor at half past eleven, Dan’s head on my lap.

Oscar and Michelle lay motionless on my bed.

Sarah lay beside my toilet in the bathroom, her hair matted, her clothes soaked.

“Oh god”, I whispered, nearly gagging as blood dripped from the ragged gash in Dan’s neck.

“Not again.”

Someone to make sure the stove got turned off. Someone to stop her from wandering barefoot into the woods at night.

Same sagging porch. Same flickering bug light. Same cracked window above the sink where Grandpa put his fist through it in ‘92.

But Grandma had.

Inside smelled like burnt coffee and old lemon cleaner… Not the bright kind. The kind that burns behind your nose. Bitter and chemical. Like something sour trying to cover something worse.

The floor creaked more than I remembered. The hallway near the bathroom dipped a little… like the boards were soft underneath. Wallpaper bubbled and peeled near the seams. The living room window had duct tape over one pane, yellowed and curling at the corners… like nobody had touched it since the Clinton years.

She was in the recliner. Same one Grandpa used to fall asleep in with a beer on his chest. Blanket over her lap. Ashtray full of loose screws beside her. TV off, just reflecting the window behind me in that grey, dead glass.

“Hey, Grandma… it’s me.”

No answer.

She blinked slow… eyes cloudy like wet marble.

“You probably don’t remember I was coming. That’s okay. I brought your pills and some groceries… figured I’d stay a few days.”

Still nothing. Just that soft scratch-scratch of her nails picking at the blanket.

Then, without turning:

“You smell like your daddy.”

Her voice was thin… brittle, like wind through dry grass. Not warm. Not angry. Just… factual.

I gave a tired smile. “That a good thing or a bad thing?”

She didn’t answer.

Her gaze stayed locked on the dark TV… like it was showing her something I couldn’t see.

I moved toward the kitchen to put the groceries away… left her sitting there in the chair.

I was halfway through putting cans in the cupboard when I heard her voice again… low and quiet:

“He came back… I told you he would… no, don’t start crying now… I told you, didn’t I?”

I peeked around the corner.

She was still facing the blank TV. Still alone. Still whispering.

I slept in the back room. Used to be my dad’s when he was a kid. Twin mattress on a metal frame. Same thin yellow sheets with faded cowboy prints. Same dresser with the broken top drawer that always slid open a few inches on its own.

The air back there felt… wrong.

Heavy. Like it didn’t want to move unless you gave it permission.

I cracked the window and laid down with my hoodie as a pillow. No fan. Just that old stillness you only get in houses where people die slow.

I could hear her down the hall for a while… mumbling. Not loud enough to make out the words. Just a steady drone. Like someone praying underwater.

At one point she laughed. Sharp. Sudden. Like someone had whispered a joke in her ear.

It stopped after a while. I guess she fell asleep. I tried to do the same.

The dreams were strange.

Pressure and heat… like something heavy was sitting on my chest. The sound of water running behind the walls. A breath that wasn’t mine… brushing close to my ear.

It didn’t feel like sleep. It felt like being held under.

I woke up with my heart hammering.

The room was dark… still. But the door was cracked open now.

I know I closed it.

For a second, I thought I saw something… a shape in the hallway. Short. Slouched. Leaning forward like it was listening.

I sat up.

“Grandma…?”

The shape shifted… stepped into the low light spilling in through the living room window.

It was her.

Thin housecoat. Eyes wide and glassy. Arms limp at her sides. Just standing there, staring in at me like she didn’t know who I was.

I got up slow… eased toward her.

“You okay…? You need something?”

She flinched when I got close. Didn’t speak. Just turned and shuffled back down the hall barefoot, muttering something too low to catch.

I watched her bedroom door close behind her.

Didn’t sleep much after that.

She was quiet most of the afternoon. Sat in the recliner watching static again… TV off, remote untouched. Just staring at the glass.

I cleaned a little. Hauled some junk mail to the burn barrel out back. Tried not to look at the woods too long. They weren’t scary. Just… dense. Claustrophobic in the daytime. Black by five.

I passed the bathroom on the way back to the guest room.

Door cracked. Light on.

I heard snipping. Quick. Rhythmic. Sharp little metallic bites.

Snip… snip… snip.

“Grandma…?”

No answer.

I pushed the door open slow.

She was sitting on the toilet lid, hunched over her lap. One hand holding a tissue. The other… nail clippers.

Her foot was up on a stool. Bare. Shaking. She wasn’t trimming. She was cutting.

All the way down. Past the white. Past the pink. Into the bed.

The big toe was already bleeding. The nail split and pulped… jagged like cracked tile.

She didn’t flinch. Just kept snipping. Eyes unfocused. Mouth moving with a little tune I couldn’t place.

Snip… snip… snip.

“Grandma, stop… you’re gonna hurt yourself.”

She didn’t look up.

“It grows back if you let it… just keeps coming back…”

Then she looked at me. Real sudden.

Eyes wide. Red-rimmed. Wet like she’d just been crying… except there were no tears. Just that shaky smile people make when they’ve been alone too long.

“You’ve got your daddy’s feet… I always hated that about him.”

She was different the next day. Quieter. But twitchy. Kept folding and unfolding a dishrag with her thumbs like she didn’t know where she was. Her teeth clicked. She wouldn’t eat.

I offered soup. Crackers. A protein shake. She wouldn’t touch any of it.

Just stared at the window over the sink and said…

“It’s too cold for him out there… don’t want him stiff before we get the nails in.”

I stopped moving. She didn’t even look at me.

“Grandma, what…?”

She blinked. Looked confused. Looked at me, but through me.

“Why’d you put your hair up like that for? You know how he gets.”

Then she started crying. Real tears this time. Covered her face and whispered I’m sorry, I’m sorry, over and over like she didn’t know why.

I helped her back to bed. She went easy. Didn’t fight or mutter. Just let me tuck her in and stared at the ceiling like it was showing her something I couldn’t see.

She was out cold by ten.

I couldn’t sleep.

The house was too quiet. That kind of quiet where you can hear it… like pressure behind your ears.

I left the door cracked. Just a little. In case she called for me.

Around 1:30, I heard movement. A soft creak. Another.

I thought she was up again. Maybe headed to the bathroom. Maybe just wandering.

I stepped into the hall.

Her door was still shut. The light was off.

But the living room…

The recliner was rocking.

Just slowly. A soft, steady creeeee—creeeee—creeeee. Like a kid pushing themselves in time with a lullaby.

Nobody was in it.

I stared too long. Didn’t move.

I walked up close. Real slow. Every board creaking like it didn’t want me near.

There was something on the cushion.

Not a coin. Not a crumb.

A fingernail.

Fresh. Pale. Split down the middle. The kind of rip that doesn’t happen by accident.

The rocking stopped the second I picked it up.

No wind. No movement.

Just the TV flickering blue in the corner. Still unplugged.

The next morning she was already awake. Sitting stiff in her rocker like she’d never gone to bed at all.

No TV. No radio. Just the low scrape of her nails against the armrest.

She was humming again.

Same tune as before. Something slow. Maybe a church thing. Or maybe just something she made up.

I brought her oatmeal. Hoped the warmth might pull her back into herself.

She didn’t look up.

“They always name ‘em,” she said.

Voice flat. Not talking to me. Just… out loud.

“That’s where it goes wrong. You give it a name, you start thinking it means something. Don’t give animals names. Makes it harder to bury ’em.”

She scooped a spoonful of oatmeal and brought it to her lips like nothing was wrong. Chewed. Swallowed. Looked at me, finally.

“Did you check the lock on the shed? The wind was up last night.”

I hadn’t. Didn’t even know it had a lock.

I just nodded and said yeah, I would.

She smiled. Real soft. Almost proud.

Then went back to humming.

It was just after midnight when I heard the screen door creak. I hadn’t been sleeping well. Dad’s old mattress was rather thin. And the smell of that house—mothballs and old piss and something worse underneath—clung to the roof of my mouth no matter how many times I brushed my teeth.

I sat up. Wiped the sweat from my chest. Listened.

No wind. No bugs. Just the hum of the fridge and the slow groan of something settling on the back deck.

I cracked the curtain open.

Grandma was out there. Barefoot. Nightgown hanging loose off one shoulder. Standing still in the dark like she’d been poured into it.

In her hands were the shears. Not kitchen scissors. Not hedge trimmers. The old iron kind. The farm kind. Rust like dried blood flaked down the handles. Blades long enough to snip a chicken’s head off clean.

She wasn’t cutting anything. Just holding them. Arms low and relaxed. Like someone waiting their turn.

She was humming again.

I didn’t go out. Didn’t call her name. Just stood there… curtain pinched between my fingers… watching the soft sway of her shoulders as she turned and walked back inside.

She never looked at me. But she set the shears on the kitchen counter before going back to bed.

I didn’t touch them. I couldn’t.

She died on a Thursday.

No screams. No fall. Just… gone.

I found her in bed, curled into the blanket like a child. One hand tucked under her chin. Mouth slack. Eyes open.

The hospice nurse said it was peaceful. I believed her.

There wasn’t a service. The county buried her next to Grandpa at the edge of Coal Creek Cemetery—no headstone, just a brass tag and a mound of disturbed dirt. No one else came.

I stayed behind to pack the house.

Three days of dust, mildew, and silence thick enough to chew. Moth-eaten dresses. Expired pills. Jars of paperclips sorted by size. Granny’s mind had left long before her body did.

Then I found the box. Wrapped in butcher paper. Duct tape peeling. Tucked deep under her bed like a secret that didn’t want to be remembered.

Inside were photos.

Stacks of them.

Not Polaroids. Not prints. These were darkroom-developed, edge-curled, yellowed at the corners—decades old.

They weren’t family photos.

No birthdays. No cookouts. Just bodies.

Kneeling. Bound. Dressed in clothes that looked local… Coal Creek diner uniforms, Sunday dresses, feedstore overalls.

Some of them were gagged. All of them were hurt.

Eyes swollen. Teeth missing. Arms bruised from restraint.

And in every third or fourth picture… Grandma.

Grinning. Hair done. Makeup heavy. Holding a leather belt in both hands like she was about to teach a lesson.

Then came the final photo. I swear I can still see it when I blink.

She posed in the rocker like she wanted the photo to seduce someone—legs open, lace clinging to her hips, a severed head nestled where a lover’s face might go. One stocking was rolled down. Her panties were bunched around one ankle like she’d peeled them off slow. If the head wasn’t there, I swear to God…

That’s when I noticed the background.

Behind the chair… the shape of a window. A wooden wall. A hanging tool.

The shed.

Not just any shed. Her shed. The one behind the house. The one with a padlock so rusted it looked fossilized.

I didn’t think. I just grabbed a flashlight and headed for the door.

The padlock came off with one tug. I don’t think she even locked it.

The door groaned on the hinge like something breathing shallow.

I stood there for a second, flashlight trembling in my grip, breathing in mold and cold dirt.

The shed wasn’t big—maybe ten by ten—but it felt deeper than it should’ve been. Like there was weight in the air. Something that wanted to be left alone.

I stepped inside.

The light swept across stacked crates, rusted tools, a workbench stained the color of old liver. There were flies… slow, drunken ones… buzzing in lazy loops.

And then the jars.

Four of them.

Mason jars. Dust-caked. Unlabeled. Sealed with wax.

One held a shriveled tongue… gray and curled like something chewed and spat out. Another was full of teeth, floating like pearls in a yellow brine. The third had what looked like three fingers, swollen and pickled, the nails blackened and split.

The last jar was worse.

Not for what was in it… but what wasn’t.

Just murk. A fog of rot.

I turned to the workbench.

There was a wooden box with an old 8mm film reel inside… labeled in pen: For Later.

Beside it: A roll of leather straps, stained dark. A pair of rusted shears. A folded apron, stiff with dried blood.

Not splatter. Not a stain. Soaked. Front to back. Like someone wore it while butchering something that screamed.

I couldn’t breathe.

The shed smelled like pennies and vinegar and meat left in the sun.

My knees buckled. I dropped to one hand, coughing into the dirt.

There were scratch marks on the inside of the door. Fingernail-deep. Like someone tried to claw their way out.

And then I heard it.

A creak.

Slow. Rhythmic.

From the house.

From the rocking chair.

The house was still dark when I stepped back inside. I didn’t turn on any lights. There was no point. I already knew where the sound was coming from.

The hallway stretched long and still… smelling like dust and boiled potatoes and the faint copper whiff that clings to old women’s hair.

The closer I got to the living room, the more I could feel it. That wrong pressure. Like the air was watching me.

I turned the corner.

The rocking chair was moving.

Back and forth. Back and forth. Slow and even. No wind. No draft. Just motion.

There was no one in it.

Just that old, worn afghan folded across the back… The one she always used to cover her knees. The one that still smelled like her.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

And then…

Her voice.

From the chair. Low. Close. Warm like it used to be.

“You found my things, didn’t you?”

I couldn’t speak.

“S’pose you know now.”

The chair kept rocking. One… two… three…

Then it stopped.

Just like that.

The house went still.

The chair’s empty.

But when I pass that room… it feels like she’s grinning at me.

Like she’s not done.

I thought packing her things would help.

Give me something to do. Something human.

But I just opened a box in her bedroom closet marked “Church Bazaar 1997.”

Inside, beneath some folded linens, were laminated newspaper clippings.

Nine in total.

All local. All different years.

1975. 1983. 1997. 2004.

Missing persons.

Some had names circled in red pen. One had “liar” written across the photo.

I don’t think I can do this much longer.

I decided to read one of the articles.

“Body Found Near Sugar Creek — Victim Remains Unidentified.”

Dated 1975.

The man was in his forties. No ID. No wallet.

Head missing.

She underlined that part.

Then, in the margin, in her handwriting:

“It was still warm when I kissed it.”

I don’t even know if I read the whole thing. I got to that line and just… closed the lid.

It’s still sitting in the kitchen. I haven’t moved it.

That night I slept on the couch.

Right there across from the rocker.

I told myself I’d go first thing in the morning.

But I think I already knew I wouldn’t.

Then I woke up to the smell of breakfast.

Sausage, eggs, toast with blackberry jam. Just how she used to make it.

I followed the smell into the kitchen.

The stove was cold.

The table was empty… except for the belt.

Folded. Centered.

I didn’t touch it.

I just sat in the car with the door open until the sun came up.

I don’t know what I’m protecting anymore.

I feel so ashamed needing to even resort to this. 
I’m a single mom to my 9 month old son. Back in May I had to call the police on his father, and since then I’ve been doing everything I can to keep us afloat. Before that I was a stay at home mom, because it made more sense for me to quit my job….so I had to scramble overnight to figure things out and start providing for us on my own. I have my son with me 24/7,  he even comes to work with me.

I put together an Amazon wishlist with a few things that would really help us right now: a coffee table/ottoman with storage (his toys are everywhere), diapers and wipes. 

If you are unable to help, even just kind words would mean a lot. 

It won’t let me add a link (maybe it isn’t allowed?)  
You can request it via dm if you’re able to help or are willing. 

Any help means the world to us. Thank you 💙
