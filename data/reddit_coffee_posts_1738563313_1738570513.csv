At a bare minimum, all drugs impair judgement, cognition, and will somewhat damage the human body. ALL. This includes Alcohol. This includes Weed. This includes Coffee.

I believe that a vast majority of drugs have their place in helping those who need it, but when people start acting like manipulating their brain functions by introducing substances has no cons, people get hurt.

I'm not saying that drugs should be criminalized (in fact I think criminalization of substances just makes them more dangerous by preventing the creation of regulations and addicts from getting help), but we need to start treating drugs with respect.

The best time to plant a money tree was 20 years ago.

The next best time to plant a money tree is today.

The trouble is...

Planting a tree, money tree or otherwise...

... takes getting your hands dirty, sweat and some patience.

PATIENCE is the real rub.

If we could all plant the seeds today and tomorrow, we would have money trees.

We'd ALL have orchards full of money trees.

""If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas"" - Cleon Salmon from the movie Slammin Salmon.

Nearly 20 years ago...

I worked 70+ hours per week for a salary on someone else's orchard.

It was a tough fucking choice to wake up at 3 or 4 am in the morning to plant MY OWN money trees and start my own orchard.

It was brutal to be out digging, watering, and pulling weeds on Saturdays and Sundays. (I was really only pushing buttons and talking to people, but stick with me here!)

I lived off of coffee, cigarettes and Yellow Jackets (like 5 hour Energy before there was 5 Hour energy.)

But wake up at 4 am and plant the donuts I did.

One day, I started to see sprigs sprout up!

Those sprigs turned to saplings.

Then the saplings started bearing fruit!

I will never forget one day coming back from the mailbox.

I had half a dozen checks from 3 or 4 different countries.

I opened them all up.

[UK Cheque](https://preview.redd.it/t7hy6q2wtvge1.jpg?width=2088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71480e19e83c52a124e4069bad71181934048cc6)

(One of them was from the UK and looked weird. It was for recurring payments and I'd get one per month. SEE PIC above.)

I put them in a ""fan"".

Eager as a schoolboy, I displayed them to my wife, Jeannie.

Now, if you know Jeannie, she has angel eyes.

And when I fanned out those checks, her angel eyes teared up, and she said, ""I always knew you could do it. I am sooo proud of you!""

It was a beautiful day.

One I will never forget.

Nobody would've blamed or shamed me if I had chosen not to plant my money trees. I was already working 70 hours a week.

But ""I"" will be forever grateful I did!

Those trees I've planted have turned into quite the orchard.

They bear fruit 24/7/365.

That orchard has bought my home free and clear.

Bought my son a home free and clear.

Bought me time to care for my angel when she was so sick for two years.

I don't owe a dime to anybody.

My orchard of money trees keeps giving me fruit.

Now...

Anytime I need to make a tough decision...

I remember BACK to this beautiful day.

AND THEN...

I try and think from FUTURE TRAVIS.

Will he be able to sit in the shade 5 years from now because I planted a tree today?

...or will he be a scorched, sunburnt old man still in the hot sun picking fruit from someone else's orchard for a wage, retainer, or fee?

Will he be more proud? or less proud of himself?

Who else will benefit from the decision in the future?

Who will he be fuc\*ing over by not rolling up his sleeves and making the decision?

What will Jeannie's eyes say?

Decisions can be complex.

I hope, in some small way, this serves as a pair of clarity glasses like it has done for me.

I know folks today have very little time.

It’s tough to find time to plant that first (or next) Money Tree.

1igkbax,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1igkbax/adelaide_australia_45_guests_12k_january_2025/,"Adelaide Australia, 45 guests, $12k, January 2025","I wanted to share a budget / recap as someone living in Australia which I would consider HCOL and wanting to have a relatively low cost / low stress wedding. 

**Context:**

My partner and I have been together and engaged for many years, I was pregnant and we decided to organise the wedding now as a 'if we don't do this now we will never bother'. Initially we thought we would want to spend no more than 10k, but once we started getting costs we upped our budget to 12k. We funded the wedding ourselves. We organised everything in 4 months. We wanted to invite all our family and a few friends, we invited about 45 family and 10 friends and ended up with 45 attendees. If we had given people more notice probably a few more would have been available. Our goals were: Bringing our families together, Good food, Low stress (i.e. minimising anyone needing to do too much). I've also always liked the idea of a morning ceremony, which we ended up doing. 

**Schedule:** 

- 8.30am-9.00am couples photos, 

- 9:00am-9:30am drive from photo location to venue 

- guests arrive 10.00am for 10.30am ceremony, 

- 11:00-11:30am family photos,

- 12.00pm-4.00pm lunch. 

**Invitations:**

I made my own wedding invitations which were handmade lino prints, i attended two lino printing workshops, one to make the lino cut and one to print the ~30 invites. Total cost: $150 = 2 x $50 workshops and ~$50 supplies (paper, envelopes, stamps). Not necessary but i enjoyed doing it. I replicated my parents front gate for the design.

**Ceremony:** 

We ended up hosting the wedding in my parents front garden, which my mum also really wanted. if this hadn't been possible i would have chosen a local park. The unintended consequence was my parents felt they needed to finish some house renovation / painting tasks because of the wedding. These things aren't in my budget. The only wedding specific thing we set up was about 16 hired white chairs (cost $100). The ceremony was very short so it was no issue for most people to stand. The garden was the venue decoration. My parents offered tea / coffee / water to guests. We had no bridal party.

**Lunch:** 

We hired out a very nice Italian restaurant for lunch the only condition of the venue was a minimum spend of 2,500 which we had no issue exceeding. We paid for drinks on consumption. Food = $69 per person (shared dishes for the table: ~4 starters, pasta course, pizza course and cakeage) = $3100, drinks ended up about $1800 (we paid $1500 of this up front and then family snuck in and covered the last few hundred dollars). We didn't decorate the venue. Cake: My brother made a wedding cake for us as our wedding gift, he is an avid hobby baker. 

**Photography:** 

I organised 3 hours of photography to cover: couples photos, ceremony and then family photos after the ceremony. I got two quotes - one was $3000 one was $1000 we went with the $1000. The person we went with had photographed weddings before but they did mostly commercial work. I was happy with the photos, the more expensive photographer might have been slightly better but i would have felt more pressure to spend more money/effort on my appearance and making the venue look nice if we had gone with the more expensive photographer. The cheaper photographer achieved the goal of capturing the event and family photos without adding extra pressure. 

**Rings / Outfits:**

Between pregnancy body changes and not being a big ring wearer, I reused my engagement ring for the ceremony, my partner bought a nice locally made band which was $2800 (we could have saved here but we wanted to support the local ethical jeweler who had made my engagement ring).
My partner wore a suit and shoes he already owned but bought a new white shirt ($150). I sewed my wedding dress which cost me about $500 dollars in silk satin (and obviously my time). Additional costs were $500 in makeup and $160 for my shoes, i wore my hair down just tidy not styled.

**Summary:**

- Lunch: $4600

- Chairs: $100

- Celebrant: $950

- Photographer: $1000

- Ring: $2800

- Partner new shirt: $150

- Dress Fabric: $490

- Shoes: $160

- Makeup: $500

- Invites: $150

**Total:** $10,900 (we then also went away for a few nights which cost around $900 for accom. + food).

**Summary:**

There were some obvious savings from my brother making a cake and making my own dress  but mostly we just saved money by not doing things that we didn't feel were necessary (i.e. flowers, decorations, etc.) and avoiding 'wedding' vendors. We had really lovely positive feedback from guests that they liked our short ceremony and really enjoyed the food (it is a very nice restaurant). It might not be everyone's idea of a wedding but it was exactly what i had envisioned. 

**Lessons Learnt:**

The day itself was actually very relaxing, but some things that were somewhat stressful in the lead up to the wedding were: 

- Making my own dress in a short turn around, sewing with silk was stressful & with the added pressure of pregnancy body changes (5 mo pregnant at wedding). 

- Dealing with family expectations around what a wedding should look like, when these things weren't important to us. 

- In general my focus shifting to thinking about the baby which made wedding planning feel less important / relevant.

If you’ve ever tasted a strong, flavorful cup of filter coffee from South India, you’ve likely experienced the magic of decoction firsthand. Here's why it plays such a central role in crafting that perfect cup:

# 1. Traditional Brewing Method

In South India, coffee is typically brewed using a **metal filter**, which produces a concentrated liquid known as the coffee decoction. This method has been passed down through generations and is deeply ingrained in the region's coffee culture. The coffee decoction is a result of slowly extracting the flavors from freshly ground coffee beans, which creates a brew that’s both smooth and strong.

# 2. Concentration of Flavor

The slow drip process ensures that the coffee extracts all the essential oils and rich flavors from the ground beans. As a result, the decoction is a concentrated form of coffee that delivers a **bold and robust flavor**. When mixed with milk and sugar, it forms the perfect balance, giving the characteristic strong taste without overpowering bitterness.

# 3. Versatility in Preparation

Once the decoction is ready, it can be used in a variety of ways. It’s typically combined with hot milk to make a **classic South Indian filter coffee**, but it can also be enjoyed as a **black coffee** or in a lighter version with more milk. The ratio of decoction to milk is customizable, allowing each individual to enjoy their coffee the way they like it best.

# 4. Cultural Significance

Coffee decoction is more than just a brewing method—it's a part of **South Indian heritage**. The filter coffee tradition, often enjoyed in the morning or during family gatherings, has become synonymous with the warmth of hospitality. Offering a cup of coffee made with freshly brewed decoction is a gesture of welcome and a symbol of connection.

# 5. Rich, Bold, and Smooth Texture

One of the key aspects of the coffee decoction is the **smooth texture** it imparts to the coffee. The method ensures that the flavors are extracted without over-extracting the bitterness, resulting in a cup that is rich but never harsh. The natural oils in the decoction contribute to the **silky mouthfeel**, making it an indulgent experience from the first sip to the last.

# 6. The Magic of Freshness

When coffee decoction is prepared fresh, it adds another layer of **exquisite freshness** to the cup. In many South Indian homes, the decoction is brewed daily to ensure that each cup is as fresh and flavorful as possible. The use of freshly ground coffee beans further enhances the richness, making every sip an experience.

# 7. A Symbol of Identity

South Indian filter coffee isn’t just a beverage; it's a way of life. The decoction method, with its rich, full-bodied flavor, represents the region’s passion for good coffee. It’s **part of the cultural identity**, a symbol of tradition, craftsmanship, and the simple joys of life.

In conclusion, **coffee decoction** is far more than just a brewing technique—it's the secret behind the bold, distinctive taste of South Indian filter coffee. Whether you’re sipping it on a lazy morning or serving it to guests, the decoction is what gives the coffee its heart and soul, making it an enduring symbol of the region’s love for great coffee.. If you’ve ever tasted a strong, flavorful cup of filter coffee from South India, you’ve likely experienced the magic of decoction firsthand. Here's why it plays such a central role in crafting that perfect cup.

1igk7pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1igk7pd/it_follows_and_i_might_be_out_of_time_part_1/,It Follows and I Might Be Out of Time [Part 1],"It's close. Searching. I can feel it like a storm rolling in. We have to stop for a few days and... I'm terrified it's going to catch up. We both are. So for my sanity, I'm going to tell you how we got here, from the beginning. You're going to be smarter than I was if it ever follows you. 



Thinking about it, I never liked living in an apartment complex. Pine Cone Landing is tucked into a part of town avoided by families and law enforcement alike. It wasn't just the sketchiness that put a bad taste in my mouth; there were too many people, too close by all the time. It didn't matter when it was, odds were good there was someone somewhere close. If it wasn't outside, it was noise from the unit to my left, right or above, small house noises from my own place. The walls were little more than drywall that may have sat near insulation before their installation. All of this in an environment with poor lighting, wandering junkies and no cameras. It isn’t too different from how I grew up, so I knew the ropes. I spent a lot of time in some degree of alertness. I now spend every moment that way. 



 I worked from home in data entry, and kept to myself. It left a lot of space to observe the habits of the people I could always hear. From above, it was usually creaking, footsteps, human and dog. Maybe some random sounds of a phone dropping or dishes shifting. What are you gonna do? Apartment living. As far as I knew, apartment 23 above me was a chill middle-aged guy and his doggo, who kept pretty quiet too. 

  
It started one evening when he seemed to have some company. It was a lot of moving, floor groaning, random bouts of loud talking. It had been going on for a couple of hours, ebbing and flowing with its noise level. I didn't mind. It was easy to tune out while I worked; the tapping of keys was usually accompanied by a YouTube video or some music. I was typing out the final notes of the invoice, my fingers hesitated as I double checked the notations. Then, I hesitated a little longer, hands lowering as something else took the front seat of my attention. A quiet that wasn’t there before. That was never there if he was home and awake. 

  
Every sound from the unit upstairs had ceased. 

  
I looked at the ceiling, scowling. I'd heard something drop only a few minutes before between the walking and shuffling. You might think they all left, but they'd have to go right by my front door, and down the stairs on the opposite side of the wall I was facing. That was something you could feel in the floor with that many people. They were still up there. It was strange. Even so, I didn’t usually care enough to follow up on any of the weirdness that came through. After a few moments of wondering where the bustle went, I returned to my work. 

  
I didn't hear another sound from upstairs for the rest of the day or that night. A perfect Saturday passed with a couple of phone calls, food, a nap and wine in the evening. I had a glass for me, a glass for Evan. Another for me and so on; I had almost polished off the bottle when it occurred to me, I still hadn't heard a damn thing. Not even his sweet old dog. I racked my brain, trying to remember the guy's name. I quickly gave up, and poured the last of the wine into my glass. It didn't help the growing unease. I decided as I curled up in bed that night, that if I didn't hear anything by tomorrow afternoon, I'd take action. Maybe pretend I needed a cup of sugar so I could check in. I know this may sound excessive for a neighbor I've exchanged maybe ten words with, but I don't have a lot going on. I was accustomed to his daily routine, because it was constantly in the background of my own. There was no denying it had changed in the last two days. I've always liked quiet but this didn't feel like that. It was more like silence. 

  
It’s important to note, I had my home set up oddly; the designated bedroom space was where I had my office and my bed was in the living room area. It was as far from the stairs as I could get, and usually unoccupied. I arranged it that way with my boyfriend’s help, for the quiet. 



At some point that night, I dreamed it was snowing. I was standing on the back lawn, under the maple tree that grew a little closer to my balcony every summer. Its leaves were gone. I looked up at the gray sky, watching the flakes fall between its branches.... but it wasn't quite right. The snow felt abrasive, bounced off of my cheeks and onto my coat instead of melting. It fell in small bursts instead of that soft and steady way. 

  
When it got into my eye, I woke up gasping, coughing and blowing from my nostrils like a reflex, something covered and scraped me like sand. I brushed at the dusty substance in a blind panic, too breathless to scream, blinking around at the darkness, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. My last two coherent brain cells remembered that I had a lamp on the nightstand that I quickly flipped on. I was already covered in sweat, and gasped for air as I looked down at the rest of me. A thin layer of what looked like plaster coated most of my bed. I stared down at my powdered arms--

  
BOOM- BOOM-BOOM!

  
I jumped, stifled a scream as a few more flecks of the popcorn ceiling fell. All I could do was try to blink away the grit and breathe, make sense of what the hell was happening. I started to move, but froze when I heard another sound.

  
Something heavy dragging, scraping metal and fabric on hardwood. I tracked its path like I could see through his floor, and listened when he moved towards the kitchen. Then it stopped. I waited for footsteps to start making their way around the apartment, but there was nothing except my labored breaths. Trembling, I got out from under my blankets and shook them out, leaving the mess for tomorrow. I looked back up while I dusted my arms, thinking 'if he can stomp and make plaster fall, how sturdy is this ceiling?' That sounds intentionally stupid, but believe me. These apartments are made on the cheap and filled with the sort that have odd lives. A few loud stomps was nothing compared to some of the other sounds I've heard from surrounding units. 

  
I shook my head, deciding that at least there were signs of life again. I crawled back into bed, trying to ignore the chill that settled over me. Instead, I focused on the sound of someone walking up the stairwell, another tenant letting the door close in the laundry/mail building across the sidewalk. All the while waiting to hear any sign of the neighbor as I drifted off. 

  
The next morning I slept in until 10 a.m., then proceeded to clean up the mess from the night before. After doing some laundry, more tidying, I still didn't hear anything and decided: maybe the guy was shacking up somewhere else. Perhaps thinking about moving? That would explain the weirdness so far, and good on him. Later on, I closed my laptop for the night, standing and stretching after the busy but comfy day. Mid-victory stretch, my balled fist bumped the coffee thermos that kept me going... before I could fully gasp, it was clattering on the floor, sending the last swills splashing all over. I cussed under my breath, moving around the desk to start cleaning up before it soaked in. 

  
A short series of sounds came from above, but they blew to the wayside as I sprung into action. I started rushing around for paper towels, for cleaner, I looked under the bathroom sink, in the cupboard, anywhere my scatter-brain might put a bottle of chemicals. I felt strangely agitated, damn near overstimulated by trying to track down something to scrub the carpet. It was like there wasn't enough room in my brain to see it even if I did come across it....



I was reaching to move stuff under the kitchen sink when it finally hit me. I froze, half bent over. I watched the hairs raise on my extended arm as my body registered what already took me too long to notice. 

  
A flurry of noise from the neighbor’s place had suddenly stopped too. A mix of steps, hardwood groaning, and something else had followed me through my crusade. I’d been too worried about the damn sub-floor to notice, but that was over. A different part of me now clocked the growing unease.

  
Anyone who has experienced a hostile home or even a bad neighborhood knows what I mean when I say: you can tell when approaching footsteps are meant for you. You learn when they’re fine, angry or coming for you. It made me think of things I didn’t want to, and I knew this wasn’t the time. I had to calm down and think; as difficult as it was, necessity is that simple. My upstairs neighbor barely acknowledged I existed and I granted him the same courtesy; it was our system, we stayed out of each other's hair. Could someone else have moved in? I scrapped that immediately, that would have been loud, impossible to miss. Maybe someone house-sitting? No, that wouldn't make sense if he had company. I was pretty sure it was still him up there.  

  
After a couple more minutes of silent contemplation, I decided there was no way or reason for him to follow me through the apartment. No point. I quickly grabbed some bottle from under the sink, closing the case on being.... what would you even call it, micro-stalked? It doesn't matter. It was in my head. Even so, I tiptoed to the office. I scrubbed, sponged up and cleaned as quietly as I could. 

  
I went to bed exhausted that night. My eyes closed on their own, and it occurred to me that I should try to get to sleep earlier. It wasn't a crazy day by any means, but I felt drained. Tense. A few minutes passed of me dozing; I was on the edge of deep sleep when wood groaned from the ceiling just above my bed. My eyes snapped open, accompanied by a sick feeling. Nauseating dread. A part of me didn't want to move as I stared at the spot bare of that popcorn texture. I was suddenly conscious of how loud my breath was, how my bed would creak if I did get out of it. It was a feeling all too familiar... And that pissed me off.

  
The tension, the fear gave way to white hot anger; I ripped off my comforter, putting all of my weight into the mattress so the upstairs neighbor could hear my crappy metal bed frame as I got up. I stomped over to the TV, turned it on and up to eleven, letting the laugh track of some sitcom fill the quiet apartment. The floor above creaked as I heard him move back towards the kitchen, then the office. I laid back down, fighting the urge to yell a few choice words to the ceiling. 

  
The doubt let itself in a little later as my heartbeat slowed and my eyelids fluttered again. I'm not the best person to deal with what seemed to be happening above. Changes in manner mixed with dead silence, with a dash of sleep deprivation. As someone with a harsh past and anxiety I had only recently learned to control, I could admit: I'm wired to fixate and that's what I was doing. Over a couple days of passing weirdness. I was turning it into a problem. Possibly making it his, with passive aggressive gestures.

  
I jumped with the sharp ring of my charging phone, pushing all else from my mind. A pang of missing him ached as I hit the green circle on the screen, putting it to my ear as I muted the TV with the remote.

  
""Baby I thought you'd be out of range for a couple days!"" Evan's chuckle sent a ripple of warmth through me. 



""It’s so good to hear your voice, did I wake you up?""

  
"" No, no, have you been taking pictures?""

  
""Of course, and all of them will be yours. I wish I was seeing it all with you, Mimi."" I grinned at hearing the name he kept just for me. That I only heard from him. My real name is Miranda. He makes that feel so much sweeter. He'd been in France for nearly two weeks. *Only 5 days to go* I thought, wrapping my other arm around me.

  
""With this new job, I'll pay for our next trip there. Tell me everything.""

  
""I'm not sure there's time, so we'll call it all great. Except for missing a particular sassybutt back home.""

  
""Come on now, I’ve behaved.""

  
""Only because you miss me too, now tell me. How are you?""

  
I looked back up at the ceiling. ""It's been a time. It feels like..."" I trailed off, trying to think of a way to explain it without sounding paranoid. He was quiet for a few moments.

  
""Is everything okay there?"" I sighed, lowering my head into my hand, rubbing it. ""The upstairs neighbor has been acting off. Or at least, the sounds from up there are odd.""

  
The last few days tumbled out in tired murmurs. I told him everything. From how it started Friday to the weird familiar feeling it all brought about. He listened, matching the quiet and calm I was trying to keep. By the end I was bone-tired. I waited, expecting the usual optimistic note he brought to the dark. I closed my eyes and leaned back, ready to absorb the cozy. 

  
""I'm coming home.""

  
""Babe, that isn't what I was saying.""



“If you don't feel safe, I should not be here. I take my role as best boyfriend very seriously and you notice everything, compulsively. I’ll hedge my bets that something is up, Mimi.” I slumped against the headboard. His complete acceptance always has a way of taking the wind out of me. Even so, he'd had dreams of France. Paid through the nose to take this trip. 

  
""It's only a few more days. I'm okay.""



""You're unsettled at the very least. I don't like that you're alone."" I didn’t really know what to say that wouldn’t make his case. I didn’t want him to give up a single day of adventure for me either.I heard a sigh from the other end and knew he’d read my mind. I also think a small part of him wanted just a little more time too, and that’s okay. I still appreciated his concern.



“I’ll be working my day down the mountain starting tomorrow. I’ll be headed your way. Will you put that security bar on the door? Just so I can sleep."" 

  
""You got it. I love you.""

  
""I love you, Mimi. Sleep well with kind dreams.""



""Be safe, have fun."" The call disconnected. I stared down at the screen for a few moments after: 12:19 a.m. Odds were good he was about to cook up some oatmeal, maybe watch the sunrise over the Alps. All the while fighting off the freezing cold; I didn’t envy him. I’m not sure how his body could pull him up the heights of the earth and nature then return, but he loved it. Damn did I miss him.

  
I jolted a little against the unmistakable sound of the door just above my own in the stairwell, opening. Closing. My reaction was instant. I got up, staring at the front door as I scrambled to move, thinking of my promise to Evan. Heavy footsteps trudged down the first flight, seeming to slow on the landing. I moved around the bed, tiptoeing towards the pantry. I could hear him coming down the next five stairs, which would bring him to the second floor. I quietly opened its flimsy door and grabbed the adjustable bar of steel. I turned to use it but paused.

  
The footsteps stopped. My mouth went dry with that certainty you get. That you’re in danger or being watched. As if he knew, the floor just outside creaked. So close, I felt it in the soles of my feet. 

  
My chest was pounding, I was counting the moments he stood there, just a couple of feet away, was he waiting? Stopping to look at his phone? The only answer was another groan of flooring. I fought panic, desperate to put a steel bar between the door and wall, in front of him, between us. He’d hear it, though. Any movement would give away just how frightened I was. How I was monitoring him. The thought jerked me into a glimpse of rationality. I was stalking him. Tracking his movements, I had no way to prove he was doing the same to me.



*He’s the one standing outside of your door.*

  
I took a deep breath, mustering courage: paranoid or not, I couldn’t live like this. It was time to stop with the questions, and confront whatever in the hell this was. Gripping the door bar tighter, I unlocked the deadbolt with my free hand. I grasped the knob, turning it and letting in the impending winter. I hoped the neighbor might get a startle, or a message: do not fuck with me.

  
My stomach dropped as my eyes swept the small landing. No one was there. I looked down the stairs, up the stairs, nothing. No one. There was no noise of retreat either. I quickly darted back inside, slamming and locking the door.

  
I didn’t sleep much that night; around five in the morning, I decided to put my deepening anxiety to work. I knew what I heard, but it felt like there was nothing to be done. I couldn’t prove or explain it. All I could do at the moment was plow through some of those invoice entries, and nap later without worrying. If I was lucky, I could just be. I missed that I thought, fighting not to hunch over my keyboard.



Work went by in a blur as the sun rose, warming the office more and more. I had the insulated curtains to thank for that; they provided privacy and kept the room from getting too chilly. My stomach started to growl around 9:30 a.m., pulling me out of the zone. I was more than halfway through the day I realized, which felt like success. 

  
I went to break, grabbing some crackers and munching as I found something to watch on my phone. I wasn’t feeling documentary or commentary type stuff. I had a few comfort shows I liked, and felt weirdly indifferent to that idea too. I put down my phone, feeling a spike of annoyance as I picked something random from the history channel. Great. I couldn’t eat, sleep or mindlessly watch something. I threw the saltines back in the cupboard with a small amount of disgust, letting the cheap compression wood fall back closed. Like a hostile echo, a cupboard door slammed from the kitchen above mine, then another, then one more. I couldn't hear if he slammed any more through the rushing, growing pulse in my ears. 



The human race did not survive because of its intelligence, or ability to procreate. Yes, those definitely helped us along, but the very first contributor to our longevity as a species comes down to one thing: adrenaline. It kept us running, fighting, living. 



That primal mechanism threatened to overwhelm me; my fingers and toes prickled, ready to burst with blood-flow while my heart tried to tear through my ribs. The swelling of muscle in my calves, my thighs was almost painful, begging me to run as far from whatever in the hell was going on as I could. It already felt like I was being attacked, ripped apart, dying, fleeing, fighting, my very veins felt like they were trying to escape my body. I put my hand on my chest, trying to breathe, trying to think through the ringing in my ears. My whole body felt damp, I braced my hands on my knees, staring at the grains of the faux wood flooring. He had to be following me, listening to me, it was too many coincidences. I sank to the floor, watching the world get further from me, an illusion that sealed my understanding of what was about to happen. One last thought clawed its way to the surface of the violent terror embracing me: *Please don’t let me be out for long.*

For example, I'm not going to boycott my local hair salon or coffee shop as they are all very anti-trump

For example, I recently leased a Volkswagen EV built in Tennessee albeit by the UAW. I made the decision because VW is a German company, the UAW has been vocally against the tariffs (and also support a lot of other political positions I like on topics like Gaza and labor rights), and the White House gave me $7500 to lease the car.

I've been avoiding McDonalds and Starbucks for a while now and may switch to Tim Hortons

Living in Minnesota, I might choose to visit Winnipeg instead of Chicago for a getaway. 

In other scenarios, I might just try to avoid American products and companies

I've also been buying stuff off Alixpress or Temu instead of Amazon.

My next phone will likely be a Oneplus or Samsung instead of Apple

I'm trying to shop more at Aldi's or Trader Joe's (German owned) instead of Walmart. 



  
Of course, intentionally buying Canadian products is moot at this point as I'll just be contributing directly to the tariffs. But in the mean time, I might try to buy more products not made in America but also made in a country that isn't subject to tariffs.

But post Covid I lost a lot of social confidence and keen to get it back. For now I would like to chat with others to get to know, then maybe catch up for a trail walk (when it’s cooler) or a cafe.

I came across this comic on Reddit between 2011-2014. It was a 3 (maybe 4) panel newspaper comic strip in black and white. It had a small man in a suit with a big, circular head and a mouth almost as large as the head. He had his little arms up in the air and was moving back and forth. I am 99% certain he was saying ""I love coffee"" in at least one of the panels.

I saved it back then and lost it over time. There was also a popular Twitter comedian who had the man's head/face as their profile picture between 2012-2015, but I can't remember who it was to even find any old screenshots and reverse search the pfp!

1igk0s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1igk0s8/its_all_a_play_on_their_stage_of_life/,It's all a play on their stage of life,"I've been wanting to try and write my story and perspective on marriage to BPD after 23 years. Like clockwork, our rollercoaster is fairly predictable and we're avoiding each other and I have time. I'm going to give my story, then my analogy. Sorry for any rants, this is emotional and my first time really taking about this all together. I am leaving stuff out, but I'm giving enough to paint a marriage that's been this way over 20 years.

We started dating in 99, knew each other in high school, but went to different schools. We broke up a couple times, it was me breaking up. The last time she cheated on me, had a break down and admitted it. Told me how wrong it was and awful etc etc, and I believed her. I was raised by pretty good parents who taught us no one is perfect, we all mess up in life (everyone), etc. So, after awhile we ended back together after her parents kicked her out while she was with me and my friend. She literally had no place to go. I believed she was sorry and would never do that again.

Another time I broke up with her was before that, I felt like something was missing, but the love was strong so I thought since I couldn't figure it out, maybe there wasn't really a problem. She clearly loved me and I loved her more than I thought was possible. I've never needed a bunch of friends and wasn't even sure I would get married. I grew up to join the military, and I did in 99. We got married in 2001, four days after 9/11. I now know what was missing, but it's hard to put words to it.

I deployed that winter, working hand in hand with our bad guys of the time. At first communication was OK, then it became like the emotion from her just dropped away. She was cheating on me. I came back for a week before another deployment and she saw nothing wrong with inviting his friend (and someone who stole a drums set from me) over the first day I was back so he could get his stuff (they were in a band together, and it was the stolen drum set he was picking up if I remember right). If I was as bad as she says, I would have killed them both. I told him to leave, she broke down and called her parents, or something. Anyways, they showed up and call the cops on me and she gets sent to a mental ward for a 3 day hold and they are kicked off the property. By command orders, I am told to stay there and wait her until she is ok. Then follow along if needed.

I had a week between deployments, and just a couple days left. I was forced into a fast decision and I called my mom for that kind of advice. She reminded me how she'd raised me (she was sold on my wife too). I know there were girls that if I had the chance, I'm not sure i could say ""no"". We all make mistakes, I guess.

Told her, she can go to Benning with me or stay here, but I would not be continuing our marriage if she stayed because I couldn't trust her. I didn't believe she cheated on me at Benning, but I do have suspicions. She was friends with my buddies gf and he told me how cool it was she was into chicks like his girlfriend. Then he clammed up and I have no reason why he said that. She has just been there a day, or two, prior early in the morning to go shopping (store didn't open until 10). But whatever, they were friends why wouldn't they hang out before.

After Benning I took a sorry break from the military. During that time, we had our first son. Everything went great until one of her old friends moved in. I was impressed with her, she was really nice and had lost a lot of weight since I had last seen her. Those two feed off each other, and I ended up walking in on my wife with another dude cuddling on the couch watching friends. My wife thinks a worthy excuse was she didn't even really know him and that he was her friend. I booted them. At the time I didn't think they had sex, now I say..... why not. We had a flight about it later, and then her friend accused me of hitting on her after I kicked her out over my wife cheating again. (But, it isn't cheating if it isn't sex).

I knew she couldn't handle being home around her circle of friends and her families influence. She agreed, and still does. Her mom is a narcissist, her sister is a fairly aggressive bpd (just our opinions, she thinks she's fine), and my wife is a quiet BPD that can get very not quiet. She's in therapy, but there isn't a whole lot of improvement for the time she's been in it. She one l only gets 1 appointment a month.

I went back into the military, and into another deployment. Guess what. Prior to deployment my wife acknowledged the clubs that the unfaithful wife's who go to them (every base has a chub club close by) and says she would never be that person. Guess where her and her friends went? I know of a girl she cheated on me with while I was literally kicking in doors. Life's a party. A fantasy of mine, and I was in Baghdad. She thought I would be fine since it was a red head and I have a think for red heads. Our son really looked up to me, and I stayed with her still. I'm not perfect, and at this point I'm really not caring what she does. I have bigger things in my mind than my wife, I know who she is at this point.

We leave and go to the next base, and everything there just turns into a party. It is actually a good time, good friends, hard damn job which meant my down time was spent unwinding. We didn't have to many issues, but I learned my wife's top comes off at 3 beers. At 5 she'll climb a tree in a skirt without underwear and run around the neighborhood being loud. She enjoyed having fun. Other than some maturity issues, we got along. I did really start to wonder if she was maturing past being a teen as we approached our 30s. She slept with a friend of mine, but it was with permission and I got to pay with her and her friend. I figured she was going to do it anyways, might as well enjoy it.

Next base, no suspicion of cheating, but our relationship and her starts to plummet. She couldn't even wipe the sugar from her coffee off the counter. I would work and come home and clean sugar and tell her we're going to get ants. Turned to fights. We got ants. I was medically retired at this base, and my wife got a job. She had attended college while I was serving and earned a couple levels of degrees. 

I was kind of tired of the military life, and she had never shown any interest. We had about $30k and spent a big chunk on a little vacation to visit family and tour job locations she was looking at in Texas. She gets a job and moves there, we stayed so our kids could finish school and get ready for the move and she could get stuff setup. She got an apartment and didn't get time working, eating thai, and going to a ""really cool coffee store that sells specialty Keurig cups"". She didn't seem to put much into figuring out us coming down. 

She enjoyed that job and we were set to move, house on the market and everything. A couple weeks later she joins the military as an officer, and moves around for training. During the second part of training, she had time to message other guys, but not help me learn how to interact with the kids and connect with them. I wasn't really around a lot, and when I was 16 hour days of straight hard work were common. My last job, before I was medically retired, I had time but I learned my wife has real control issues. I wasn't aloud to interact with them on my terms. Yet, she couldn't help me connect when she left. She literally told me to go visit her family in another state that we have only seen a handful of times when I asked her what stuff or son likes and if she could give me ideas on how to connect and interact with him.

That's when I started realizing, she's never let me parent unless it's benefited her. Our kids can act like anything towards each other and she doesn't care. If they act that way towards her, it's awful. If they act that way towards me, she starts a fight if I parent them and tell them to be nice. I realized there was an actually issue. 

She got her first duty station, and she admitted there was something wrong and that it'll get better. Anytime I tried to talk about how she was acting, or treating the kids, or me it was a gaslight that would blind you. Nothing had changed, but she did start to become physically unable to control herself. She threatened me with a pan, then had a rush of coming sense that saved her when I said ""I get to respond."" She didn't swing, but since then has acted like I abuse her. She did before, but in her head she really started acting like it. I didn't know what projection was.

At this point, any counseling she got ended when the counselor dead eyeinh her and askinh ""why"" because her logic just isn't based in reality at times. It came to a point that the last time we tried counseling we were told the same thing about communication and decency and all that, which were her bare minimum standards that i could expect from her at the first duty station. I told him I'll make another appointment when she tries any of this. I have heard the same things so many times, and she has always said she will.

I've been waiting over 10 years for that. We fought again this weekend. She's smart enough to not get physical, I had to stand that line and I have called the cops. She pushed me down and every time I tried to get up she would yell ""didn't hit me"" as she kept me down standing over me as I would bump into her with my back trying to get up. To hell if I attempted to push her away. I tried to record her so she could see the way she acts, but she hit my phone about 30 feet away. My palms and knees were all scratched up. Had to sign a waiver for the cops to not arrest her.

Recently, I was doing laundry and that distinctive smell and feel of a guy's semen is on my hands, and her underwear. I didn't realize it at first, but that smell and cold sliminess is relatively distinct. Even mentioning it started a fight if straight to denial, and anytime I've mentioned it she goes into her place. She's said it's nothing, then says it's me. She can't keep a story straight between her moods, but it's constant deny or dismiss, etc.

I have spent my adult life waiting on a wife who knows she is all this, but can't admit it to herself because she has problems. I don't have financial control, I didn't have access to our finances as an adult until the end of this summer. She hid finance stuff until a few summers ago. I've had my cell phone emergency pinged so she could see where I'm at if I simply try to get away and go for a walk down the road. If I try to get away for the night, she has transferred money out of the account so I couldn't get gas during winter. In Alaska. She really left me out to die, but I'm not average. I ended up getting gas, and she gave me plenty of money to do so.

I've endured physical abuse, emotional abuse, she's manipulative, she drives a wedge between me and our children. She has a problem disciplining them, so I'm the constant bad guy. She's finally trying to figure it out a little with stuff that irritates her, but it's a 0-100 in 2 seconds response often.

We start projects that we will never complete. Spend hugs amounts of money, then never follow through. If I try, she seems to sabotage it. She takes stuff of mine when I've angered her because she doesn't like it and doesn't think I need it. It took a marriage counselor to buy a guitar to try a new hobby after I retired. My wife didn't want me to because it's a waste of money and she doesn't think I'll follow through so I shouldn't even try.

She wanted a nice sewing machine so she can teach her 4 daughters how to sew. She bought a vinyl cutting thing, we have a ton of stuff for that. Our daughters know they are there, but no one can touch it. The sewing machine hasn't been opened, and it's been made clear that it is hers. Even our daughters won't ask to use it. Our life is promises that if we are lucky may get partially filled. It's a special occasion and she has to really want it and stay motivated through the end for us to see anything through. When I bought a new first to practice on, she complained at first then bought a signature guitar that cost 4x as much.

I feel sorry for our children. Even she says they deserve better. The oldest one is moved out. He's expressed that he sees the problems. She didn't ever put any effort into being not borderline while he was at home. When you're not borderline you know something is wrong, even if the borderline doesn't, our won't, acknowledge it, or even consider it a possibility without a fight.

I know how my wife, her sister, their dad, everyone that know my mother in law personally saw my wife's mother. My wife promised to not become her, and our son joined the military not knowing anything beyond our constant fighting and problems.

I'm still here because we still have 4 daughters at home. The oldest two are getting old enough they see the issues and are recognizing the traits they learn from their mom, and work to do better. So it seems they missed the BPD bullet. When our son moved out, we both agreed we needed a change and our daughter's needed better. We fought for a couple years, and eventually my wife changed. She has a pretty good relationship with our daughters compared to how it was. Luckily, I didn't think they remember their mom giving them all her glory to much. They do see an issue though.

We we're feared at restaurants and couldn't get service. Once my wife admitted that it may possibly could be the way she treats them and our inability to function enough to order in a half way effective way for a large family taking up 7 seats. She could change towards them, and we get smiles when we go places again. All the changes she's made have been because I've had to parent my wife and constantly explain to her why the way she is acting isn't good and that's why our lives are difficult in various scenarios through the years. How our children live in their rooms. How we can't follow through with stuff we bring the idea up for.

My wife has made changes over the years, she just can't change how she acts towards me after all this. This weekend, what should have been a fun car buying experience for our oldest daughter, I have to plan my exit. She has crossed to many lines with no regard or concern towards me and she can't even be decent or communicate yet. Over ten years of waiting, she's mad at me because I need a break and she is incapable of being decent long enough for my nerves to settle down. I'm sticking to my red line like I she said she understood and she started acting like a child and pending I wasn't there.

I don't tolerate her attitude like I used to, and we fought because after a few days of it I get an attitude back towards her. She turkey believes she can treat me like crap and it shouldn't stress me out or make me angry after awhile. I'm not a physical fighter, I didn't need to be. After she hits, pokes, pushes, whatever a few times I just tell her to stop and when she looks me dead in the eyes and does it again I simply push her away out of arms reach. That enough for her to break and then the victimhood comes out and the panic attacks. She can't stand being stood up to buy someone she doesn't respect at that moment and she can't stand taking responsibility for anything. She loves being a victim.

She even admits that she has a happy with voice with her friends at work that she accidently answers the phone with when I call and a different more stearner voice for me at home. I've learned that if I'm not right beside her playing my role to her liking (no matter how unrealistic or impossible) it's just animosity from her. If I say anything, it's an argument. I hate fighting. I was good at fighting because I thought I could come home to a home without it. I simply want peace, but to not be walked on and treated like dirt for it.

Like everything in our marriage, she is allowed and will always have a valid excuse (even if it changes every time) and I am wrong. This is marriage to bpd.

Here's my analogy.

We all have a stage for our life's and we get to direct the play that rolls out on it. As we bring people into our lives, we have to give up a little of the directors role, so we all get along. It's still our stage, and we are directing our own play, but we need to let the other actors in the stage have a little say at times. They are the directors for their stage, and by playing on our stage give away a little of the director control away to fit into it. 

My wife can't relinquish that control. Everything needs to play out according to a play that she doesn't know and is constantly changing through mirroring other people and her own disappointments. She projects her issue on me and I carry the burden. I have had to relinquish nearly all of my director abilities in my life to stay with my wife and give my children a chance at seeing what my wife and her sister saw. I've surrender everything I can do my children know there is someone different than acting like her.

My role is coming to an end, my use on her stage is coming to a close. Either I'll get discarded is some big inflammatory way, or she'll be the victim as I pointlessly left. These are her two roles.



I'm standing my ground and leaving this week. I have to get everything ready, and she understood I was not backing down to her abusive controlling manipulative ways again for simply standing up to her crap towards me. I'll try to have a small talk and she'll literally turn around and walk off while not even being upset, instead, anything. That's her on a good day. No clue. She can't even say how she shows love, respect, anything towards when when she isn't wanting something.

She knows, the girls know. The younger two aren't old enough to remember anything but daddy left when they were really little and whatever she fills their heads with. Both offer daughters have expressed moving away, but she'll try to talk them into staying by her side. Once I leave, I can't come back until she puts real effort into our life and decide and show if I'm to be in hers again. I know her tricks, not much has changed in over 20 years, it's just gotten more common and a little worse over time.

My closest family is over a days drive. I can't afford a roach rental to stay in the area for the girls. I don't have any place to go here. My wife bought this house and signed my name to the offer, and my only condition was for someone to come see it first. The realtor was on his way, but since it was an hour and a half drive she told him not to mess with it. She didn't uphold her end of the deal and in strapped to an overpriced house in an under desired area 1.5 hours from her work. I'm really thinking she did this to force me to stay.

My wife has been in therapy for awhile, but it's only once a month. I can't say it's very impressive, she even says it's not enough. But, it's what insurance and health care deciders say is needed.

After over 20 years, my own tolerance for this stuff has gotten to where I can't just go on with her crap. I'm always walking on eggshells. This isn't what life is supposed to be, but it's the deck I was giving and I've chosen to stay with it. I'm taking a break and have to leave. I'm posting all this as motivation, because I can't just up and go.

I haven't been perfect during all this. I can get mean, I am a loud guy anyways. I've smiled, waved my hand, and said ""hi"" to kids on a parade float after they all yelled hi to me as they past. I scared them waving, smiling, on the side of the road as the drive by with a lot of gruff vets around for the Veterans Day Parade. So when I say I can give an attitude back, I can but I don't like to. That is a part of me that retired. I only get there because time after time my wife says she can be nicer to me only to turn around and be worse. Or, and she even admits, she'll intentionally push my buttons to get me going if I'm not. I'm tired of being her bad guy so she can pity herself. I'm tired of being pushed to the point of arguing, just for her to literally turn around and walk off, or the constant gas lighting on everything. I can stand the money problems. I can stand the physical abuse, as long as I'm not on the ground. I can stand a lot. But, not if she can't even be decent, which was her bare that she said I deserved from her over a decade ago.

Think they change over time? Think long term marriages have a chance? I do. Ours hasn't because she hasn't accept enough responsibility over her actions due to BPD. There is nothing I've done that has worked except accept everything and give as much as I could add a man to key his family together because his wife had mental issues.

Pain is very minimal but my belly button incision was driving me a little nuts last night cause it was itchy and made me feel overstimulated when I was trying to go to sleep. It’s still sore when I roll over in bed or stand up but it’s not bad at all. I’m not afraid to cough or sneeze or take a deep breath like I was a few days ago. 

I went for a 45 min walk today and did need to take some ibuprofen afterwards just cause it made me a little extra sore but that quickly went away. 

I’m still eating kinda sparingly. I did all clear liquids the first 24 hours after surgery and ended up extending that much longer cause anything more solid was giving me indigestion. I was mostly having jello, yogurt, soup, mashed potatoes, and frozen yogurt the first 5 days but today I managed to have 4 chicken strips, some frozen yogurt, and an apple (all spread out throughout the day). I know it’s not much but I’m really not that hungry still. 

BMs have been normal. I took the stool softeners the first two days I was taking the pain meds. It took a few days but thankfully I haven’t had any issues with constipation or diarrhea. 

I can have caffeine with no issues which was one of my biggest triggers so that’s been a huge relief. Honestly I’ve missed coffee so much but I’ve gone so long without it that it tastes overwhelmingly strong in the mornings so I’ve been sticking with my favorite Yorkshire biscuit tea that I also wasn’t able to have the last few months. 

My follow up isn’t until 2/18 so I’m waiting for that to get cleared to work again. I’m self employed and refinish furniture which involves a lot of physical labor/lifting. Can’t wait to get back to working since I’ve had such a hard time with it this past year. My body has been so wrecked from all the attacks, vomiting, fatigue, back pain, etc that I just can’t wait to feel healthy again and have the energy to actually work a full day. 

Lastly, I just pulled off my steri strips a little early 😬 they were grossing me out and I was tried of blow drying them after my showers lol I also wanted to be able to put some unscented lotion on my stomach cause I have dry skin and can’t stand the itchiness. The incisions look great so I’m not worried. 

Overall, the surgery was absolutely worth it and the pain was manageable while also not being a breeze if that makes sense. Like it is painful and debilitating the first few days but much less so than my attacks were. Coming off all the meds and anesthesia has definitely affected my mood as well but getting up today and going for a walk really helped. So glad I’m starting to feel normal again :)",3,1738568230.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Reading books, because apparently, I'm the kind of person who believes turning pages is the same as doing something productive.

Watching TV shows and movies, because who needs a social life when you can watch a character make better decisions than you?

Music. A lot of music. If you ever need a soundtrack to your existential crisis, I’m your guy.

Anyways this episode opens up on Christmas Eve 1989, and Kate is complaining of a stomachache. Rebecca thinks it's because of the cookies, but Jack feels her head and says she had a fever. Unfortunately, Kate has appendicitis, and needs an emergency surgery. Kate is nervous, so Rebecca rips off a piece of garland. While they are at the hospital, they hear Dr. K, but he's there as a patient. As he's leaving town to see his family for the holidays, he slid on ice, and his family won't make it in time to see him before surgery. He thinks he is going to die, but nothing bad happens on Christmas Eve. Jack and Rebecca decided to stay by his side, until Kate gets out of surgery, and Randall went to the gift shop to get him a gift for what he did for the Pearsons. 

In the present day, Kate and Rebecca are at a consultation for Kate's upcoming gastric bypass surgery. They explain the risks and that Kate's stomach will be the size of an egg, and that she needs vitamins to avoid malnutrition. Rebecca's freaking out on the way home wondering if she did this to herself. Kevin and Kate aren't planning on attending Christmas festivities at Randall and Beth's house. William has plans with this guy named Jessie. It is revealed that Jessie and William are in a relationship. Randall is currently at a company Christmas party, and one of his coworkers, Andy just got divorced, and is standing over a balcony. Randall strongly advised him to step away from the balcony. Randall turns his back and he turns back, and Andy is nowhere to be seen. Randall thinks he jumped, but he actually went inside to the party. 

Randall and Beth are getting home from said Christmas party, and they have guests arriving one by one. Everyone ended up coming by, even Toby, who the girls think is Santa, but Toby explained to Kate that she is more important than food, and she forgives him. Then we see Kate and Toby heading upstairs for a little bit of exercise. Then William comes home, and brings a special friend, which is none other than Jessie. Tess explained to Randall that William is bisexual. To finish this episode, Dr. K gets wheeled into surgery and makes it out alive. Toby however, collapsed on Randall's coffee table and ends up in the hospital, with doctors trying to bring him back.

I still remember my school principal, a kind man with a sharp intellect, wearing a pair of sleek round metal glasses. His facial features had an angular structure with a sharp jawline, and well-defined cheekbones and those glasses softened his overall appearance. His glasses used to make him look more approachable and warm towards his students. That memory always stuck with me, and when I started looking into eyewear styles, I understood why round glasses have such a unique impact.

[Round glasses](https://specscart.co.uk/glasses/round-glasses) are a brilliant choice for men with angular face shapes like square face shapes. The curves of the frames help to balance sharp lines, creating a softer and more harmonious look. This is exactly why Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter looked so effortlessly charming in his signature round glasses.



If you are looking for comfortable and lightweight pairs of metal frame glasses, this is where brands like Specscart shine. Their metal frames are not only stylish but also known for comfort, thanks to their lightweight designs and use of high-quality materials. I am confident about this brand as It’s been years since I have been using their glasses. With Specscart’s glasses, I never have to worry about the frames feeling heavy or causing discomfort over long hours of use.



According to me, eyeglasses are made to be comfortable for everyday use, no matter your lifestyle. Whether it is for long working hours at a desk, running errands to the coffee shop, or attending events, [eyeglasses](https://specscart.co.uk) keep you looking stylish and provide a clear vision, without sacrificing comfort. So, if you’re looking to soften your facial features and embrace the timeless elegance of round glasses, Specscart is a great place to start. And, round metal glasses are always an option to add extra points that can complement your personality and face shape!

My second model I said fuck it and wanted to actually commit to trying and practicing techniques, idk if you can tell or if it’s readable but before applying wash I did try and do some highlights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into a warm and inviting space is a joy, and nothing captures that essence quite like Italian home decor. Known for its rustic charm and elegance, Italian decor can transport you straight to the sun-soaked hills of Tuscany or the vibrant streets of Rome. Let’s explore the essential elements and styles that will help you achieve that enchanting Italian vibe in your kitchen.

### Colors that Speak to the Soul

When it comes to Italian home decor, color choices play a significant role. Traditional Italian kitchens often feature a palette that reflects nature, infused with rich, earthy tones. Here are some colors you should consider:

Practical Tips for Incorporating Italian Influences in Your Kitchen Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bringing Italian influences into your kitchen design can create a warm and inviting space. With its blend of rustic charm and practical elegance, an Italian-inspired kitchen encourages family gatherings and culinary creativity. Here are practical tips to incorporate Italian decor into your kitchen.

### Focus on Color Palette

Start by choosing a color palette that reflects the Italian landscape. Warm earth tones like terracotta, olive green, and creamy whites are perfect for this. You can add splashes of vibrant colors like deep red and sunny yellow to mimic the bustling markets of Italy. Consider painting your walls in a soft hue, while using brighter accents on tiles or decor items.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/italian-home-decor-kitchen

Utilizing natural materials adds a touch of authenticity to your kitchen. Here are some key elements:

- **Wood:** Use reclaimed wood for cabinetry or as open shelving. This not only looks beautiful but adds a rustic charm.
- **Inefficient Backsplashes:** Consider using handmade ceramic or terra-cotta tiles. They serve as a functional surface while showcasing Italian craftsmanship.
- **Marble:** A marble countertop can bring a luxurious touch that is still practical for food preparation.

### Classic Italian Furniture Styles

Traditional Italian furniture can enhance your kitchen's aesthetics. Here are some options to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/italian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Farmhouse Table:** A large wooden table serves as the centerpiece of gatherings. Choose a distressed finish for that vintage feel.
- **Bar Stools:** Opt for wrought iron or wood in earthy tones to complement your kitchen decor.
- **Open Shelving:** Display your dishes or Italian cookbooks on open shelves made from reclaimed wood.

### Decorative Accessories

Accessorizing your kitchen is key to achieving an Italian vibe. Here are some ideas:

- **Artisanal Pottery:** Seek out beautiful hand-painted ceramics to use as serving dishes or wall decor.
- **Herb Planters:** Fresh herbs not only enhance your cooking but also add a vibrant touch. Use terracotta pots for an authentic look.
- **Vintage Bottles:** Display olive oil or vinegar in beautiful glass bottles on your countertop for a rustic charm.

Good lighting can transform your kitchen. Aim for a mix of functional and decorative lighting. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/italian-home-decor-kitchen

### Incorporate Italian Food Culture

An Italian kitchen celebrates cooking and sharing. Here are some tips:

- **Cookbook Display:** Showcase your favorite Italian cookbooks on shelves or your kitchen island.
- **Family Photos:** Decorate with family photos or vintage Italian prints to make the space feel personal.
- **Cooking Essentials:** Keep tools such as pasta makers or pizza stones visible and accessible.

### Consider the Layout

The layout of your kitchen can reflect an Italian style. Aim for a functional kitchen triangle between the stove, sink, and refrigerator. This ensures efficiency while cooking. Additionally, consider an open-concept design that allows for easy movement and social interaction, especially if the kitchen is part of a larger living space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/italian-home-decor-kitchen  
  
These Italian decor influences will not only enhance the beauty of your kitchen but also create a space that encourages cooking and connection. Whether you're indulging in family meals or hosting friends, an Italian-inspired kitchen welcomes everyone with warmth and charm.

### Conclusion

Italian home decor brings a delightful charm to your kitchen, combining beauty and functionality in a way that few styles can match. By embracing essential elements like rustic wood, ceramic tiles, and vibrant colors, you create a warm and inviting atmosphere that resonates with the authenticity of Italian culture. The key is to strike a balance between elegance and comfort, ensuring that your kitchen becomes not just a space for cooking but a true gathering place for family and friends.

To incorporate Italian influences into your kitchen design, consider practical tips that enhance both aesthetics and usability. Start with a palette that reflects the rich hues of the Italian countryside, such as terracotta, olive green, and deep red. Accessorize with artisanal pottery, vintage-style cookware, and fresh herbs to add life and character. Additionally, open shelving can showcase your beautiful dishes and create a warm, lived-in look, while ample natural light can highlight the charm of your decor.

We would try to meet every so often, but were in different countries and couldn’t make it work. Last year, she messaged me again, and for once we were in the same city. We went for a coffee date which went well and let to another date. 

I put effort into the second date, started with an Italian food market, went to the park after to watch the sunset, then gave her the choice between an arcade and boardgames, both of which I had reservations for. After an hour or so at the board games, we called it a night and I dropped her off. She gave me a kiss and I made my way home.

We tried to plan the third date, but something not another would come up with work, almost 2 weeks later she suggested a place and as I was about to leave, she said she’s still at work and I suggested we could do it another day and not to worry. 

I threw the ball in her court and said let me know when you’re free and we can reschedule. I didn’t hear anything for a couple months. So I replied to her story 4 months later, and she said dating wasn’t a priority for her, but she really enjoyed spending time with me. She said she would be down to go out again, but was travelling for a couple weeks and would be down after. I told her to let me know when she’s back and we can do something, and once again I haven’t heard anything from her. 

It’s been 2 months since, and I’m wondering if it’s worth it to message her again? Her messages seem genuine, but her actions seem otherwise. I’m not sure what to do.

When I’m sad I think a lot about all of our memories where you were my comfort. It’s sad because they’re all like 2,3 years ago. I haven’t felt comfort with you in so long because I’ve had so many nights that feel exactly like this because you were with her, shutting me out, etc. You were great at playing like I was your priority, but in reality I wasn’t. You didn’t even want me at a coffee shop with you but instead had her keep you company. I’ve been lonely for a long time. I’ve been mourning the love we had for years. It’s been almost 5 years since we kissed and it’s still the best time of my life. I miss that so much. I haven’t felt safe since then because you slowly started to rip all of that away from me. I was just some fantasy to you and you used me the same way you used her. We both gave you a ride to where you are today, only I got kicked out of the car first. I would do anything to be able to talk to that early version of you again, I felt safe with her. I think it was also my perception, though, because even back then I remember crying and wanting so badly to be understood. You knew. You knew with the wallet, you knew with the crying, you just knew and didn’t care enough because you’ve BEEN selfish. I don’t know what hurts more - the void of you, or the realization of who you are. ",2,1738565305.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

You make life so undeniably worse for me.,"I know you're just another adult with your own flaws, but never have I ever for once felt like you love me or any of us. You take so much pride in showing our achievements off to the world, despite knowing none of us would choose this life if we were given the freedom to. 

I see you ogling other women while you're out *with* mom and us. You even brought home a single lady with a child one day and when we tried to confront you, you said you'd never bring her home if it was an affair. But you talk to her over phone daily for longer than you talk to mom in a full week. So disrespectful that you do it even in front of her. 

I dread the weekend now that I've moved away for college. Friends around me go back to their homes to meet their parents, so excited, so full of life but I don't wanna go. I'd rather rot in bed for two whole days at my dorm than visit home and see your face. 

I checked your chats one day and you text so many women each day. You reply to their stories, you call them beautiful whereas mom doesn't remember the last time you complimented her or got her a present. I hate you dad. For making the prettiest and most elegant woman I know feel so little, like she doesn't matter. 

You refuse to get a job and still live at your dad's house at the ripe age of 60. Mom has never complained about it, neither have any of us. You rot in the living room couch every single day watching TV or being on your phone and lash out at us when grandpa or mom brings up you taking up a job cause we're struggling so much financially. 

All this because you refuse to grow up. You refuse to grow up and pay for your actions. Why don't you just get a divorce, dad? Or would it ruin your image in the society? It would hurt you right? Cause people would come to know that our family isn't as perfect as you make it out to be in front of your other ladies. 

I've stopped believing in love because of you. This super sweet guy in class wanted to sit with me for coffee and probably have a chat but I pushed him away. I can't see men in positive eyes anymore dad. I'd even go to the extent to say I'm afraid of them. Thank you for showing me how horrible men can be. 

I could go on and on about how never for once in my life I've looked at you with respect or love. I've only seen you as a beast that enjoys faking everything. The happiness, the sorrows - everything. I hate seeing you smile, dad. All I feel is - someone that's that bad of a human shouldn't get to smile. They should be repenting for their mistakes or should be feeling guilty.

Its in the eyes of those that you meet

You can feel the pieces come together

The second their eyes meet yours

Soul recognizing soul

Old friends from lives lived long before

There you are, I missed you

You feel like home

You feel like waking up in a tent on a summer morning

Coffee over a fire and birds singing over the lake

You feel like warmth from the sun

The old  wood stove heating my cheeks 

The heavy blankets when consumed in peaceful sleep 

There you are, I missed you

Your pieces knit together with mine so easily, as if they had never been separated to begin with

There you are, I missed you❤️

I wrote that for you so many years ago. It’s not perfect, I am very out of practice, but I read it often since we rediscovered it not that long ago. 

I love you and I miss you so much. I wish I had dealt with my own traumas sooner so I didn’t project so much of it on to you. I hope our separation helps us heal our own individual demons so we can come back to each other, because god do I want to love on you properly this time. 

You hid so much of the weight you felt on your shoulders love. You did such a good job of providing and working that you genuinely made it look easy. I have always admired you and appreciated you so much for that, but I regret so much now that I dropped the ball on showing you that appreciation..  I stopped didn’t I? I stopped showing you how much I loved you when dad died and your grandpa passed. We had a new baby and two toddlers. A mortgage, a dog. I fell apart when dad died and I couldn’t get out of my own way. I didn’t hold space for you and your own experiences. I needed help and I was too broken to even know where to get it. I made you feel taken for granted. I am so sorry. 

I hid things from you too. The severity of my trauma, the unending pressure and anxiety I constantly felt to be perfect in an attempt to be good enough for you. I thought overworking myself by constantly overdoing it was the price I paid to get to have such a wonderful person in my life. That hurting myself meant I had finally earned the love I never received before you.  That’s not healthy at all and that had to have been so much to deal with on your part.

I put you on a pedestal that stripped you of your humanity and didn’t allow you the grace you deserved to make mistakes, while I preached about communicating and being vulnerable with each other. I was so obsessed with working on myself to be better than my parents and “good enough” for you that I completely missed the point and I didn’t pay attention to what you actually needed. To what actually made you feel loved and cherished. I let it eat me alive and I became bitter and resentful when you didn’t live up to an impossible standard. I took it as a personal attack, a sign that everything we built was too good to be true. That the illusion was finally dropping and I was going to be abandoned and proven worthless, unlovable, yet again. 

None of that should have been placed on your shoulders though. An impossible weight for anyone, and while you tried to get me help I tried to get it from you. I’m so sorry. 

I’ve taken so much time to heal myself and grow, and I wish I had been more open with you about what that was like. I wish I’d let you in. I wish I hadn’t let bitterness set in a cause you so much hurt. I’ve been so scared to be vulnerable with you since we separated. I’ve grown and changed a lot, and you have been so supportive. I have done counseling, but I took you seriously and I started trauma therapy too. 

I miss you so much my heart hurts in my chest. I am so proud of you for going to school. I am so proud of you for taking big steps in counselling and battling your addictions. I am really proud of you for setting boundaries with me and being honest with your feelings despite how scary that had to be. 

I want to reach out to every five damn minutes but I am not doing that because I respect where you are at and I don’t want to send us backwards in our healing journeys right now. You are always on my mind though. There is not one day that has gone by since the day I met you that you haven’t been on my mind, despite my struggles to show that. 

I miss counting your freckles in your sleep.

I miss how green your eyes are when you first wake up, and the way you get goose pimples when I run my hands up and down your back.

I miss the feeling of your arms wrapped around me in our sleep and the scent of you lingering on my body long after you’ve left for work. 

I miss our morning kiss.

I miss your big smile and the way you would hold my hands and dance side to side with me. 

I miss your hugs. God I miss your hugs. 

I miss how you lisp a teeny bit when you’re really sleepy.

I miss waking up in the morning with you and making pancakes and coffee all by ourselves.

I miss couch cuddles and movie nights.

I miss making your lunches and sneaking love notes into them as often as I could find pen and paper. 

I miss kissing you deeply and passionately and showing you exactly how intensely I feel for you. 

I miss doing life with you. I miss getting to show you love. I hope that when this is done we can have a really open and honest conversation and start dating again. Because if we ever get a chance to love each other again I want to do it right this time. 

Please be safe, make sure you’re eating enough and know I will never stop loving you. No matter what happens. I just want to see you happy. 

I love you always,

Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called BrewLog—a simple, digital coffee journal designed to help coffee enthusiasts track their tastings, take notes, and log brewing methods.

As a coffee nerd myself, I’ve always found it tricky to keep consistent notes on what worked (and what didn’t) with different beans, grind sizes, and brew methods. I’ve been using a physical coffee journal (just a regular notebook), but it quickly got messy and hard to organize. So, I started looking around for a digital coffee journal that could solve this problem. To my surprise, I could only find one or two options—and they were really outdated, lacking the features I wanted.

That’s when I decided to build BrewLog.

What BrewLog Does:
	•	Track your brews: Log details like origin, roast, grind size, brew time, and tasting notes.
	•	Discover patterns: See what techniques lead to your favorite cups.
	•	Perfect your process: Learn from your own data to improve over time.
	•	Coffee Map: Visualize where you’ve had coffee from around the world.
	•	Community Recommendations: See other users’ tasting notes to discover new coffees to try.

I’m currently preparing for launch, and I’ll be sending out emails soon to invite a small group of people for early access. If you’re interested in testing it out and giving me feedback, sign up here:
👉 https://brewlog.coffee

I’d love your input:
	•	Would you find this useful?
	•	What features would you like to 
see? 
	•	Any design ideas you would like?

I’m genuinely looking to make this a good tool that people can use whenever they do tastings. Or to know whether this is just a bad idea. So any input (or brutal honesty) is appreciated. Thanks for reading!",4,1738563379.0,AeroPress,2,0.83,False
